B000002UAO|5.0|I think this cd is the first way experimentalish recording from the beatles, with DRIVE MY CAR (what a great bass line) and michelle and If I needed someone... great G R E A T songs.  the beatles were getting LEGS on this cd and carried it on to their next recordings.  A MUST HAVE
B000068OSK|5.0|This album really blew me away.   I heard 'Elephant', then I immediatly bought this album, 'De Stijl', and 'White Blood Cells'.   This is by far the best of the four.   Their most raw album by far.   I just love it!   Some of the highlights are 'Stop Breaking Down', 'Jimmy The Exploder', 'The Big 3 Killed My Baby', and 'Astro', to name a few.   Any Stripes fan has to have this!   Actually, any rock fan needs to have this!
B000000WA4|2.0|Okay, I know I am going to get beat up on this review but I did buy the CD and am a fan of Smashing Pumpkins.<br />HOWEVER every now and then, a band makes too much music, and cannot determine what is good and what is bad.  This is the case with SP.  Not only did they include a ton of cruddy songs on here, they also released around this time period a 5 cd set of 'b sides'.  SP was just making music to make music.  And it is all too apparent.  1979 is a great groov, but there is nothing to hook it to on this recording.  It is a sad recording.  Buy the single 1979 and save money.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Remember when you were a kid and you were sure there was a monster in your closet waiting to get you?  Guess what, you were right!  But the monsters didn't really want to hurt you.  They just needed the power of your scream to keep their city running properly.<br />Meet Mike and Sulley.  Sulley is the top scarer at Monsters, Inc., the local power company, and Mike is his best friend and assistant.  With the exception of Randall, who wants to take the honors away, life is going well.  One night, however, Sulley returns to the scare floor to find one door has been left behind.  Investigating further, he accidentally lets a little girl into their world.  Believing that kids are toxic, Mike and Sulley try to figure out a way to get her back to her room without getting in trouble for letting such a danger into their world.<br />Pixar has scored again - big time.  They seem to get better with every film released.  Here, they present a heart warming tale with loads of humor that will make the entire family laugh out loud.  The characters, while looking like monsters, do have a certain cuteness about them.  And they have wonderful hearts, making them easy to like and root for.  \\"Boo,\\" the little girl, really steals the show.  The animators did a wonderful job creating her.  The idea that monsters are actually afraid of kids is inspired, providing some funny moments.  The graphics have come a long way; the effects are wonderful, but they never get in the way of the story, which is tight, entertaining, and lots of fun.  And that climax.  I want to ride on those doors as well!<br />As always, the folks at Pixar know how to release a DVD.  The movie itself is presented in wide screen and full frame formats, directly from their computer files so you get a wonderful picture and sound.  The audio commentary is informative and eye opening, and the second disc contains over three hours of extras that show all the hard work that went into creating this masterpiece.<br />While some moments might frighten young children, most will fall in love with the almost cute stars and be so caught up in the fun of the story that they won't notice.  Pixar hit just the right note to appeal to kids and the parents they drag into the theater.  They're four for four in my book and I can hardly wait to see what they do next.ments might frighten young children, most will fall in love with the almost cute stars and be so caught up in the fun of the story that they won't notice.

B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard the song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; I took notice.  Not only did the music grab me and intrigue me but the vocals blew me away.  I had seen this cover sitting on the spotlight sections in every music store but had only heard that song.  I bought the CD because I wandered just how good this band could be.  Well, AWESOME, is all I can say.  Everytime I listen to this gem, I get a new favorite track.  My personal favorite is &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;  although every track is superb.  The music is really great but Amy Lee's vocals are so wonderful!!  This is one great singer with a range that is second to none.  I like the Gothic sound they have and the lyrics were beyond my expectations.  These songs are quite deep but not at all depressing.  In fact, many of the lyrics are quite positive.  I look forward to the next Evanescence experience.  It is hard for a CD to take you on a journey that moves you, but &quot;Fallen&quot; is that CD.  I have reccommended this disc to everyone I know.  Well worth every penny!
B00008J4P5|5.0|I love this album. The White Stripes 2nd best behind their debut.   The tracklisting:   1. Seven Nation Army   2. Black Math   3. There's No Home For You Here   4.

Just sheer brilliance.   I was extremely impressed with this album. After hearing it I immediatly bought they other three releases. That's how good it is.   Amazing lyrics and guitar. Great drumming too.   Another thing that makes it so unique is the fact that there is no bass player. And there's no need for one!   I would advise anyone who likes good music to buy this.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie was really great. From the witty dialogue (especially by McGill) to the adventures to the improbable occurences, this is a movie worth watching. The music is also very good-and matches the time period of this movie (the Depression). <br />Just by looking at the cover, this movie looks like an old-fashioned, boring film-but don't be tricked, this is a superb movie that is very memorable.
B000001FI7|5.0|although 'sour times' gives this album a jolt of almost &quot;Bond-esque&quot; surrealism, most of album has the feeling of reaching into your head, pulling out your fears, and putting music to it in an understated mellow way. I suggest getting it on record and playing it on an old phonograph so that you get the old scratchy sound...
B00005NTJM|5.0|Debut albums are often the stuff of great discussion and controversy.  In the case of \\"This Was\\", Jethro Tull appeared on the music scene largely unheralded.  Perhaps part of the reason was the many of the songs were strongly blues influenced and appeared at a time when blues were making a musical comeback, thus becoming somewhat lost in the flood of other music.  It's also possible that the broad variation of musical styles, a characteristic of Tull throughout their history, made the album difficult to classify, and rather than deal with a group that fit no single category, reviews were lukewarm.  Current reviews hail \\"This Was\\" for its creativity and for the eclectic collection of music that defied 1968 conventions.<br />This album remains unusual, even considering all the albums that have been released since 1968.  There are strong blues songs, Ian's rock/jazz/blues style of playing a flute, and flavors of rock and folk; clearly not a concept album, but a group of guys getting together and throwing what they had, which was very good, onto an album.<br />The album kicks off with \\"My Sunday Feeling\\", a lament about the aftereffects of Saturday night.  The flute in this song modifies the blues-rock guitar riffs and drums to provide a jazz twist.  Ian's vocals could similarly be either blues or jazz.  Regardless of how you classify the song, it's heartfelt and creative.<br />\\"Some Day the Sun Won't Shine for You\\" is all blues, with an acoustic guitar and harmonica flavoring the song from the outset.  The vocals have a classic blues sound to them that fit well with the acoustic instruments; a mellow breakup song advising the ex-girlfriend that some day she'll have a bad day.<br />\\"Beggar's Farm\\" begins with a repetitive series of notes that is blues-flavored rock.  During the bridge the electric guitar and flute increase the blues flavor substantially.  The theme here is another significant other with an outside relationship.  The song advises her that she's going down in a bad way, and one day she'll end up on the beggar's farm, where perhaps he will see her (if she asks him nicely).  It seems that Ian Anderson and Mick Abrahams were feeling down while writing these songs, as the next song, \\"Move on Alone\\", seems to indicate.  Here the girlfriend has gone, and he's trying to overcome his grief to get on with his life.  The blues instrumentation in this song is jazz-flavored with brass.<br />The next two songs are instrumentals.  The first, \\"Serenade for Cuckoo\\", sounds like a piece for a jazz combo, with Ian's flute providing a substitute for a horn.  The lead guitar is blues, with mellow riffs.  A very laidback piece.  \\"Dharma for One\\" follows with a faster beat.  While blues flavor this song, it is at heart rock.  You can even hear elements of progressive rock in this song, including a portion that sounded to me a little like some of King Crimson's later style.  The only strange thing about this instrumental is a drum solo that may have been a bit of 1968 experimentation on Jethro Tull's part.<br />The next song is \\"It's Breaking Me Up\\", where the group moves into solid blues.  This song joins the second track as the two most solidly blues songs on this CD.  Ian plays the harmonica like a veteran blues man, and you might think you were in a New Orleans blues bar instead of listening to Jethro Tull.<br />We jump from a classic blues song to a nearly psychedelic instrumental, \\"Cat's Squirrel\\".  Each time I hear this piece I am reminded of early Black Sabbath.  For much of the song the lead guitar and bass guitar pound out hard rock sounding riffs, and when the drums take off you could easily think you are listening to an early Black Sabbath recording; the heaviest cut on this CD.<br />\\"A Song for Jeffrey\\" is the last song on the CD before the short instrumental \\"Round\\" (excluding the three relatively unnecessary &quot;extra&quot; tracks).  Ian Anderson sings this song with a blues-like guttural vocal, yet the instrumentation backing Ian is rock, perhaps you could even consider this hard rock.  \\"Round\\" finishes off the CD with a jazz sound, combining piano, drums and flute.  The piece is short and to the point.<br />I am not going to provide any discussion of the three extra tracks.  Usually extra tracks add to an album.  In this case, the three extras are unnecessary distractions, given that I have a lot of Tull CDs.<br />There is a quote on the liner for this CD that states \\"'This Was' how we were playing then - but things change.\\"  Little did anyone realize how true that quote was when Jethro Tull was soon to release \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Thick as a Brick\\", among others.  More importantly, Jethro Tull was already experimenting with musical elements that would eventually be termed progressive, though this CD is more blues and jazz-flavored rock than progressive.  Jethro Tull helped show the rest of the rock world that if you were brave, you could stretch the limits of what could fit onto a single album pretty far.  This debut album helped define that this group had no definition, and has never needed one, because they have always defined themselves.cking Ian is rock, perhaps you could even consider this hard rock.  \\"Round\\" finishes off the CD with a jazz sound, combining piano, drums and flute.

B00004SCX6|5.0|I love Britney Spears's music.  Her body is decent.  Her musoc is incredible.  The songwriting is so deep.  She is so musically talented.  Most people don't know that she plays all of the music that you hear.  She plays guitar, piano, sax, clarinet, bass guitar, flute, trumbone, trumpet, alto-sax, drums, and the tuba.  Since she can only play one at a time, she plays them at her studio one at a time.  Then, the studio guys make it all sound like its happening at once.  They play it from a cd during her concerts, but she is the one who actually creates all of the music.  Go Britney! You rock! You Go GIRL!! Her last hit \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" was so incredible! How did she do it?!?!?!  She is so cool. [...]
6304698798|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this movie the first time in 1968, in a drive-in theater.  It seemed to me to be an epic, complex western, and perhaps the best movie I had ever seen in my life.  This movie is epic, it is complex, and it is certainly one of the best westerns ever made.<br />Sergio Leone made this movie at a time when Italian movie-makers were known for their intensely artistic visions.  Sergio keeps his movie sufficiently within the mainstream so that the movie is very accessible, yet there are numerous artistic elements, including symbolism and film angles that were intended to be artistic, and turned out to be incredibly evocative and beautiful cinematography.<br />Before proceeding with this review, I should mention the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.  The music enhances each situation beautifully, and is one of the best soundtracks for a western of all time.  The signature song with the predominant drum and vocal is unforgettable, and perfectly formed to each scene in which it is used.<br />The story takes place during the Civil War.  Clint Eastwood is essentially a con artist, turning in Eli Wallach for a reward, and then saving him by shooting the hangman's rope at just the right moment.  Clint and Eli have a falling out and the two separate.  Clint finds a new partner and is in the process of saving him when Eli runs into him.  Eli wants a little revenge on Clint, and is torturing him by walking him through the desert when they stumble on a wagon full of dead Confederate soldiers; except one is still alive.  The dying soldier tells Clint where $200,000 in gold is buried before he dies.  Suddenly Eli has to keep Clint alive.  The search for the gold is the true story to this movie, though it takes a significant portion of the movie to discover this plot.  The beginning of the movie to the start of the search for the gold is used to introduce each of the main characters and to establish their personality.<br />This movie is full of highly detailed and complex scenes, each of which is a mini-story in its own right.  Perhaps the most memorable portions of the movie occur near the end.  In one scene, Confederate and Union soldiers are dying endlessly and pointlessly over a bridge that neither side can seem to capture.  The Union captain would love to see the bridge destroyed to stop the endless and pointless killing, but he is under orders to take the bridge intact.  Given the violence of this movie, it is ironic that this entire scene is about the futility of war.  This scene is also one of the more complex and dramatic scenes in the movie.<br />In a subsequent scene, Clint Eastwood finds a dying Confederate soldier and comforts him, covering him to keep him warm and sharing a cigarette.  Clint looks away to see Eli Wallach riding off on a horse, and the soldier dies.  The scene visually illustrates how fleeting life is, and important things can happen in just a moment.<br />The final scene is classic western, with Sergio Leone's masterful artistic touch.  The three principal characters meet in a graveyard where the gold is supposedly buried.  The confusion of Tuco (Eli Wallach) as he searches for the grave is illustrated visually.  The background music is eliminated in favor of natural outdoor noise for portions of this scene as the three principal characters participate in a dramatic three-way gunfight.<br />Even with this scene, Sergio Leone was not quite done.  He had an afterward that reflects on how the movie began.  The ending is Sergio's impression of the classic American western, with a man riding off into the hills and theme music accompanying him, with soaring camera angles to illustrate the western ideal of independence, self-reliance, and American individualism.<br />You need not understand the artistic elements of this movie to be able to appreciate it.  You will sense the elements are there, if only subconsciously, and you will realize that this is a wonderful and great movie.  This movie is one you will want to see again and again, especially if you are a fan of westerns or epic movies.  Well worth buying and worthy of a 5 star rating.ie is one you will want to see again and again, especially if you are a fan of westerns or epic movies.

B00005JLKN|3.0|After seeing Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, Red Dragon was a bit of a let down. A set of grisly murders brings FBI Agent Will Graham (Norton) out of retirement and puts him in search of \\"The Tooth Fairy\\" (Fiennes) who's driven by the image of a painting. Yet his only means of survival and success are to seek the help of another madman, whom he himself captured, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). Marked by past scars and quickly running out of time, Graham finds himself tangled in a heap of madness, sacrificing his work, his family, and above all his own life, to put an end to pure evil.<br />The biggest problem with Red Dragon is Edward Norton as Will Graham; he just doesn't fit the part. To the films advantage, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson both give outstanding performances. Anthony Hopkins plays the part brilliantly! Unlike Norton, these three actors seem totally natural and don't seem out of place at all.
0156027321|5.0|No. I could not start believing in God as the book claims on the front cover. The story however is very good.<br />After the cargo ship sinks till the 100th chapter, it's a gripping tale of persistence and undying hope. A fair balance of humor and storytelling. Apart from that I do not see why God should have any role anywhere in it. In Ernest Hemingway's 'Old Man and the Sea' (which you are reminded of at a few places in this novel ),  Santiago the protagonist while he is struggling with the waves in the sea, says to himself something like -- &quot;we need hope and so we need faith&quot;. In another book about Logotherapy by Viktor Fank'l  the author proposes something like &quot;we live and have hope because we have a responsibilty towards life&quot; . So whatever drives you to do the courageous things like Pi Patel does in 'Life of Pi' may or may not be your faith in God. It can simply be this feeling of responsibility that we all possess by birth or the unflagging hope that is just a given in some people and dormant in others. The story may or may not cultivate any belief of God in people who read it but it definitely fills you with faith and honor for life.
0316548189|4.0|The storyline of Long Walk to Freedom would make an excellent novel. However, this is the real story of a man and his country's struggle for a fair, democratic society. The fact that the events told in this autobiography actually happened is reason enough to read this book because of the moral values instilled in the reader. It's important for anyone to read this book so they not only learn about the hero Nelson Mandela is, but the unjust apartheid run South Africa as well. Occasionally the book may seem long (it is 600 pages) and slow, but overall the book is entertaining. Also, the reader can be easily frustrated with the myriad of African names thrown at him/her. Still, Mandela does a superb job as a storyteller. The reader is given excellent insight into the mind of Nelson Mandela and his reasons for the decisions he made. Also, the book has several interesting sub-stories that coincide well with his journey to a free South Africa. Most people have heard of Mandela, but few actually know the details surrounding the inspiration he is. Without a doubt, he lived one of the most eventful lives of the 20th century. His journeys from growing up as young boy in the Transkei with no opportunities to setting his people free is incredible. This is a powerful story of the struggle for equality one man and his country made. It will influence you for the rest of your life. This long walk is definitely worth taking if you're anyone interested in history/politics or anyone with a little patience.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Since its release in 2001 there has been nothing but bad reviews of this CD, complaining that its too mello and boring. But as a loyal incubus fan, i had to get &quot;Morning View&quot; when it came out. What a surprise! Starting from the first song &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; the CD unravels as a more mature incredible mix of acoustic, metal, and alternative music, while still retaining incubus' distinct sound. Some of the songs on this CD even count as some of my favorite incubus songs ever. Some great songs include &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, &quot;11am&quot;, acoustic &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Warning&quot; (my personal fav, and quite possibly my fav incubus song ever) &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, &quot;Are You In&quot;, &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot;, and even the slow oriental sounding &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;. If you dont know incubus that well and didnt like more energetic songs from &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot;, try this CD, its a great background music. Buy it now!!
B00004SU5J|5.0|Well, it's hard to write about emotions, that burst out when listening to St. Germain. This glimmering miracle from Paris makes me feel, if I were in the passionful downtown of Detroit with the characters of Jack Kerouac, enjoying the velvet touch of MUSIC...<BR>This jazzy D'n'B is simply perfect! Thanks for the French wizards.
B000002U82|4.0|And honestly I've come to realize that there are other better albums out there, but none quite as addictive as this one. The Dark Side of the Moon just gets beneath your skin and stays there--with songs like Time how could it possibly not?!?! Sure it may be overrated and too mellow at times, but not many other albums can account for being as addictive as this one. The Wall may be technically more enjoyable, but give Dark Side its due. After all I've grown somewhat tired of The Wall but for some reason keep on coming back to this one in my Floyd collection. Now maybe I just need to buy more albums by Pink Floyd--since I just own Ummagumma, Atome Heart Mother, this one and The Wall--but if and until I do undoubtedly Dark Side of the Moon will continue to make a believer out of me.
0060916540|2.0|This has to be one of the greatest mountaineering survival story of all time.  But, it is poorely written.  I had trouble finnishing the book.  If only John Krakauer would have written it, we would have gotten a classic.
B00008CLOA|4.0|And honestly the album is beginning to grow on me a heck of a lot more. I still did not love every single song and the beginning voices and sound effects of Speak to Me were still hard to hear even in this newly remastered state, but I admit I did still enjoy it and lately this has been the only Pink Floyd album I've wanted to listen to when I get in the mood to listen to some more Floyd. It seems that no matter how much parts of it still seem boring and dull to me and overall I still don't think it's the greatest album of all time, I just keep on coming back to it from time to time. Though admittedly it's mainly to just hear Time again which is my favorite track from it and is one of the best songs I've ever heard, and then I figure I might as well just hear the rest of it too, lol. Time sucks me in and then I hear the other songs just because they're on the album that Time is on, but at least I end up getting pleasantly surprised from the rest of the album too though. This album is just seriously addictive, and I think that's the main reason why it has sold countless millions and why people continue to praise it to this day. The music and lyrics just get stuck in your head and makes you want to hear it over and over and over again. Now true that's what makes a great album great in the first place, but that's not necessarily something to be proud of. There may be other albums out there that I enjoy listening to a lot more, but few are as addictive as this one. I say just let yourself get swept away and enjoy it for what it is. After all, we are all 'shorter of breath and one day closer to death'.
B00000C28M|3.0|This is one of the worst recordings I've ever heard. It's not so much the coughing in the audience which disturbed me hearing this CD but the lacking of differentiation. In fact it is very hard to get all the details played by Gould- and if you get it it`s a baroque trill !!! Also Mr. Gould doesn't really like to play it beautifully romantic like for example Emil Gilels but just harsh and \\"solid\\" or harmonically. It would have been better if Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Gould would have switched their parts- this would have been amazing.
B000002J1U|5.0|LZ3 is the quintessential Zep album. It announces to the world that the underrated heavy rockers can play in any style from Indian sitar to Blues Slide. As one critic wrote, LZ3 is a complete experience from one end to another, an odyssey of the mind.
B000062Y98|5.0|It took me a month of research but I've just discovered that the epic piece of music I love better than any other, is called &quot;The Soulforged&quot; on this album (which I just purchased here). I heard it on a college (usually punk) radio station and sent a copy of it to a metal record store in Minnesota and they just emailed me that this is IT! And, so it is! Buy it, sit back and ENJOY the greatest medieval metal song ever recorded!
6301934229|5.0|It's a great flick, if only because Rutger Hauer, King of the B-movies, gets to do to C. Thomas Howell what we have all dreamed of.....torture him mercilessly, for no adequately explained reason.<br />I guess Rutger saw &quot;Soul Man.&quot;<br />Seriously, it's a well-done, if somewhat formulaic, version of the ol' deadly hitchhiker story.  I endorse it wholeheartedly.  Howell being the victim is just a bonus.
B00004ZD69|5.0|It's about 3:20 a.m. right now and I just finished listening to both cd's for the first time in my bed, all lights out. No track listing or anything. Having heard and loved Yanqui U.X.O., I knew what I was in for, but nothing could have prepared me for this. First off, I would just like to say that the best way to enjoy this music is to get lost in it. Wait until night, close your eyes, and just put it on. Many people make a general statement about this album and say &quot;much of it is the same, it just builds and climaxes, and starts again.&quot; I find this both true and false. Yes, much of the music is based on rising. However, there is so much MORE. This stuff is all over the place... it goes from ambient noises to eerie samples and interludes to strange melodies that may or may not build, and its all mixed into what seems like a giant 80+ minute &quot;song&quot; (too bad it couldn't all fit onto one cd... but after hearing this I would never cut a second out of it.)<br />Like I mentioned earlier, the best time to listen to this is at night. In bed. I don't think it may be possible to experience this album the way I just did if you are in the middle of day or your usual agenda. I will be listening to this many times from now on... but I don't think it will be quite as good as this first time. If you love to get lost in your music, this is one of the most incredible cd's around. It's an 80+ minute hypnotic, eerie, and altogether mindblowing experience.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is one of the best selling opera recording of all time. The three principles are the biggest superstars in opera.<br />There are those who criticize Sutherland for having lack of size for the formidible role of Turandot. The truth is, she was trained to be a Wagnerian dramatic soprano. The quality of her high notes are legendary. If you were in the audience of a 1961 Lucia with Sutherland at the Met, her high E flats were rockets that almost blew up the place. They were the largest high notes I've ever heard. As an old timer opera fan, I can honestly tell you Sutherland's high notes from her youth were even larger than Nilsson's, especially the notes above high C. And that's from a fan who's heard them both numerous times. However, her midrange were never as strong as the Swedish diva. And her lower range can't touch Nilsson's. But remember, the recording studio can even that up.<br />True, in this Turandot, Sutherland is 10 years older than when I first heard her as Lucia in 1961. This recording is 1971. The diva's voice is much darker, and her upper register has lost some of it's power. This to be compare to Nilsson's 1960 recording is nonsense. Of course Nilsson had more power in 1960 than Sutherland in 1971, but what's the point? Both have more than enough juice to sing the confused princess. And whoever said that Sutherland's voice sounded anemic next to Nilsson has never heard the two divas on an actual operatic stage. <br />Different voices... Nilsson's voice is like a rocket while Sutherland is like a gigantic wall of sound that surrounds you like a blanket. You cannot say that when mammoth sounds are needed, Sutherland cannot deliver them. I heard her soar over the gigantic choruses in Beatrice di Tenda, holding a high E natural for 12 seconds! <br />Believe me, the high tessitura of Turandot is child's play for Sutherland's fantastic voice. Remember, she is the only soprano in the world to sing Esclamonde - a role that demands high Ds, Es, and a highG. Esclamonde also required a full 120 piece Wagnerian size orchestra (think Gotterdamerung).And Sutherland does trills and staccato that soars above the brass section! LIVE on the SF stage!<br />As Turandot, Sutherland did not attack every note with shere power as Nilsson did. The role did not required that every note be sung that way. Because she sung Turandot with much dynamics makes her far superior to Nilsson's belting Turandot. <br />Now for some trivia. Did you know that in La Scala, the Italians did not like Nilsson's style of belting out every single note in Turandot? Puccini wrote the role with the idea of a very complicated woman who WANT to fall in love. I believe, it fact, that Turandot was in love with Calaf at first sight. And that's the feeling I get with Sutherland's Turandot. <br />To me, and thousands of others who rave this recording as the definitive version of Puccini's great masterpiece, Sutherland sang with just enough fortissimo and moderato AND beauty of tone to make this a powerful Turandot to beat all others.<br />The same goes for Caballe's superlative Liu that is miraculous and Pavarotti's confident and honeyed voice Calaf.<br />This is opera making at its best. And those one star reviews are obviously jealous people who probably never even heard this performance. <br />Intelligent opera lovers, I challenge you to listen to this beauty and you be the judge. <br />Nilsson or Sutherland? I say Sutherland.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Wow!  Where do I begin?  This movie left me sitting in my seat at the end, and I watched all the credits, for the first time ever because I was so riveted by the movie.  This movie was touching especially towards the end where you see how hard it has been for the pianist to survive (sorry, his name, I still can't figure it out, even after reading the back of the DVD, I'm only 16)!  <br />Though I loved this movie, it is not what I expected, but was pleasantly surprised, and quite honestly, I do not know what I expected from it... but I know I got more than I expected... <br />Adrien Brody was captivating in this film... if he wouldn't have won the Oscar, something had to have been wrong with the Academy!  He is brilliant, one of my favorite scenes is when he plays the piano without touching the keys... but I have a favorite scene, but I won't tell you what it is, you MUST watch it, and when you do see it, you'll probably know which scene I'm talking about.<br />On that note, WWII is my favorite period of history, because the cruelty of Hitler makes me wonder, and interests me because I don't see how a human being can be so cruel, and this movie doesn't answer the question, it just makes it harder to understand why because the story is true.  <br />It's hard for me to write a review, (as you can see, I jump from subjects, and ramble), because this movie can't be explained in words, only by watching it can you experience the feeling of the movie in all its glory!
B00005JKPF|5.0|As a \\"Johnny-Come-Lately\\" to the X-Men saga (I read \\"Spiderman\\" and \\"The Fantastic Four\\" from the Marvel stable), I was most unfamiliar with the characters and the premise until the first film, a satisfying blend of comic lore and science fiction. It is no wonder that the movie was one of the biggest hits of 2000.<br />\\"X2: X-men\\" goes more in-depth in answering some of the questions that plagued me about part one, chiefly the origin of Logan/Wolverine, the Wolverine/Cyclops/Jean Grey triangle, and the uneasy relationship between Professor X and Magneto. There are also some intriguing introductions (Pryo, Colossus, and Iceman) that set the stage for further development in the subsequent third episode.<br />While the special effects are eye-popping, the actors underneath all that latex and muscle manage to pull off some pretty believable performances. The classically trained Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen show why they are at the top of their craft. Critics may scoff that a film like \\"X2\\" is not of the same caliber of, say \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", but that should not belittle the actors that bring life to their respective roles. With such a large ensemble cast, it is logical that screen time is limited, but Halle Berry, James Marsden, and Anna Paquin do the best that they can in the allotment given them.<br />Brian Cox is appropriately sinister as the nemesis to mutants everywhere. He seems to have graduated from the Rip Torn School of Villainy.<br />And Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, as well as Kelly Hu, could show those \\"angels\\" that work for a man named \\"Charlie\\" a thing or two about butt kicking. The damsels are stunning in appearance and craft.<br />Newcomer Allan Cumming (\\"Nightcrawler\\") brings just the right about of pathos and savagery to his role as a manipulated mutant. His soulful expressions and sincerity can be seen beneath heavy makeup. It's no wonder that he is the toast of Broadway and Hollywood.<br />One of the likely story developments for part three should involve a battle between Pyro and Iceman. That will give young actors Aaron Stanford and Shawn Ashmore a chance at \\"muscle-flexing\\".<br />In all, \\"X2: X-Men United\\" follows in the tradition of \\"Aliens\\", a sequel that ups the ante in grand style of its predecessor.nvolve a battle between Pyro and Iceman.

B00008OWZC|5.0|THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME was such a lack-lustre movie and album that it was strangely tempting to regard Cameron Crowe's ALMOST FAMOUS as closer in spirit to the Led Zeppelin roadshow.<br />Now we have the real thing -- the four lads from England in ridiculously confident style strutting their stuff before the crowds at the LA Forum and Long Beach Arena in 1972, previewing material from HOUSES OF THE HOLY as well as playing most of the earlier classics.<br />My only gripe is the lack of sleevenotes.  I've been listening to Zeppelin for over thirty years (although I never saw them live) and I'm still not sure that it's John Paul Jones who plays acoustic guitar when Page plays electric lead.  Presumably this will be clarified once I get the accompanying DVD, but it wouldn't have hurt to have put this info in writing, along with a few photos of the band and the venues.<br />I sometimes wonder whether it is healthy, when you still have some of your career ahead of you, to put as much effort as Jimmy Page has done into researching past highlights.  But frankly Page and Plant were gods in those days, and no sane person could expect to regain those heights at the age of nearly 60.  Page is dramatically enhancing and extending the catalogue of material that is legally available from their golden period.<br />Good on yer, mate!
B00008VGK0|4.0|The title, of course, refers to the pairing of Madonna with Missy Elliott on the first remix...and what a blending it is. Miss Elliott gives the former Material Girl's song a harder and more urban radio-friendly edge than anything that she has ever done. This one blends naturally with the second restructuring, a highly \\"funkafied\\" Oakenfield Downtemp Mix. Both show one direction that the singer might consider in broadening her fan base.<br />Surprisingly, the more dance club sounding cuts three, four, and five don't work as well as the first offerings. Felix da Housecat's Devin Dazzle Club Mix is a little too fast while Peter Rauhofer's American Anthem Mix sounds like a holdover from Donna Summer/Georgio Moroder, circa 1979. Rauhofer's \\"Part II\\" is significantly better, making up for section one's weaknesses.<br />Richard Humpty Vission's Electrofield Mix of recent Bond film theme is an OK variation of the original and should satisfy the armada of Madonna fan's worldwide.<br />It just left this one lacking!
6304039506|5.0|The fim version of the play is absolutely outstanding. It completely and fullheartedly deserves the Awards it got, and by far. Marlon Brandon is fascinating as an animal of violence and desire, and Vivien Leigh is an astonishing embodiment of a fallen southern belle who tries to escape her lost past and cannot, turning her obsession about her past of failure into an absolute neurotic inability to accept change in the world. The use of music is quite convincing to signal the shifts from the present experience to the recollections of the past mistakes and guilt.<br /><br />The violence and the sensuality of the present are always striking and powerful. It is moving and cruel, emotional and mind-raking, sensual and frightening. Desire, the desire to be in complete osmosis with another human being, is beautifully depicted and enacted by the dialogue, the acting and the physical rendering of the feelings, the fears, the hopes, the deceptions of the characters. But the ending is changed and the meaning of the film is different from that of the book.<br /><br />From the triumph of sensual and sexual desire, from the necessary destruction and institutionalization of Blanche in order for life and its desires to survive and live on, like a show that has to go on, we shift to an opening in Stella that could lead to more independance and autonomy for her, for women. But this opening is ambiguous since it can only come from a distanciation from desire in the objective realization of it, that is to say the baby.<br /><br />When the baby is born, when desire has produced its fruit, women can move on to a higher level and men can be pushed back into a more refrained and cultured attitude. Can they? Maybe. At least they may, in a long process that is foretold in this ending, at the end of this film. We can wonder whether it is a way to satisfy the demands of Hollywood for a film that can reach the wide public (and the three odd minutes that were cut off in 1951 go that way), or it is a sign in Tennessee Williams and Elia Kazan that new social evolutions were entering the wider social picture.<br /><br />That we cannot know for sure. But this film shows how a ten or twenty second change at the end can change the meaning of the play and can open completely different vistas in our consciousness.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUWilliams and Elia Kazan that new social evolutions were entering the wider social picture.

0312305060|5.0|While I found &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; enjoyable, and it does help to read it before reading &quot;The Hours,&quot; I thought this book was more enjoyable, easier to read, yet just as deep and complex. I loved how the lives of the three women wove together; it made perfect sense at the end. This book really explores why we live, whether live is meaningful, and how we find meaning in it. I think this book is destined to become as much of a classic as the Virginia Woolf novel on which it is based.
B00008PX8P|5.0|[Discussing Disc One] From the very first seconds, this was an incredible experience.  I was only two-years-old when the footage on DVD-1 was shot.  I was never able to see Led Zeppelin in concert during their day.  \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" video was somewhat of a dissapointment - this endeavour blows that attempt away.  Those that are responsible for this work - Thank you!  The footage is magnificent, yet raw and smacks solidly against the brain.  It captures all the improvisation; one can actually witness these four creating new material on stage, literally making it up as they went along.  Rock was in a state of flux, and we are allowed a long clear look at the metamorphosis brought about by Led Zeppelin's talent and daring.<br />And, Dear God, how about that John Bonham!  During \\"White Summer\\" he makes his power known by sneaking in on Page's ad lib's and totally transforming the feel and texture.  And \\"Moby Dick!\\"  That alone was worth the purchase price!  You can look and see one tiny drop of persperation marking the center of John's shirt, proof that he was indeed laboring during this portion of the show.  And when John labored, he was unmatched by any drummer that planet Earth ever produced.<br />Robert Plant sang well.  His voice was in his control, which is more than can be said for a lot of Rock singers in that era.  Watch as he and Page play games, going back and forth, mimicking each other's notes, taking turns.  A lot of fun.<br />How young they all were in this first disc.  That in itself was intriguing.  The whole performance was reminiscent of a \\"bar band\\" scenario; they were all at ease and having a blast.  The crowd often was completely silent, intent and enthralled with what was going on onstage.<br />Again, Thanks to all who made this possible.  It is a treasure beyond any words I could come up with.  I'm going to buy this for both my brothers (Zep fans) and for a couple of friends, too.  It's too great not to be witnessed by all.<br />Gary
B00004DTLJ|5.0|Saxon is an unique band. The average American usualy has his/her brains programmed by the media and labels are soon posted on bands like Saxon. Truth of the matter is some bands make music for listeners with brains while the vast majority of MTV driven 'music' is for ears only.<br />This CD is for those with brains. As well as CDs from other bands that you probably like as well (Queensryche, Dream Theater, Rush, etc) because you DO have brains.<br />Ok, I could live without the triggered snare on this CD but hey, it's from the 80's so what can one expect? While hair bands without any talent were making huge amounts of money the true musicians could only go so far on trying to get a piece of the pie.<br />This CD is one of the best Saxon ever produced, along with Crusader, Power and the Glory and so many others.<br />So don't give yourself any more excuses and buy this CD.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I purchased the Led Zeppelin DVD the day it came out and let me assure you, it lives up to all the hype. The sound is truly amazing considering it was recorded between 1970 -1979. It just blows me away each time I have sat down to watch it. I grew up in the late 70's and Zeppelin was one of my favorite bands back then, but I never had a chance to catch them in concert.With this new dvd set, I feel like I have made up for it, it is that good!! Never before or since has so much talent been on one stage. After watching this dvd, you will realize that no band today comes close to measuring up to Zeppelin. Just go out and buy it and you will see what I'm talking about.They were the REAL DEAL!!Thanks to Jimmy Page and Dick Carruthers for putting this DVD set together,you did a wonderful job.
B00008HCCF|5.0|I was surprised to read a previous reviewer's comments that this DVD didn't give us much of an idea of Nora's personality... that is exactly one of the reasons I enjoy this DVD.  This DVD pleasantly presents Nora with her humble, laid-back style.<br />I too have the John Mayer DVD and I agree it displays an artist with more humor and a quirky personality, but I think that is because that is John Mayer's personality - he's funnier and quirkier.  Likewise, the Nora Jones DVD displays HER personality as a relaxed, honest and ego-free performer.  I wouldn't knock Nora for not being John!<br />Anyway, this DVD is fairly true to the album, but not totally.  While Nora doesn't take many piano solos, vocally, she does take more liberties in the live performance.  Also, it is interesting to see the variety of methods the drummer uses to provide rhythm for the various cuts.<br />The concert has an intimate, friendly tone.  The musicianship is fairly good and the sound and presentation production is good as well.<br />This was a good buy for me.

B00006JKON|5.0|I don't own the cd, but am writing about the LP version so I can't really comment on the bonus tracks...<br />Anyway, about the album. The 'A' side (war child through sealion) is rather slow, I don't like it as much as the 'B' side. It is pretty good, though, except for 'Back Door Angels.' It goes a bit too slow for my liking. <BR>Now the 'B' side (Skating Away... through Two Fingers). It is some of the best music I've ever heard. 'Skating Away' is a musical masterpiece, and I don't know anyone who doesn't like 'Bungle in the Jungle.' My favorite is 'the Third Hoorah.' I would recommend you buy this album for the 'B' side alone, you will be completely satisfied. Don't listen to those people who dislike it. There's no accounting for taste with some people.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone soundtrack is one of Williams's best. &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; is the best song I have ever heard. The beginning tracks may be a bit slow, but later on it really picks up. &quot;Quidditch&quot; is awesome, &quot;The Face of Voldemort&quot; is creepy, and &quot;Harry's Wondrous World&quot; with its sweeping string section is very elegant. Over all I think this score definantly deserves 5 stars.

B000002J2B|5.0|Genesis has a long history of composing brilliant progressive rock. In fact Genesis are one of the originators of this style along with Yes, King Crimson, and ELP. They started off as a progressive folk band and ended, sadly for us music lovers, as a pop-rock band. &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; was the pinnacle of Genesis' progressive rock music. Many people will argue that &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; is better, but I strongly disagree. I think both albums are worth owning. I chose &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; because I think it has more of a darker atmosphere than any other Genesis album. Phil Collins does a nice job as vocalist, but it is always going to be his drumming abilities that interest me. This album is absolutely breath-taking. There isn't a weak song on this album. All of the Genesis trademarks are present. Also sadly this is the last progressive rock album they did. Oh, and if that wasn't enough, their guitarist Steve Hackett leaves after this album. This album represents the farewell to one of best and most inspiring progressive rock acts ever. An absolute must-buy for progressive rock fans.
B00003CX9S|5.0|As I sit down to write this review, my experiences with it from my youth came flooding back. I first saw it as a 17 year old high-schooler at my local movie theater, late one evening. I had seen, and enjoyed, the Broadway play a few months earlier, and wanted to see how the movie compared. The play, I should say, was very moving and had a certain spareness in its production design that was very effective. I had left the theatre with a moist eye and an interest in learning more about John Merrick, The Elephant Man (who had neurofibromatosis, NOT elephantitis, as is so often attributed to him).     Anyway, when the movie concluded, the ENTIRE audience of 150 or so sat in its seats, numbed and unmoving. It was one of those experiences where you fight back your tears, because you're worried if you let go, you'll start bawling like a baby! The film was so profoundly moving to me and so artistically brilliant, that I went again the very next day, dragging reluctant friends with me. They were all stunned. I watched it AGAIN later that week.     I've watched it on video a couple of times years ago, but until I rewatched it recently on DVD, it had been nearly 10 years since I'd seen it.    The story is set in the early turn-of-the-twentieth-century London. John Merrick (John Hurt) is, for lack of a better word, enslaved as a sideshow freak.  He has the most hideous growths on his bones, which give him a frightening appearance.  His  head is probably three times bigger than a normal human, and the shape resembles a lumpy dirigible.  His limbs are mostly tangled messes.  Noted physician Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins) hears of this \\"elephant man\\" and is fascinated so greatly by his condition that he brings him to his hospital for study.  Everyone has always assumed this man must be a mute \\"idiot.\\"  Turns out that Merrick is a gentle, thoughtful and almost unbearably forgiving soul.  The relationship that emerges between Treves and Merrick, as well as with Merrick and virtually everyone he encounters, is at the heart of this film.    (Note of caution: The movie does not follow John Merrick's life terribly accurately...neither did the play. When I read the biography of Merrick that his doctor, Treves, wrote, I got his \\"true\\" story, which is just as moving in its own way.)     David Lynch, we all know, is a \\"difficult\\" director, at least when it comes to narrative continuity. This movie, however, is his most accessible (along with THE STRAIGHT STORY, which doesn't even feel like a Lynch movie). It tells a straightforward story...no dancing dwarfs, no little people behind radiators, no Wizard of Oz references, etc. etc. No Laura Palmer. However, the touches he brings to it are pure Lynch, and they serve the movie profoundly.     For example, the movie takes place in the midst of the early Industrial Revolution, when science was becoming more \\"popular\\" or \\"glorified\\" by the masses. It was also a time when London was awash in factories, and all the noise and pollution they wrought. If you've seen ERASERHEAD or DUNE, you know that Lynch likes to have lots of background noises of machinery. Often, those sounds are distracting. In ELEPHANT MAN, we are constantly aware, through these sounds, that we are in a very specific time and place, where the lifeblood of society was machinery, but big, dirty, unsubtle, dangerous machinery. This, coupled with the glorious black and white cinematography, truly create a mood that is unequaled.   Also, there are some brief dream sequences in which Merrick sees his mother. She flits in and out of his dreams in a manner only Lynch can evoke. No one has ever been better at capturing on film the elusive nature of dreaming...that dreams are a crazy combination of good things and bad things happening all at once. These dreams are not a \\"device\\" but a window into Merrick's soul.     Those of us who remember when the film first came out remember the constant rehashing of the \\"I am not an animal, I am a human being, I am aMAN!!\\" line that Merrick yells out when cornered in a train station. This howl of despair is one of the most gripping moments EVER put to film. I tear-up just thinking about it.    The makeup is incredible. Having seen photos of the real Merrick, I can state that the makeup crew got it right! And the black and white helps to mask any imperfections. And underneath the makeup...   ...is John Hurt, a fabulous actor in the role of his lifetime. He brings a delicacy and gentleness to the part that has to bee seen to be believed. I guarantee you'll be moved.     Hurt is ably assisted by Anthony Hopkins in a role which calls for restraint, and he delivers, which is unusual for Hopkins, who can overact at the drop of a hat...I love him, but sometimes he can overdo it, you must admit.  The rest of the cast is full of familiar British character actors, as well as a brief but incandescent appearance by Anne Bancroft.  Everyone is at their very best.    Initially, the film snags the viewer because of our fascination at seeing a human being so horrifically monstrous.  It holds a lurid fascination that fades into compassion and empathy.  If a person as horribly mistreated by his fellow man, as well as by fate, can find beauty, forgiveness, tenderness and love flowing from him and to him...well, the film leaves you to draw your own personal conclusions.    I know that Lynch receives more ongoing accolades for his disturbing BLUE VELVET, and of course, for the groundbreaking TWIN PEAKS...but THE ELEPHANT MAN is the one I'm always drawn back to.    I simply cannot recommend this film highly enough. Moviemaking doesn't get any more heartbreaking and effective than this masterpiece.
0316666343|2.0|I agree that the book seemed a bit creepy, being that it's written from the perspective of the dead. The beginning chapters seemed to lead to no where. Several chapters into the book, the pace picked up but Alice Sebold lost me with a scene on spiritual possession.  The ending presented no sense of closure. As the reader, you are left asking, is that it??? It ends there??? What a complete utter disappointment!
0385504209|4.0|This was a fun book to read.  The historical information about DaVinci, secret societies and alternate interpretations of the Bible was interesting.  I thought the characters were very one dimensional.  I never developed any empathy for them at all.  They were simply vehicles to get to the very creative clues and puzzles in the story.  I found myself hurrying through the plot elements, to get to the next clue or historical information.  Overall, it was enjoyable.  It was very fast paced, and hard to put down.

0385503954|1.0|This is the first book I've read by Ian McEwan, and I absolutely hated it.  Surprisingly, I did venture later to read another of his books, Amsterdam, which I enjoyed.  In Atonement, the circumstances of the plot are not revealed until the middle of the book by which time the reader is totally frustrated by, for example, two-paragraph descriptions of the way the sunlight appeared on the garden lawn.  I finished the book with increasing irritation only because I felt I deserved to know the ending.  However, I was very disappointed.  Evidently, whatever McEwan was trying to convey does not mesh with my concept of atonement.

B00008BRB5|5.0|It's hard to believe that the Police put out only 5 regular studio releases, but with Synchronicity they went out at the top of their game. Over the the span of those five collections, they had gone from a punk/white reggae outfit, to groove power pop, to a fully developed and uniquely identifiable sound. Synchronicity laid the groundwork for the beginning of Sting's successful solo career, as well as the future work of bandmates drummer Stewart Copeland drums and guitarist Andy Summers.<br />With the title in mind, the song and album theme borrows from and elaborates on Jung's psychology work. Sometimes two parallel events do collide at an opportune time. How else does one explain \\"Every breath You Take\\" as a popular romance ballad?<br />\\"Synchronicity I\\" leads off, an up-tempo number with excellent intensity, powerful drums and guitar washes. \\"We share this nightmare.\\"<br />\\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\" is full of atmospheric guitars and primal drumming to explore themes like dinosaurs and early hominids...and modern ones. Spare yet full of sound.<br />\\"O My God\\" has a groove that harkens back to \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" and is notable for an instance of Sting recycling lyrics from \\"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.\\"<br />\\"Mother\\" is a bizarre, irritating song featuring Andy Summers on vocals, with a Norman Bates type theme. One could imagine this being played over and over during a fraternity hell week to drive pledges bonkers.<br />\\"Miss Gradenko\\" is Stewart Copeland's contribution, with his usual wry lyrics. \\"They were in a policy meeting, planning new ways of cheating...\\"<br />With \\"Synchronicity II\\" the disk really takes off. The instrumental dynamics are superb and there are dual stories of a nightmare suburban/corporate existence and something happening 'many miles away...' Great vocals by Sting.<br />\\"Every Breath you Take\\" is the track that sent this one skyrocketing, along with the famous black and white video. Spare guitar and keyboard lines along with pulsing bass and drums, with lush dynamic choruses make this a classic. The funny thing is that this is basically a song about a stalker, but people play this at their weddings. More great vocals by Sting.<br />\\"King of Pain\\" features some of Sting's best lyrical imagery yet, excellent instrumental dynamics and a memorable chorus.<br />\\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" is another gem, full of atmospheric guitars and keyboards, and Copeland's best drumming on the disk.<br />\\"Tea in the Sahara\\" is an underrated gem, featuring more cool guitar work and references to \\"beneath the sheltering sky\\" and exotic desert landscapes.<br />\\"Murder By Numbers\\" is a darkly comic song about committing the perfect murder, even taking out your entire family, and turning it into art.<br />Buy this one as your introduction to the band and work backward, or move forward through the solo work of Sting, Copeland and Summers.ums, with lush dynamic choruses make this a classic.

B00006LLLN|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  I bought it because I had heard a little of it here and there, and heard some good things.  I'm not a fan of country music by any stretch, but it's turned out to be an indispensable part of my CD library.  Whether or not you like country/bluegrass or not, the quality of this music cannot be denied.<br />First of all, there are the musicians.  Each member of this band is incredibly skilled, and it shows.  In the MTV/CMT world of prepackaged pop music that all sounds alike, we tend to forget what a joy it is to listen to fine musicianship, and this group is virtually without peer.  In this album, the instruments blend together seamlessly, without any one dominating the others.  It's truly an engrossing experience to sit and listen, especially during the instrumental portions of the album, where each member of the band has a chance to showcase his or her talents.<br />Then there are the vocals.  Alison Krauss's voice lends an ethereal quality to the string instruments of the band, and is a wonderful contrast to the vocals of Dan Tyminski, whose sandy southern voice leads several songs.  Though both are talented vocalists, they don't over-improvise; they just move along with the music, creating a tapestry of sound that truly envelops the listener.<br />The music covers a wide range, from roots-style bluegrass to '50s pop to contemporary country.  They sprinkle in some \\"story songs,\\" along with some instrumentals, love songs, and a gospel tune.  My personal favorites include \\"The Lucky One,\\" and \\"The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn,\\" but every song is fantastic.<br />This is, without question, a worthwhile buy.  I can't say enough about the quality of this music because I can't fit all the superlatives into this space.  If you appreciate GOOD music, no matter what the genre, then you won't be disappointed.  \\"Live\\" is an absolutely wonderful album, one to listen to over and over.
B00004TJLD|4.0|I love this album. It is my favorite by Alan Parsons. I recently got the DVD-Audio version of it, and the sound quality is absolutely top rate. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the DVD-Audio version is in stereo instead of surround sound. That is a big disappointment. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it!
B00008PX8P|5.0|After years of bootleg audio ranging from murky to almost passable, and the band's official if generally self-dismissed The Song Remains the Same, Led Zepplin have culled through their archives and given the fans a true audio-visual glimpse of their live power. <br />And what a blinding and deafening glimpse it is!<br />Spanning their entire career, we are treated to marvelously sharp film and video matched with absolutely crystal clear audio that will literally slam you back into your livingroom couch. The balance between the instruments so lacking in the numerous bootleg CDs floating about is replaced with Jone's tight basslines, Bonzo's crackling drums, Plant's soaring vocals, and Page's trancendent guitar tones. At points, this could be mistaken for stripped down studio basic tracks, but the spontaniety of Zep's live performances assure us that this is the real deal. <br />TSRTS was a mediocre testament, that was always obvious. For any other band to be playing at the level depicted in that film, it would be a great document of their live act. But this is Zeppelin, and we always knew that they were at their very best live. Sure, there are moments in that film that pushed the blood through your veins like no other concert film before (the unbelievable sprawl of Dazed and Confused, for instance, and the title song), but when compared to this new DVD, it pales, pales, by comparison. Here you will find far superior versions of many of the songs included in that film. The new version of Moby Dick alone, with Bonham playing at blistering speeds that, even when seen and heard, cannot be believed, is worth the price of this DVD.<br />What makes these discs special for me are the versions of some of the less frquently heard songs. Trampled Under Foot, Sick Again, these have always been favorites of mine, and to hear them live, well...<br />As for a tried and true classic, the 1980 version of Kashmir from  Knebworth is crunchingly heavy with it's huge lurch of a riff. Itshows a band that, despite signs of age in the lines of Plant's face and Page's painfully thin drug wasted physique, was as good, if not better, then they had ever been. Absolutely.<br />The albums have always testified that Led Zeppelin was the most powerful rock band ever. Memories, especially 70's ones, fade and die away. This DVD set is the band's legacy as the greatest live act ever. <br />Immortal Gods, live at last!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie just built in excellence on top of the first one.  Much better paced and executed.  There is a lot more action in the second movie which also helps the movie go faster and not seem so long!  I can't wait to get the EE DVD of this movie, I want to see if the extra footage makes the movie even better like it did for FOTR.
B000002HMH|5.0|I remember when Ride the Lightning was Metallica's current album, and a friend of a friend tried to turn me on to it. It didn't take. I was a punk. I was anti-heavy metal. But the next year I got into thrash bands like DRI and COC. Then, Metallica released Master of Puppets. Because I was wearing a DRI t-shirt, a kid at school asked me if I was into Metallica. &#34;Nope.&#34; &#34;Well, you should be.&#34; He loaned me his walkman which had his tape of Master of Puppets in it and let me listen to it for the rest of the day. When school let out I gave it back to him and stopped at the record store on the way home and bought my own copy of Master of Puppets. Not long after that I bought Ride the Lightning, then Kill 'Em All. I had officially become a metal head, and Metallica was my favorite metal band. As I recall I loved Justice, despite the plastic sounding, ultra-sterile production. The songs themselves were good enough to overcome that problem. The black album didn't really do it for me. I've never been sure why. It just seemed... I dunno, frivolous compared to the eariler albums. I didn't hate it. I just didn't glom on to it as I did with everything else they'd done. Then there was the long hiatus where no one heard a peep out of Metallica for several years. Eventually Load came out, and I instantly loved it. What a change. What a breath of fresh air. It was still undoubtedly Metallica, but with a sense of growth and evolution and maturation. Reload was good too, but not quite as good as Load. I've never really understood the accusations of &#34;sell out&#34; and whatnot because of these records. I mean, it was still so obviously Metallica... it was just in a new dimension. And besides, Metallica has been accused of selling out since Day 1. First it was because of their slow and melodic &#34;ballad&#34; Fade to Black on Ride the Lightning. Then it was signing to a major label with Master of Puppets. Then it was making a video for One on And Justice For All. And then of course we all know that they really truly sold out with the black album. How many times can a band sell out? I was under the impression it was a one-time event.<br /><br />Anyway, I've been listening to these lately to get ready for St. Anger. Based on the three short samples I've heard, it sounds like they've gone to yet another place. &#34;They've gone back to their old sound!&#34; What?! Get off the dope. Metallica was NEVER this hardcore. Time to show today's little panty-waist twerps who think they can rock how it's supposed to be done...then of course we all know that they really truly sold out with the black album.

B00008OWZC|5.0|This is amazing stuff!  Led Zeppelin were the greatest band of their day and any day!  I listened to this and expected another bbc but this is much better.  There are songs on here I never thought i'd hear them do live.  Every song is incredible.  This contains the best version of Stairway Heaven to date. The energy explodes out of every song. There will never be another band like them and I feel very fortunate to have heard this.
B000009ROK|5.0|These CD's are a must-have. I listen to them at least twice a week.  I love to play Luis Miguel when I am cooking or driving in traffic.  His voice is so soothing and the lyrics are beautiful. All the songs are good but my favorite is Maana de Carnaval. Words can't describe the beauty of this song. Buy these, you won't be sorry.
B000002MFE|5.0|This album is spectacular! Tears In Heaven is the BEST song! Okay, I first listened to this album a couple weeks ago and never in my life heard Eric Clapton before, seeing as he is before my time. I first put the song on Tears In Heaven because I liked the name. From the time I FIRST started listening to it I was in tears and by the end I was soaked! This song is just wonderful! The rest of the album is great too but Tears In Heaven just lights up the WHOLE album! This is a must for any Eric Clapton fan and a must for anyone who has lost someone...This album shows that Eric Clapton IS a living legend!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Many people may find the often slow pace of Equilibrium to be a bit tedious, but I find it to strike a good balance between the silly over the top action of the Matrix and the almost painfully slow drama of THX 1138, both films in the same vein.  <br />Of course, this draws from Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, 1984, Metropolis and countless other repressive future society stories, but it is done so with aplomb.  Christian Bale's performance in this movie is downright incredible.  He should have played Neo in the Matrix as he is a FAR better actor than Keanu Reeves.  In fact, almost all of the acting in Equilibrium is well done.  Taye Diggs plays his role very well, even flashing his teeth in emotionless fake smiles.<br />If the story does not move you, the action will.  Not only is the action superbly original and more realistic than the fly by wire act of the Matrix (more on this in a minute), but the actors performed their own stunts and had to memorize the fight scenes (watch the documentary), which certainly made their roles physically demanding.<br />Many have argued that the \\"gun-kata\\" is silly and unrealistic, and they do have a point.  But, such study is not totally from the real of realism.  Anyone who has studied Japanese sword fighting learns that in order for many people to attack one person, they must be organized or else all they can do is mob him.  But the man alone does not have such constraints.  Add to this fact that guns create crossfire (you might shoot your comrades) and the \\"gun-kata\\" might even be plausible.  This combination of ideas make it unique and an interesting study in fighting.  Of course, no one can hold a candle to John Preston in the \\"gun-kata\\", but that adds to the fun!<br />All in all, it is a highly enjoyable film, offering fresh insights into one of the most classic genres.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones was a terrific opportunity to see a story from many dimensions.  Each character was well defined (rare for such a short story,) the plot was believable, and you'll feel that you want to keep reading.<br />In a strange way, it will be very uplifting for someone who has experienced a tragedy in their life -- particularly a death.  It provides a way to think about the afterlife that is enjoyable and calming.  <br />If you like typical \\"chick\\" books, this one was a page-turner.
B000002E5J|5.0|Everything about this album and its artist is irrestistably beautiful. Not only does Shakira have an amazing voice but her own lyrics make this album truly unforgettable.  Her words are insightful and courageous. One can definitely tell that there is a little bit of her soul in each song. Her down-to-earth personality makes her music easy to relate to as well as inspiring. (her other albums easily deserve 5 stars as well)
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you enjoy collecting Beatles' rarities to obtain stereo mixes of their 1962-1965 output, then this Anthology on DVD will provide you with full versions of stereo studio tracks that have until recently been issued only in mono. In contrast to faulty sounding bootlegs, the stereo mixes here are superb, especially for A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale. The stereo separation allows you to hear George Harrison's melodic guitar riffs separtated out from the mix, and you can distinctly hear the first use of intentional feedback in the recording process.. Beautiful sounding!
B00008H2LB|5.0|l would just like to say to all those linkin park fans out there that this album will blow you away! I thought that nothing would ever be any better than hybrid theory, but l guess l was wrong. This album has not one dissappointment in it! l cant give the reviewers a list with the best tracks as you will see listening that you will never have to push the skip button!<BR>This album is sick! What more can l say!
B00008V2VM|5.0|I would describe this as Farenheit 451 meets John Woo (with some influence from Matrix and maybe even Total Recall).  <br />The Gun-Kadas are what make the action so engrossing (basically a martial arts/statistic fighting style taught to the Grammaton Clerics - elite troops of the Librians - which teaches how to use guns to maximize the damage while keeping the clerics safe from return fire).  Actually when you watch the fighting scenes you get the impression that it was also influenced by the fast-paced fighting within most Anime.  <BR>The whole thing with everyone being doped up on an ultra-prozac was a nice message about our current culture (using drugs as an easy way to solve the underlying problems).<br />This movie came out quite recently but the film 'looks' a bit older - not shiny but more grainy quality to it (looks like it was produced in mid-nineties I think), which actually makes it more effective.  The casting was well done, all the actors performed admirably - I was quite surprised by the number of actors I could recognize in the film especially considering how little press it got.<BR>I'm quite surprised by how little advertising was done for this movie.  I'm sure it'll be a sleeper-hit but they should at least show some commercials first.  I only heard of it through a friend, and I'm quite happy to have taken his advice and rented it (although I vaguely remembered seeing a commercial for this flick after watching the whole thing).<br />Anybody who likes action or dystopia type movies should watch this.  It stands on its own, its got its own style which can't be said of all recent movies ...  This was a fun movie that I will probably own soon.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As someone who's thirty something, Led Zep has alway's been omnipresent in my musical mind.  Sadly, there was so little visual to go with the auditory (except all the great live photographs).  We have had \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", but it only showed one period of this legendary band which tells only part of the story.  I can not convey enough how elated I am with this DVD, simply but, don't consider yourself a Rock fan and much less a Led Zep fan if this is not in your collection; this also goes with the new CD \\"How The West Was Won\\".  The only thing that makes me sad is that when you see a band like this in all their glory, you realize how [weak] the music of today is.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm a big fan of female vocals. I'm also a big fan of hard rock/metal. I've been waiting for a \\"best of both worlds\\" album, and this is it!!! Think Portishead meets Linkin Park, with a hint of Type O Negative for mood, and you have Fallen. The ballads are simply astounding, with the up-tempo songs right behind them. The is a great CD for ANY rock fan, not just folks like me. If you've been on the fence about this disk (as I was), GET IT!! You will not be dissapointed.
B000002UA0|3.0|First off, its a shame that this CD was your introduction to Pink Floyd. I gave this CD a three star rating because even as a hard-core Pink Floyd fan, the music on this offering is not typical Pink Floyd.<BR>If you (A.M.) happen to read this review, and for anyone else who comes across it that may not be familure with Pink Floyd, do yourself a favor and buy either &quot;Animals&quot; or &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; from Pink Floyd. If, after listening to one, or both of those CD's you still have a unfavorable opinion about Pink Floyd, then you can say that &quot;they're just another mediocre, overrated band&quot;, but you'll be wrong...and chances are those words wont come to mind after hearing either of the aforementioned CD's.
0441003257|5.0|Wow! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For anyone who likes British humor, this is a book that will keep you laughing, and thinking.<br />Crowley is a demon with a mission. He has been chosen to end the world by delivering the antichrist to a family. The only problem is, he and his angel friend (that's right, friend) Aziraphale aren't exactly sure they want the world to end just yet. But, ever dutiful, Crowley delivers the antichrist to a hospital, where an order of satanic nuns are to switch the antichrist with the mortal baby son of the American cultural attache (ala &quot;The Omen&quot;). But, due to the slip-up of a particularly confused satanic nun, the spawn of satan is sent home with the wrong family, unbeknownst to the spiritual powers involved. The antichrist is delievered to a nice, middle-class family from Tadfield. Meanwhile, the four horsemen of the apocolypse are firing up their motorcycles, and the powers that be are gathering up their weapons for the war that is to follow Armageddon, among other, more earthly matters.<br />This book is very odd, very funny, and somewhat dark all at the same time. This is probably due to the fact that the authors (Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett) are considered to be rather well-versed in these areas. If you are a Gaiman or a Pratchett fan already, then Good Omens is likely to increase your appriciation for the authors. However, if you haven't read Gaiman or Pratchett's books, Good Omens is a good introduction to both authors. In my case, it got me started reading the authors' individual works, and I haven't looked back since. Hopefully, this book will open new literary opportunities for the willing.
B000006ZKY|5.0|This is one of the albums that should be in your collection with no objection....great songs like Fantasy, American nights, Dont get me wrong.......all songs are perfect...this is a good example of how hard rock have to be. Clauss Lessmann is a great vocalist sorrounded by a great guitarrist like Hans Ziller, awesome production...definitely this album earns 5 stars.
B00005R5G9|3.0|This is a fun movie, and so typical of the 80s' weird concept movies. The whole family can enjoy this - the story line can be picked up by all ages. And it's great for kids of the 80's wanting to relive those fun years.<br />A really sweet and fluffy story. <br />It is annoying in parts (like an over-the-top flamboyant gay guy that really is the epitome of 80's gay stereo-typing) Or how no one thinks much of a guy obsessed with a shop window mannequin.<br />But then you remind yourself, that it is just a bit of fun; you really arent supposed to take this seriously. And finding it funny doesnt totally undermine your intelegence... too much. (I bought it!!)<br />Extremely well cast, both lead and supporting actors.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It is a year or so ago the first time I listen to Norah's music. The more I listen to her music, the more I fall in love with her music. Norah's voice is kind of deep and absolutely atractive. Her music gives a comfortable feeling to me, and  I trust to whoever listens to it as well. Once you turn on the her CD, you will never able to stop until you fall asleep. Her music is full of strength, everytime when I listen to it, I discover a new feeling. Her music will only get better not worse.  If you are a Jazz/Pop lover, this is a must earned music in a year. My recommendation : #1 Don't Know Why?, #2 Seven Years and #5 Come Away With Me
B00000F566|5.0|Finally, an 80's movie DVD with more than just a film trailor.  This one disc is jam packed with lots of goodies to watch as well as an excellent movie. Also it has a booklet.<br />The movie is romantic and well crafted. You can see how much blood and sweat went in to the two main parts of Jennifer's and Patrick's parts. They really played the best possible and it shows throughout the movie. <br />The entire cast infact have invested so much energy that the movie glows, unlike so many other films where no one's heart was really in the production. <br />The soundtrack is excellent; mixing vintage 50's/60's music with modern 80's songs - which really works.<br />In total the movie, DVD features and even the box add up to a superbly made package.
0312979479|5.0|As a seasoned mystery fan, I'm fussy about the quality of the mysteries that I read. This classic by Christie will NOT disappoint. She weaves her tale so cleverly, creates characters with such detail, and skillfully sets the scene. If you're like me, this one will drag you in and keep you reading all night long. Pick it up on a Friday night, and you'll be finished sometime on Saturday ... it's that compelling once you get into the plot. And when you think you know who it is, guess again, she'll surprise you. Enough of a spooky-factor to make you nervous as you read. The characters are very believable. Very human and real people she's created for this one. Enjoy!
B00005JKQZ|4.0|First let me say that &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is a very good movie. It's well made, well acted, and a very thoughtful picture. The biggest problem with it is that it's a shoe-in for Academy Awards like &quot;Best Actor,&quot; &quot;Best Director,&quot; and &quot;Best Picture.&quot; Director Ron Howard definitely deserves the Best Director award. This may be his best directing job yet. But let's look at the others. I really think any respectable actor besides Russell Crowe could've gotten the Best Actor award. That part could've been played by anybody and the award would've been given to him. The film was also a shoe-in for Best Picture simply because it was a touching life story about a man with a mental disease. But putting all these expectations aside, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is still a very good movie, even when it's obviously trying to jerk a few tears. It tells the story of John Nash, a gifted mathematician who finds out he has schizophrennia. We meet John when he's a young hotshot in college and follow his life up until 1994 when he recieves the Nobel prize. I wouldn't take everything in this movie as law. There are many inaccuracies and omissions to Nash's life in the film. But for what it's worth it is a well-made film and will delight those who weep easily in movies. Don't take my criticisms on this film too seriously. I did like this movie a lot. However, there are other similar films that didn't get awards that I would recommend instead of this.
0679735259|5.0|Maybe it's because Michael Herr wrote the narration for the film, but reading Dispatches, you can't help but feel that you're getting another peek into the thoughts of Martin Sheen's character Captain Willard, from Apocalypse Now.  Willard if he was wimpier, actually; Herr makes no bones about the fact that he was scared out of his wits throughout most of his stay in Vietnam.  One of the pieces in Dispatches, \\"Illumination Rounds,\\" really slams this point home; Herr comes off like a paranoid wreck in it.<br />Beyond that, Herr's writing is almost poetic.  His descriptions of the war and the men who fought in it are impressive, borderline masterly.  In addition he throws off gems of impromptu character studies, almost throw-away sentences that describe the very core of the soldiers he met.  One of my favorite lines that Herr wrote for Apocalypse Now is when Willard meets the PBR crew; he says they're \\"rock and rollers, with one foot in their graves.\\"  Dispatches is filled to the brim with such lines, and if you enjoyed Martin Sheen's voice-over in the Coppola film, you'll really enjoy this book.<br />I've read Dispatches a few times, and each time I've taken something new from it.  The \\"Khe Sanh\\" section is obviously the centerpiece of the book; it dwarfs all of the other stories.  Stuck in the bombed-out, besieged base, Herr effectively conveys the sense of doom and paranoia that gripped the Marines trapped inside.  This section features one of the more memorable soldiers in the book, the black Marine Day Tripper, as well as a mysterious grenade launcher who provided the inspiration for the character Roach in Apocalypse Now.  In fact, the \\"Khe Sanh\\" article, as it originally appeared in magazine form, was a prime source of inspiration for John Milius, when he was writing the Apocalypse Now script in 1969.<br />There are a host of intriguing characters in this book.  My favorite is cast aside quickly, however: a drugged-out LURP who appears briefly in the opening chapter, \\"Breathing In.\\"  Herr apparently was too frightened of this guy to get closer to him, so all we get in Dispatches is an intriguing glimpse.  We do get to see more of Herr's colleagues, though, such as Errol Flynn's son Sean, who treats the war like a day at the park, riding to and from battles on a motorcycle.<br />Readers looking for detailed combat description are out of luck.  In fact, it appears that Herr didn't see much fighting at all.  At least, if he did, he doesn't mention it.  Instead, what you find in Dispatches are illuminating reports from the front lines, insightful character studies of the men who fought and died.  You also get a heavy dose of the pop culture of the time: the spirit of Morrison and Hendrix and Zappa so permeate every page that you can almost hear their music blaring in the background.<br />So, just as Apocalypse Now rises above being just another \\"war\\" film by mostly not being about the war at all, Dispatches rises above your average combat journalism.  Instead, it comes off as a moment in time, caught and contained forever in text.  It is to be read first and foremost by those who wish to understand Vietnam, the mindset of the men who fought there.  It's also just a plain engrossing read.pter, \\"Breathing In.\\"  Herr apparently was too frightened of this guy to get closer to him, so all we get in Dispatches is an intriguing glimpse.

B00008PX8P|5.0|Thank you Jimmy Page! I have always had a motto when it comes to buying anything featuring Led Zeppelin, &quot;If it's produced by Jimmy Page, GET IT!, you'll NEVER be disappointed&quot;<br />Nothing could be more true about these DVD's. The quality in both the audio and video is incredible. And the performances ROCK!<br />For years and years we've all known that these performances existed somewhere. Kudos to Mr. Page for finally putting them together and once again making the little hairs on the back of our necks stand up!<br />Buy this now!
B00008PX8P|5.0|5 stars is not enough...a new rating should be established for a masterpiece like this...I give it a 10 Star rating and beyond. I've been on this earth long enough to have seen a couple of live Zep concerts...and have been patiently waiting for this event for years. If you never have seen Zeppelin live, you now have the chance. All the passion, raw energy, creativity, and talent of the band is presented true to life, thanks to the efforts of Jimmy Page and his technical magicians who have resurrected concert footage spanning the life of the band, and have restored all the magic brilliantly. Listening to Page's guitar riffs via DTS audio will keep you on the edge of your seat and your jaw will just drop to the floor as you watch him effortlessly slide up and down the neck of his guitar...truly amazing stuff, no guitar player today even comes close...if you are a guitar player, you now have a chance to learn from the master up close. Plant's vocals, especially during the early days, will send chills down your spine. He has a voice with fingers that will reach the highest of heights and grab you by the balls. JPJ's bass playing truly defines the term \\"heavy,\\" and Bonzo's attack on his drum kit is something to see (watching him play you can see why many refer to him as the greatest rock drummer who ever lived...damn, during some sequences it almost looks like they ran  the video fast forward...you want to see and hear acceleration and pure power, watch his solo during Moby Dick).<br />The DVD is loaded with over 5 hours of live footage...all of it fantastic. Even the menu interaction provides you with rare concert footage in the background as you are navigating your way around the DVD...bottom line, there is no wasted space on this DVD...every bit is used to the max...leave it to Zeppelin to do something that has never been done before...and of course, true to form, and living up to their historic reputation, they do it better than anyone else. Zeppelin fan or not, thisis a must have for anyone who loves R&B, rock 'n' roll, heavy metal, raw blues, live performances, and so on and so on... hell... the dvd is a masterpiece, just do yourself a favor and buy it. It will be the biggest bang you will ever get in your life time... PS... we will probably be seeing these guys at this year's Grammy Awards, this release is EARTH SHATTERING!!!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Well, its been said how great this was enuf already. I just got it today and intended to just sample it but didn't get off the couch for 6 hours. The video quality is superb, audio as well.<br />I play guitar in a Zep cover band in So Calif. and am so stoked to see Pagey up close in new material. Very nostalgic trip thru their career; so much produced in 11 short years, bittersweet in a way. I've been praying for a reunion tour but now wonder if its best kept as is (I hope the lads don't read that!). I'd like to think that it wasn't that long ago they ruled, but my 20 year high school reunion is next week so who am I lying to?! Good Lord, these guys rocked the f'ing planet and now we have the historical document to prove it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|To the person who wrote about the edited version, the Director's Cut is the NC-17 version.  It may say rated R but this is the version [Director's Cut] with ALL of the available explicit scenes that person was talking about. <br />This movie is definitely for someone wanting a movie worth &quot;thinking over&quot; after watched.  This is not a light movie but is an excellent depiction of an addict in various forms.  If you wish to look directly into addiction's eyes, this will give you a VERY close glance.  Watch the Director's Cut, you will NOT be disappointed!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is a mindblowing release and an incredible value for anybody remotely familiar with Led Zeppelin's music and mystery.  I finally found a store where I could purchase it on the May 27th release date (it was sold out the first three places I looked), and I have not been able to turn it off for the last three days.  Highlights are too many to note, but here are some of the features and moments that Shook Me, left me Dazed and Confused, and took me on the Stairway to Heaven:  1.)The progression of the band from the 1970 Albert Hall performance to the 1979 Knebworth show (their last as a band - you are watching history of footage that only a few hardcore fans ever even knew existed!)truly documents their progression as a band... the early performances strike me as raw and outerworldly... the later performances are more refined and charismatic - true rock gods strutting their stuff; 2.)The sound and audio quality FAR exceed my expectations. 3.) These performances once and for all prove that Zep (when they were on like they are here)were a devastating live act. Most of the songs played live in these performances, especially many of the songs from Physical Grafitti on, are far superior to the album cuts due to the incredible interplay and improvisation of the band.  4.)The oddities and extras -- some of the TV performances are fascinating and bizarre.  The audiences at these shows just didn't know what to think of this band. 5.) My favorite cuts are the \\"White Summer\\" guitar solo spot from Albert Hall, the entire segment from the black and white Danish TV special, \\"In My Time of Dying\\" from the 1975 Earl's Court show, and the reworked version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" from the Knebworth show.  <BR>    When DVDs debuted in the 1990s, the possibilities seemed endless for what this new medium could do in terms of sound and content, but the promises have been largely unfulfilled (in my opinion) by the movie and music industries.  Huge credit goes to the band and the engineers for not teasing us with incomplete material and hoping we would settle for [for less than the best]audio, but instead creating a DVD crammed full of 5+ hours of great entertainment and quality.  I just hope the rebirth of Led Zep this product will surely inspire does not result in a misguided \\"reunion tour.\\"  Even with the best intentions, Plant, Page, and Jonesy could never come close to recapturing the magic of these performances... not to mention that no drummer could provide the 20 ton whallop of Bonzo's drum kit so majestically on display on this DVD.  This DVD is what I've been waiting for for over 20 years, and the most amazing thing is that I didn't even know I've been waiting for it.  What a gem!
B000002LOE|3.0|I'm not much of an R.E.M. fan; I'm more of a casual listener. But when my sister was cleaning out her music collection, I was happy enough to take this CD off her hands, since I recognized a couple of the singles on it: #2, \\"Losing My Religion\\" (one I like), and #6, \\"Shiny Happy People\\" (one I don't). And that just about sums up my reaction to \\"Out of Time\\"--a 50/50 like/dislike of the songs.<br />The CD almost has a country feel to it, and since I'm not much a country fan, that's probably why I wasn't won over by this album. I still think Michael Stipe has a good singing voice, but it was nice to hear some accompaniment by Kate Pierson (from The B-52's) on songs like \\"Shiny Happy People,\\" \\"Country Feedback,\\" and \\"Me In Honey.\\"<br />Anyone who likes mellow, artsy alt rock with a hint of country will probably like \\"Out of Time,\\" but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this CD, unless you're a die hard R.E.M. fan.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay proves that you can still have soul in alternative/rock music in 2002/2003.  The lead singer's piano sound gives this album one of the most unique sounds of its time.  We need more artists like Coldplay, as proven in this album.  Need I say more?
0312932081|5.0|I'm impressed with the insight into the character of Ender. It is one of the rare books that caught me by suprise at the end, while making it seem a natural development. Concise writing and to the point. Such a wonderful combination of Science fiction ideas and social understanding.
B000062YAZ|1.0|...I am going to be perfectly honest about what I think of this cheesy garbage. I first thought that this was one of those bands who's music was hard to get into at first, but eventually would grow on you. I have found this band and this album to be unlistenable due to the nerve grating vocals, sloppy bass playing, and the endless and mindless guitar solos. On the other hand, the drumming is outstanding. I just wish Dave Lobardo would have made a better choice in the beginning of his career. His efforts on Testament's \\"The gathering\\" are, what I think to be much better than any effort he made with Slayer. My reccomendations for fans of angry, intense Thrash metal include Sodom, Destruction, Kreator, Dark angel, and Sepultura's first four albums.<br />I don't understand how a band so heavily influenced by Venom could turn out so awful. What personally upsets me is that Slayer have spawned an entire legion of bands who's styles have been directly lifted from Slayer's albums. Oh well, I guess that's just the way things are. Many sub-par bands will get lavished with praise while, in my opinion much better bands will get much less recognition.
B00008J4P5|5.0|That's an amazing album, i fell in love with every single track on it. the white stripes are really great!
B00008OWZC|5.0|The alternate title for this review is \\"Got Zeppelin?\\". Cause if you don't, you really need to do so immediately. The release of this 3CD live set confirms what many of us have believed for some time. Many, if not most, of the bands that we grew up with taped their shows. We all have talked about where are the live releases of these concerts. Now we know, at least in the case of Led Zeppelin.<br />In 1972, these 4 lads were in total command of their composing and performing powers. They had 4 solid releases behind them and were touring in advance of \\"Houses of the Holy\\". The power of this band was always in their live performances. <br />This is irrevocably confirmed in the first listen of the first disc. Jimmy gets this whole secondary riff thing going in \\"Immigrant Song\\" that just leaps out at you. My reaction was one of \\"oh, yea, that works\\". HOTH is first experienced on track 5, \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\", where the band lays it out ever so finely with Plant's vocals at center stage. Variations on a theme are heard as Page noodles an alternate riff throughout. To those of us, and there are many, who know Zep's music note for note, this is so refreshing. To hear these alternate riffs throughout this album makes it very engaging and absolutely essential. The blues base of the band is in your face throughout an 8 minute \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". The alternate or secondary riff thing happens again as Jimmy and John Paul trade licks on \\"Going to California\\". John Paul's mandolin playing is sweet, yet forceful, a ying to Jimmy's guitar yang. <br />Disc 2 burns rubber as \\"Dazed and Confused\\" commands 25 minutes of attention. This is not your mother's D+C, or even the D+C we know so well from a certain Live Concert Film from Madison Square Garden. This is something else entirely. Blues with serious bashing is experienced again with \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\". The vocals here are just superb. Plant is the man. He knows it. We know it. Then and now. Wow.<br/>Disc 3 requires the donning of protective eyewear as the shredding of Page's guitar is potentially hazardous. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" also reintroduces the world to the best rock drummer of the era, John Bonham. He crushes the skins throughout the 3CDs, but totally shines on WLL. Say what you will about the (many) other great drummers of the late 60s into the 70s. When you are done, listen to Bonham's playing on this 3CD set and see if you do not agree. If WLL does not convince you, check out \\"Rock And Roll\\", which follows. Bonham is awfully good there, too. It still does not make me aspire to be a Caddy owner, though.<br />In the end, I am left both satiated and hungry. Satiated that I have had a full meal deal listening to one of the absolute titans of rock at the apex of their performing. Hungry for more from them and the many other bands we all treasure/d and wondering where all those tapes went. Here's hoping for more, soon.
B00008PX8P|5.0|When the BBC sessions came out, I was sorry I ever spent a dime on all the inferior bootlegs (trust me, I bought alot!). I never bought any videos and boy am I glad now! The DVD is split nice between the pre-star Zep and the arena years. Both are equally amazing in terms of sound and video quality. It shows how Jimmy still cares enough to put out quality releases like these. I really liked the extras. Check out the comical lip syncing and playing on the Communication Breakdown promo. The most bizzare is definitely the French TV performance. Check out the lady with her baby and the look on the orchestra player's faces. <br />This DVD is a bargain at the price and is definitly a must own. I wonder if anything else is in the works. Thanks Jimmy for this and all the new releases!
B000002C1V|5.0|I've been a lover of this album since I was in junior high school in the late eighties.  Floyd was my first concert, at RFK Stadium in SE Washington DC.  &quot;The Final Cut&quot; takes the sonic, decidedly non-Floydian stamp of &quot;The Wall,&quot; and uses it to explore the betrayal of ideals, alienation, paranoia, rampant free-market capitalism, and the futility of war.  As a &quot;concept album,&quot; I think it's far more effective than &quot;The Wall,&quot; insofar as that album was intended as a quasi-narrative, while TFC explores topic in a non-linear fashion, and it's easier to wrap your mind around.  Also, it's not 1.5 hours.  &quot;Two Suns in the Sunset&quot; is perhaps my favorite cut off the album.  I mean, how could you not love a ballad of global nuclear apocalypse?  You gotta love that Roger Waters.  He's sunny guy.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This the one of few music dvd's i have and it's very high on the wow factor.<BR>I was born in 1970 so i hear and listen to there music and love them still now in 2003.<BR>for people out there your have to watch everything on each dvd it start with the show but the menu is at the end of each dvd.<BR>It has bonus stuff listed there and much more.<BR>SO ROCK ON WITH THE ZED-MEN...
B00000AFFF|3.0|A lot of people who write about this Bacharach-Costello collaboration go on as if it came out of the pure blue sky.  Dig this: Elvis was singing Bacharach in 1977 already.  Go listen to &quot;Live Stiffs&quot;, and then come back and talk when your homework is done okay?  Jeez.<br />Yes, as one complainer said, the songs do meander.  They are not terribly hummable.  Most Bacharach songs aren't.  Neither is Mahler.  But this isn't  a valid objection.  It didn't promise &quot;hummability&quot; on the label.  (Tori Amos, anyone?)  Moving on...<br />Wonderful &quot;hyper-romantic&quot; lyrics.  But, as receptive as I have slowly become to this album (lifelong EC fanatic), I still don't like &quot;crooner Elvis&quot;.  It's not the songs I have a problem with: I just don't think that this is the music his voice is best suited to sing.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I've been a SOAD fan since I first heard Chop Suey blaring through my headphones on the radio. I had heard Spiders long before but I was'nt mmature enough to understand it. I've said before, this band has everything they need to stay on the top of a world of posers and wannabes. The lyrics are smart and political, and occasionally funny. Even if this isn't your type of music you'll find one song you'll melodically, lyrically, musically, or all three love. Whether it's the hard riffing of A.D.D. or Daron's soft acoustic work on Roullette, you've got to like it. Singer Serj has a raunchy original armenian voice that is sure to keep you listening. Daron's guitar style is almost devine, with downtuned palm muted power chords and how easily he can switch from hard rock to metal and to soft acoustic playing.<BR>Chic 'N' Stu-I hate this song, nothing about it really gets me excited<BR>Innervision-Great hard rocker, just like the above goes from hard rock to acoustic playing<BR>Bubbles-It was always my favourite, wierd and heavy<BR>Boom-Its a great hard rock song but I don't like it as much since the video came out. Go George Bush!<BR>Nuguns-Really wierd, and i mean wierd, but awesome<BR>A.D.D.-Another one of my favourites, hard rocking intro, once again go George Bush.<BR>Mr.Jack-Possibly about authority another great song with an unusual begining.<BR>IEAIAIO-I didn't apreciate it at first, and I still dont like it tht much, fun to sing though. REALLY FUN.<BR>36-What the f**k?<BR>Pictures-Its average until the bridge, then it get incredible, GO DARON!<BR>hIGHWAY sONG-A slow number with hints of rock. Sweet and wierd chorus.Catchy.<BR>F**k the system-Not that great but it's still good.<BR>Ego Brain-This song will take you away, beautiful verse, rock out chorus<BR>Thetawaves-Another awesome song, one after another, wierd solo.<BR>Roullete- Great all acoustic number.<BR>Streamline-A great song, Incredible solo, but i hate it so much because it's the end of the best cd ever (in my humble opinion)

0792101448|1.0|This is number 11 on my list of ten worst movies. Like Parsifal, the opera that starts at 8:30 p.m. and three hours later, you look at your watch and it's only 8:45 p.m., there is a point at which you think this movie will never end. Though this over-bloated spaghetti western appears to have a lot going for it, especially cast-wise with Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, and Claudia Cardinale, it turns out to be a 165-minute Parsifallian test of your intestinal fortitude. It starts with Fonda's character leading a band of outlaws on an attack to kill a family of ranchers for no obvious reason. His cold-bloodedness is demonstrated when he shoots a 10-year old boy, who had been hiding during the attack, to prevent him from identifying them later. Your stomach is particularly tested later during one scene where the camera pans low over about ten bodies just blown to bits (and I mean BITS). For over two and a half hours, you keep asking yourself where this story and all its gore are going. It's finally revealed at the bitter end (Are you ready? How's this for an original plot?): a rich guy hired the outlaws to drive out the ranchers to get their land cheap so he could later sell it to the railroad that only he knows is coming to town. When it's finally over, you are still left with one last question: why couldn't the director have done this story in 90 minutes, or less (zero would have been even better)? Save your time and money (and stomach).
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Elvis Costello was very very very good at least as many albums as you have fingers, but he and the Attractions were never fresher, or better, than this.   If you don't like this album, you are not really an EC fan.  He once described &quot;This Year's Model&quot; as an attempt to re-make the Rolling Stones' &quot;Aftermath&quot;.  Truth is, he surpassed it.

B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee is AMAZING. This band ROCKS. Since I've bought this CD (the day it came out) I have listened to nothing else.  There are no words to describe how wonderful this band is. If I could I would give it 100 stars.  Her voice is wonderful, and the guitars, drums, and piano parts are amazing. If you want something that completely rocks, buy this album!!!...

0440418569|5.0|*~The Amber Spyglass~*, by Phillip Pullman, is a breathtaking novel about love, symbolism, and the quest for the purpose of exsistance. <br />To those readers, like me, who enjoy science fiction and fantasy, this golden instant classic is a true tresure. For those of you that like discussions about political issues, religion, or current beliefs, this is just a spark to light your candle of knowledge and wonderment. <br />As I have heard and read from previous reviewers, some do not like this trilogy for the same reasons Harry Potter has been accused. I myself do not favor them much, but it is more because of J.K. Rowling's writing style than anything else. It is true Pullman's references to G-d, church and angels are not Christian, but there are a couple of \\"good\\" angels in the story that help Lyra and Will from time to time. Also: Pullman did not write this story to be taken literally. The author uses such terms as \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" as a symbol for how the Church had such a dominant power over people's lives. \\"Dust/Shadows/sraf\\" is symbolistic for the spritual or mystical side of matter; small particals that each of us possess determine our destinies and make us kindred to each other. This, of course, is only my interpretation of what Dust is.<br />Pullman's writing is flawless, and surpasses all the other *~His Dark Materials~* and (as much as I have read) all his other books. I recommend this book to anyone who is still seaching for the meaning in life, as we all are, and what it truly means to be a person.
0452282152|5.0|If you were ever curious to find out how people lived in the Netherlands of the 17th century, this book will be a great introduction.  Tracy Chevalier's detailed description of common folk of that time is superb!  And it did feel as if we were entering into the scenes depicted by Vermeer or his Delft colleagues Pieter de Hooch, Gerard Ter Borch, Gabriel Metsu.  Despite the narrow focus of the narrative, Chevalier was able to keep me involved with greater and greater interest to the end.   Here, the ordinary worries of a young woman, who finds herself pushed down in the rigid social scale, moving from an artesan's class to the servant class, are described with sympathy.  The tone, to Chevalier's benefit, is unjudgmental and adds to the sense of a true portrait of the era.  Definitely a great read, charming in all  aspects; a jewel, worth re-reading!
B000089RVX|3.0|This could be called the worst of Evanesence. If you have ever heard the original version of Whisper you will have to agree. I bought the CD anyway to support them. I only hope their next release will be without the &quot;popular sound&quot; addition. I know they cannot be completely happy with this one.
B000002MY3|4.0|Jagged Little Pill is a good album. produced by Glen Ballard the album contains 12 good songs that all has something special about them. Lyrically the album is good. It mostly deals with relationships with men and people around Alanis, eating disorders etc. Some of the lyrics dont make sense at all but work well in the song. Musically it isnt exactly avant-garde or different  but gripping and very melodic. Jagged Little Pill is by no means however a perfect record it is a bit cheesy and corny and often a bit annoying but it has also feel to it that you just cant ignore it. 7.5/10.
B00005O5CM|1.0|This is another one of those films (Forest Gump, Greek Wedding come to mind) that you hear so much about and then they turn out to be like the Emperor's Clothes when you see them. This movie's plot is breathtakingly unoriginal and every joke is telegraphed and obvious. Just an old formula repackaged with a pretty face.
B000002AVF|3.0|Daydream was released in the autumn of 1995. The LP became a huge sucess all over the world and produced 3 massive US no.1 singels and another top 10 hit. It was also her most critically aclaimed album. Mariah had never been a hit with the music critics until this album.Perhaps because it was more of an R&amp;B direction then her previous efforts. Like every other Mariah Carey album Dadyream has ballads, fun pop songs and few smooth R&amp;B tracks which often is the main element in every of her album.<br />But is Daydream a perfect album. NO. Not a single one of Mariah Carey album are. Musically they are not challenging or groubreaking they are not that much interesting however they have certain quality to them like most of Diva´s releases. <br />The production is slick The Producers she collaborates with are Walter Afanasieff who also worked with her on the music box Lp and is also known for his job with Celine Dion and few others.<BR>Daydream is the first album by Mariah where she begins to sample and the first track on the album Fantasy which is by the way her greatest single is a sample of ( Good god i forgot the name of the song but you know what). She also collaborated with Jermaine Dupri on one track. There are more beats on this album and it also shows that Motolla did not come as near this album as the previous. ( which shows that there were some probelms in the marriage and it was Mariah who made Tony Mottola bring other artists that he perhaps wouldn´t have done without Mariah). <br />Daydream is a good album. It is not great, Lyrically it is cliched and a bit corny. Musically it is of course very similar to it that was happening at the time and Mariah recieved baclash of being a bit trendy. Daydream however works on every level does not matter how cheesy or cliched it really is it is a well made album which has good production. The voice of Mariah shines well through and it is comfortable listen.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zep is alive and well folks.  Jimmy Page's guitar gets a nice mix and is mighty impressive.  Robert Plant's voice is generally in fine form - but slightly under in the mix here and there (this was 1972 after all) Still, the crucial part about this CD is how it captured Led Zep at its peak before Robert Plant's voice burned out on the Houses of the Holy Tour later that year, permanently altering Led Zep's sound.<br />In this CD, the band rocks and finally does some justice to its own live legacy.  Plant was a singer that went all the way.  Page went all the way. Jones and Bonham went all the way...<br />Shed a tear for this bygone era, but enjoy a glimpse of the era when men were men.  Led Zep stood above all as a creative and live force, once upon a time.  One hopes that even more will come out from the vaults!!  Keep hoping...<br />Trivia:<BR>As some bootleg collectors will know, the June 25 show also had &quot;Louis Louis&quot; and &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; in the encores...unfortunately these were left out here.<br />And finally: how could Jimmy Page pass that horrendous cover??
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a vivid novel about a girl named Scout who for some reason, likes to act like a boy. To Kill a Mockingbird tells a modern day life of two kids whose father is a lawer supporting a African man who was accused of raping a white woman. This book is a vivid novel of racism and faith.
B0000214F0|5.0|Caligula is a truly hot film!  I saw it years ago on VHS and then in a theatrical release about four years ago.    This is not a truly historical film, nor yet is it strictly speaking a sex film or \\"porno\\".  Much of the film is based on actual history, but it is not pure history. I would tend to label it as a spectacle.  There is plenty of nudity, to be sure.  There is some explicit sex. It is by all accounts oddball.  There is drama and some history thrown in, but don't expect a true to life blow by blow account of the life of Caligula.    When you see it, you are not going to see a real life portrayal of ancient Rome.  It is more like a fantasy based on ancient Roman themes.  If you are looking for stricly historical film about Emperor Caligula, then the series \\"I Claudius\\" would be more of a better treatment.    Watching the film is like watching a dream -- like one is entering the mind of the mad man.  It is often highly erotic filled with the rich texture of nude human flesh and sexuality and at other times horrifically violent, cruel, and disturbing.  Some scenes, including a mutilation scene are hard to take, but this does not detract from the overall richness. It is not your ordinary breed of film.  (Another similar film with plenty of nudity but without sex is \\"Prospero's Books\\".)    If you like unusual films with a lot of nudity, sex, exotic scenery and a bit of drama and history thrown in, then Caligula is for you.  But if you are put off by nudity, explicit sex, violence and the unusual, then you will hate it.
0345442970|4.0|Cloak of Deception reminds me, again, that there is more to a good adventure than the special effects. Spin me a good tale and give me interesting characters to follow and I'm there. James Luceno does it. He gives the reader the lay of the land in a Galactic Republic poised, not unlike the old Roman Republic, on the verge of collapse, the victim of its own success. There are many parallels. <br />When I first saw Star Wars I wondered about the Empire and the old Republic that preceded it. I only got some of the answers from Episode I and II. Now I have a feeling for and a picture of what it was like before the dark times and why things moved the way they did. It's easy to get caught up in the intrigues and the complex manipulations of our once and future villain, Darth Sidious [we all know how that will play out]. We also get a much larger picture of who Qui-Gon Jinn was and why he was often at odds with the Jedi Counsel. <br />If you like a good story and want to get a clearer picture of the Star Wars universe, I recommend this book. And for those who like action there's lots of that in here too-Capitan Cohl is a lot like Han Solo and there's lots of Jedi's employing what Anakin called aggressive negotiations. It's true you know where everything will end up but that does not take away from the adventure on the road to it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I dont really know what you people expect from Madonna, This album is, I have to say, if not bad, its fair enough, actually, its a great album, Songs like American Life, Holywood, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, Intervention, Die Another Day, X Static Process are all great songs ... if you listen carefully, I'm so Stupid , theres nothing wrong with it, great accompany music, Nobody knows me, its a bit annoying with vocoder, but the song could have been worse without it, Easy Ride, I dont particularly like this song, as its too slow,...some people may say Die Another Day is out of place, but still, its a remarkable song produced by Madonna and Mirawis, its also a successful soundtrack,...moreover this album is exclusively produced by Mirawirs there for that important cant be ignored! <BR>Overall, this album is great, opens up chapter 3 of Madonna's career, a must have for every Madonna's fan,....I cant wait for her to come to Sydney for her 6th live show!!

I wouldn't say that the acting was great (it's not), but I absolutely love the mixture of fantasy and reality.  Jim Henson and LucasArts teamed together to produce a film about a teenager who thinks that nothing is &quot;fair&quot; (she constantly whimpers, &quot;Oh, it's not fair!&quot;) who gets a taste of &quot;reality&quot; by going on a fantasy quest to rescue her baby brother who was kidnapped by goblins.  She realizes that things are not always what they seem (although I'm certain that special effects are part of this!), and she can't take things for granted.  The puppets used (there were many!) were mostly well done, and I think the music is kinda catchy.  I don't consider myself a David Bowie fan, and I don't own any of his albums, but the music went along well with the movie.  This movie is one of the ultimate fantasy movies of its time.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin park again comes back with fresh beats, lyrics and of course hard rock! Only if you are a true LP fan you will loove this album! I disagree with the past review's they are LAME! LP definetly worked for this one! My favorite cuts off the album include \\"somewhere I belong\\" along with \\"Nobody's Listening\\" and of course \\"Faint\\" with the japanese flutes in the background. Trust me its worth a buy!!! If you are a true LP fan you will love and respect the hard work spent to make this album great! LP ROCKS!

B000089RVX|5.0|I can see how it can be \\"soft\\" to those who are of \\"goth\\" persona.....but the minute I played this album I could not turn it off. It's emotional yet disturbing at the same time. Amy Lee's vocals are amazing. The lyrics speak for themselves. Oh they are not to be compared to Linkin Park with a female vocal...not even in the same category. Evanescence has made a breakthrough album especially withe the single \\"bring me to life\\" which pretty much sets the tone for what the whole album is like. songs like \\"Hello\\" and \\"Going Under\\" are timeless. They are here to stay! Rock on!
B000031EGV|4.0|This movie is about a board game gone wild (literally!).  It's a fun fantasy-land in the &quot;real world&quot; that becomes frightening with a hunter that hunts people, rhinos that trample cars, and spiders that are almost human size (I still have to close my eyes at that part!).  There is some element of romance, but it's primarily a comic adventure.  Just stay away from any board games that play conga drums!
B00005JMK6|5.0|\\"The Spanish Apartment\\" (L'Auberge Espagnole) is what Xavier is in desperate need of when he arrives in Barcelona to study Spanish and to immerse himself in the culture so as to follow his father's footstep and become a Bureaucrat in a Paris-based firm that deals primarily with the Spanish.And what he finds is more than a proficiency in the Spanish language of course, he finds Love, he finds what appears to be lifelong friendship with his six roommates who come from all over Europe and ultimately...he finds himself. \\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" then is about finding out, after twelve years of schooling, after listening to the where/the why's/the who's from a host of teachers...who we are, who is our core self, what are our dreams, what will we make of our lives?Pretty basic stuff, n'est pas? But director Cedric Klapisch has fashioned this film in such a way and inhabited it with such interesting and winning actors/characters that we are fascinated and entertained. It is a sunny, compassionate film without one mean bone in its body.\\"The Spanish Apartment\\" deals with the serious issues of relationships and self-realization. Klapisch has just chosen to present them in a truthful, emotionally available, particularly French and slyly humorous manner.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|The possibility of time travel has always fascinated me, yet I was pretty bored for a good portion of the movie.  There wasn't much character development, and the plot lacked substance.  I was not &quot;on the edge of my seat,&quot; even when there was some action and danger.  I found myself analyzing how (un)realistic some of the special effects were (&quot;wow that time lapse is way off&quot;), and how they were done. This is a sign of a fairly boring movie.  Still, the special effects were decent, and there was somewhat of a story line you could follow if the movie held your interest long enough.
B00005YUPO|4.0|My baby enjoys this video as well.  However, it doesn't have as many of the moving toys & puppets that Mozart has.  My child enjoys this but loves Mozart.  This is good but, could do without Julie Clarks video clips of her children.  It feels too home video with the unintegrated shots of her children.  Music is wonderful and clips with moving toys and puppets are wonderful.
B00000ICD9|5.0|Don't let the fact that Robin Williams is in this movie fool you into thinking that this is a comedy, it's far from it.  This movie is a swirl of romance, sadness, art, and philosophy.<br />The visual effects were excellent and made me almost believe that such a world existed -- I wanted to be a part of it.  Be prepared for an emotional roller coaster when you watch it -- it's best viewed with a significant other.<br />The DVD also provided &quot;alternate endings&quot; -- I'm very glad they chose the original ending.

6303407188|5.0|Doubtlessly the most underrated and misunderstood movie in this brilliant director's career - look, it isn't even available on DVD yet! - Ed Wood is one of Tim Burton's best movies, right up there with his four timeless masterpieces - Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman. It's very different from anything else he's done before, though. Even the music is different - it was composed by Howard Shore (`The Lord Of The Rings') instead of Tim's regular partner since the beginning, the brilliant Danny Elfman. Few of Burton's beloved motifs are to be found here. I think the reason is that he meant for Ed Wood to look like an Ed Wood film rather than a Tim Burton film - and it works, down to the black & white and the cheesy dialogue. It's a camp masterpiece, and essential for Burton fans.<br />Granted, Tim's choice of subject matter for this film - a biography of the worst director in history - may seem odd, but then again he was never the kind of director who repeats himself (except for the excellent Batman Returns, of course). And in his skilled hands, the rather messy storyline makes for a wonderful comedy that is absolutely hilarious - but also, at times, touching. The character of Edward Wood (played skillfully by the one and only Johnny Depp) is so absolutely pathetic that he can really get to you - his incredible ambition even at the face of repeating failure (\\"...The worst movie you ever saw? Well, my next one will be even better!\\"), his childish enthusiasm, his absolute assurance in his `vision' (his wonderful dialogue with Orson Wells) and lack of patience to get it done with (he does one take for every shoot) and his fondness for women's clothing make him a unique and lovely character, and in Johnny's hands he is brought back to life.<br />The rest of the cast is also wonderful, and a great deal effort was put into choosing actors as similar as possible to the real people they're portraying. Best of all is of course the wonderful Martin Landau who does fantastic job as horror superstar Bela Lugosi. Jeffery Jones as Criswell, Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, pro-wrestler George `The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller, as well as all the rest, are terrific. I recommend seeing at least one of Ed Wood's films (preferably `Bride of the Monster' or `Plan 9 from Outer Space') before watching Ed Wood, and that would give you a much better perspective at the film and the characters. In any case Ed Wood is well worth watching if you can get your hands on a VHS copy, and let me know if someone gets the brains to release it on DVD.
B00008RH1H|5.0|This is another wonderful film by Akira Kurosawa. We must remember that this film is an adaptation of Shakesphere's MacBeth, not a literal translation. Kurosawa was primarily interested in the general plot of MacBeth and adapted that to the classic Japanese Noh style of theater. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend a comparison for any purpose other than as a purely entertaining one. This isn't Shakesphere, this is Kurosawa (but borrowing a basic storyline from Shakesphere because it happens to be good)!<br />This is also one of Aikra Kurosawa's most experimental films, and in this reviewer's opinion, is a very successful experiment indeed! The elements work, not just for a Japanese audience familiar to Noh, but to anyone from any culture of any age. This is also a fairly accesible movie for fans of all ages. The violence is theatric and underdone, and there really is no strong sexual content or situations, and like all great stories, this one also has a moral lesson at the end.<br />Coming off the huge International success of \\"Seven Samurai\\", Akira Kurosawa was given a huge budget and obviously felt the urge and had creative the freedom to experiment with style to a large degree, and that is apprarent in this movie.<br />The DVD transfer is great - very little dust & scratches and the picture is a pure black & white 1.33:1 fullscreen aspect ratio. There is also a brilliant commentary track by a Japanese film expert that gives wonderful insight into this fascinating and dark film. Criterion has done an excellent job yet again!<BR>I could not recommend this brilliant classic more. Worth every penny.
0553274503|5.0|Daniel Keyesfs Flowers for Algernon is a science fiction narrative that was originally written as a short story in 1959 then expanded into a novel in 1966.   The novel takes place in New York City.  In this essay, I will give a literary analysis and criticism of the novel.    <br />The novelfs protagonist and narrator Charlie Gordon is a mentally [handicapped]thirty-three year old man.  He works in a bakery and is always mocked by the other workers because he behaves like a child, having difficulty understanding, manipulating, and communicating information.  Charlie is determined to become smart to have people like him and become his friend. <br />His wish comes true when a group of scientists gives him an experimental surgery to improve his intelligence. As a result Charlie increases his IQ from 68 to 185.  At first Charlie is thrilled to be able to read and to work more efficiently at the bakery.  However, he starts to see the cruel reality.  He realizes how all the workers of the bakery used to terribly make fun of him and how he was never their friend.  In addition, he realizes how now everyone resented him even more than they did before because he became smarter.  The biggest surprise was at the Chicago psychology convention.  He discovers that this change in intelligence might not be permanent.  This makes him leave the conference and escape to New York, facing the outside world by himself.  <br />The theme of the novel describes what happiness is really about.  In the novel, the scientists say that when Charlie first came to them he was outside of society, alone in a great city without friends or relatives to care about him, and living a miserable life.  That is not necessarily true.  Charlie probably had a better and happier life before he became smart because he did not know the horrible side of humans with envy, hatred, lies, and apathy. The worst part is the Charlie discovered he had some of those features in himself.  At one point in the novel, he becomes like the bakery workers that treated him poorly, and makes everyone else feel inferior. <br />The theme of the book is really important because it is saying that a personfs happiness has nothing to do with intelligence.  Just because a person is mentally [handicapped] does not mean that he or she cannot live a happy meaningful life.  They explain this throughout the entire novel.  I would definitely recommend Flowers for Algernon for young adults.  Itfs a great novel!
B00008OWZC|5.0|AWESOME!! I wish I had been older in those days and seen this GREAT band in there hey day.... was way too young to know who they were.. I guess I can close my eyes and imagine what a Led Zepppelin concert would have been like back then.. Great CD.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Dont forget to buy the DVD too......
B00003CY6M|3.0|While this movie is clearly a chick-flick, it's not completely offensive as compared to other such dross.<br />(I don't know what the deal is with John Cusack, but his movies seem to be big hits with the ladies.)<br />This DVD would make a very good present for your girlfriend or wife, and you won't completely hate it when you are forced to watch it.
0679409866|3.0|Published a few years after the acclaimed PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this novel paints an intimate portrait of country gentry in<BR>early 19th century England.  Describing the social milieus with which she was so familiar, Austen alternates the plot development between modest estates and the seaside resorts of Lyme and Bath. Travel aand communication proved serious obstacles, so letters and notes were the more prized and preserved. Austen weaves a tapestry of strict social customs,<BR>explaining the value of keeping up appearances, of keeping one's place--which was clearly deliniated by time-honored class snobbery and ritual.  Other themes which are quietly included:<BR>be wary of schemers, evaluate the counsel of interfering extended famly, and do not trust superficial impressions.  <br /><BR>Narrated in the usual third person, ths intense story revolves around Anne Elliot, the middle daughter of vain but impoverished Sir Walter. The author might well have chosen to make this a first person novel, since we always know what the modest<BR>protagonist is doing, feeling and thinking. Austen gently ridicules the struggle between vanity and financial reality, as the family's streightened circumstances obliged them to rent out their beloved Kellynch Hall and take rooms in Bath. But where to find suitable tenants for the ancestral home? Their circle includes the neighboring Musgroves, whose son married the youngest Elliot daughter.  Fortunately for the marriageable<BR>girls, their limited horizons are expandaded by the arrival of three young naval captains--one of whom Anne was forced to renounce 7 years before. She represents the first victim of<BR>of the art of familial persuasion. Yet her heart still beats fast at the mention of his name...  <br />  Austen presents many themes and events which also appear in her signature novel; she deftly reveals a woman's intimate understanding of her heroine's private torment.  The social ritual between country gentry is almost ridiculousin their extreme scruples regarding proper behavior--even to their own relatives and in-laws.  Austen exposes the time-honored web of duty an public behavior, even on vacation.  One wonders if the women of Austen's day were taught--direclty or indirectly--to value their own &quot;nothingness,&quot; as Anne puts it.  Is a teachable heart (one that can be persuaded to reason, even in violation of its natural instincts, to be admired in that society?  Or in our own time? Were Austen's women true Victorian ladies or more rational creatures than <BR>male authors of the time generally portrayed them? Anne pounced upon the eternal argument which provoked the denouement: which of the genders is more (or less) &quot;inconstant.&quot;  These and many other soul-searching issues are elucidated in this short novel (225 pages) which should be evaluated by the standards of a by-gone era.  Thoughtful readers must discern for themselves which truths are valid for all times; if they prove universal, then the work is a true classic.  An insightful novel which will appeal to most caring women.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I saw Chicago in the Theatre two days after it came out. I have been a fan of Chicago the musical for years. I really loved this film. I do wish they had not cut a few songs and hide some of the secrets. I did really enjoy Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma and Richard as Billy (even though I normally hate him). The show stealers for me were John C. Reily and Queen Latifah. I do not think this is the greatest musical movie of all times, but is a good one. If you love musical theatre try listening to the London Cast Revival with Ute Lemper as Velma and Ruthie Henshall as Roxie. They are both truely amazing. The Broadway Revival cast with Bebe Neuwirth as Velma is supurb too. If you like musical theatre...you will LOVE Chicago!!!
B000002KCC|5.0|According to Young's late-great producer, David Briggs, this is the \\"water-downed\\" version of what really happened. At the time, Briggs said Neil kind of wussed out on the full length version & preened things down. So somewhere out there lies the whole story. Collecting dust. That being said, welcome to Neil Young's darkest hour. Coming off the heels of \\"Harvest\\" this one kinda freaked those San Francisco Hippies out. On the subsequent tour they were expecting \\"Heart Of Gold\\". What they got was a jabbering, Tequila swilling mad man in a \\"Tinkerbell\\" T-shirt. Inbetween songs he'd scream stuff like, \\"Bruce, you stole his guitar & put it in your arm!\\". For Young the 60's were over. As if tunes like \\"Roll Another Number\\" don't go to show. Pot had given way to smack. Suffice it to say, the record was panned. But Young maintains it's his best album. I agree. Nearly 30 years later, not one sloppy note sounds dated or premeditated.<br />The opening title track starts off with a drunken plunk on the piano. Then there's that ominous bass followed by Young's haggard chant. Taking the dope addled death of a young roadie to epic proportions. \\"Speaking Out\\" marks the first time Young ever calls for a solo & Nils Lofgren rubs one out that I'll never forget. \\"Borrowed Tune\\" is one of the bleakest, most gut wrenching performances Young has ever cut. The punchline, \\"I'm singing this borrowed tune/I took from the Rolling Stones/Alone in this empty room/Too wasted to write my own\\", says it all.<br />The next thing you hear is the voice of Danny Whitten. Crazy Horse's belated guitarist. Another nameless O.D. Rising up from the grave to pour his heart out. You can hear Neil in the background but it's Whitten's show. That boy could sure as hell sing. Next to Lou Reed's \\"Waiting For My Man\\" is one of the most gleeful songs about scoring I've ever heard.<br />Young's sounds at the end of his tether on \\"Mellow My Mind\\". He sounds so raw, so choked up, he can barely sing. But \\"Roll Another Number\\" might just serve as the death knell for the  60's. An infectious anthem. It's lyrics are dead on, talking about some \\"open hearted people going down\\". What's truelly scary is that the lyrics were completely improvised on the spot.<br />The jewel in the crown though is, \\"Tired Eyes\\". I've never heard Young sing this onstage. Listening to this, I can understand why. You just can't top it. For my money, it's Young's best song.It made a fan out of me. He sounds like he's been in the interrogation room for 3 days straight.<br />All rhetoric aside, no album is worth it's spit unless it relates to you on personal level. When I first heard it, I didn't know about dope much less who Danny Whitten or Bruce Berry were.  But this record just kinda punched me in the gut & made me see stars. It made me cry & gave me hope. In other words, it made a \\"waterface\\" out of me.mber\\" might just serve as the death knell for the  60's. An infectious anthem.

038572179X|3.0|After hearing so much, I read this book, but found it extremely gloomy and difficult to finish. I did not care much for any of the main characters nor what happened to them. The most compelling part of the book was the description of experiences during the Second World War. There are far better ways to learn about that era than reading this book, however.
B00005JM03|5.0|I loved the film....it was fast-paced and although sometimes the trailer shows the whole movie, I love the technology, Seth Green was great....and I really liked Mark Wahlberg's anchoring role.  I highly recommend this movie and the biggest star of the movie, the minnie cooper should sell not only the movie, but the car!

B00008OWZC|5.0|Being a fan who only within the last 7 months began to get into Led Zeppelin it was not hard to realize why they're probably all of the sudden one of if not my favorite - in each and every performance they radiate such raw, intense energy and emotion. This album is one of those you can listen to over and over. Few could come close to such fantastic musicianship, talent, creativity, enthusiasm, drive, appeal...it goes on and this is all demonstrated in this set. Being among those in my generation who never got to live in the heyday of Zeppelin, an album like this and the concurrently released DVD is the closest I'll ever come to experience what it was like to experience something so phenomenal. You really feel something different when you listen to Zeppelin and it's nothing like I've felt before.
B00008G9JO|5.0|The one-star reviews of this album are simply baffling. This album answered the brainless critical accusations that Tull was &quot;pretentious&quot; with an album of unassuming, yet technically proficient, songs. Yes, SONGS -- not epics, not experiments, just finely crafted tunes with poignant, touching lyrics, all in the distinctive Tull style. That style is often imitated, but never quite matched by anyone else.<br />Anderson's voice is not appreciably different from the way it sounds on earlier offerings; his voice did fall off (much) later, but not here. In fact, I challenge anybody to hit every note of &quot;No Lullaby&quot; without bruising vocal chords. And the harmonies on the title track are stunning.<br />There's a lot more to this album if you're willing to listen closely. It weaves in and out of an astonishing array of diverse musical sources. In the process, it ranges from the sublimely silly (&quot;The Mouse Police Never Sleeps&quot;), the movingly nostalgic (title cut), the brilliantly simple (&quot;One Brown Mouse,&quot; &quot;Moths&quot;), and the stunningly intense (&quot;Weathercock&quot;).

B000092Q7O|5.0|Now, I obviously see a lot of comparisons of The Pianist to The Schindler's List. These are probably only two images of holocaust Americans seem to have been exposed to on the silver screen so no wonder (which in itself is pretty sad). Not going into the discussion which one is closest to the historical reality, one must say that these are two very different movies despite the subject matter. They are different because the directors are different. Look at Polanski's movies, especially his best early period (to name Knife in the Water at least). Polanski is an observer of the reality. Yes, think of this lonely child wondering the streets and trying to survive like he did and looking at the world with attention and sometimes fear. That really is reflected in his movies. He is a great documentarian so to speak of the story he tells us about. He does not develop the characters, does not go into their motivations and internal struggles. He lets us observe. That is why he maybe critisized for being removed from the story and \\"cold.\\" I disagree. I love Polanski and I love a lot of his movies (and hate a lot of them as well) but he has a certain way of telling the story. From this perspective, \\"The Pianist\\" is great. And obviously I loved the fact that unlike so many American movies, this is a movie about a regular person, not a hero, not a bad guy but someone just like you or me (yes, a great pianist of course!) a decent person trying to survive the madness and horror of history - being helped and being screwed by others at the same time. In this way he is an everyman. I did enjoy that. I did enjoy the portrayal of Warsaw (the city I was born and raised in and which was leveled be the Nazis - and by the way, he was the only director who ever thanked people of Warsaw for their patience during the shooting as many streets had to be closed) but I was not thrilled by the cinematography. But yet again, this is not his style. He is not a Gone-With-The-Wind-larger-than-life imagery. This is again not a review of Schindler's List but comparisons are inevitable. SL, which I give 5 stars as well and make it a must see movie as well, is much more of an American picture. There has to be a \\"human spirit prevails\\" and happy ending and some long unrealistic speaches etc ect. That's the target audience and that's what they are used to. They look for closure and something uplifting. I can understand that. Besides that SL, while being very different from The Pianist, is a great movie. It has a phenomenal cinematography (I just can't wait for a DVD release, what's up with that?!), some breathtaking and powerful moments and most of all great character development. Ralph Finnes role is a masterpiece of its own. He is so incredibly believeble and horrifying. The change happening in Schindler. SL pays more attention to detail, makes better use of terrain and supporting characters. All this makes for a great movie. Yet, a movie very much in a hollywood style. It uses points to get the message, The Pianist is much more linear in conveying the story (should we say as life is...). That is why some may criticize it as being monotoneous. Well, if it is, so are our lives. Definitely the best movie of the year (which means nothing considering the competition). Go see it and judge it for yourself. Now I expect some bad movie from Mr. Polanski. He seems to be true to this good/bad/good pattern for years now.
B00006879E|4.0|Found this CD on Amazon. 3 Doors Down, Train and Incubus' Morning View are three of my favorite bands. I was looking for something similar and was very impressed with the sound clips from \\"Songs About Jane\\".  (Granian and Pay the Girl are a couple others that sounded good online).<br />I must say I was a little disappointed when I got this CD. After listening to Songs About Jane a couple times I popped in my favs to compare and help put my finger on the difference. I'm not a musician but these guys obviously have some real skills. However I'd have to say Maroon 5's CD sound is kind of \\"thin\\" in comparison. The attacks are precise, the notes are right on (unusually so for a rock band), yet it sounds more like it was generated by a computer than by living breathing singers and guitar players. Not just the expression in the playing, but it also sounds like a few very precise notes - rather than a richer deeper sound of these other bands. The expressiveness depends on the band members, but maybe they'd at least have a richer sound with different instruments or recording equipment/mixing in the future?<br />Still I'd easily give them four stars and I'll definitely be playing them over and over again.
B000002TQV|5.0|To try to put it simply...listen to it all the way thru...it is BIG music. It is thick, layered, and textured. It surrounds you and pulls you in. <br />Fake Plastic Trees is the highlight, if I can pick one.
B00000K0DV|1.0|I could hardly stand to watch this garbage.  A serial killer bumps off attractive women (they're Italian, so attractiveness is almost a given) with various bladed implements, while talking like Donald Duck.  I kid you not.  If that's entertainment I'd rather watch F Troop until my brain becomes oatmeal.  It is unnervingly gory but so sleazy overall that nothing positive can come out of the experience of watching this junk.  Avoid if you have any shred of decency.
B000002B7M|5.0|I was addicted to this CD along with Diary of a Madman when I was in Junior High School although I was listening to cassettes at the time.  I had forgotten how good these recordings actually were until I ordered the remastered versions on CD.  Randy Rhoads, even though he only contributed to two albums due to a sudden and tragic death, should be considered as one of the best guitarists ever to grace the planet.  His classical training is evident on these recordings and it is magical how it blends with Ozzy's heavy style.  Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman are by far Ozzy's best solo projects although he does have the knack of finding great guitarists. (Jake E. Lee, Zakk Wylde) Long Live Randy Rhoads and I sincerely hope he is never forgotten!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|This album restores my faith in rock and roll.  Fabulous recording of the greatest band period.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Now, I obviously see a lot of comparisons of The Pianist to The Schindler's List. These are probably only two images of holocaust Americans seem to have been exposed to on the silver screen so no wonder (which in itself is pretty sad). Not going into the discussion which one is closest to the historical reality, one must say that these are two very different movies despite the subject matter. They are different because the directors are different. Look at Polanski's movies, especially his best early period (to name Knife in the Water at least). Polanski is an observer of the reality. Yes, think of this lonely child wondering the streets and trying to survive like he did and looking at the world with attention and sometimes fear. That really is reflected in his movies. He is a great documentarian so to speak of the story he tells us about. He does not develop the characters, does not go into their motivations and internal struggles. He lets us observe. That is why he maybe critisized for being removed from the story and \\"cold.\\" I disagree. I love Polanski and I love a lot of his movies (and hate a lot of them as well) but he has a certain way of telling the story. From this perspective, \\"The Pianist\\" is great. And obviously I loved the fact that unlike so many American movies, this is a movie about a regular person, not a hero, not a bad guy but someone just like you or me (yes, a great pianist of course!) a decent person trying to survive the madness and horror of history - being helped and being screwed by others at the same time. In this way he is an everyman. I did enjoy that. I did enjoy the portrayal of Warsaw (the city I was born and raised in and which was leveled be the Nazis - and by the way, he was the only director who ever thanked people of Warsaw for their patience during the shooting as many streets had to be closed) but I was not thrilled by the cinematography. But yet again, this is not his style. He is not a Gone-With-The-Wind-larger-than-life imagery. This is again not a review of Schindler's List but comparisons are inevitable. SL, which I give 5 stars as well and make it a must see movie as well, is much more of an American picture. There has to be a \\"human spirit prevails\\" and happy ending and some long unrealistic speaches etc ect. That's the target audience and that's what they are used to. They look for closure and something uplifting. I can understand that. Besides that SL, while being very different from The Pianist, is a great movie. It has a phenomenal cinematography (I just can't wait for a DVD release, what's up with that?!), some breathtaking and powerful moments and most of all great character development. Ralph Finnes role is a masterpiece of its own. He is so incredibly believeble and horrifying. The change happening in Schindler. SL pays more attention to detail, makes better use of terrain and supporting characters. All this makes for a great movie. Yet, a movie very much in a hollywood style. It uses points to get the message, The Pianist is much more linear in conveying the story (should we say as life is...). That is why some may criticize it as being monotoneous. Well, if it is, so are our lives. Definitely the best movie of the year (which means nothing considering the competition). Go see it and judge it for yourself. Now I expect some bad movie from Mr. Polanski. He seems to be true to this good/bad/good pattern for years now.
0316234753|5.0|Those wretched art classes to which we were all subjected as children left me in daily agony - and of course wouldn't my older sister just have to be a spectacularly gifted artist.  My mother took pity on my suffering and bought me this wonderful book when I was six. It was a balm to my artistic handicap and an immeasurable boost to my confidence when I finally drew the dragon!  Looking back now, I believe that Mr. Emberley's books would benefit any child, whether naturally artistic or crying over watercolor class.  In an era when children's imaginations are saturated with Disney and TV cartoon notions of art, Mr. Emberley can give them simple tools with which to carve a path back to their own creativity.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Finally, seven years after being originally issued and this harder-to-find than world peace, this box set has made a comeback, certain to get everyone to get up, stand up and boogie. The 78 tracks, showcased on four discs, detail the rise of the reggae master, and the mon who still influences musicians today.
B000094DUP|4.0|Don't be fooled that just because she is from 'Neighbours', that she'll follow <br />Holly Valance, Kylie Minogue, Natalie Imbruglia <br />This girl has got dreams and knows where she's going. She wants to be a the Grammys one day, and i say there is a chance! <BR>The young singer/song-writer/performer/pianist/actress' debut is surprisingly refreshing. <br />It features a very positive ballad -#1 in Oz -\\"Born To Try\\" and <BR>also #1 in Oz \\"Lost Without You\\" as well as now: <BR>#1 in Oz: \\"Innocent Eyes\\" as well as the album forever in the number one position/Top 10. <br />The 3rd single will be \\"Innocent Eyes\\" which is a rock ballad, and is a very different Pop Song. Other hot picks on the CD besides the singles are: <br />Not Me, No I <BR>Predictable <BR>Butterfly <BR>In My Own Time <BR>Longer <BR>This Is Not Me <br />Watch out for Delta she'll capture you. She's already won the hearts of Australia.<BR>Really sad news that she's been diagnosed with Cancer. <br />+the only bad thing about this Cd is that my friends all try and borrow it. Tight-... .
B00007KQA3|4.0|Let me start by stating that the transfer on this disc is right on the money, revealing every gritty detail in the London of 1984 (both story-wise and, in fact, also when and where this movie was filmed)<BR>Orwell's 1984 contains a message for us all, and on the day this film is banned - worry.<BR>This is one of my staple films that I like to come back to every year or so, and it's an excellent adaptation of Orwell's novel (unlike the 1954 version that I once purchased out of curiousity).<br />Everything in Winston Smith's London has a poverty that rival's Moscow's during the Cold War, and the element of dread of the opressive INGSOC government and the Thought Police is conveyed perfectly!<BR>I was quite pleased that this film had finally made it to DVD, but discovered much to my chagrin that the soundtrack wasn't the same one that I had been accustomed to hearing in all these years of seeing this film.<BR>The soundtrack that is on the VHS and premium-cable version of the film was performed by the Eurythmics, and in my opinion enhanced the surreal feeling of dread and hopelessness that is at the core of this film.<BR>On the disc, however, is the score that the director originally wanted - in the 80's it was replaced with the Eurythmics soundtrack in the American theatrical and video releases to make it more &quot;marketable&quot;.<BR>I could understand if perhaps the disc could have contained alternate soundtrack options - since this is a bare-bones disc that wouldn't have been too difficult, I imagine, but unfortunately we don't get a choice.<BR>I'm not saying the score the director preferred is necessarily inferior - simply that, after years and years of watching this film, my mind associates certain scenes with certain scores, and now that all that is changed...well, I guess the only thing I can do is play my VHS recording of the film while watching the DVD picture.<BR>We should have been given a choice in soundtracks, as Universal did with Legend.

0385504209|3.0|I loved the first third of this book, with its intricate twists and fascinating look at art and the Louvre and Paris and the depth of research into the history of the Catholic Church.  But then it just started getting to be too much; too many details, too many symbols, too many cliffhangers until I found myself exhausted by it all, yet still racing through it just to see how it would be resolved - but it really wasn't worth the race.<br />The curator of the Louvre is found murdered in a locked room, so to speak - and in a macabre start, leaves clues drawn in his own blood, including the name Robert Langdon.  Langdon is a professor from Harvard visiting Paris to give a lecture on religious symbolism, and coincidentally had an appointment with the murder victim, who of course failed to show.  The victim's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, is a cryptographer with the Paris equivalent of the F.B.I. but the two of them become the chief suspects in the murder.  Their only hope is to solve it themselves, but with the cops hot on their tail they have to stay one step ahead as they race their way through France, then England, in this complex yet ultimately disappointing thriller.
B0000542D1|4.0|I first saw this when I was 11 (in 1975) and went through my own phase of Bay-tel mania as a result. The music is fresh and clean and the Fab 4 are quite appealing. The interview is a scream! (&quot;What do you call your hairstyle?&quot; answer-&quot;Arthur.&quot;). Ringo's forlorn walk through the streets to the tune of &quot;This Boy&quot; made this tune run through my head everytime I took a solitary walk for years. The shabby teen show host who tries unsuccessfully to exploit George Harrison rings all too true even today (one can picture this guy as an MTV-American Idol excec). The &quot;clean old man&quot; gives the picture added dimension.<br />However, today's kids might be baffled by the whole thing, and the Fab 4's thick accents require repeated viewing for most people. But it does seem to appeal to the kid in a lot of people with the Bay-tels' freewheeling attitudes and the excitement surrounding their music. Sort of explains the whole phenomenon of Bay-tel mania.
B000003S0B|5.0|That's how I first heard King Crimson's sound described back in the early 70s. I think it's a good description. I'm most partial to this album because it was the first one I bought. Most Amazon buyers are kind to it but the 'expert' reviewers seem to think it is somehow a pale imitation of the first album. I like to see it as simply a continuation of the first. If you like Court you will certainly find much to enjoy here. Yes the sound is similar on many of the songs. Rather than see that as negative I think it just doubles the pleasure. Fripp has never done any two of his other projects quite the same. The beginning of it all is a special treat for those of us who like the earliest version the best.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead abruptly abandoned the majestic guitar driven music after OK Computer and released the electronic driven Kid A in 2000.  Some fans were appalled while others could appreciate the band's new direction.  People hoping for a return to rock will be disappointed as there is a large share of electronic tunes on Amnesiac.  The album's songs were actually recorded in the same time period as Kid A's, so both albums go hand in hand.  Amnesiac, however, is more earthy and conventional than Kid A, but most definitely in the same vein as its predecessor.  Some of Radiohead's best songs are contained within this CD, making it essential for any fan of the Kid A based material.<br />Pyramid Song is a haunting piano waltz with dark lyrics, and when the words are draped across the music the song creates an atmosphere that is both frightening and soothing at the same time.  Truly one of the best songs ever recorded by the Radiohead camp.  You And Whose Army is another stunner, beginning with sparse chords and climaxing to an anthemic finale all within 3 minutes.  Knives Out is a killer track as well with its amazing guitar line and great vocals.  Unfortunately, the heights scaled within the first 6 tracks are never again reached, although Life in a Glass House comes pretty close.  The electronic songs are interesting as well, including Packt Like Sardines and the acquired listen of Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors.  Unfortunately, a Radiohead-like level of quality is not present on all of the album.  The Morning Bell remix is an uninteresting and pointless take on the Kid A classic and Hunting Bears is even more pointless as it consists of only a jagged guitar line repeated over and over against random sound effects.  <br />One is left with mixed feelings towards this album, but the good material outweighs the bad and results in an interesting listen.  The problem is, all other Radiohead CDs have been ENJOYABLE listens.  While the first half of Amnesiac ranks among Radiohead's best, the latter is lacking.  Radiohead could have created a masterpiece on the level of OK Computer had they condensed Kid A and Amnesiac into one album and cut off the filler.  What we're left with though, are two good but disjointed albums that don't provide the level of satisfaction as The Bends or OK Computer did.
6305127697|5.0|This movie is truly one of a kind.  It is by far my all time favorite movie.  By the end of the movie you think you have it all figured out but then the jaw-dropping end comes out and everything you thought or believed is completely wrong.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This movie is definitely one of the best comedies ever made!  Anyone that went to college and partied or dreamed about partying will enjoy this.  It also appeals to those people who go to work every day and live a plain life, yet daydream about being carless.  The comedy is somewhat sexual, but definitely a good laugh for audiences mature enough to handle it, but immature enough to appreciate it.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out!
B00005JKCH|3.0|there were alot of mitakes were u can tell they cut stuff out. and the part where...Norman was talkin to himself in the mirror...look at his hair in the mirror and than at him. its different. and parts of the scene were there havin a thanksgiving dinner, some parts MJ's arms up. some there down. when MJ and spiderman kiss in the rain and she pulls his mask up they edit it so its all the way before she does it all. and other stuff like that when Spiderman goes back to his place after the fire scene and he jumps on the balcony but next we see him takin off his mask and hes IN his room. other part was back at the kissin scene between MJ and spiderman. when he hangs upside down and shes lookin 4 him, shes walkin towards him and next second she turned and is starin at him. she wasnt even close enough to him to be directly in front of him. another mistakes.<br />there are stupid parts like the fire scene and the wresting scene. Peter's aunt n uncle are sure old.<br />only see it once. its good than. more than that it gets stupid. Props to MJ's red hair. its great
0062502182|1.0|Having read what other people have to say I think I know why this insignificant book enjoys the distinction of having almost 500 reviews! Most are not descriptions of the book - they are descriptions of how readers felt after reading it! Well, let me tell you how it made me feel: *Angry*. Now let me tell you why: it is trite, paternalistic, sexist and repetitive. Unlike most of those who comment positively I will justify my opinion.<br />This book tells the story of a young shepherd from Andalusia who decides to sell his flock and pursue his dream of finding a treasure hidden in the Pyramids. After many adventures through North Africa (he even faces death at some point!) he succeeds. What makes the book *Trite* is not just the fact that its narrative is an unoriginal amalgamation of other people's tales. It is its moral teachings. They are no more than rehashed words of `wisdom' you have read a million times before. The basic teaching of `follow your heart' in particular is to be found in countless other works - notwithstanding the Bible itself. While other authors at least try to validate their thesis this Coelho adopts a `I'm into alchemy, I know best' attitude that smacks of sheer contempt to the reader's intelligence. Did I say paternalistic - make that *Condescending*! No one is spared, especially women. There are few in the story anyway, properly hidden from view attending to household chores while the men brandish their swords and ponder the secrets of the Universe. Somehow the hero manages to find one and fall in love with her (fittingly, a girl fetching water from a well...). He thinks about dropping his treasure hunt and staying with her but then decides to push on. And what does she do? She assures him she'll wait for him! How *Sexist* can you get?<br />To add insult to injury the book bridles with constant repetitions of its shallow albeit fashionable New Agey messages. I am convinced the author must think we are all certified ... who can't comprehend unless told a dozen times. Too bad a zero rating is not allowed. Even one star is too much for this blatant piece of commercial authorship.
0316666343|4.0|Interesting story. Once you get past the first 15 pages (which are the hardest) the novel slows down at some parts. The miracle that takes place at the end with Ray is a little weird and was the major bump in the road.  Good look at what people go through when a loved one dies, but it wasn't as good as its hype
B00005YXZH|5.0|I bought this record the day that it was released.   When I first listened to it, I was very intrigued, but I wasn't sure that I liked it.   I took that as a good sign.  In a time when most records are not interesting and are calculated for a carefully defined and determined market segment, records like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot are refreshing and needed.  <br />After subsequent listens, I knew that I loved this album.   I listened to it every day for several months.  There are layers to peel back on each song, from the lyrics to the fresh sonic presentations.  There are subtleties here to be relished.  This is an inventive and creative album and it's my top album of 2002.  More bands should be this brave and release records that they truly believe in.  Check out the film &quot;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart&quot; to see what went into this record.
B00008PX8P|4.0|The Royal Albert Hall footage is absolutely mesmerizing, and this is not only due to the audio/video quality. The impact of that particular concert is made all the more powerful because it is not marred by the speed cuts which plague the rest of the film. The second disc is extremely aggravating in that the MSG, Earl's Court, and Knebworth footage is almost sickening to watch. For example: a shot of Jimmy's guitar immediately cuts to a shot of Robert then to a shot of a fan then to a side shot of the stage, and so on. Before any real emotional tension can be built in one shot, it is cut away from. Whoever edited this (Carruthers?) should have followed the example of The Band's concert film \\"The Last Waltz\\". Scorcese knew how to compile his different camera angles so that the images would complement the music instead of getting in its way. Had the editing on the Zeppelin DVD been more graceful - rather than done in a frenetic MTV style - the footage would be far more enjoyable. I must say that there is some beautiful cinematography - especially for the MSG material - but again, the rapid cutting lessens the impact dramatically. For all of its problems, at least the Song Remains the Same movie didn't trigger epilepsy in its viewers.
6304806418|5.0|Evita is a very interesting musical; a hybrid between classical musicals and music videos.  A classic musical uses the song and dance numbers as a means to \\"make the point\\" of the scene presceeding the number, moving the narrative forward, and as a segway into the next part of the film.  In the case of EVITA, the song and dance IS the narrative, making it unique to the genre.  <BR>     EVITA is visualy stunning, elegant and somber.  Filmed in a sort of color sepia that works very well with the period.  The role of Eva Peron was indeed ment for Madonna, scince the film is basicaly the most [costly] and lavish music video ever filmed, who better than the best video actress of our generation to portray her?  Although Madonna can't seem to \\"be in the moment\\" when she acts in non-singing roles, once she hears and feels the music, like in her videos, she lets it possess and guide her emotionally beautifly with all the range and emotion required of beleivable acting.  I do hope she \\"gets it\\" one day, and not be as painfully self conscious when acting with out music.  <BR>     The overall tone of the movie is a bit lugubrious (It begins and ends with funerals) but worth watching.
B00005JM03|2.0|The preview give you all the cool action sequences so there isnt a lot of surprises. Norton and Wahlberg seems emotionless with their action. The more comedic scenes are with Seth Green. The best part has to be the soundtrack and the use of Pink Floyd.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Most fans of Billie Holiday don't care for her last works because her voice seemed to almost gone.  Holiday's last songs are the ones I love best because they're a direct line from her heart, full of honesty and soul.  Johnny Cash's latest CD, The Man Comes Around, strikes me in exactly the same way.  Cash's voice on this CD is not adorned by studio enhancements and tricks, but by the depths of his soul.  There is a morbidity to the CD, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, but there is also a life to it.  It's almost as if Cash is singing with one foot in the grave, while the other is firmly planted on the ground.  The honesty and fragility of Cash's voice is almost too much to bear at times.  But there are some movements on the CD that are so beautiful, they are almost overwhelming.  If you're looking for a lush voice, you may want to look elsewhere.  But if you want to be struck by the complete honesty of a great voice, mainlined from Cash's heart.  this may be the CD for you.
B000069AUI|5.0|When I heard \\"In My Place\\" I got totally hooked on Coldplay. The CD is worth every single last dime! I, also, enjoy \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Daylight\\". You have got to love this band. They are so sick!! <br />---Weird thing is that I don't really like alternative music, but Coldplay is a different story. In fact, my fav. type of music is rave, trance and house. But when I heard Coldplay, I was blown away. I think anyone, even with different tastes in music, will like them.
B00006F83Y|5.0|The Queens Of A Stone age have constintly put out great albums and this is an amazing albums amazing guitar riffs and basslines with Drums by Dave Grohl and amazing singing skill and lyrics a must for any rock fan. recommended songs are Go With The Flow, Gonna Leave You and No One Knows
0375422307|5.0|Challenged by reading traditional memoirs that only give you a vague sense of what it's like to live in a foreign land? Look no more! Marjane Satrapi's book about growing up during the Iranian revolution is engaging, witty, well drawn and something you'll finish in one sitting. Ms. Satrapi finds the common thread of everyone's childhood (her recollection of wanting to grow up to be a prophet is hilarious) but also expresses her unique voice and identity as the daughter of liberal Iranians whose views ended up being thwarted by the new regime that was ushered in following the 1979 revolution. Even if you don't have an interest in Iranian history/politics, I guarantee you'll love this book!
B00008OWZC|5.0|I've been a die-hard Led Zeppelin fan since High School, having collected all of their original releases early on, and more recently adding dozens of live bootleg shows to my catalog.  The quality of these bootlegs varies from unlistenable to pretty good - but this release really has the clarity and dynamic of sound that makes you feel like you are there.  It sounds as if it could have been recorded yesterday - really amazing.  The instruments are well-treated individually within the recording, which is absolutely essential since all four were masters of their respective instruments.  When you add them all together, well, the chemistry goes without saying - it's Beatle-esque.  We can thank Led Zeppelin for pushing the rock concert from a 20 minute set of playing songs note-for-note into a sprawling, exploring, total experience that often stretched 2 1/2 to 3 hours or more in their prime.  This release helps to make up for the paucity of official live material in the Zeppelin catalog and is a must-have for serious fans, as well as those just looking to get that flashback experience.  I'm looking forward to buying the new DVD as well to add the visual side to the experience.
B000003BEV|5.0|I hate to rain on the parade of all the Beat the Meatles fans out there, but everything in the music world of the late 60's ISN'T connected to their timeline. In the real world of the hippies, as a matter of fact, if you played a Beatles record in a real 60's crowd they would have kicked you out of the room.<BR>Now, on to this under appreciated masterpiece of stoned psychedlica. Given their R&amp;B and blues background, the Stones are the last group you would think of to even attempt to do a psychedelic album, but when we heard about it 35 years ago, everybody said &quot;Oh, wow, really? But they'd really GET stoned to do it, the Beatles would just sing about it.&quot; And they were right. But this is a musician's CD as well: listen to Bill Wyman's playing on 2000 Man or the unbelievable Citadel - he's in top form, as was Brian Jones on the same cuts. As for Bill singing on &quot;In Another Land&quot;, it's a STONER SONG, WHAT'S IT SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE? Perhaps the listener wasn't properly herbally or chemically prepared..<BR>It's a product of it's time, but again  IT ISN'T AN ANSWER ALBUM TO THE BEATLES. Those of us who were around during the Stones vs. Beatles era understand this heresy!<BR>PS: The song &quot;Sing This Song All Together&quot; was later used as the theme song for a children's program - wonder what was in the lunch snacks at THAT studio?
B00002EPJH|1.0|Jarrett was recovering from ME when he recorded these, and it shows. The standards (all ballads) are played simply and slowly, he uses conventional Bill Evans voicings, and none of his trade-mark lines. Moments of interest are very few and far between: moments of inspiration, non-existant. There's nothing to distinguish this playing from the average cocktail pianist's - that it's so popular is almost insulting to Jarrett's other work.
006092988X|5.0|This is my favorite book now, and will be for a long time to come....it reminded me of Angela's Ashes (Frank McCourt), the story of a young woman against the world. I loved reading all the descriptions (glad I haven't lived them) and watching Francie's experiences to the end. She is a character that wasn't, and-shouldn't, be perfect but one to cheer for. READ THIS!

B00006F2TV|5.0|I thought that this movie was great. The actors picked for this were great also. Tobey Maguire is was great as Peter Parker and Spider-man. If you have not see this movie see it. I can't wait for for the next one.
B000002J1H|5.0|Along with ELP Yes had a kind of sound that was almost a trademark. However,  if you are acquainted with Yes' first &quot;classical&quot; albuns (Fragile, Close to The Edge, Tales From Topographic Oceans, Relayer) and compare them with &quot;Going For The One&quot; you'll probably be quite shocked. Surely, the musical skills are all there, Jon Anderson's magnificent voice is there also, but the style changed. Radically. The sound is much more robust, punchy, contundent. It takes only two tracks to prove it. &quot;Going For The One&quot; swings like no other Yes work I ever heard. Howe plays like his influences were Stevie Ray Vaughn or even Hendrix. Wakeman sounds different, perhaps because of the use of different technologies in keyboards. The whole band rocks like it has never done before.  And it is Chris Squire, along with Wakeman that delivers what I think is the true masterpiece of this album: &quot;Paralells&quot;. Both musicians are simply phenomenal in this track. The use of a church organ and the continuos, obsessive organ riff turns a keyboard instrument almost into a percussive element. &quot;Paralells&quot; is powerfull, vital, almost like a tribal dance. Much has been said about &quot;Awaken&quot; but in my opinion &quot;Paralells&quot; stands as one of the most relevant contributions prog rock has ever made as an art form.<BR>In general there is not one single track of this album that could receive less than 5 stars. But these two tracks alone are worth 50 CDs of today's groups.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's place in musical history is already assured, even without this recording. Nevertheless, they have made a disc that reminds us why we loved them so much. True, they have aged, vocally, but they are still inspired and very talented writers and performers.
B000069AUI|5.0|oh wow, i can say that this CD keeps growing on me.  I passed the point that I actually like it more than Parachutes (which is a great CD in its own right).  Beautiful music with vocals and though-rich lyrics, make it a great combination to listen to.
6302453356|2.0|My son is obsessed with the Disney cartoon of Peter Pan, so it was natural that he would want to see this.  One of my joys with my kids is revisiting things that I loved at their age as well as discovering new things.  Unfortunately, though the incomparable Spielberg was involved, this film is wholly lacking in that indefinable magic that makes for greatness.  I found the whole thing flat, the acting poor to fair even with Robin Williams, and the attempt to add on to an wholly contained work of art a dimsal failure.  You shouldn't try to make a knockoff of something that stands perfectly on its own.  This is the worst that I ever saw in a Spielberg film.  The only things going for it are special effects and rollicking violence.<br />Not recommended.
B00000K2SC|5.0|THE BEST MOVIE EVER I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS IT'S THE BEST MOVIE
0060977493|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Arundati Roy's language is incomparable. The book is full of the most beautiful figurative language and symbolism that I found myself reading the sentences over and over. The story line is incredibly realistic and remarkably clever. I have read the book several times and I have recommended it to everybody I know. It is so beautifully written, and so artistically developed, I don't know how everyone doesn't have a copy.
B00003CWTI|5.0|A fantastic film full of creativity and wonder.  The performances delievered by Magnolia's cast far and away surpass any collective effort in recent memory.<br />Although I gave this film five stars, it's mainly due to a personal preference.  I can understand how someone may not \\"get\\" this movie, but for fans of art, Magnolia's a can't-miss.
0060920432|4.0|This is an excellent book on the happiness derived from achievement.  Anyone who is any good at something comes accross as self-actualized, driven, talented, fortunate.  This applies to Andre Agassi as well as Yoyo Ma.  Top performers in any field appear blessed by a destiny leading them to superior achievement and level of happiness.<br />To the author there is no secret.  All these super talented achievers live in 'flow.'  This is a psychological state where you are so fulfilled that you seem in a timeless, efortless dimention of play.  But, to the rest of the world you actually are really focused, training really hard, and really driven.  To you it is a piece of cake because you love what you are doing.<br />Find your own 'flow' activities.  And, see your own self actualization soar.
B000001G89|5.0|In my review of the Abbado CARMEN I forgot to mention one cast member:  Robert Lloyd in the secondary (and mostly spoken) role of Zuniga is a real standout, with his perfect French.  His performance only adds to the overall excellence of this CARMEN.
0767903374|5.0|This follow up to the book on the same subject is excellent.  By now, you know pretty much who you are.  If you are interested in this workbook you know that you are an HSP.<br />But, the workbook really drills down.  You will find that there are several types of HSPs with different levels of sensitivity depending on the life domain.  Some are more vulnerable in certain situations than the others.<br />Your self-awareness on the HSP scale is going to get much more in depth, much more refined, more 'sensitive' so to speak.  And, that is a very good think.  Life revolves around knowing thyself.
B00008PX8P|5.0|After sitting down for the last almost 3 hours to browse through the mountain of material on this release, I can say with all honesty that this is worth every penny. The true genius and craft of Led Zeppelin's 4 equally impressive members shines through like the sun. The only negative here would be for aspiring rock stars - to be intimidated like this must be tough. It would be virtually impossible for anyone to ever recreate the excitement and sense of wonder that Led Zeppelin could deliver on stage. Don't wait, buy a copy and get ready to be dazzled.
0553062182|5.0|My really enlightened HMO doctor recommended I read this book a few years ago.  It helped me a lot recognizing my psychological profile, my role in life, and how to treat and respect myself so as to function optimally in this rather challenging world of ours.<br />The author comes up with wonderful metaphors.  She places people in two broad buckets.  First, the King Warriors, these are the majority of the people accounting for roughly 80% of the population.  They are self assured, often loud, and thrive naturally in our macho world.  They are also risk takers.  And, allow our society to advance in all sorts of discipline.  So, as you can see, even though they may have some less than desireable qualities, they also make a very positive contribution to society.  The other 20% are the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP).  She calls them the King Advisors.  These people are not so self assured.  They are typically not risk takers.  But, their complex sensitive personalities give them a multi dimension ability to understand the world around them.  Thus, they are a source of judgment, wisdom, knowledge that is indispensable for society at large.  Thanks to them, the energy and risk daring of the King Warriors can be better optimized.  In other workds, society really needs both temperaments (King Warriors and King Advisors) to be fruitful and progress.<br />The author comes up with many other psycho analytical metaphors that you will love.  She also comes with recommendation on how HSPs should deal with doctors, workplace, and other occasional intense situations.  It is full of sound recommendation that will really feel right on the money if you are truly an HSP.
B00008F8HE|5.0|If you haven't purchased this album, you're stepping over a gem. I just love John &amp; Carlos. This is a great collaboration. What was created on this LP is magical. Great pioneers. It's a shame John gets not credit. He is one of the fastest guitar players, I've ever heard. The way he phrases is bone chilling. When I first listened to this CD, I was blown away. <br />A must have for a fan of Jazz, Rock or Fusion and someone who is studying guitar. These guys were ahead of their time.<br />Carlos &amp; John rocked this composition......<br />Nuff Said
B00005UWCV|4.0|Anastasia is a very good animated film - still worth four stars even though it does have a weak plot, obvious animation mistakes, and is historicaly inaccurate. <br />~PLOT & ANIMATION~<BR>The plot is weak to me because Anastasia was..oh, about 8 i think (in the movie only) when she fell off the train. She was 8 - and she doesn't remember anything? I know she likely suffered a concusion, but still. Also, she actually believes Dimitri has train tickets when they clearly say \\"CIRCUS\\" is bright letters. Altogether its just weak, and one more thing. Marie doesnt believe her at first until she recognizes her perfume. HER PERFUME? what? it could have been a very popular perfume at the time..it was PEPPERMINT! Anyways, the animation is good but the biggest mistake you will notice is when Pooka (the little dog she travels with) is crawling under the tablecloth at the Alexander Palace, look closely, he just runs through some invisible hole in the cloth. Good Movie and animation though - its still fun to watch!<br />~HISTORY~<BR>hmmm - where do I start, well lets see, i guess near the begining. Okay, so their all joyfull at their clebration of the Romanovs ruling for 300 years in Russia (good, that facts rite!). Anastasia is 7 or 8 and the Bolshiviks (well I assume they are, I will give FOX the credit and just assume) raid the palace (um - no the guards wouldve likely taken them out or demolished them to a fairly small size especially considering the year and the revolution was not as big as a riot as it later grew to be). The Dowager Empress Marie is with Anastasia, trying to escape and Dimitri lets them out. She boards a running train but falls off remebers nothing and is sent to an orphanage. (none of this ever happened. They were not raided at their 300th aniversary party and Anastasia had just turned 17 at the time of the Romanov family's excution.) Next - Marie is in Paris? (try Denmark - thats where she escaped to and lived the rest of her life) Now the major inaccuracy is that the real Romanovs lived under house arrest for 2 years until 1918 when they killed by Bolskivks in the cellar of the Empative House (i didnt spell that rite). Also, Raspution was not the villian, the bolshivk party and lenin were. Respution was kept near the palace to heal the Tsarvish (Alexis) from his Hemophilia. If you are looking for a book to read or a movie to watch for real info try Nicholas & Alexandra (both book and movie), The Romanovs: The Final Chapter, Anastasia's Album, and The Last Tsar. For kids I would recommend Anastasia's Album.<br />~OVERALL~<BR>good movie, buy it! its something you will want to watch more than once, try to find the animation thingys and the inaccuracys I pointed out.
0393057658|5.0|What a pleasure it was to see my favorite author, Michael Lewis, taking a hard look at my favorite subject, baseball. Lewis won me over w/ Liar's Poker a decade over, and I've been thrilled w/ his progress as a writer and his Crichton-like ability to master new subjects.<BR><BR>I found astonishing about this book was how Lewis could take a mathematical formula, OBP, and weave it w/ astonishing personal stories.

1564029654|5.0|I bought this book over two years ago, when my daughter was around 14 months and was just starting to visibly enjoy being read to.  Two years later she still pulls it off the shelf sometimes and asks me to read it (usually around bedtime).<br />The plot is appropriately simple:  Mama Owl goes out hunting for the night, and the three owl babies get progressively more worried and scared.  When they have almost sunk into despair, mom comes home.<br />The illustrations are beautiful.  Benson does an excellent job of evoking the fear of the wee owlets as they wait, and their exuberant joy upon mama's return.  They are a perfect companion to Waddell's writing.<br />Waddell makes good use of parallelism.  After a couple of readings, if you're child is verbal, expect her to be wailing \\"I want my mommy!\\" right along with you and baby Bill.  Also, despite the brevity and simple vocabulary, one gets a real sense of the different personalities of the owl babies.  As children's literature goes, this is a masterpiece.<br />Concurring with several other reviewers, I would agree that this is a great book to share with your kids if any of them suffer from separation anxiety.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As a long-time Led Zeppelin fan, I looked forward for months to the release of both _DVD_ and the new live 3-CD set, _How The West Was Won_. Accordingly I bought both on Tuesday when they hit local stores and watched the entire DVD immediately...<br />Disc one starts off with 142 minutes from a performance at Royal Albert Hall on January 9,1970 during which a young Led Zeppelin (Plant and Bonham are only 21 years old), fresh off the remarkable success of their first two LPs, pound out the bulk of their early live repertoire with astounding raw energy, not to mention remarkable confidence and poise for their age, to an very enthusiastic young crowd. The set begins like a freight train with \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" and moves like a tour de force through most of the early Zep classics as follows:<br />I Can't Quit You Babe/Dazed and Confused/White Summer (so far, my favorite from this gig)/What Is and What Should Never Be/How Many More Times/Moby Dick (complete with long drum solo)/Whole Lotta Love/Communication Breakdown/C'mon Everybody/Something Else/Bring It On Home. <br />This actually the entire show less \\"Heartbreaker\\" which was omitted as some footage was missing. Originally filmed for a BBC documentary, this performance was pro-shot on two 16mm cameras and features rather good camera work overall.<br />Disc one concludes with the 1969 promo for \\"Communication Breakdown\\" and three 1969 TV performances. First is a Danish show called `TV-Byen' where the band performs solid renditions of \\"Communication Breakdown,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" \\"Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You\\" (all electric) and \\"How Many More Times\\" to a small studio audience of seemingly shell-shocked young Danes. This is followed by a strong performance of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" on the British variety show `Supershow'. Finally, we see the boys on the French variety show `Tous En Scene', again performing \\"Communication Breakdown\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" but this time to a crowd of folks that seem mostly unable/unwilling to appreciate what they are seeing and hearing.<br />Disc two begins with a version of \\"Immigrant Song\\" that matches the audio from a 1972 performance in Long Beach, CA (this is the same version that starts out the new live CD) with a collage of video from the group's performance in Sydney, Australia earlier that year. The musical performance is strong (very high energy) and the edited Super-8 video is fine.<br />_DVD_ continues with four numbers (Black Dog/Misty Mountain Hop/Since I've Been Loving You/The Ocean) from the now infamous Madison Square Garden shows, originally filmed for the movie _The Song Remains The Same_, that took place July 27-29, 1973 at the conclusion of the `Houses of the Holy' tour. In this set, the standout is \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" during which Page delivers a strong and passionate solo. (The film TSRTS contains parts of this tune and of \\"Black Dog,\\" but here they are presented in their entirety.) As maligned as these performances have been by some over the years, to see four guys (essentially a power trio with vocals) command the Garden crowd of 20,000 at this level, especially under the circumstances, is truly awe inspiring. (Personally, seeing this quality of presentation of this material makes me wish someone would go back and redo TSRTS as a straight-up concert film, but that's likely a pipe dream.)<br />Next we are taken to Earls Court Arena, London, England for six numbers (Going To California/That's The Way/Bron Yr Aur Stomp/In My Time of Dying/Trampled Under Foot/Stairway To Heaven), shot with video, from Zep's historic 5-night, two weekend stand from May 17 through 25, 1975. All the performances are solid, as Led Zeppelin has by now clearly developed into a juggernaut live band, but particularly enjoyable are the three acoustic tunes.  These are intimately shot and the band is clearly having lots of fun.<br />Finally and poignantly we are treated to seven tunes (Rock And Roll/Nobody's Fault But Mine/Sick Again/Achilles Last Stand/In The Evening/Kashmir/Whole Lotta Love) from the band's final U.K. appearances of August 4 and 11, 1979.  These performances were pro-shot with video in front of crowds of approximately 200,000 each night! Again, all the numbers are strong, and are highlighted here by an evocative rendition of Kashmir and a powerhouse performance of Achilles Last Stand. Almost uncannily, Robert Plant's last words to the audience are \\"Thank you for eleven years.\\"<br />Disc two extras are a Page/Plant NYC 1970 press conference, footage from 1972 of \\"Rock And Roll\\" and a \\"band\\" interview (with rare commentary from Bonzo (RIP)), another interview (just Plant), and finally two 1990 \\"Box Set\\" promos (Over The Hills And Far Away/Travelling Riverside Blues). <br />On the overall the audio quality is good (I listened to the DTS mix), though I honestly think some of the mixing could have been better.  While the video, particularly Earls Court, has some glitches (always the result of the source material), it is clear that the digital restoration and transfer for this project were done painstakingly. The material from the Garden shows looks spectacular in its matted widescreen presentation. All the other material is 4:3 full-screen. Compared to the film elements, the video is a bit grainy, but not bad. Where the software is concerned the stereo mix is the default audio track, which is a bit annoying and you can't do things like play all the extras at once, but like my comments on the audio mix, this is just nit-picking. When one considers the vast undertaking this project must have been, it is really a testament to modern technology that Led Zeppelin fans can time travel through some of the highlights of the decade that the band dominated in the comfort of their own living room.<br />Years ago Jimmy Page often talked about a comprehensive chronological live album. _DVD_ is at least a partial realization of this vision, but with added dimensions that no Zep enthusiast could have dreamed of 25 years ago. If you are a Zep fan and you own a DVD player, What are you waiting for?
B00006690G|5.0|This CD is unbelievable, and as most people already know it has turned the public onto Eminem, when previously he got an equal amount of criticism as praise.    Anywone who truly likes this cd and appreciates the complexity of Eminem's vocabulary and vocal rhythms should check out some of his earlier work like the slim shady lp which is a little more rough around the edges but again shows off his ability.
079284632X|4.0|Wes Craven's debut film wasn't bad for a beginner.  It begins innocently enough, with Mary Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) getting ready to go to a concert with her friend.  It's when they want some weed that they get into trouble.<br />They go up to a dealer who just happens to be someone on the lookout for new victims for two violent murderers who escaped from prison and their female accomplice.<br />In the apartment, the girls are verbally abused and one of them is raped.  The following day, they are taken to the woods.  It is there that the real \\"fun\\" begins for the rapists/murderers and they proceed to intensify their torture of the two women.<br />After Mary and her friend are murdered (in reverse order), the four killers (three actually, the fourth in the group is the son of one of the murderers and he's so strung out on heroin he can't think straight) seek refuge in a house directly across from the woods.  It turns out to be the house of Mary Collingwood.<br />When the parents put two and two together, they seek the ultimate revenge and get it.<br />For working on such a low budget, Craven did an excellent job with his first film.  The shoddy camera work gives it that extra scary effect (the creators of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" knew a good effect when they saw it).<br />Even after many times watching it, this still scares the hell out of me.
0385334206|5.0|I read this book the night I quit my first university. I was in a funk since I had decided that being an english major was pointless and the future seemed bleak and uncertain.<br />I stayed up all night reading this novel, utterly amazed at the manner that Vonneggutt wrote and constructed the story. It was a liberating experience and it taught me that one can write in any manner one chooses.<br />The almost grade school descriptions of activities do such a marvelous job of baring the reality of how we really are.<br />This is a wonderfully instructive novel that will open your mind and help to sweep out the debris that may have gathered there.
B000063WDH|5.0|Words cannot express how great this disc is or how great The Black Keys are. The Big Come Up is rooted firmly in the hypnotic North Missippi hill country blues brought to attention by RL Burnside and Junior Kimbrough. This disc is proof positive that blues music, REAL blues music, knows no color or geography. It doesn't matter who you are or where you're from, If you get it...YOU GET IT!!!!!!!!!! Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney HAVE IT. The playing, and more importantly, feeling are 100% genuine. Singer/guitarist Dan Auerbach doesn't play many solos and isn't concerned with technical brilliance or how fast he can play or how many scales he knows. He doesn't consider himself 'the midpoint between Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimi Hendrix' (as one popular blues wanker once stated). Real blues musicians know style, \\"THEIR\\" style, is more important than mindless aping and idol worship. Dan's style echoes many great bluesmen but comes out all HIS. I can think of no greater compliment to pay a blues artist. Drummer Patrick Carney concentrates on rythmic FORCE. At one time, that's how blues players ACTUALLY played. No kidding.<BR>To sum up: Buy this album and thank your lucky stars that bands like The Black Keys are out there doing it the way it should be done
B00008PX8P|3.0|Now, let's be really honest with ourselves. I'm a Zeppelin fan and guitarist, but Jimmy Page has always left me cold with his sloppy playing (well in evidence if you'd just use an objective ear). Had I never heard them live and only had the studio experience to go on, I would think he was one of the greats. But his stumbling on In the Evening, his ridiculous chordal  embellishments on Stairway live, overall sloppy soloing...Even in the Earl's Court shows he was starting on his pathway to the Atlantic 40th Anniversary performance (cringe). **CASE IN POINT: Jimmy OVERDUBBED (repaired?) the very last notes of his solo on Stairway 1975 for this dvd. Guitarists take heed and watch! He's playing at the 5th fret (3rd and 4th string?), but what you hear is from the 17th fret. <BR>John Paul Jones was the only real musician in the band anyway, and this dvd proves that. It's good to hear Robert from back when he could actually hit the high notes, however.<BR>Of course I'm thrilled to see these rare shows, but just think of what has been left out: Dazed and Confused at Knebworth with the laser show! That alone would have been worth the absence of at least 2 of the 3 or 4 times D & C is on here. The earliest shows on Disc One are definitely the best of the bunch, but the promo videos from 1990 are ESSENTIAL pieces of art. Heck, I'd like to have seen perhaps a second Moby Dick replace one of the Dazed performances. <BR>Would've been nice to see maybe some backstage footage from MSG instead of those mis-editted travesties from The Song Remains.... The artsy video touch-ups to Trampled Underfoot are cool, and the acoustic set is superb, even though the cameraman has a definite case of Page-o-philia, since Jimmy is the most prominent figure on the show. (Where's Jonesy?)<BR>I was looking forward to this as much as any Zep head, but I am not going to let my emotions cloud my judgement. They made some of the best hard rock songs ever...in the STUDIO. But aside from the drum solo, theviolin bow, and Page's dramatic posturing, there's really not alot on offer that, for example, a non-Zeppelin fan could get turned on about. The band's essence was as a live act only in the early years. Jimmy's obsession with his \\"guitar army\\" made the later songs virtually impossible to pull off live. Nope, I didn't buy this expecting to see \\"great performances\\", but to see Led Zeppelin. Period. <BR>   I expect most of you to be unhappy about my opinion, so condemn me all you want. But I DO NOT DOUBT that you will understand exactly what I'm saying if you would just lend a critical eye and ear instead of the usual starstruck glassy-eyed stare.
B00006879E|5.0|I saw Maroon5 at the Matchbox 20/Sugar Ray concert.  I figured they would be like any other opening band.  I could not have been more wrong.  They were incredible.  We went to buy the CD right after they played and by the time I got a turn in line to buy they were sold out.  Needless to say I ordered it online the next day.  Buy the CD, play it over and over, and enjoy as much as I and many others have.
B000089RVX|5.0|i love this cd. she sings so great. i love her sing 4.My Immortal and her sing 8. Taking Over Me
B00006L9ZT|2.0|Having viewed the entire DVD several times, I can say that I'm not that satisfied with what I see and hear. <br />It's great to have a production with traditional sets, in particular as we're often nowadays treated to so many stupid productions with all those irrelevant &quot;up-dates&quot;. Unfortunately, the stage direction here is insufficiently lively and often unimaginative, thus making several of the scenes fall flat. <br />On the musical side, there are a number of flaws in the casting with several singers either past their prime or are physically unconvincing in their roles. The orchestra of the Met does a great job, but the effort is marred by Levine's rather stodgy conducting. <br />I think it is still worthy to get this DVD recording. Yet, all those reservations cannot be overlooked.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is fantastic, however the reviews of the CD are not. The reviews state that they are a cross between Tori Amos and Linkin Park. This is not true at all! They are a combination of Tori Amos and Sarah McLaughlin. I like every song on the CD but the reviews are misleading.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Ah, yes yes yes, Madonna.  The innovator of many styles and trends.  The Queen of Pop.  Whether she's acting \\"Like A Virgin,\\" trying out some \\"Erotica,\\" seeing a \\"Ray Of Light,\\" or just making great \\"Music,\\" Madonna has always kept our interest.  And now we have her latest record, \\"American Life?\\" The question on most people's minds is, \\"Is it any good?\\"  The answer?  Hell Yes!  Using most of the same electronic sounds she used on \\"Ray Of Light\\" and \\"Music,\\" Madonna creates an interesting mix of pop, rap/hip-hop, electronica, dance grooves, and folk rock.  These mixtures make \\"American Life\\" one of Madonna's best albums.  Is it better than \\"Music?\\" Yes.  \\"Music\\" was a mixed bag of awesome songs such as \\"Music,\\" and \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl,\\" while some not quite as great songs such as \\"Amazing.\\"  Is it better than \\"Ray Of Light?\\"  In my opinion, yes.  'Ray Of Light\\" had many, many, killer tracks such as \\"Ray Of Light,\\" and \\"Nothing really Matters,\\" but again, not quite as good as this album.  The album starts off with a bang with the single \\"American Life.\\"  If you don't like that song, it's okay.  It's definately not the best song.  The best songs on the album are right in the middle.  \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is an excellent electronica/rock song complete with a catchy corus, and interesting lyrics.  \\"Nothing Fails\\" is my favorite song on the album.  The guitar and the gospel choir heighten the emotional impact of the song.  \\"Intervention\\" is a great song about the power of love keeping a family together.  \\"X-tatic Process\\" is a simple medley.  This is a song about Jesus Christ and is stunning in its simplicity.  \\"Mother and Father\\" is probably my second favorite song on the album.  A great song with an awesome beat that touches on some very personal issues.  \\"Hollywood,\\" \\"I'm So Stupid,\\" \\"Love Profusion,\\" \\"Die Another Day,\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\" are also great songs.  All in all, this is a great album, and quite possibly Madonna's best album since \\"Like A Prayer!\\"
B00007AJGH|5.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a cutting edge film in its day, and is still a classic.  And it looks absolutely fabulous on DVD!!!  I love the fact that you have the option of watching it in widescreen or full screen, because some of us don't have big, widescreen, digital TV's yet.  And even after all of this time, this film still delivers the laughs.
1878424319|5.0|This was a fantastic book. It was the first book I ever read by him. I liked how he made a seaction for each task and it was easy to understand. I could not put it down. I use the book like a bible because the agreements can be applied to daily life. It mentioned how words were like black magcik. That they can in fact a person deeply. I like where he decribes other peoples emotional garbabge can affect you if you let it occur.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Excellent quality and value overall, but with one significant oversight - I couldn't find a navigation menu to jump around song-by-song. The navigation menu lets you jump by section; i.e., from Earl's Court to Knebworth, but they don't make it easy to jump ahead to Stairway to Heaven, or skip over Dazed and Confused or Moby Dick. Failure to include such basic function on a modern DVD is an oversight that will detract from enjoyment on repeated listens.<br />I'd still recommend this highly, however, since you get a lot of great material and a welcome alternative to the high-priced ... bootlegs that were the only source for so many years.
B000089CPF|5.0|These guys put together wonderful soundscapes, and much like Beck, Radiohead, the Flaming Lips, et al. their end work flows beautifully. If you like your music organic, with spectacular musicianship, this is a cd for you. The reviewer from Phoenix gave it one star,  but he's just jealous cause Tucson and Calexico are ten times more beautiful than where he's from...
B00005JLRT|3.0|As I watched the movie I couldn't help but obsess on all the unexplained questions. This movie has some of the laziest scripting I've ever seen.<br />For instance:<br />The Enterprise crew seems baffled as to how a human could end up in charge of the Romulan empire. Guess what. So was I and it's never really explained. Are we to just assume the Picard's genes are so superior that if placed on Romulus he would naturally take over the whole planet.<br />Why would the Romulan's help Shinzon with his coup, urge him to follow through with his bizaare plan and then turn on him the moment he starts putting his plan in motion?<br />Shinzon spent his childhood being tortured by the Romulan's so naturally he holds a deep hatred for... EARTH????<br />What do the Romulan's hope to gain by destroying the Earth?<br />Who built the Scimitar? Was it the Romulans or the Remians and how did they suddenly make this technological leap to build the most powerful starship ever? Why would the Romulan's give Shinzon charge of this ship since he seems to have no experience as a starship commander.<br />Who designed the Phazon generator to sit on the Scimitar's bridge? Doesn't that seem like an accident just waiting to happen.<br />How in the world did the Remian's think they were going to capture the Enterprise by beaming a half dozen soldiers aboard?<br />Why would the Romulan's build such a massive space cruiser and then fill it with no defense forces? Picard had little difficulty storming the ship SINGLE HANDEDLY.<br />Why did the Romulan's attack their OWN SHIP knowing it's power after giving it to Shinzon? Naturally they got their butts handed to them but it makes no sense.<br />If the Romulans can just start beeming people off the Enterprise at will why not just keep doing it until you capture the whole crew?<br />I give the movie a three because I have a soft heart. The Final Frontier would have received a one.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is just the hottest damn CD in years. I'm just stunned the rest of the world doesn't think so - yet.<BR>I read one professional review where the reviewer complained we didn't need lessons in humility from someone living in a London mansion. What the hell does that have to do with the music?<BR>This is my new favorite current album. The previous ones included The White Album, Disreali Gears and The One. Go out and get this CD - it will make you dance in front of the mirror. <BR>I did not know Madonna was capable of this. I used to think she was good, now I am a fan!
B00003CXV4|5.0|I was referred to this movie because of my love for Jason Isaacs but at the same time I fell into the storyline and the characters. I know that a lot of the story was unrealistic but it didn't stop me from enjoying it. I was really rooting for Nelson and Sara and was so saddened that it had to end so tragically, can there ever be a love story without a sad ending? It is sad to me that love stories always end sadly.<br />I still have to say that Jason Isaacs took my breath away with his performance of Chaz, the friendly gay cross-dresser friend of Sarah. I have followed his career as of recent since falling in love with him in Harry Potter but this took me as a surprise. He makes for a lovely looking man but makes an utterly ugly woman. <br />So over all, worth it and Ron thank you!
0736041850|5.0|I have been looking for a book like this for a long time, I wish I could rate it higher. It is very well illustrated and should be on any everyones lists for books to buy when weight training. You will see every muscle a specific exersize targets and it also shows the minor muscles that come into play. This book DOES NOT put together a weight training routine but you can easily put one together by learning what muscles do what. The book is divided into seven section; arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, buttocks, and abdomen. and each of these sections have anywhere from 9 to 21 execizes to perform. My hat goes off to Frederic Delavier for his awesome illustrations and this well put together book.
0385504209|3.0|The book was entertaining, but too much background information. There are many excellent, faster-paced historical mysteries such as The Patriote Proposition, listed in zshops.

B000096I9G|5.0|Altough this DVD was to be released in the beginning of next week, my loyal music shop called me today and handed this dvd for me. Just finished enjoying three hours of old and new time classics and I'm thrilled. It must have been an exhausting show for the band, but every minute of it is full of energy and retrospectical melancholy and power. Never again will a band be able to put something together like this... to put together three of their strongest albums and make it seem like their connected for all times... best euro's spend this season...
068981528X|5.0|I really laughed out loud with this book.<br />The idea of it was great!!  I do think some of it goes above<br />the children's head sometimes, but for the parents or the reader,<br />it is hysterical.<br />I definately recommend this to everyone!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is an amazing phenomenum. The combination of thunderous guitar, piano, violin and especialy, Amy's voice, makes their music unique and very creative. No female singer in this world can compare to her. You'll see what i mmeant when you hear \\"Hello\\", \\"My immortal\\", \\"Imaginary\\" or \\"Bring me to life\\". ...
B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved this movie-<br />40 years old and I loved all the characters.  I love Mike!!
B00003CWTI|5.0|To those who think this movie is about a bunch of pretentious run-arounds (a-hem), you are entirely wrong.  Art films are not meant to depress nor uplift, a good film is to leave the viewer with their own opinion - and not follow the critics criticism. <br />It is unfortunate that we have few opportunities to see a film which covers a gamut of personalities - and no, that is not hollywood, I think everyone who sees Magnolia can identify with one character. And as you watch the movie, the characters evolve to other people.  There is no Caulfield except the sprightly cop - but at the end of the film, you have to be an ogre not to feel the sorrow and hope that Magnolia cleverly conveys.  I feel sorry for those who are so rapt with their own &quot;art&quot; that they cannot see what lies afoot, namely...hubris and frailty of the human heart.

Norah on the other hand, posseses a smooth tone and simple background music that perfectly compliments her voice. It's not simply &quot;driving music&quot;, &quot;romantic music&quot;, &quot;go to sleep music&quot;, or &quot;background music&quot;, or only for those who typically enjoy jazz or blues. I would recommend this CD to anyone for any occasion. The first song I heard was &quot;Nightingale&quot;, and I needed to hear no more to know that I had to have the CD, and in my opinion, there are several even better tracks.
0688163173|1.0|Set in the summer of 1954, United States Marshall Teddy Daniels is assigned to an investigation involving Shutter Island, located just off the Massachusetts Coast. The island is the home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. In a variation of the classic locked room mystery problem, the Hospital staff has lost a patient. Somehow, Rachel Solando, responsible for murdering her three children by drowning them in a lake, escaped from her locked room and past the eyes of the not so vigilant guards and staff. Teddy and his partner Chuck Aule are sent in to investigate and find the missing patient who theoretically could not have escaped the island alive.<br />What follows is a nightmarish world where reality and mental illness collide. Rumor has it that the Hospital is doing unethical, even for 1954, experiments on patients and engaged in a giant cover-up with links to the government and the Cold War. Teddy has been investigating the Hospital and its people for a long time and the missing Rachel Solando was a convenient excuse for him to get on the island. Once there, with a hurricane coming and no signs of Rachel Solando, it may prove impossible to leave.<br />As one expects from Dennis Lehane, this is another dark and gritty novel. Usually that is his style along with a tight mystery, strong character development and plenty of action. His books maybe very dark at times, but usually for a reason and usually the book are good stuff. None of that applies to this effort.<br />He is dark throughout the novel and there is some action to it. However, one does not expect such amazingly shallow character development along with contrived events like a hurricane coming towards the island. The actual cheap ending is amazingly contrived and considering all the shallowness of the novel, to be expected but leaves this reader feeling very cheated. That along with the overall depressing tone of the work, which deals extensively and graphically with mental illness, and some of the bizarre treatment methods of the past, makes this one to skip. This theme has been done better by others and simply is not even \\"good\\" under the standards set by Dennis Lehane in his earlier works.f the bizarre treatment methods of the past, makes this one to skip.

B00005JKZV|5.0|Lord of the Rings, the entire series, is totally awesome of course because of the director and cast and crew. Its music is so cool! and all the actors are wonderful...Moreover it has tried not to miss out any imp. details form the book...Lotr deserves many oscars and the cast should get loads and loads of awards...They all have put extreme effort to reproduce a long fantasy into a beautiful, creative film which has captured the hearts of many!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I will admit to being, at best, a casual Led Zeppelin fan.  I own all of their albums, but that is by accident - a friend gave me the 10-CD Zep box for my birthday one year.  I never saw Zep live, and I'd heard that their live performances ran the full gamut, from transcendantly brutal to laughingly amateurish.  I'd seen \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" at midnight movie showings and kept thinking \\"If this is the best they could do, they don't deserve their reputation.\\"  I'd even go so far as to say that I'd heard cover bands do better versions of Zep songs than the band I saw in that movie.<br />Then I saw the Led Zeppelin DVD.  Four times through since the package arrived on Wednesday night, stopping only to sleep and go to work.  What I saw was a level of sustained excellence rivalled only by The Who in their heyday.  I never know that John Bonham could improvise the way he did.  Nor did I realize what a skilled keyboard player John Paul Jones is.  And, of course, the counterpoint chiming and wailing of Jimmy Page's guitar and the marvelous instrument that is, or at least was, Robert Plant's voice.  The songs, of course, speak for themselves, but do NOT remain the same, as they are given a girth and muscle missing from the studio recordings.<br />My apologies to my fellow rock fans.  While they will NEVER replace The Who ... Led Zeppelin DOES belong in the Pantheon of rock gods.  Jimmy Page has been threatening this outpouring of retrospective material for years.  The wait was worth it.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's new album \\"Faceless\\" mixes powerful guitar riffs with strong bass and vocals to back the guitar riffs up,the drumming is second to non with new drummer Shannon Larkin proveing to be a great asset to godsmacks music.I think godsmack's more heavyer songs like \\"Straight out of line\\" \\"I stand alone\\" \\"I f***in hate you and \\"Releasing the demons\\" really sum up what a powerful band godsmack really are! Also the more softer songs on the album like \\"The awakening\\" and \\"Seranity\\" also show us the more meaningful side of the greatest band on the planet!
B00007ELEL|5.0|What a great movie!  Everyone who loves this movies knows why, its the interaction of the characters and their reactions to each other.  John Goodman is priceless as Walter, and I can't watch Jeff Bridges in any other movies without wondering where his goatee went.  The Coens are genuises, only they could pull off a movie like this and people who appreciate (extremely) dry humor will love this movie!
0066214122|2.0|One of the things I always like about Crichton's books was that there was always a feeling in the back of my mind that the story was somehow possible.<BR>From Jurrasic park's \\"DNA locked in amber\\" to the \\"alien life form\\" brought down by a satelite in the Andromeda Strain - I always believed that someday - this kind of thing might happen,<BR>In Prey - however - I just didn't get the same feeling and I think the book goes way beyond what can someday be possible.<br />Crichton puts the story line of Prey in present day terms when in fact - technology such as this won't be available for many, many years - not in our lifetime anyway.<BR>If Crichton had put this story a few hundred years in the future - it may have worked
B00005JMC6|5.0|Saw this movie and I believe its one of the best movies to come out of New Zealand. The young actor, Keisha Castle-Hughes and the grandmother's performances were outstanding although the rest of the support cast were also brilliant. Can't wait for this to come out on dvd to add to my collection.<BR> The movie lovingly and accurately illustrated the difficulty in absorbing the old and powerful Maori legends and beliefs into modern day life.
6304626495|5.0|Blessed are the cheesemakers!<br />This is what one line from the Sermon on the Mount is mis-interpreted as being by one of the distant crowd members (remember, Jesus had no microphones or amplification -- you try talking down a mountain and see who hears you correctly!).<br />And of course, the instant interpretation (obviously emphasising the 'fun' in fundamental interpretation) -- 'he obviously means that to apply to the makers of any dairy products,' is applied by one of the listeners.<br />I heard this used (and have since myself used) as an example in a sermon of the difficulty of interpretation. And this entire movie is rife with such examples of twisting the biblical (and extra-biblical) stories -- often with hilarious results, but quite frequently one finds oneself laughing because it is accurate, rather than satire. Wasn't it Will Rogers who said 'I don't have to satirise my enemies: I merely have to quote them.'?<br />Beginning with the birth in the manger through to a crucifixion, our would-be and reluctant messiah embarks on a mad-cap romp through a thoroughly modern-Britainised Palestine of the null-millenium. Just at the Bible leaves out the childhood of Jesus, so does this movie leave out the childhood of Brian -- and I've often wondered of the split in the believers -- those who followed the shoe and those who followed the gourd, which are catholics and which are protestants?<br />Perhaps the best scene to any prep-school graduate would be the sight of the Roman guard correcting the Latin grammar of Brian the would-be slogan writer and political propagandist.<br />'It says, &quot;Romans go home!&quot;,' Brian insists.<br />'No it doesn't,' the guard replies.  'It says &quot;People called the Romans they go the house!&quot; '<br />A great film for humour, a great film for provoking thought, a great film for leaving your serious side alone for a bit.
B000005IU1|5.0|Dude, the Stooges kick so much ass, man. Throw away all your other crappy CDs, crack open a cold one, guzzle it, get half naked and just rock out, dude. The Stooges are so freakin' awesome, man. Iggy's insane, man.
B000002H33|5.0|This is possibly the best cd ever, it has the best rock band ever in their prime playing the best rock songs ever. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is my favorite song ever peroid, and &quot;Orion&quot; is one of the best instrumentals ever with insanely great guitar solos. &quot;Battery&quot; is such a great fast heavy song. &quot;Welcome Home&quot; is a very good song as well that starts slow then turns into a very heavy song. &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; starts real soft and then suddenly because one of the hardest songs ever recorded, great song. I could go on forever about this album the point is that everyone needs to buy this cd, because they don't come any better.
B00008J4P5|5.0|i must say this is the FIRST album i listened to in its entirety and thinking to myself what an amazing piece of work.  i'm not saying it's my favorite of all time but its for sure on my top15 list.  usually the best albums are ones i dont like at all first listen but eventually grows on me.   Elephant is everything i wanted to hear and more. <br /> ...  first of all, just because a band isn't using the greatest and latest technology out there doesnt mean they arent trying and lacking talent.  ...  how ... are two people going to play more than two instruments combined?  so they need to add more people?  then will they still be the \\"white stripes\\". ....<br />i love how jack's vocals have so much variety from a Jimmy Hendrix (Ball And Biscuit) to a buddy holly (Little Acorns).  i'd say just cause of his lyrics and vocals puts him into a category along w/ mike patton (mr. bungle, fantomas)  and the early days of pavement and beck.  i'd say this is worth [$$$] and save DL for albums like 50 cent and the Ataris...oh wait, why ... would you wast your time w/ those.  DL a manson song to slit your teenage wrists to and have a good day :)
B000089RVX|2.0|All the hype about this album convinced my girlfriend to force me to buy her this album. I was hesitant at first after hearing the song from DareDevil. Anyway, i bought it for her. We listened to it in my car, and before the 3rd song was over i noticed she was getting bored. So  i decided to pop in Lacuna Coil's Comalies and she woke up. Now this CD is sitting somewhere in my car (together with my running shoes) and she has all my Lacuna Coil and Nightwish CDs... Sure taught her a lesson about relying in reviews too much. This CDs not that bad, its just not worth it unless you're really a fan of the band i think.
B00008G9JO|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and I'm amazed that several reviewers really hate it.  I guess it depends on your taste and expectations.  This CD and its sister CD Songs From the Woods are Tull's best work.  I couldn't get into A Passion Play and much of the last 5 or so CD's (Ian's voice is horrible and the music is generic), but I really like Stand Up, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, most of Roots to Branches, and yes, even Warchild.  As great as those CDs are, none of them compare to HH and SFTW.<br />The bass work is especially interesting.  Both CDs have John Glasscock on bass (he was also on Too Old to Rock and Roll prior to this), who, in my opinion, was one of the best bass players around and certainly the best Tull has ever had.  Unfortunately he's deceased, otherwise their subsequent music might have had the same energy and exuberance as these 2.<br />I never discount the negative reviews and you shouldn't either.  Listen to the clips and decide for yourself.  If your still on the fence, I recommend you try Songs From the Woods 1st.  If you like it, then you will probably like Heavy Horses too.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Unbelievably good cd.  What more is there to say.
1558216847|3.0|I wouldn't like to be disrespectful towards Mr. Rawiz, but I have to admit that there are a lot of suspicious things in this otherwise interesting book.<br />I have read quite a few books on the gulag, and on &quot;real adventure&quot; &quot;endurance&quot; and the like, and it is a constant in all of them that the author takes good care to give sufficient explanations as to render fully credible any description of tools, devices, plans or simple behaviours that allowed him to achieve his goals (whether obtaining the appropriate gear, climbing a mountain, fording a river or scaping from a prison or camp). Certainly, none of this is to be found in this book.<br />I can suppose that Mr. Rawicz simply did not have the clue to real distances travelled and so on, but there is an overall feeling of awkward vagueness throughout the whole story. <br />Even though Mr. Rawicz and his mates deserve all of my admiration for what they did (if indeed they did it) the book is much too simple to create an atractive atmosphere (it is sort of &quot;this lady helped me, we escaped at night, and we walked and walked until we made it to India&quot;). Don't get me wrong, it is quite entertaining and not badly written, but...
B00008OWZC|2.0|This supposedly hot live albums pales in comparison to the classics like Live at Leeds by the Who and Get Your Ya Yas Out by the Stones.  It IS better than Song Remains the Same, but that isn't saying much.  I was disappointed.
0060090383|5.0|My mom discovered Marian Keyes in Ireland a few years before her books were published in the States.  What a wonderful writer she is.  Rachel's Holiday is filled with humor, family and struggle.  Its so easy at first to get sucked into Rachel's world and delusions and then realize you are going through the same denial she is.  Part of series including Watermelon and Angels (you don't need to read them in order).
B000002I55|3.0|...so I'm jus' gon' throw down an' give it three stars 'cause I feel like bein' nice.  Look, I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about Ornette Coleman or his place in jazz history, an' in fact I'll be honest with you an' tell you that I know NOTHING about him or his work.  I bought this because it looked intriguing.  I like the fact that this was groundbreaking an' that the improvised lines an' the overall self-assured nature of bein' able to go into the studio with no notes, no sketches, nothin', wit' your jazz quartet an' jus' play your @ss off, but this isn't sumpin' I would feel the urge to listen to on a regular basis.  Is' not that I find it chaotic or that I find it atonal, so don' trip on me about that.  I can hear the melodies, trust me, an' I understand why this is considered landmark jazz.  Maybe I'm jus' more of a calmer, mellow jazz fan or maybe I'm jus' more into jazz that I can understand where the performer started an' ended it up in the piece.  Moreover, maybe I'm jus' musical snob whose close-minded to things I'm not used to.  <br />Don't get me wrong.  I don't regret buying this one bit.  An' I think any jazz-head would  do well to hear this at least once.  Is' jus' not an essential to me.  It may'a kick-started sumpin', but to me there are others who did it much better.  I'm no expert so I wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong, but thas' my general feeling about this.  I'm tryin'ta be the peacekeeper on this one, 'cause I see the way the other reviewers have been gangin' up on each other.  So if you're into more avant-garde style then knock yourself out; if all you're into traditional jazz, then don't bother with this, or do like me, an' know what your gettin' into an' have an open mind about it.  Thas' all for now.  Reach for peace, amazonians.
6302293553|5.0|This movie ROCKS!  If you don't like it, you have got some SERIOUS issues that you need to work out.  This is not a movie that is so boring that you would fall asleep during it at all.   It is just one of those movies that you practically die lauging while watching it.  It has good humor, and no corny jokes.  Don't bring it down because it is a little older than   modern-day movies.  It is just REALLY good.
B000059XUT|5.0|I didn't like a lot of the Disney-Pixar movies that went to theatres after this until Monsters Inc renewed my faith in Disney-Pixar. And yes, Disney even makes thier own great animated movies all byt themselves like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Lilo &amp; Stitch. Starting today a new Disney-Pixar movie opened named Finding Nemo, which I saw got 4 stars in the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Suntimes and Daily Southtown. I have two problems with ADisney, that most (if not all) there movies has either violence or scary scenes in the movie. And also Disney has thier new animated movies out for a limited time on video and dvd, then after a while, they take them out of stock for about 10 years, then may re-release them back into theatres, and maybe on the IMAX screen , and then again on video, and sometimes, making its debut on dvd, keep the re-relase version of it out for a few months, and then takes them out of stock again for about another 10 years. As the movie opens, Woody (Tom Hanks) is not worried about being replaced by his human owner Andy (John Morris XXX) and has a hard time convinceing the other toys, that they will not get replaced by Andy. Woody sends a group of toy soliders out with I guess a baby moditar, and to report in what inside the presents.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Exact historical account or not aside, this movie has greatness above any of the criticisms that I have read here on Amazon.com.  What makes this movie great is that from beginning to end it is a marvelous Catholic friendly movie, so unlike Hollywood to make.  The ending scene and epilog tells it all very powerfully.  What a tribute to the Church!  The pro-Catholic view of the movie is not at the expense of Protestantism, so I don't think Protestants would be offended in any way.  I think that all Christians can love this movie for what it is a movie of a historical event that is uplifting as can be.  Another triumph of love and goodness.  Our parish priest a number of years ago, thought so highly of this movie that he bought it for everyone in the parish.  Do your family a favor and buy this tape or DVD.  I run the Wayside Shrine Catholic retreat house.  Everyone of our guests has thought very highly of this film.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD set showcases the musical journey of Led Zepplein, from 1970 - 1979. It shows their finest live performances. The visual quality is surprisingly good, considering the age and technology used to film these early performances. The DTS surround sound ROCKS! I was blown away hearing my favorite Zeppelin songs in true surround sound. This is the closest thing many of will have to actually seeing Zeppelin live in their prime. Song Remains the Same pales in comparison to this DVD set. People who say Zeppelin sucked live are gonna eat thier words! If your a fan, this is a must have.
B00008PBZW|4.0|The 3 CD director's cut of WINDTALKERS is actually very good! I heard horrible reviews for this dvd and I was not a big fan of JOHN WOO's \\"Mission Impossible 2\\" (even though I respected his approach to action). WINTALKERS has some excellent performances by not only NICHOLAS CAGE but the NAVAJO actors too. Christin Slater actually does a very good job too!!! There is 20 EXTRA MINUTES re-edited into the DIRECTOR'S CUT. I never saw the original.. only this version and it is 2 HOURS and 30 MINUTES long. Just when you want the movie to pick up, it does!!! I was very suprised! I thought that I would be board but the movie is paced well. I am a tough guy too. I never cry at movies but I have to admit, I GOT CHOKED UP TOWARDS the end.. There are also some very good twists in the movie. The BONUS features are also very interesting. THE CODETALKERS documentary is great and there are many different commentaries too!!! 3 DVDs....  Do NOT let the bad press ruin this movie for you. SEE it for yourself and MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.
B00008OWZC|5.0|All I can say is \\"WOW!\\" This is a amazing collection of live recordings. I have never heard Led Zeppelin perform well live. I have the Song Remains the Same & BBC Sessions. Both pale in comparison to this new set. The quality of the recordings is incredible, and anyone who says that Zeppelin couldn't play live will have to eat their words. John Bonham's drumming is superb. Plant sounds amazing, and Page just goes off like the guitar-god that he is. This version of \\"Stairway\\" is worth the price alone. GET THIS!
B00008NRL8|5.0|Im not used to listen Tango, even that Im from Argentina. You may think that Im an Alien, having one of the most beatiful music in my own country I dont listen to it. Well there is a one good reason for it; listen to much Tango makes me bored. But with this Album I Kinda like it the sound of the Tango. From the beginning till the end its an lovely mix with tango an electric music, even if you are not used to it, you will love it. I say YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD!<BR>Now I want to listen more Tango, the real one, this album kinda make u feel that you are a modern tango, so. LISTEN TO IT!!<br />any big mistake with the orthography, make your pardon! :) forgive.. Im only a human.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this CD.  I had earlier proclaimed Hybrid Theory to be the perfect CD, in that there was not one single clunker on the whole disc.  Not only has Meteora met my expectations for a follow-up, but demolished them!  Every song is a keeper, from the crunchy rockers (Don't Stay, Hit The Floor) to the more introspective mid-tempo songs (Easier To Run, From The Inside).  The band bares its soul without all the posturing of other bands of a similar style (Listen up, Fred!).  If I was forced to offer a criticism, I would argue that the disc is too short; it's obvious that there is no shortage of great material to be had from this band.  I eagerly await the third installment to their catalog, but until then, I'll wear out my copy of Meteora.  BUY THIS CD!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|For anyone that's even a casual Zeppelin fan, this DVD set is certainly worth purchasing. Fantastic footage and incredible sound abound on both discs. The highlight for me being the Royal Albert Hall footage and Kashmir from Knebworth. Personally, I really enjoy the 'early' Led Zeppelin period (1969 - 1973) when compared to the later years, but it's nice to have a varied setlist from the complete period on 2 DVDs.<br />A live set by Led Zeppelin has been LONG overdue -- while the studio albums themselves are excellent, I've always wanted to see AND hear what a live Zeppelin show would be like. Don't let the price of this set intimidate you -- it's much cheaper than a concert ticket -- and it puts you right up front with the band.<br />Highly recommended for the Led Zeppelin fan, or anyone that enjoys watching a terrific rockin' band at the peak of their powers.
B00008PX8P|5.0|until now all the general public knew of zeppelin's live prowess was the song remains the same, which is pretty much average. not only does this dvd kill tsrts, it shows us what zeppelin was at their best. 5 hours and 20 minutes of performances and interviews from: Royal Albert Hall, Madison Square Garden, Earls Court, and the surprisingly incredible Knebworth. Some highlights include: Bring It On Home from RAH, Trampled Underfoot from Earls Court, Achilles Last Stand from Knebworth, and In The Evening from Knebworth.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Having heard Zeppelin on the radio for numerous years, and owning the Led Zeppelin boxed set, I had always wondered why a live album (aside from &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; and &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;) was never released.<br />This triple CD set is a long overdue welcome to the Led Zep catalog. Coupled with the recently released &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; DVD, my cravings for live &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; have been quenched.<br />The band is definitely ON, as experienced by the aural bombardment of Page, Plant, Bonham, and Jones on this live CD set. If you are a Zeppelin fan -- or even if you are a casual fan of classic rock, I recommend picking this CD up to REALLY hear how the band sounded live, and at the peak of their powers.<br />Highly recommended.
B000059XYL|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I bought the soundtrack and the dvd.  It is a great movie that I would be glad to compliment on.
B00008PX8P|5.0|How else to describe 5+ hours of previously unreleased Led Zeppelin concert footage--in outstanding audio and visual quality--from their heyday back in the 70s?  At last, those too young to have seen Zeppelin in concert, and who had always heard that \\"Song Remains The Same\\" was an inadequate document of their work, can relive what is now a foggy but glorious memory in the minds of those lucky enough to have been there.  <br />To start with, the 60s TV appearances are a revelation: obviously, no-one had seen or heard anything quite like this<BR>band in early 1969, so to see them play \\"Dazed And Confused\\" in front of a confused European audience of fortysomethings on one program was a surreal experience.  Every second of the Royal Albert Hall Footage is a must, and I was nearly shocked at how good the quality was...it could have been recorded yesterday.<BR>The Madison Square Garden footage repeats two songs from \\"Song Remains The Same\\" and adds two mighty outtake performances.  The DVD peaks with '75 footage from Earl's Court, featuring an exquisite acoustic set and jaw-dropping renditions of \\"In My Time Of Dying\\", \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\".<BR>I was not expecting the '79 show to rock as hard but I could not have been more wrong; the band sounds as epic and revelatory on \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", \\"Kashmir\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" as ever. Watching this DVD, you will wonder where all the good music has gone, weep for Bonham's passing and be sure and tell the whole neighborhood to pick up a copy--although given that it has already sold four million in two days, they will probably already have their own.
B00005JM03|4.0|As a new MINI Cooper owner (GRNSTRK, Washington), I was looking forward to seeing this movie, partly due to my husband's raving about the 1969 version, partly because I can rarely identify so closely with something in a film (the escape vehicles). Like watching \\"Monster's Garage\\" turn a new MINI into a snowmobile, I wish I could have seen in more detail what modifications were made to the car to make them be able to carry the weight of the loot (2,700 pounds each). But this story was not about MINI Coopers, it was about what everyone else has written about. I truly enjoyed the humor, action and pace of this film. And the Coopers got enough screen time, I enjoyed seeing them put thru their paces, since mine will never see THAT kind of driving action.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I agree with Sue, regardless of how many times you watch this movie you are going to be pleased.  The first time I saw this movie was back around 1971 in college one night when the movie was being shown in the cafeteria. To this day I still remember the one sceen where I felt like jumped a couple of feet into the air along with everyone else.  It's been a long time since I last saw this movie and I have been waiting for the DVD release for a couple of years.<BR>So turn out the lights and get ready for a very good movie that I am sure you will enjoy.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I knew out of all of the \\"teeny bopper\\" artists of the late '90s, Christina Aguilera had it in her to come back better than ever. First off, this girl's vocals are incredible. She can sing & scream like no other. When Christina's in the room her voice is heard. The long awaited sophomore was worth it. STRIPPED is awesome start to finish. It's personal, powerful, soulful, and it takes you into Christina's personal world. She makes a lot of statements all over this CD from break-ups (fighter) to soul searching (soar) to boys (infatuation). It's very personal. Christina wrote and produced most of the tracks here. She took a big step and it pays off well. STRIPPED shows tremendous growth from her debut. Christina smashes the bottle and comes out as a confident, opinionated young woman.
B00004YYDI|3.0|The characters in this movie (so typical of the French) are unusual, whacky, and totally unexpected - basically the story revolves around a lonely hitman who has single relationship with a houseplant until a young girl, trying to escape from a brutal DEA agent (played by Gary Oldman), places herself into his reluctant care.  Meantime as their relationship strenghtens the young girl developes a crush on this hitman. While I dont think this is unusual, the reaction of the guy though is perverse.  C'mon, she cant be any older than 12!  I enjoyed the movie until this disturbing developement in the story.  <br />Of course, Gary Oldman's played his usual crazed, maniacal, violent, unpredictable character.<br />PS.. I honestly never thought Natalie Portman could act until I saw her in this movie - very different from her booooring portrayal in the yucky Star Wars prequel.
B00008NG5V|5.0|With artists that are notoriously skilled in live performance, there is a tendency for fans to feel that a production album is more like a rough draft. Not this time. Jack Johnson's new release not only preserves, but heightens the signature ambience of his shows, keeping it flowing &quot;On and On&quot;. Johnson uses the studio to his full advantage as he creates imaginative and paradisiac jam extras that won't be experienced acoustically. The album succeeds in displaying an intimacy Jack Johnson has with his music. As the lyrics maintain the enchanting playfulness of &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;, there is philosophical, pseudo-political weight to the album. However, have no fear, Johnson does not venture anywhere near the spectrum of trite attempts-to-be-political, like many other artists today.  While this album has assumed a more mellow vibe, it has created distance from boring. Through your speakers you will hear studio sound quality, but music that is purebred Jack Johnson.
B0000640VO|5.0|A heartwarming, charming, beautiful movie.<br />Get drawn into the world of Amelie and forget yor troubles for a couple of hours.  Absolutely magical!<BR>Warning: You will have a smile stuck to your face long after its over.<br />This is my favorite French movie yet.
B00005NB8K|5.0|This is an excellent film about Jim Morrison and the Doors. While it is true that it is not completely accurate(Oliver Stone directed it so how would it be)and is sometimes way over the top it is still an entertaining and intresting movie. I've watched it several times(I love the Doors and Jim)and it holds up to the repeated views. If you like classic rock or the Doors then I would encourage this because it is a great picture of the 60's and of Jim. Val Kilmer does a superb job as Jim. He looks, speaks and even sings like Jim. Meg Ryan is good as his wife. Anyways I highly reccomend this!
B00008V2VM|4.0|Within the first ten minutes of Equilibrium I was unsure if I would like it. I found myself giggling at the Matrix style fight scene in the opening act. Wondering if it was trying to be \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"Farenheit 451\\" or \\"1984\\". And in truth it is a bit of all of these things. Pieced together amazingly well. So my giggling ceased and became slack jawed awe as the film progressed.<br />This movie has alot to offer. Thrilling actions scenes that have you rewinding them to watch them again.The action in this film can be described as a beautiful violent ballet. I also found the story line to be quite engrossing, the plot twists truthfully kept me guessing. And the cineamatography is beautiful as well.<br />I almost didn't see this movie because of the fact that I had heard it was a Matrix [copy], I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics, because I would have missed out on a fantastic film.
B0000634EV|5.0|I was like a lot of people that posted reviews on here when I first picked this up; a little disappointed. I thought that it was a good CD, but perhaps not what I was looking for. Then I gave it another listen after a couple of days and I liked it a lot more. By the third listen I was hooked. This is just a classic album. The best records are the ones that draw you in. It doesn't matter if you like it at first or not. This is one of those records.<br />To start with, there's is a lot more diversity here, especially in the middle of the album. \\"Stained Glass Cross\\" is a great song, kind of a Lynyrd Skynyrd meets Black Sabbath southern jam that is just totally unlike anything I think I've ever heard. \\"Learn From This Mistake\\" is a also a great tune. What at first appears to be a simple cool melancholy track becomes something of great substance by the end of the song. Phil's been through a lot since NOLA came out and this is basically about his heroin addiction. Unlike a lot of preachy stuff on this subject, it's just about moving on and getting over it. Great guitar solo by Pepper too. \\"Landing On The Mountains Of Meggido\\" is the classic song that Led Zeppelin never made. Atmospheric and awesome. The little musical number \\"Doobinterlude\\" makes me want to loop it endlessly and blaze away. \\"Ghosts Along The Mississippi\\" and \\"New Orleans Is A Dying Whore\\" are classic Down tunes that would fit right in on NOLA, the latter of which features the dirtiest, dirgiest, coolest riff that they've come up with thus far. It's the diversity that makes this album so endlessly listenable and that's something I can always get into. They've added a lot more to the mix while still being distinctly Down, if you know what I mean. <br />Is it as good as NOLA? Yes. Is it better than NOLA? In my opinion, yes. If you're into NOLA I don't see why you won't dig this, even if you don't like it as much as I do.
B000063JDE|2.0|I love hoppers role in this movie, he is evil and twisted enough, but that's about as far as the good goes on this movie.  ..... I think the movie began aggravating me around the point when the sang the blue velvet song for the 20th time in the film (the whole thing) bunch of time killing if you ask me, as sign of a bad movie!! The character of hopper is enough to keep you watching this, and waiting to see what will happen next, but that's about is far as it goes, boring movie, stupid movie - because anyone else in this ladies situation would have done something to get out of the situation. Verdict: if you like hearing Blue Velvet 20 million times, get this!
0761957553|5.0|Great book!  The only drawback is that it doesn't go into much on the SPSS advanced models.  That said however, it is a well-written, funny book with easily understandable examples that makes learning the stats and SPSS a breeze.  It should be a model for all statistics books in the social sciences!

B000003S09|5.0|Time and time again we are confronted with artists who put out a great debut album and never climb that high ever again. When it comes to talking about the paradigmatic example of such a phenomenon my choice would be King Crimson and their debut album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\" Released in 1969 with its distinctive cover art, this was the album that set the standard for progressive/psychedelic rock for the next decade. Except for the title track the songs are ensemble efforts by guitarist Robert Fripp, drummer Michael Giles, bass player and lead vocalist Greg Lake, keyboard player Ian McDonald, and lyricist Peter Sinfield.<br />The best track on the album is the first, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" with its big main riff and jazz-rock middle section (\\"Mirrors\\"). The music is somewhat distorted at times, but that does not stop the group's musical virtuosity from coming through. As you would expect from the title, the song paints a picture of dystopian future that embodies the worst tendencies of the late 1960s, and remains the standard by which other progressive rock epics are judged. In terms of political sensibilities nothing comes close. The song also stands out because the following track, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" is more folk-rock and constitutes a sort of cleansing of the palate before proceeding to the rest of the album (it is actually a song members of the group had played on earlier efforts).<br />The title track is not the best King Crimson song, but it is probably their best known one (and the one song that was written just by McDonald and Sinfeld). The conceit is of a medieval court afflicted by a black queen, fire witch, and other equally dark images heading for total destruction. It is a daring finality, teetering on the brink of the sort of bombastic pomposity that often afflicted progressive rock (Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" with its synthesizer excess is the example that springs to mind). Musically on this album as a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent. When I was growing up the singing voice I most wanted to have was Greg Lake's, and this is the album when he sounds the best. The result is that \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is one of the albums that has to be considered when you are making a list of top albums from the Sixites or in the history of progressive rock music. It does not matter that King Crimson had a revolving door lineup and that it would take them years to come up with anything close to this classic album.Donald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent.

B000096H33|5.0|Is there room in this world for yet another Tubular Bells spin-off? Apparently Yes. The original is beyond reproach, warts and all, but Oldfield still decided that now was the time to re-record it, rather than release another variation on a theme as with the orchestral version, live version and TB2 ¡V all of which are terrific ¡V and TB3 which was only sporadically worthy of the name. However, since the Millennium Bell¡¦s shameless use of the iconic Tubular Bells logo for marketing purposes, and the wholly pointless ¡¥Best of Tubular Bells¡¦ it¡¦s understandable that interest may begin to wane. <br />Despite being a note-for-note remake ¡V even using exactly the same instruments as far as I can tell ¡V this is NOT a replacement for the beloved original, but a fresh sounding and beautifully recorded alternative. If the original was the sound of a shy young musician feverishly bringing his opus to life by grabbing whatever studio time he could, then TB2003 is the sound of a rich, mature musician with plenty of time on his hands to tweak, tinker and perfect as much as his heart desires. The difference is tangible.<br />It is not complete replica: one or two short sections have subtle changes and some sections do not work quite as well as on the original. For example the guitar heavy mid-section of  Part One of the original is better than the equivalent section on TB2003 (now called Blues, Thrash and Jazz for CD convenience). Also,  John Cleese¡¦s MC instrument introductions come across as a little too affected compared to Viv Stanshell¡¦s original, though this may be just a matter of getting used to it.<br />So, is it worth buying? Definitely yes if you loved the original as huge enjoyment can be had from spotting little differences and hearing the same instruments in glorious sound quality, and for those unfamiliar with the original this will still be a real treat for entirely different reasons. Having said that, if I¡¦m still around in another thirty years I imagine it will be the ¡¦73 version that will played the most on my old tin box. Now then, any chance of a new version of Hergest Ridge?<br />Favourite bits: Introduction; Finale; Harmonics; Peace.
037571412X|5.0|There seems to be just one main theme for Vidal - one he comes back to again and again: SEX.<br />As the author ages, so does the protagonist professor David Kepesh, age seventy and telling a story of eight years ago. At the center of the story is Consuela Castillo, of Cuban descent and then 24 years old. She has the most perfect female form, magnificent large breasts, an almost translucent white skin and black hair. She is just simply perfect, also in everything she does. This liaison lasts about a good year, stopping abruptly.<br />Some years later, Kepesh gets a call from Consuela, who needs his help and understanding. She has breast cancer, already lost her hair and will now lose one of her breasts.<br />Roth mainly writes about the juxtaposition of old age and youth. He finds that youth has its advantages, but they are not guaranteed. Consuela's youth and perfection are being destroyed, while Kepesh lives on. There is a lesson hidden here somewhere, and the lesson has to do with old age surviving. And that beauty is not reliable.

B000021XS0|5.0|This album is simply amazing. That's all I can say because I am so speechless.<br />For those of you that have Six Degrees - did you notice that the end of Finally Free leads into the beginning of The Glass Prison? Very cool indeed. Cheers Dream Theater.
B00003CX8T|5.0|Aladdin is a triumph for disney.  Along with Lion King, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I loved the Genie, voiced by Robin Williams, and his humorous antics and impersonations.  I couldn't stop humming along with the songs as they played.  The animations is spectacular for a disney movie.  I couldn't stop laughing at the scene where the Genie says, \\"...Jafar, Jafar, he's our man, if he can't do it..GREAT!\\"<br />And I loved how Iago was the perfect foil to Jafar, a serious villain.  I also enjoyed the love story that unravels around Aladdin and Jasmine.  Jasmine is the girl that every guy wants, and Aladdin is the sweet, handsome young man that every girl dreams of.  I also enjoyed the personifications of the carpet, and his expressions.  Gilbert Godfried was the perfect voice for Iago.<br />I love everything about this movie, and can't wait 'till it comes out on DVD.  I've heard that it comes out in 2004.  I guarantee I'll be one of the first people to place an advanced order on Amazon.com for this DVD.<br />I loved it!
B000002IZ4|5.0|Meatplow/Interstate love song/vasoline... what great rock anthems.  Grunge aside, these songs would go to number one right now with a bullet.  All grunge was in the first place was just reborn black sabbath, with catchy hooks and sing song kiss like choruses.  This cd is great for those very reasons.  If you love music that you can tap your feet to, and listen without any worries in your mind, this is a great CD to do it with.
0393312836|5.0|This book is my favorite book of all time.  Burgess uses a self-made language here that's unique and out of this world.  By the middle, you will feel sorry for Alex, the main character, despite the terrible things he did in the beginning of the book.<br />This book will really get you thinking:<BR>1) Is it better to choose to be bad than to be forced to be good?<BR>2) Are we still human if we don't have the right to choose what we want to become?<br />You will learn that even if we do have a 'perfect citizen', the problem might not be the person him/herself, but society.
B000002J2F|5.0|This cd is very good. As much as I hate to admit it.  I am not a fan of the Collins era Genesis, but this one really is great stuff.  I do not think any other genesis with PC holds a candle to this recording.  And Yes, I do not like the song MISUNDERSTANDING, it is just P. Collins pop slime.<br /><br />But let me restate my problem with the song 'Misunderstanding'.  First of all, it is not totally a bad song.  It is however, very badly placed.  It jumps into the CD without any introduction.. and it doesn't follow the theme of the rest of the songs.  This is a theme/concept CD about a Princess and her travels etc... and then blammo MISUNDERSTANDING muscles it way into the middle of it.  That is the whole jamming up of the music.  I re edit the CD and burned it without the song included and it sounds much better.  It seems to me that they wrote this song for the label, so they could market a hit.. and perhaps that made future Genesis CD's possible, but still it really felt like a party crasher song.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is very very good, and holds well in the genesis catalog.<br /><br />I think anyone who wants to see what Genesis was without Peter Gabriel, or before Genesis became a hit single machine in the 80's, this is the CD to pick up.<br /><br />very nice and the songs are masterful, sans misunderstanding.
B000001IQH|5.0|Yes, the guy has a horrible voice, and he's not even trying to sound good, but I just really like this album.  It's funny and it gets me all energenic.

B00004YX39|5.0|At this writing, we are awaiting &quot;Everything Must Go.&quot;  Fans looking to round out their Steely Dan collection must get this album.  It is viewed by some as an end-of-career scrap pile by a couple of burnouts.  This view is 100 percent erroneous.  &quot;Let it Be,&quot; this ain't. This album is a worthy sequel to &quot;Aja,&quot; their consensus classic, and on at least five of its seven songs, approaches the same level of quality.  If anything, it's spare funk arrangements (i.e. the great &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot; and &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;) foreshadow the band's direction, 20 years later, on &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; and the various solo albums, especially &quot;Kamakiriad.&quot;  As with &quot;Aja&quot; and their other classics, each song is unique, compelling, and brilliantly executed.  &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot; is probably the best example (on a short list admittedly) of a perfect jazz-rock-big band fusion, and it's thrilling, and very fresh today.  Steely Dan has an aesthetic all its own, derived from the Beats, from Duke Ellington, from Bob Dylan, and from their own noir view of life.  This aesthetic acheives perfect realization on &quot;Gaucho&quot; and don't let any jaded critics mislead you to the contrary.
B000002J1L|5.0|This CD is fun.  It is die hard PROG ROCK but fun.  Lyrics border on the amusing, and Peter Sings them with vigor tongue and cheek... this is often not found in Prog music, since it tends to be very serious affairs to be in a Prog Band, but PETER GABRIEL just whips it good on this outing. I highly recommend this recording, but DO NOT FORGET Trespass or Foxtrot OR Selling England by the Pound OR OR OR Lamb Lies Down On Broadway... this is the greatest five prog recordings in a row by any group, even YES.  Nobody did such wonderful prog music for five releases in a row.  Just the greatest influence of underground Prog ever.
0312305060|3.0|Michael Cunningham sensitively describes the lives of women. He also sympathetically takes us into the minds of homosexual people, making us wonder, and then making us see. His flowers, furniture, artefacts - even his cake - are believable. His smells are credible, and his textures.<br />This is a book written with three protagonists of equal importance, and yet, one is seen as being the fulcum, the raison d'etre of the whole work. Without Virginia Woolf, there would have been no Mrs Brown. Without Mrs Brown, there would have been no Richard. Without Richard, Clarissa's role in the story is meaningless. This is a clever way to build a book. It is also a clever way to give modern readers an insight into what it meant to be a writer in the 1930s; what it meant to be gay or a lesbian at other times apart from the present. It gives one a yen to find out - if one has not already - what \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" is all about. What novels of the 30s were like.<br />Virginia Woolf's trials and tribulations were very real. At the outset and the end of writing a novel, she would experience hellish episodes any novelist would relate to! She was creating a watershed, and it took its toll. Novel writing has never been the same since she created her protagonists all those years ago.<br />She actually made them think confused thoughts: made them vacillate, wonder, crave different things at different times, so at variance with how readers were used to thinking characters should behave. Characters hardly thought before - they rarely experienced ambiguity of any kind, let alone sexual.<br />Michael Cunningham takes Woolf's groundbreaking ways and how they affected her, and pulls them three ways, joining them together when we all finally realise who Richard is. After he slips off the edge, we find out who he really is.<br />Yes, real people question themselves. Yes, real people find themselves withdrawing from those they love. Yes, real people do vacillate, buy flowers for the wrong people and for the wrong reasons. Yes, real people do note the colour of the finger food they eat at things like book launches and award parties. Yes, real people try to top themselves and fail, ending up outliving all the ones who displeased, enraged or enthralled them.<br />It's not such a hard book to believe.<br />Still, I wonder whether I would have liked a more dramatic ending. And perhaps it is rather demanding of the reader to present a set of characters all of whom are to a greater or lesser extent homosexual. But it is a premise one decides to accept after the first 30 pages. It is a view into the lives of THESE characters, the ones the author has chosen to show us, in these hours.<br />\\"The Hours\\" is just that... the space of a day into which are crowded the fortunes, reasons, motives and lots, of a bunch of women.

Just being able to have all of this rare footage in one convienient package is enough in itself, but with all the extras.....it's just amazing. I understand that some people will b**ch and moan about it having most of the same tracks as The Song Remains the Same (which I also own), but the preformances are different. Zep just has a way of varing their live stuff to make it different and enthusiastic. It's kinda hard to put into words....you know? Anyway, it's a must for even the occasional Zep fan. w00t!
B000002J1O|5.0|Although Genesis didn't invent Prog, and there is a lot of debate who did, they certainly made it a viable musical alternative in the early 70s.  With classically wonderful prog tunes like Firth of Fifth and The Battle Of Epping Forest along with CINEMA SHOW, this cd continues to play in my cd player with regularity.  Similar in scope to the FOXTROT recording, but with a bit more ease of production, you have Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett and Tony Banks making wonderful music.. and Phil Collins just drums.. thank god.
B000089A07|5.0|i watched manhunter on recommendation of a few friends and was bored. the characterizations in that movie were flat and cold. but with red dragon, everything's changed. this is the first time that i've seen a remake that's better than the original. edward norton as will graham added so much more depth to the character. and the beginning shots, where they established the relationship between lecter and graham was perfect. i also really enjoyed ralph fiennes' portrayal of dolarhyde. in the first one, the killer was large, ugly and looked monstrous. with this one, fiennes' defect was more subtle, and was monstrous only to him. also, the establishment of a cruelty-filled childhood gave the killer a more sympathetic side. all in all a great movie.
0684833395|5.0|...I had heard the term \\"catch - 22\\" for years, and I knew there was a book of the same name. That's all I knew. Then, one afternoon while listening to National Public Radio, probably NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, or Radio Times, I heard one of the guests describing Joseph Heller's Catch - 22 as an exceptionally great American novel. I was almost finished with an Anthony Robbins self-help book when I heard the NPR interview, so I walked to the prison library to check it out. Heller's Catch - 22, a Voltaire-like satire of the military's rigidity had me laughing from page one.<br />Heller uses a dry wit to poke fun at the obsequious, phony interactions between military personnel. As Voltaire's Candid brought to surface the hypocrisy that comes with institutional thought patterns in general, and organized religion in particular, Heller makes readers laugh by bringing his protagonist into contact with his superiors, his equals, his subordinates, and civilians. As a federal prisoner, I live in the midst of the same culture Heller describes. Catch - 22 reminds readers that institutions and the insular culture they propagate cause many of the personnel who work for institutions to forget that we're all human beings and not part of a bureaucratic machine.<br />Heller uses each chapter in Catch - 22 to dramatize another ludicrous episode of military life. We laugh while reading how individuals become blinded by their positions and the power that comes with rank. In several chapters we follow one ingenious military man as he exploits the greed of human nature to build a massive military-sanctioned black market enterprise, the syndicate, in which \\"everyone has a share\\"; enabling them to profit through layered global transactions that frequently deal with war-time enemies.

It not only made me laugh, but also inspires me as a writer. One day I hope to emulate Heller and Voltaire by writing a satire in the same vein, exposing the absurdity and waste of the criminal justice system in general, and prisons in particular.
0767802470|3.0|\\"Das Boot\\" is probably the best and most honest World War II submarine movie ever made.<br />I do have some quibbles with the DVD, however.<br />I began watching it with English sound and English captions. But it was hard to follow because the words on the screen often differed drastically from the words being spoken.  Whoever did the English captions probably didn't use the English version of the movie. My guess is that the captions were translated directly from the German soundtrack.<br />I ended up watching the movie with German sound and  English captions.<br />Secondly, the \\"Making of Das Boot\\" item in the Special Features menu leaves much to be desired. Compared to the \\"Making of\\" features on the DVD versions of \\"American Graffiti\\" and \\"1941\\" it's woefully lacking.<br />I was hoping for a shot of a bird landing on the U-boat miniature, or at least a modicum of detail on the genesis, casting and production of the movie.
0684833395|5.0|As a long-term prisoner, I'm frequently struck with the comical absurdity of the rigid rules and manner in which adult human beings interact inside the federal bureau of prisons. It doesn't matter whether one is held at USP Leavenworth, or the federal prison camp at FPC Montgomery. A pecking order of personnel exists in every institution which mandates that staff members who want to advance must like the boots of their supervisors, enforce and support every rule assiduously regardless of the ridiculousness of the rule itself. No staff member can befriend or fraternize with a prisoner. Although prison guards fancy titular titles like correctional professionals, they not only fail to \\"correct\\" anything, but they absolutely thwart the progress of individuals who aspire to grow. Living as a prisoner places one in a perennial catch-22.<br />I had heard the term \\"catch - 22\\" for years, and I knew there was a book of the same name. That's all I knew. Then, one afternoon while listening to National Public Radio, probably NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, or Radio Times, I heard one of the guests describing Joseph Heller's Catch - 22 as an exceptionally great American novel. I was almost finished with an Anthony Robbins self-help book when I heard the NPR interview, so I walked to the prison library to check it out. Heller's Catch - 22, a Voltaire-like satire of the military's rigidity had me laughing from page one.<br />Heller uses a dry wit to poke fun at the obsequious, phony interactions between military personnel. As Voltaire's Candid brought to surface the hypocrisy that comes with institutional thought patterns in general, and organized religion in particular, Heller makes readers laugh by bringing his protagonist into contact with his superiors, his equals, his subordinates, and civilians. As a federal prisoner, I live in the midst of the same culture Heller describes. Catch - 22 reminds readers that institutions and the insular culture they propagate cause many of the personnel who work for institutions to forget that we're all human beings and not part of a bureaucratic machine.<br />Heller uses each chapter in Catch - 22 to dramatize another ludicrous episode of military life. We laugh while reading how individuals become blinded by their positions and the power that comes with rank. In several chapters we follow one ingenious military man as he exploits the greed of human nature to build a massive military-sanctioned black market enterprise, the syndicate, in which \\"everyone has a share\\"; enabling them to profit through layered global transactions that frequently deal with war-time enemies. In other chapters Heller entertains us by exposing the insecurities and pettiness of high-ranking officers; it's funny to see those whom the officers belittled and stepped on earlier become direct superiors later in the novel.<br />Heller's Catch - 22 is so powerful that he book's title became a dictionary work defining paradox.

One day I hope to emulate Heller and Voltaire by writing a satire in the same vein, exposing the absurdity and waste of the criminal justice system in general, and prisons in particular.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Finally an opportunity to witness the great gigs at Earls Court 1975!!<BR>As a true Zep-fan, owning all official releases and let's say, some less official ones..(very strong recommendation : For Badgeholders Only, LA Forum, 1977), I am really excited about this visual carrier of THE WORLD'S MOST ASTONISHING LIVE ROCK ACT. <BR>Unfortunately, I was too young in the seventies to even realize what Led Zep was all about.<BR>In 1995 I grabbed my chance to see Page/Plant on tour in the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam. Nobody can take that breathtaking event away from me!<BR>However, I still wondered what it would be to travel back in time, and be there when they were at their best.<BR>Finally we all can!<BR>For newcomers I can only say : use those 20 bucks and discover what it's all about!! <BR>Hope Jimmy will work in the future to release some of their 1977 gigs as well.<BR>Finally, in 2003, some more thrilling live footage.<BR>The spirit remains the same.
B000000993|5.0|This is a great cd! But I must warn you..this is a cd wich grows on you. You can't say anything about it after the first listening and also after the next few listenings. Let it settle down on you. Give it some time.<br />Tool is unique. You can understand what I'm saying when you hear \\"Flood\\". That's one of my favorite songs on Undertow, the real Tool-sound.<BR>All songs are very good but the last track, \\"Disgustipated\\" is very abstract. <BR>\\"Swamp Song\\" is another favorite of mine because it is so aggressive. You can feel the power of it. <BR>And what do I have to say about \\"Sober\\"? This song sounds really sad..very emotional but very good. A real classic, together with \\"Prison Sex\\".<br />After all..everyone has another taste in music so I can't say wich songs you will like and I can't even say if you're gonna like this cd. You'll have to find it out for yourself.
B000002L7Y|5.0|I Adored this album in the 80's and lately I have been finding myself listening to it and it still hasn't lost it's appeal and I still find it refreshing,it's a work of art.This and Aha'a second album&quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; to me are the best this band has ever released to this day,and yes I have listen to their latest work and it's not bad but they seem to have lost a element or should I say &quot;kick&quot; or &quot;edge&quot; that their first two album's had.And perhaps the direction they went was a good change for them as musicians. I honestly believe that this band never did get the credit here in the states that they SHOULD of deserved and &amp; sadly the 1980's was not a good time to be a labled a &quot;pretty boy band&quot; if you actually had some serious musical talent to offer.To me the best songs on this album are Train Of Thought,Hunting High And Low &amp; The Sun Always Shines on TV.If your a 80's synth pop fan or into  synth pop in general this album is a must have to add to your collection,a MUST! :)
B00005B36H|5.0|Ok guys, this is the most beautyful music I have ever heard. I own this cd for more than a year now and I never listened to a cd that much. Really amazing stuff! Everything just fits so perfectly together here. Great sound quality. This album has everything: From hard rock to very relax music. <br />Well...I can say a lot of this album but I think you will have to find it out for yourself because this is just my opinion.<BR>I would like to say that the tittle track &quot;Lateralus&quot; is my favorite. It haves it all.<br />Lateralus is the most perfect Tool album to date. All band members are doing the best they can.<BR>If you are going to buy another Tool cd then I recommend Undertow.<br />Well, go out and buy this cd!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Outstanding! This live CD will be considered one of the best live concerts of all time. The recording sounds very contempory even though it is 31 years old. Page, with his extended guitar solos, and Plant, the peak years of his voice, sound great, but it is Bonham that may be the most impressive. His play was the backbone of Zeppelin.<br />Do get this if your young or old, you will not hear this type of hard/heavy/blues rock played in this day and age. The songs are classics and Zeppelin's live creativity distinguishes them from their studio recordings. <br />This album is how Led Zeppelin should be heard!
B00008J2DQ|2.0|for 15.00 bucks, dont bother.  if you have the previous two, good enough.  the other two cd's had a track or two that &quot;grabbed&quot; you...this one, same riffs...same sully voice,etc etc. they've resorted to(aka limp biskit) using the F word as the tittle of a song.  i am a fan of this so-called genre of music and i know the faithfull will be mad that i wrote this, but let the buyer beware.  sadly,it's another long awaited cd by a band i really liked that is at par or less w/their previous efforts.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you are drawn to female vocalists, then you'll be drawn to Evanescence. <br />Like many, the first song I heard from the group was Bring Me Back To Life, and I loved it. The group filled a void in the &quot;nu&quot; rock genre championed by the likes of Lincoln Park, POD and others. That void? No female vocalists. Amy Lee, though, has filled that void, and did so in style.<br />She is a strong vocalist who can belt out the loud ones, but at the same time, give an emotional depth to the softer tunes. Her band supports her with good guitar rifts, base lines and beats, letting her navigate the music with her rich voice.<br />I am definitely hooked on Fallen.
B0000029DD|4.0|a friend of mine gave me this album, and honestly, the first time i listened to it, I hated it. Absolutely detested it. it wasn't 'my type of music' i didn't like his voice, his lyrics didn't seem to flow and hey how long can you listen to raw emotion being pushed through a falsetto? But then the more I listened to it the more i realized that it was like listening to your brother singing. It doesn't always sound the best, but eventually something clicks and you realize that you like it just becasue of either what you already knew about or becasue of what you learned about him from his singing. In the case of this album, it's the latter.
B000089RVX|5.0|Let's face it. The best thing about Evanescence is Amy Lee. The first time I heard them, I thought oh no, not another Linkin Park. Thankfully I allowed myself to sample their other songs and boy, was I blown away. The music isn't anything groundbreaking. Sure, most tracks on \\"Fallen\\" are infectious and it doesn't hurt to keep it in your CD player for yonks. But what draws your attention and keeps you interested are most certainly the vocals.<br />Don't expect Evanescence to sound like Linkin Park. They are neither Christian rock nor goth nu-metal. And I wouldn't exactly call them goth. Instead of trying to categorize them, I'll just run through the songs. Everyone's taste differs so I'm not going to 'grade' them.<br />\\"Going Under\\" is a pretty suitable opener. You immediately get a taste of Amy Lee's wonderful vocal ability. \\"Bring Me To Life\\" has been played to death. The demo version does not have any rapping, which may be what some of you are looking for. \\"Everybody's Fool\\" comes along next in the same vein as the opening track.<br />One of my favourites is \\"My Immortal,\\" the best ballad on the album (in my humble opinion). It's a beautiful piece, rendered even more poignant with Amy's expressive voice. As nice as the orchestration in the background is, I prefer the stripped down version on \\"Origin,\\" which sounds much more moving.<br />\\"Haunted\\" is another slow number, perhaps more melodic than the others. As the title leads you to believe, it borders on gothic rock. At the halfway point, \\"Tourniquet\\" picks up the pace with more lyrics of longing.<br />The next track \\"My Imaginary\\" is relatively slow with nice flowing keyboards - one of the better songs on the album. \\"Taking Over Me\\" has really grown on me and turned into one of my favourites, which incidentally happens to be another song about longing for someone out of reach.<br />Ballad #2 comes in the form of \\"Hello.\\" Very nice and simple with a cello thrown in for good measure, while giving Amy room to showcase her talent. \\"My Last Breath\\" starts off with some synthesizers, and is the weakest track for me, even after several listens. Finally, \\"Fallen\\" closes with another highlight, \\"Whisper.\\" With choir-like background vox, it draws the album to an end with a dramatic flourish.<br />The reason why I'm giving \\"Fallen\\" 5 stars is pretty obvious. Not to say the rest of the band is horrible. Evanescence churns out some pretty good stuff, or I wouldn't be listening to this repeatedly for hours. Do yourself a favour and grab a copy of this CD for your collection.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie is honestly the best I have ever seen. I first saw the original version in my history class and I fell in love with it. Now it is unusual for a 15-year-old girl to go crazy over a historical drama, so you know it's not just any movie. The story is timeless. The elements that made it win Oscars (the costumes, makeup, location, and acting) is amazing! Tom Hulce was one of my favorite actors anyway, but he really shines as Mozart. F. Murray Abraham gives the performance of a lifetime. And the music ties it all together. It gave me a new respect for classical music and opera.
B00005RDRO|3.0|A comedy that delivers much less than it promises. Quite disappointing, really, given the magnificent talent behind it. Not that they didn't try. In fact, they try too hard! So hard, they should have titled it \\"Murder by Overkill\\"! To waste a cast like that in such silliness ought to be punishable by law, for rather than a witty parody on the great detectives of fiction the film ends up spoofing those \\"Wacky Races\\" cartoons, where teams of allegedly \\"funny\\" characters -each with its own gimmick- try to outwit the others to win a prize. They even drive distinctive cars accordingly!<br />So don't expect this to be \\"The Ladykillers\\", just to kill some time.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Hybrid Theory was OK.  Correction: It was below average.  But now, the band has chosen not to develop, but instead keep up it's un-innovative, cliched, terrible sound.  They are just the most mainstream of a genre with very narrow boundries, and one that takes 2 genres which sound great alone but terrible together and mixes them together.  Rap and metal don't mix.  The slews of modern metal bands that have been inspired by KoRn and Limp Bizkit are destroying the music industry, and this is just another one.  If many of the impressionable youth are creating bands to sound like Linkin Park and their similar counterparts, then they have really missed the mark.  If these guys are going to be the future of music, then the hard rock/metal community is [in bad shape].  Don't waste your money.  It is nothing new.  The only reason the band didn't change their sound is because IT WILL SELL!!!  Excruciating.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is by far one of the greatest films put out by Disney during its Golden Age.  Before the age of Toy Story, The Lion King, and the rest of today's popular Disney productions, the film's were made for more than just kids.  I highly recommend Sleeping Beauty for its beautiful animation, believable and imaginitive characters, and fast-paced story line.  Its a wonderful movie for the whole family, not just the kids.  It is the best example of Disney at its best.
B000002UUX|5.0|I've been a long time Megadeth fan, and I've listened to everything they've ever released.(I think) This album definitely stands out to me. The songs on this album are excellent examples of well-crafted, creative, ...kicking metal. I never get bored or tired of listening to these tracks. I'm not a veteran at writing reviews, but I'll try to give a track-by-track to my best ability.<br />Holy Wars...The Punishment Due-<BR>An excellent track. These are some seriously fast riffs. And the fingerpicked/spanish thing that makes the transition is great.<br />Hangar 18-<BR>This was the first Megadeth song I ever heard. Definitely one of their greatest. This song features some of the finest soloing that I've come across with Dave and Marty trading off.<br />Take No Prisoners-<BR>I actually learned this song for a guitar competition a year ago. This is one REALLY fast song, with some sweet bass chops too.<br />Five Magics-<BR>This one has a very cool bass intro. The last half of the song blows me away with the solo and the frantic riffage.<br />Poison Was the Cure-<BR>A great song. The intro is with bass again, and kicks.... The solo in this song is really good, with a lot of feel. GREAT ending.<br />Lucretia-<BR>Sweet. This song is great to listen to when you want to headbang.<br />Tornado of Souls-<BR>Oh man. This is my all-time favorite Megadeth song; definitely some of the best metal EVER written. From start to finish this song is absolutely amazing. There are SO MANY different riffs, and the vocals rock. The guitar work on this song is not to be ignored. There is so much feeling and good stuff in this song, I can listen to it all day. The solo in this song is without a doubt, one of the most moving I have heard. It goes all-out.<br />Dawn Patrol-<BR>Dave Ellefson displays some excellent bass skill in this song. Kind of different, but still good.<br />Rust in Peace...Polaris-<BR>This song has a really good chorus, I've always liked Dave's singing style. A great end to a great album.<br />And that's that. So, if you like metal or Megadeth at all and you don't have this album, do yourself a favor and pick it up. It's one of the best.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Not usually a blues fan, I fell in love wth this CD and it has been playing non-stop since I bought it.  Its great for driving, hanging out, or calming down. Her unique sound is refreshing from today's flamboyant pop music where image is more important than the sound.  Definitly two thumbs up!
B00008MNYS|4.0|About time!!!  LOVE this album.  Being from the UK I have watched Robbie through the days of \\"Take That' to now, and he just keeps getting better and better.  The songs on this album have a lot more feeling than his others, maybe he's maturing in his old age!  It is still an album that you can 'rock' to and enjoy.  He should be A LOT bigger in the USA than he is.  He has said that this is the place he would like to conquer, so lets hope he can do it with this one.<br />  Nice one Robbie!!!
1563898586|4.0|i had heard about the LoEG movie coming out, and i heard later that it was based on a comic book. being a new comic fan, i went out and got this, and i was impressed! the art is great, the premise is fantastic, the plot development is superb and these guys do a marvelous job of giving it that 19th century feel (the language, etc). if you have never read LoEG and want to start, start with this book. it is the first few issues where everyone is introduced, and it is just fabulous!<br />this has been Apollyon
B00005NG9Z|5.0|man oh man, i love Alice in Chains. this is a great music DVD. it has all of the bands music videos (and there are quite a few of them) as well as a little bit of footage of the band just chilling out. it has two videos for the song \\"We Die Young;\\" the one played on MTV and the original one that was made by someone at the Seattle Art Institute. if you ask me, the latter is much better. if you are a Chains fan, i would highly reccomend your purchase of this DVD...
0156027321|5.0|I really wanted my husband (a staunch atheist)to read this book, but because he didn't read it fast enough, I found myself telling him the whole story in a Japanese restaurant.  I am stunned by how much I not only enjoyed reading this book, but also telling it.  I find myself tempted to tell it to all my friends, but wouldn't want them to miss out on Yann Martel's beautiful writing.  This book did not make me believe in God, but even better, it made me decide to live my life as though there was one.  The outcome is the same, so why not choose the story with the animals.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I love this cd. Hands down one of the greatest cds of all time. You gotta listen to the lyrics tho, u dont kno cds until u pay attention to the lyrics. 2Pac is a true artist, this man is deep wit his s**t. The number 1 song on this is Ambitionz Az A Ridah....he talks about the beef wit Biggie, about the rap game and his reincarnation....speakin true lines(this life as a rap star is nothin without heart). Shorty Wanna Be A Thug is off the hook (One of my favorites). No More Pain is bumpin wit a crazy beat, Straight puttin it down wit a piano. In Heartz Of Men he talks about the rap game. 2 Of Amerika'z Most Wanted is a classic hit, Snoop rips it. Besides those hits the baddest joints on it are: Can't C Me, Rather Be Ya N***a,I Ain't Mad At Cha, Picture Me Rollin', All Eyez On Me, Run The Streets, Only God Can Judge Me, All Bout U and of course California Love (Remix) even tho the original is better, they still put it down 4 Cali. Get this album, listen to it, put it down for Pac and keep it real. Recognize Tha Bay. Cali 4 life.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee has a voice that is haunting as well as beautiful.And the dark metal riffs on each and every song are a great background to this amazing female talent.How can you relate this music to Linkin Park(of which I like).This cd is stirring and kind of scary at parts.I will listen to this album over and over because of the emotion she puts into each and every song.Great Buy!!!!
B000096H33|5.0|After a 25-year clause in his contract with the EVIL Richard Branson of the Virgin mega-empire, Mike Oldfield was able to re-record his defining masterpiece.  This album alone has influenced more musicians during the last 30-years then I dare say Mozart, Bach, and Beethoven (even though the Introduction of Tubular Bells is based on a section from Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D-minor) or anyone else's instrumental music.  You can even hear a copy cat variation of TB's Introduction in the 50-cent hit \\"In Da Club.\\"  Even Janet Jackson used Tubular Bells in her hit \\"The Velvet Rope.\\"  <br />This re-recording is hopefully the last we will hear of the Tubular Bells franchise.  I do believe that Mike kept making TB albums (TB2 and TB3) to deal with his own disappointment with the original and not being able to re-record his original.  Tubular Bells 2003 is TB the way it should sound.  The beauty of the melodies is truly brought out in this recording!  Every track from the original 1973 version is brought to life and given a new life in TB2003 - while remaining faithful to it's roots.  The only downfall of this re-recording is the use of synths in sections.  In my opinion that is what dates an album - keyboard synths.  According to Oldfield only 10 percent of this album is keyboard and 90 percent is played by hand.  <br />Some of the highlights of this album is the beautiful and constant use of the Mandolin.  Breathtaking!!  In the track 'Harmonics' you can hear, about 30 seconds in, a beautiful vocal by Sally Oldfield (Mike's sister) - very haunting!  <br />The strong points in this album are the more relaxing tracks - Latin, A Minor Tune, Ghost Bells, Russian, Harmonics, Peace, and Ambient Guitars.  <br />One of my favourite tracks is the track 'Blues'.  Haunting and when you aren't expecting it, the track blows up into this heavy Blues guitar - full throttle!  <br />'Thrash' was a bit of a disappointment as it didn't do as I thought it should have - seemed a little too programmed and perfect.  <br />'Finale' is very good and John Cleese adds a subtle humor to his MC's of the instruments in his Basil Fawlty-esque voice.  As opposed to Alan Rickman's MC'ing on Tubular Bells 2 (1992) - Classy.  Mike does employ the use of real Tubular Bells instead of keyboard bells - nice and refreshing change from the other bell albums.  For those who understand time signatures - the track bounces along nicely a constant 4/4 (as in club music beats.)  After John Cleese annouces 'PLUS Tubular Bells' the beat changes - with the beat on 1 and 3 instead of a constant 1-2-3-4.  Took some getting used to.  The drums are electronic - I believe.<br />Funny really Tubular Bells has now employeed two Harry Potter stars Alan Rickman (Professor Snape) on TB2 and John Cleese (Nearly-Headless Nick) on TB2003.  Now my favourite album and book series have something in common! :)<br />The 'Caveman' section is indeed a big change from the original 1973 version.  There is a cavewoman with the caveman.  And an army of Cavemen in sections - nice touch!  The only complaint with this track is the use of electronic-esque drums.  For those who care and are wondering why you have this screaming Caveman in the first place need not wonder anymore... In 1972 when Mike was trying to get a record company to buy into Tubular Bells, they all told him to throw some vocals on there and they'd consider it.  Well, Mike in his sense of humor got trashed one night during the one-week of recording given to him by Richard Branson - hence all the technical imperfections in the original -Mike started screaming at the top his lungs into a microphone and then replied to the record companies by saying 'here's those vocals you asked for!'  It was also based on an archeologist hoax of that time called 'Piltdown Man.' Subtle humor really.  The screaming caveman and woman sound alot like two Star Trek Klingons speaking Klingon and Mike is a huge fan of Star Trek - go fig! :)  <br />The Sailors Hornpipe - otherwise known to American's as the Popeye theme - is cleaned up and sounds more brilliant than ever.<br />As for the most famous part of TB - the Introduction - made famous through its use in William Blakes 'Exorcist' is brilliant in its sound quality.  The only unusual change is the synth bass played by way of midi on an actual guitar.<br />Whether this remake will hold up in the test of time as the original 1973 version did- is up to time itself.  Either way Tubular Bells will remain one of rock music's classic albums which will brave the tests of time to still be remembered in 50 years and beyond - as Beethovens Nineth Symphony (Ode to Joy).  As a matter of fact, I do believe it was Rolling Stone magazine who stated that Tubular Bells is rocks equivalent to Beethoven's Nineth.  <br />Bottom line - BUY THIS CD!!!  You will NOT be disappointed!!!  Plus you will hopefully be sending a message to Mike's record company - that Mike Oldfield still has a fan base here in America and they should release this album here and Canada.  We shouldn't have to constantly import his music.  And the RIAA wonders why people just download music instead of purchasing it.  MAKE IT AVAILABLE at a reasonable price in our country and we wouldn't need to download it!!!  wink wink ;)  <br />PS I have bought - in spite of the outrageous import price - the Complete TB and TB2003 single album.  PLEASE SUPPORT MIKE OLDFIELD - BUY THE ALBUM!!!
B000002KLZ|3.0|Certainly not a must have live recording, but definitely loaded with compelling moments. The live performance opens strongly with Monday Morning and Say That You Love Me. Other highlights include the touching Christine McVie sung Over and Over. Like the drums on that one. Don't Let Me Down is very catchy with spunky guitar and vocals by Lindsay. The vocal harmonies on Farmer's Daughter are well done and Fireflies has a good edgy tone. I'm So Afraid is super fierce rocker.<br />The rest of the tracks are OK but just don't have that special kick in a live setting. Not That Funny drags on a bit. Lindsay's yelping can be nerve racking at times. Sara is a bit dull with the same chord sequence being a little patience trying. One More Lonely Night is nothing special and the live versions of Dreams and Go Your Own Way do not vary enough from the original versions to make them especially interesting.<br />This is more of a collection for big time fans. Those not especially interested in this band can surely pass on this batch.
B00008PX8P|5.0|WOW!  ,    This is well worth buying for the die-hard zep fans.<BR>I especially like on disc 2 where they do the UN-Plugged set.<BR>Great to see Bonzo banging again.<BR>And Plant's Soprano singing is in fine form.<BR>Also Page really tears it up in his wide range of guitar sounds.<BR>Many extras also.     Plus it sounds Great !       ZOSO
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Fleetwood Mac put out many solid records in the seventies and eighties.  Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham, and Christine McVie were capable of blending their vocal styles with the fine rhythm accents of Mick Fleetwodd and John McVie.<br />On Say You Will, Christine McVie does not participate as a full fledged member.  Her absence of warm grounded very focused songs expose the weaknesses of Lindsay's excessive ranting and Stevie's obsession with mystical imageries.  Also, the keyboard presence is mostly limited to synthesizer and programming effects which certainly grows tiresome over the course of an eighteen song collection.<br />Nonetheless, there are several good songs on this collection.  Peacekeeper is undoubtedly the best tune on this CD with hope of recovery in a world in turmoil.  Say You Will and What's The World Comming to are catchy tunes that a first time listener will enjoy right away.<br />Other moments:  Come has some stunning electric guitar solos.  Say Goodbye has a compelling acoustic guitar passage.  Miranda and Smile At You feature some nice vocal harmonies and arrangements.<br />However, Murrow Turning Over In His Grave and Red Rover have weak song structures and overdo the manic Lindsay Buckingham stylings.  Goodbye Baby is just plain dull and too many other pieces are unmemorable and too mystical.  Like other commenters have suggested, this CD should have been much shorter.<br />Maybe die hard fans will desire this, but it is not an essential recording by any means.
0393317552|3.0|There was so much information that I lost the author's point.  Granted, this was my first book on the topic.  I was very interested in the random facts and I may have to read it again to cement everything together.
B000069KE0|5.0|What a difference between early Chicago and the latter day baladeering band that claims the same name. Chicago 2 is fully loaded with stunning guitar work by Terry Kath, awesome horn and flute arrangments, and super vocal performances. Terry Kath carries the lion's share of the lead vocals and is especially strong on Colour My World, Make Me Smile, Movin'In, and The It Better End Soon Suite. Peter Cetera and Robert Lamm also contribute nicely on other tracks.<br /><br />What really hammers the experience home for me is the numerous styles. Sometimes big band flavored, other times Chicago sounds like an essemble adding pleasing string quartet stylings. Then of course there are the many ferocious rockers featuring super guitar solos mixed in with nice piano and brass.<br /><br />If you are going to forego the compilation route, this is a Chicago collection to grab at once.

B00006LSM3|4.0|The second ex-Beatle to leave this life has left behind a fitting memorial to a musical career that had its bright spots, but was filled with varying degrees of frustration at times. <br />The \\"quiet Beatle\\" comes on strong with \\"Brainwashed,\\" Harrison's final album which was completed posthumously by former ELO leader Jeff Lynne and Harrison's son, Dhani. Most, if not all, of the songs on \\"Brainwashed\\" were written while Harrison was sick with the cancer which would eventually take his life and several of the tunes reveal an introspective frame of mind. Notable among these are: \\"Looking For My Life,\\" \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud,\\" and \\"Rising Sun;\\" all reveal the soul-searching that the man was going through at that time.<br />The album opens with the up-tempo and bluesy \\"Any Road,\\" which has an unforgettable tag line: \\"If you don't know where you're going/any road will take you there. . .\\" It ends, fittingly, with the title track, which is Harrison's view on the state of today's world, with which I largely agree, and a fervent hope for a spiritual revival in the future, which we all need. Harrison's deep spiritual convictions are strong here and are encountered here and there throughout the album.<br />All-in-all, \\"Brainwashed\\" is a fitting memorial to a great musician who was overshadowed by Lennon & McCartney in the Beatles and was unfairly underrated throughout much of his career. I rate it a must-buy for Beatle fans who haven't heard much of Harrison's solo efforts. Definitely a must-have item for us Harrison fans.<br />We'll miss you, George, but you left us some wonderful memories.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Interesting band Zeppelin is, but being from the church of punk rock I've always had a healthy distaste for the muck of Zeppelin's studio work. <BR>But as much as the long over bloated pig of a dinosaur rock band created an aura of self-importance on its studio work and in its later live shows this three-disc set caught me off guard. <BR>I've always respected the fret work of Jimmy Page and the ability to really throw it down of the band, but quite often they restrained themselves from really leveling audiences with real honest mouth-dropping eye-popping rock and roll. <BR>But not here. <BR>This is quite possibly one of the finest live albums ever. I absolutely hate to say that seeing as my listening habits lean much more toward the Ramones and the Clash than classic rock radio. But, fair is fair. Put this right up there with Jerry Lee Lewis' Live at the Star Club as a historical rock n roll document for all times. <BR>Take a bow Mr. Page, you finally did a good thing for real rock n roll.
B000002OZY|5.0|I got a record player in 2002 for my thirteenth birthday, and Tommy was the first album I got. (It's nearly impossible to find nowadays). Ever since I was a young boy and heard 'Pinball Wizard' on the radio, it has been my favorite album of all time, unequalled even by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin or any other band you can think of. They say it was the first real 'Rock Opera,' (I have to take their word, I wasn't around in '69) but this only adds to the greatness. Don't listen to that [stuff] about Quadrophenia being better, it can't even be compared to Tommy. (I'm not saying Quadrophenia [is bad], I am merely saying that Tommy kicks Butt.) I will admit that id listened to nothing but this for more than three months, it is that good. It seems to me that there are three different 'sounds' of the Who, pre-Tommy, when they sounded like a rebel garage band, Tommy, when they were at their finest, and post-Tommy when they were nothing short of phenomenal. Get this album as soon as possible, It is worth every penny and will provide a lifetime of pleasure. ;)
0345457684|5.0|Altered Carbon is a SF novel in the American detective story style.  It takes places at a time when humanity has spread to a few planets in other solar systems via slowboats.  However, humankind also has FTL communications, the ability to store and transfer digitized human personas, and the means to download such personas into sleeves:  human, clone, or synthetic bodies.    In this novel, Takeshi Kovacs is a retired Envoy, a super expediter who resolves offworld threats to human polities, often by violence.  As an Envoy, Kovacs had extensive experience in downloading into various sleeves.  Now he has the experience of resleeving on Earth, where few, if any, Envoys have been.  He has been contracted out to Laurens Bancroft, who was found dead in his own office and declared a suicide, but who insists that he would not have done such an act, particularly since he only lost 48 hours of experience.  Kovacs is to find the real cause of his death, whereupon he will be paid 100,000 UN dollars and his persona will be transmitted back to his home planet.    Leaving the download facility, Kovacs is intercepted by Lieutenant Ortega of the Bay City police.  He learns something about the case, but also discovers that the younger generations do not like the centuries old Meths -- Methuselahs -- such as Bancroft.  They have too much power and too much experience;  their lives are regulated by different rules than other people.    After meeting Bancroft, and his wife and friends, Kovacs tends to agree with Ortega.  However, even Meths have problems, such as Proposition 653, which requires any dead person, even Catholics, to be resleeved as needed, and if possible, to testify in court.      Then Kovacs meets Dimi the Twin in his hotel lobby.  He is introduced by the muzzle of Dimi's pistol on his neck and ordered to come along, but Kovacs pulls a fast trick that causes the hotel AI to cut loose at the kidnappers with a twin 20 mm cannon.  Although a bit of overkill, it does the job and Kovacs gets to meet Ortega again for another talk.    This novel builds upon several old themes in SF:  androids and clones, persona uploads, brain implants, etc., but the details are used in a very contemporary manner to drive a tale of immortality, free will, poverty, power, social degeneration, and corruption.  It may well breed sequels, but prior efforts to launch series about such tough detectives in SF settings have not been very successful.  The initial story oftens attracts readers with its rich futuristic background, but maybe the subsequent releases begin to feel stale?    This title has generated a fair amount of curiosity.  Somebody dining next to me in a restaurant actually interrupted my reading to ask what it meant.  Insofar as I can determine, altered carbon is a futuristic substance that provides enormous storage capabilities for digitized data.  Otherwise, it has no central importance to the novel.    Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys American style detective tales in a SF setting.    -Arthur W. Jordin
B000001GAM|5.0|I'm not going to win any friends in the musically conservative crowd. But they're dying out, so it doesn't matter.<br />Bruckner took Beethoven's stunning Ninth, added it to Wagner's megalomaniacal (and thus often Satanic) visions and came up with what being God must sound like. If you play this music while you read the opening chapters of Tolkien's Silmarillion you know Bruckner got the creation of the world right.<br />Here's the opinion that's going to lose me friends in the classical music crowd: I think that if you lifted some of Bruckner's melodies and harmonies and put them into fuzzy electric guitar, and added John Bonham-style drumming, you would truly have heavy metal music that lasts. Especially if the song went on for twenty five intense minutes. It would bring new meaning to the term heaviosity.
B000002O4S|5.0|I like this CD. It's full of obscure music from the 80s and two tracks of Back to the Future score.<BR>I can't believe that more people don't like \\"Time Bomb Town\\" (The melody is taken from guitar chords in the song<BR>\\"Go Insane\\" by the same artist, BTW). <BR>This CD is usually in my 3-disc along with Phil Collins' \\"No Jacket Required\\" and Genesis \\"Abacab\\".
0930289234|5.0|I read and re-read these comics obsessively when they first came out way back in high school. There is so much going on in them that you are transfixed. I took an art history course, the prof of which said that there are certain vanishingly small moments in art history where everything balances perfectly. The composition, line and coloring in the art fit together so well that they can be compared to that moment when you're on a bicycle, you stop and the bike is in perfect equilibrium, before you have to put your feet on the ground. Michaelangelo and Raphael did lots of stuff like that. This book is that moment spread over something like 350 pages.<br />You can take this story in so many different ways. Take a look at the characters. It's got the suicidal god: Dr. Manhattan, who is all powerful, denies there's a god and gets along with no one. It's got a Nazi who happened to be the only person saying anything of moral worth. It's got bizarre fetishistic sex between two very human and imperfect people. It's got a narcissist who saves the earth in the short term, but may wind up killing it in the long term. And a love story between a rapist thug and his hystrionic victim.<br />Then there's the plot. The influences I can see are Robert Ludlum, William Burroughs, Michael Moorcock and possibly some great German Idealist systematizers. Ludlum because some of it looks an awful lot like the Matarese Circle, particularly when we find out what the threat the heroes face is in Chapter 11. William Burroughs because there tends to be a prevalance of degradation of humanist ideals, like in Naked Lunch. Michael Moorcock because Moore is a left-liberal type but doesn't believe in producing agit-prop. The moral model is closer to Bastable's misadventures than Ayn Rand. And the grand systematizers are there because everything falls into place. Like clockwork.<br />The art by David Gibbons is 100% stunning. I draw a bit and to this day I have no idea how Gibbons managed to pull off such minutely detailed miniscule amendments to drawings that came before. The one thing I found that detracted from the art was the coloring, which was garish in places. Though perhaps that was the intended effect.<br />There's a reason why this book is the only comic ever to win science fiction's Hugo award. It's perfect.
B00005NKKY|4.0|This is a great album, one of my favorites. I bought the CD to replace the cassette that replaced the LP. I'll never get tired of listening to it. The two tracks stuck on the end don't belong there though. They subtract from the whole rather than adding to it. I'm glad I have a CD burner so I can make a copy without them.
B00003CXXP|5.0|So the world's a rough place. People are cruel. Society's pliers keep trying to bend you out of shape. Your friends are dying and so are you. You're not sure your parents did too good a job of raising you. Well, here is a magically hypnotic place where even though all that is true, it's somehow okay. When Mom says to AI son (I mean, you think you've got it bad, think of him!) that she loves him YOU ARE THERE. Why wasn't this movie popular? The first generation of kids growing up with single moms or broken homes are still trying to cope with the problem with anger, not wisdom.<br />Keep at it Spielberg. They'll get it in the end.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I was hoping they would do this...that is, put star trek on DVD, and I hope they do it with Voyager also.<br />In any case, Star Trek has always been a favorite of mine, I'd sneak down after my bedtime to watch it with my dad. At first, I despised DS9 for taking the place of Next Gen reruns (I'm just too young to have seen it originally) But before long, I became obsessed with DS9, and it is currently my favorite of the Star Trek series<br />I love this so much!!!
B000002NE4|5.0|Bear with me now. Everything Cave wrote up to this album pointed to it.<br />Are you still with me? From the gleefully bleak and utterly violent world of From Her to Eternity, through the 50's poppy sounds of Kicking Against the Pricks, through the melancholic Good Son and all the way to Let Love In, Cave developed a singular sound that was part rock'n'roll, part blues and a lot of poppified country-folk (that kicks Garth Brooks' be-hind all across America). This album is the rawest and most sincere expression of his vision. At times it's bleak (\\"Black Hair\\"). Other times its sweetly loving (\\"Into My Arms\\"). And there are times it's outright angry (\\"People Ain't No Good\\"). The final spoken word poem at last shows us that Cave doesn't hate gays (is the narrator a she or a he? is the partner male or female?). Whereas Murder Ballads' \\"Stagger Lee\\" leaves little doubt on that score (even if it was a joke). Or the anhedonic \\"Do You Love Me? 2\\" with its theme of teen gay sex slavery. Gay bashing is a part of every Aussie's life and Cave is probably a man of his times. Here he shows that he can also break free of tradition.<br />Nocturama, which came out a while ago as of this writing, is good. But it doesn't match the levels of dark grace achieved on this album. It's too bad the market place won't let Cave explore the regions he does here further.
0783244320|3.0|It's nice to see a sci-fi movie that in many ways hearkens back to the old Flash Gordon flicks or B movies of the 50's that didn't have to rely on spectacular special effects to get the story across.  Granted this movie is still slick effect wise, but the movie doesn't go overboard with \\"in-your-face\\" special effects.  While the acting is a bit cornball, this is simply a fun movie.
078322608X|5.0|Is Bruce Willis insane in this movie? You never know. His vision of life after a plague has wiped out most of humanity is pretty convincing. And you have to wonder why he would imagine a future so degrading to himself. But then he starts hearing voices and decides he is insane and there is no future apocaplypse. He's dragged back to the future a few more times (and you don't know if it's real or imaginary) and is eventually told that he has solved the case, the scientists will prevent the end of the world. But he time travels back to the present and sees himself as a youngster watching himself die when he is killed. (An event he describes earlier in the film, but from his child's eye, with which he saw it, he saw someone else die.) Even  the closing sequence is ambiguous. Is the woman who sits down next to the guy who sets off the killer plague from the future (she is one of the future scientists who interrogates Willis) or is it just a bizarre coincidence?<br />Gilliam's accomplishment is to make this entirely schizophrenic film both interesting and popular. He truly makes insanity global. If you think there's more to the Oedipus myth than Freud, this flicks for you.
B000001IQH|4.0|Rancid is a pretty good punk band. Not a whole lot of people really understand them though. This was the first rancid cd i bought and i really liked it. My friend and his sister listened to it and they didn't like it and just didn't understand it.<BR>I liked it though.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This is the best album Madonna ever produced. She basically came out and said, \\"I'm a pervert and you better accept me for it.\\" I'm not sure it was for the best reasons. She made a football field worth of money off of it. But as far as the bottom line is concerned, she did create space for people with bizarre sexual proclivities. We need more pop stars with brains like hers. (Able to make something utterly cynical into something that also helps other people out.) She remains utterly wicked.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album shows system at their best. I've owned the album for 8 months and i still cant stop listening to it. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ALBUM. They are alot more medolic than their first album, but thats what they do best, and then they can be heavy as hell, which they are. Go get this album!
B00005JL78|4.0|Almost there! But the trick is to have the hero cross an inhuman threshold, not the villain. If you're looking for inspirational mythology, you can look at Blake. (The human faculties duel throughout time.) If you're looking for a simple love story, Wuthering Heights is one of the best. (The ghost of Catherine gets her lover, Heathcliff, to die for her so they can be ghosts together forever.) And if you're looking for a writer who has both insanity and love, you go to Horselover Fats in Philip K. Dick's Valis. (Dick truly is America's Borges as LeGuin says.)<br />The fact that Spielberg had the nerve to produce a Heideggerian action adventure is something. But it's just a shade from perfect. However, the special effects were awesome. The car chase was brilliant. Whoever thought up the design for the city and cars deserves an Academy Award.

6305313687|5.0|I first saw this movie, and I thought that it was absolutly amazing, and then I watched it again, and it just seemed to get better. The movie, I think, has a very real, yet graphic interpretation of what life is really like for some people, and as they say at the end of the movie, how we make enimes out of strangers.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I've run this cd into the ground, I listen to it so much!  Too many times I'll buy a cd for a hot single and it turns out, it's the only good song.  That is not the case with No Angel.   Thank You was her big hit, but every song on this cd deserves to be listened to.  <BR>I just wish she's hurry up with her follow up!  :)
0380973650|4.0|...taking a long and wonderful road trip that ends with the car sputtering and you shrugging your shoulders.<br />I don't want to spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that it is a bit of a let down after such a killer story is told. Gaiman does a great job of making you turn pages...until the last few. All things considered this is definitely a worthwhile read. Even though the author sticks a note in at the start about this book *not* being a roadmap, you're going to want to go to all of the very real places his characters visit. He writes up a wonderful trip through the American landscape.
B000001ESF|5.0|I first heard this album my senior year of high school.  Once I got past the shock of hearing Geddy Lee's voice, I realized that these guys are unbelievable musicians.  It goes without saying that Neal Peart is the best drummer in rock n' roll history.  Geddy Lee's bass is supreme.  Alex Liefson's guitar work is deceptively perfect.  This is a must for any serious fan of rock and rock history.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown proves again why he among the elite in his profession by putting together a compelling novel that will encapsulate its reader.  Although I must say this type of fiction is not for everyone.  Just like Jack DuBrul and Tom Clancy, Brown's explanations of concepts and the exhibiting of his knowledge of religious concepts can slow the story... if, of course, you find that kind of thing boring.  Most of his fans probably consider it a plus.<br />&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a thrilling search for the Holy Grail type of story, which of course was done to perfection in the last film of the Indiana Jones trilogy, but nevertheless, this book is worth reading.  It poses the idea that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a secret affair that produced a child, and thus, created a continuing bloodline of Christ.  Suspenseful twists to the plot bring the reader into a world of secret organizations and mysterious codes and murders.  It's a good read, and I suggest those who like the religious overtones of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; also pick up &quot;Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller&quot;.  Based on the Book of Revelation, it puts forth an Armageddon scenario I've never seen anywhere else.  I couldn't put either of these books down when I read them, and I highly recommend Dan Brown's &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.
B00008PX8P|4.0|First off let me say this is a review for people who like sitting down and watching a concert on TV.  Many people are easily bored just sitting around starting at a concert on screen and if you are one of them than you probably won't like this DVD much.  <br />Led Zeppelin fans have the right to be drooling because this DVD contains new concert footage and new live music never heard so I will talk about them separately.  The predominant format of this DVD consists of various segments from different Led Zeppelin concerts.<br />Visuals-  The footage was taken from Led Zeppelin archives that had been sitting around for years.  You can tell that much of it was in poor quality but that the it has been restored with the finest of care.  The film is crisp and for the most part looks great.  The actual concerts are pretty standard.  Multi angle Page and Plant fests so Bonham/JPJ fans might be dissapointed.  The band relied on its musicianship and intensity so while be technically advanced for the 70's, most of the shows consits of simple light tricks and the occasional symbal fire.  There are no trippy character segments a la \\"This Song Remains The Same\\" but you do get some very decent close ups of some Paige solos.  He makes it look so easy while wailing on his Les Paul and I couldn't help but get my air guitar rockin!!  <br />It is very interesting how you see the progression of the band througout the DVD.  The Royal Hall perfomance (1970) shows the band in a raw almost unrefined manner.  While still blowing the place away, they played like the knew how awesome they were, but wanted to show off to the rest of the world.  Later as their career progressed they fell into a rythm and commraderie that shows in the middle two segments where they are clearly playing at their best.  Finally at Knebworth they continue to amaze but Rock Star lifestyle has clearly caught up with the band.  By then Bonham was sporting his Morisson like beard and gut while Paige was so out of it, onewondered how he made it through while still playing at his level.  While watching Achilles Last Stand, I found myself wondering when the sweatty Paige was going to just collapse as he ripped through the machine gun licks of the song.  <br />Music- the music is really the highlight of the DVD.  For those Zep heads out there you won't be dissapointed.  Having aquired bootlegs and live songs and I was instantly amazed from the first riff.  I have a Bose Lifestyles 25 at home and the quality of the sound far surpassed any bootleg previously available as well as TSRTS.  As far as the actual versions of the songs, all of them are great.  Definitely the best live Whole Lotta Love, Dazed and Confused and Trampled Under Foot I have ever heard, while it will take more repeat viewings before I can decide about the rest.  (A No Quarter would of been nice)  The Stairway had an great extended section but could of been a few minutes longer.  There are a few acoustic selections as well from the Earls Court performance and Paige is ever so solid on Bron Y Aur Stomp. <br />Extras- This aspect of the DVD was a little more dissapointing.  There are a couple of interviews that don't provide anything substantial to even the new Zep fan.  There is a French TV performance that is pretty interesting and shows the band in their younger stage.  This DVD won't get into any of the history or famous anecdotes about LZ that the booklet from the box set describes.<br />Overall this is a must have for even the casual Zep fans.  I hope they come out with the soundtrack as it would surely be well recieved.  This is a DVD that you could sit down and watch or just put on in the background and listen to.
B00005JLRT|3.0|Star Trek:The Next Generation was a TV show with a warm heart.<BR>It was a family series with a Pollyannish view on life. a positive view.<BR>Instead of that we get a film called Nemesis with such things as a rape,a sex scene,a major Star Trek character killed off and an appalling scene of a man not just being impaled on an iron bar but actually pulling himself along it. What was Rick Berman thinking?<BR>Remember when this show was for family viewing? Sure,they had action but nothing as sadistic as a man being impaled. And about the villian Shinzon. In previous Star Trek films the villians all had some sort of charm and there were some great villians. In Nemesis,the villian is a peeping tom that perves on Troi and wants to rape her. What a comedown for Star Trek this too-young and whiny villian is!<BR>No wonder families gave the film a miss.<BR>And once again the Enterprise's shields easily fail. As one frustated critic stated \\"haven't they fixed them yet\\"?<BR>Would it be too much for Star Trek fans to ask to actually give us one well written adventure film where the good ship Enterprise isn't so easily outwitted or outgunned by the enemy?<BR>Come on Mr Berman,you can do it can't you? Get it right and the fans will come back. This show still has the fans,we just want a decent story.
B00004SVID|4.0|This live version of The Wall in its entirety is pretty standard stuff.  The versions are pretty much replicas of their brilliant originals played with relative conservatism.  I was hoping for a little more jamming and experimentation but there are some extensions in Another Brick In The Wall and Comfortably Numb that gives us a hint of Gilmore's abilities.  Although it seems blasphemous to go with this album over the original, it really depends on what you are looking for.  The biggest difference is the intamacy produced by Waters' voice that you get in the original.  The music is amazing but depressing and thus the original with Water's singing to you personally really personfies the somber mood.  If this is what you want then go with the original.  Otherwise this version is preferred.  I think in my younger angst driven days I would of preffered the original but now I'll take the live version anyday.<br />If you are a newbie looking for live Pink Floyd, try Pulse or the popular bootleg Pink Floyd Plays The Animals.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I just received and watched the Japanese version with English subtitles.  It was even better than the dubbed version I saw in the Theater.<BR>The Japanese version does not have any subtitles for the &quot;other&quot; features portion of the DVD, so if you don't understand Japanese you will not care for those parts of the DVD.  But the movie itself is more enjoyable and the voices sound more like what the characters look like.  I do understand some Japanese so maybe I am biased because I don't have to read all of the subtitles.<BR>No matter what version you do get the movie is very good.
B000002BHE|5.0|I can listen to her all day and night.  Of course I know all the songs now :o)
0156027321|5.0|The books title at least got my 12 year old to ask me about the mathematical pi, that transcendental 3.14159.   Oh, this is a glorious page-turner about animals and zoos, and the insights of zookeepers, blended with a back-story about Pis youth. But foremost it is the awesomely written story of Pi the survivor, adrift at sea, alone with his fathers zoo kept tiger in a lifeboat.  Reviewers muse somberly about this novels significance and size, its excellent manners and its clear vision, and then weigh in with the inevitable Conrad and Hemingway like-comparisons.  Phooey on all of that.  This is one enjoyable read, inspiring, tense, informative in a fun way, and plain joyful.  It is a light story and it doesnt require degrees in comparative lit or Okays from The New York Times Book Review to purchase.  This is a book you will pass along to others and remember.  And when was the last time you did that?
6304411448|4.0|This is a romantic movie.  It is comical at times, but never slapstick, just whimsical.  Great acting from Aidan Quinn.  Johnny Depp's acting is excellent as well.  You get the impression that he is a clown in a circus that no one else can see.  Everything he does expresses playfullness.<br />I would call this movie a decent drama, but it is elevated immeasurably beyond that status by the magical drama of Johnny Depp's Chaplan-like antics.  This is directed by the same Jeremiah Chechik who gave you National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  This is quite a departure for him, but it is in my opinion an endearing comedy/drama/romance.<br />Good movie for lonely sunday afternoons.
B00007E8V4|3.0|This album definitly is not there best work. Toxicity and there first album were great. This one they change in style and there lyrics are in a lot of songs quite ridiculous. like for example in chic n stu serj is singing about pizza toppings.I suggest to a new system of a down fan to buy Toxicity or there first album. They don't have the strong melodic metal style any more it seems. This album is far from bad but its nothing like there previous releases.
B000001EPB|5.0|This CD is a sensational piece of pure Irish music. It is full of great songs with a common style in all of them. It is , in fact, the soundtrack of one of the most impressive musical plays with dancing. There are deep, beautiful songs, uplifting ones, that offer you a rich diversity of tunes. It is usually Uilleann Pipes and serious fiddle playing, both of which abound on this album. The rhythm becomes progressively faster by playing the same melody more and more quickly. You may think that listening to the same melody repeated times is boring, but it's not. After listening to the 1st minute you'll blame yourself for having thought such a wrong thing before. <BR>  Besides being a great actor, Michael Flatley is one of the best dancers in the contemporary scene.<BR>  As a dancer, I envy his ability to show his true feelings while he is moving his body. If you have the chance, watch the video and you'll get the impression you're in the audience.<br />*****Absolutely, it is the best compilation of Irish music*****
B00008PX8P|5.0|A MUST for any LZ fan. Incredible video available for the first time - The Royal Albert Hall material alone is worth the purchase. The raw energy of this 1970 performance is astounding. For those who couldn't get enough of MSG '73 - all the remaining footage and finally, the Knebworth material shows how tight the band was until their final days. What more can be said about the greatest band of all time..This DVD says it all!!!
0345441184|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I made the mistake of watching the tv-movie first. The book is so much better. Bradley's writing is very magical. It entices, and makes you part of the book. Her writing makes you love a character one moment, and then hate them the next. The writing is just plain beautiful.
0393317552|4.0|[Strong 3.5 stars for its scope and development of the central thesis, but loses points for trying too hard to explain away non-European cultural failures.]<br />The first line of Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning opus is: \\"This book attempts to provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years.\\"  His central thesis is that luck of genetic distribution of domesticable plants and animals, particularly cereals and large mammals, gave a tremendous leg up to western Eurasia in the development of civilization.  In other words, it wasn't poor choices or innate inferiority that caused most of the world to be dominated by European culture -- just luck.<br />In a book with greatly wider scope than most nonfiction Pulitzer winners, Diamond pulls together long-term threads of farming, herding, languages, disease, technology, government, and religion.  He attempts to explain how trends in all these disparate areas rather inexorably led to the cultural and economic state of the world today.  While many of the author's arguments are subject to debate, the writing is lucid; it's easy to see why the Pulitzer committee gave Diamon the prize.<br />To take to task all the debatable points in \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" would be a huge undertaking.  I'll try to highlight a few.<br />Diamond argues that the temperate Mediterranean climate (featuring wet winters and dry summers) of southwest Asia aided greatly in early development, then has to explain why similar climates in California, Chile, and southwest Australia didn't spur development in those places.  Human actions (particularly deforestation and overgrazing) have turned what used to be called the \\"Fertile Crescent\\" into a wasteland, whereas this didn't happen in the similar southern European area.  Thus southwestern Asia possessed the seeds of human development, but the locals squandered their head start.  At that point Europe and eastern Asia had an equal chance of pulling ahead, and Diamond proposes that the geographical fragmentation of Europe gave it a competitive advantage over China's cohesiveness.  But because he earlier claims that easy movement (for the spread of domesticable species) gave Europe a competitive advantage over America and Africa, this argument is not compelling.<br />Diamond thinks that the different parts of the world were on a developmental par about 13,000 years ago.  At that time there were many more potentially domesticable large mammals in the Americas than there are now.  The evidence as to what the human presence at that time is mixed, but Diamond pushes hard to dispute evidence of any prior human occupation.  He favors the \\"Clovis first\\" theory, which has humans first entering from Siberia across the ice age Bering land bridge not more than 13,000 years ago, carrying stone \\"Clovis point\\" weapons.  Clovis points have been found in large numbers in mammoth carcasses in North America, and Diamond thinks they were developed in Asia and transported across Beringia.  Mammoths are one of the many now-extinct large mammals.  From the mammoth kill evidence, Diamond assumes hunting by immigrants from Siberia caused the extinction of not just mammoths but horses, elephants, lions, and all the other megafauna.  But there are several problems with this argument.  Firstly, there are more recent findings than those Diamond disputes to back up the earlier human occupation theory.  Secondly, there are no Clovis points north of British Columbia, which would mean these genocidal immigrants fasted all through Alaska.  And thirdly, while there are thousands of Clovis points in mammoth skeletons, to date we've found just ONE clovis point in an American horse carcass, and NONE in elephants, lions, or giraffes -- all at one time widely found in North America.<br />All of this debate for later occupation of the Americas appears designed to buttress a secondary argument that American development got started too late to catch up with the Eurasians.  But ironically, thePleistocene overkill hypothesis, linked to a single overwhelming swarm of human invaders, argues against Jared Diamond's central thesis.  If he's right, it WAS the Native Americans' own fault that they were later overrun by Europeans on horses, becaused they killed and ate all the existing horses on arrival.<br />Diamond also has to resort to some hand-waving to explain why independent Mesoamerican invention of writing and wheels (used only in toys, rather than tools like wheelbarrows) never went anywhere.  Similar weak arguments are used to explain why China went into cultural stagnation centuries ago.  Ultimately, the author tries too hard to make all of history fit his model.<br />In trying to explain why superior technology isn't necessarily accepted, Diamond trots out the old myth about the Dvorak keyboard being superior to the standard QWERTY layout, yet never finding much demand.  However, Diamond's book came out in 1997, and the Dvorak myth had been debunked 7 years previously (Journal of Law & Economics vol. XXXIII (April 1990)).  Diamond is left with no argument other than cultural superiority to explain why societies that adopt better technology succeed, and he rejects that position a priori.<br />In his professional career the author has spent much time working in New Guinea.  He thinks constant local warfare has made the average surviving New Guinea tribesman superior to the average descendant of European culture, and wants to explain why the people of New Guinea have so little \\"cargo\\" (wealth).  But Diamond's focus on New Guinea as a model for global development is more elucidating to the author than to his readers.<br />There are some problems with the book layout itself, including a surprisingly poor index.  For instance, trying to look up horse extinctions in the Americas, I found references to horses under \\"Americas, animal extinctions in\\" that didn't appear under \\"horses, in Americas\\".  Also, there are a variety of different maps with different levels of detail to show the migrations of peoples, languages, and domestic species.  It's necessary to flip back and forth between the maps to follow the narrative thread.<br />This is a good book to read, but a skeptical perspective is necessary while doing so.
B000066NW0|1.0|Creativity abounds on this album.  Avril Lavigne is the perfect representative for the angst-ridden punk girl, and she sings and writes songs like she knows it.  While sporting a white wife-beater and tie, it's like she's speaking directly to the youth of today.  As she bellows out powerful lyrics like &quot;Why should I care?&quot;, and sings about issues that affect all of us, especially in such a confusing time, one can literally feel her as a guide to our nation, a true light in the darkness that engulfs our world of poseurs and hypocrites. Way to go, Avril!
0066620996|5.0|This is a prequel to &quot;Built to Last&quot;; if you haven't read that one yet read this one first, even though they were written in reverse order.<br />Taken together these two books provide a step by step guideline to building and maintaining greatness that can be applied to any company, and department, any team, any family, any life.<br />Interestingly, immediately following this book I stumbled across one of my dearest old friends, &quot;Zen and the Art of Motercycle Maintenance&quot;, which I hadn't read in about 10 years. Reading it again I found the parallels with Collins' books to be stunning. A &quot;Level 5 Leader&quot; is clearly someone who exists with the fundamental attitude that Pirsig argues so heroically for in his work. It seems that Quality (emphasis on the capital &quot;Q&quot;) as described by Pirsig is fundamental to achieving greatness as described by Collins.
6304907648|5.0|Here you have two tough broads, a good cop and the nastiest of killers. How can you lose? Actually, the pairing of Sigourney & Holly is wonderful, in this age of films so lacking in strong women's roles. Sigourney, in particular, after years of kicking alien-butt, withdraws as the victim of an almost lethal attack and subsequent nervous breakdown. Her house-bound recluse still shows fire and rage, well-controlled and centered; a really great performance. Holly, too, in a slightly less showy role, shows drive and command of her role. These women are magnificent, in their own ways, and carry this film through plot-twists and strange turns that are always compelling. Also compelling is the very taut direction of John Amiel, never missing a chance to include the audience in everything, though you don't realize it at the time. A very handsome Dermot Mulroney makes an auspicious presence as an \\"almost\\" sex-object for the women, and William McNamara is greatly effective as the ultimate center of the film. Harry Connick, Jr. has impressed me as an actor many times, but not so much as here. With rotten teeth and an oily, snake-like presence he is given a few memorable moments. This film has been compared to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", but it really has its own character and drive. The tension is high, the plot well presented and the acting is superlative. I like this film a lot.
0060516402|5.0|...even though he wrote this one first, I'd recommend reading them in reverse order if you haven't read them before. This (and &quot;Good to Great&quot;) are destined to become business bibles, kept hand near every manager's desk and referred to on a regular basis. Great companions to &quot;First, Break All the Rules&quot; and &quot;Now Discover Your Strengths&quot;.
B00008LDPU|4.0|This was a bold and daring project that acts as a companion piece to The Matrix Trilogy. Since the movies have no time to explore all the many little questions we have about the matrix this was an ingenious way to explore many interesting and thought provoking elements of a world where man is a mind slave to machines. Each episode tackles an issue that you may or may not have thought about when watching the first (or second) film. While most of them are top-notch in the art direction department they do lack a little more depth in terms of telling a complete story. For example in Kid's Story we get a kid who (like Neo) is curious of what the matrix is and has heard of the legendary Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. But how did he learn this? We get no back story to his inquiry or curiosity, just the up to the moment decision of him breaking free just like Neo did, while it was great, it didn't explore anything different than the first movie. The most baffling and dazzling of all of these short films is Matriculated, which like in AEON FLUX style shows alot and explains very little. It tackles some really great ideas on slavery, conversion, and doing to the machines what they have done to the humans. It's definetly one of the more open ended shorts and is great to discuss with friends. Flight of the Osiris may appear dazzling but too much time I fear is wasted on a fight/strip tease that has little or nothing to do with the plot. Time is wasted on this when we could have learned a little more about the crew/ and the events leading up to the machines discovering zions location. <br />The second renaissance I and II are the most straight forward and revealing of all the shorts. Giving an excellent play by play of what lead up to the machine rebellion and eventual creation of The Matrix. It is graphic and extremely real, it disturbingly shows us what hatred and segregation can lead too if we do not, as a people, learn to except all forms of life and live with them peacefully and cooperatively. A strong message told through science fiction. <br />This is an amazing effort that includes some of the top-names in Anime today. It is fresh and daring in todays world of spoon-feeding plot lines and two dimensional characters. It brings to life the matrix like never before. Watching this along with playing the game gives a very complete history of the Matrix and the events leading to and discussed in the second film. This is for fans only. Enjoy the Ride, its a good one.
0688002307|5.0|This book can be read as a novel about a cross-country journey a man takes with his son.<br />And it can be read as a book about Zen, and Art, and Motorcycle Maintenance, and how, if you begin with the right mental approach, these three seemingly disparate things really aren't different at all.<br />And it can be read as a guide to how to live your life better, giving meaning to otherwise mundane daily tasks.<br />And, when combined with it's sequel, &quot;Lila&quot;, it can be read as (arguably) the deepest and greatest philosophical work the 20th century produced, laying the groundwork for a whole new Metaphysics and fundamentally altering our view of reality.<br />But no matter how the book is read,  there's no denying that it is a work of astoundingly high Quality.
B000063DGC|5.0|Best of early Ozzy, close to \\"Blizzard,\\" perhaps.  This captures the enery and appeal of early solo Ozzy and the incredible Randy Rhoads.  Get it.
0688002307|5.0|You can read it as a novel, a cross-country journey a man takes with his adolescent son.<br />You can read it as a handbook to good living, advice on how to take on an attitude that naturally leads one toward achieving great results with creativity and passion, bringing meaning to even life's most mundane tasks.<br />And you can read it with its companion, &quot;Lila&quot;, as arguably the greatest philosophical work of the 20th century, creating a whole new Metaphysics from scratch that fundamentally alters our view of reality.<br />No matter how you read it, read it carefully (I've read it three times now and am just starting to really feel like I &quot;get it&quot;). Read it slowly. Savor it like a good meal. It is a work of tremendously high Quality.
B000002B7O|4.0|This is, perhaps, the second best Ozzy album musically, but the late remaster is HORRIBLE!  Buy a used copy of the remaster with the little bitty album cover on the front.  The later copy has redone bass and drum parts and isn't worth listening to, much less paying money to listen to it.<br />That said, enjoy Randy Rhoads, great bass and drums and Ozzy in his prime.
B000002E5J|4.0|I got this cd way back when. You can really appreciate Shakira as a songwriter and guitarrist, etc.. when you hear this in comparison to her bubble gum now.<br />Her songs are catchy and fun to listen to. Here she has a diverse collection of songs that show her talents as a singer and songwriter. One of her best cds honestly.
B000068MKZ|5.0|I listened to this album in a music store in Paris, just by chance. I just loved it at the first time. I did not know that Carla is a super model then. I learned it now from the other reviewers. I just wanted to come here and write my ideas on this album, since it is a beautiful piece of music. Extremely talented girl.
B00005QHPQ|2.0|In English Enrique is just producing more bubble gum. Although his pop in Spanish had some depth, this cd is just hard to listen to at points.  Hero is catchy and ok for a while and I like the beat to Love to see you cry, but it makes no sense! <br />Many of the songs seem lame, I will survive, and his music just seems to be sung for the heck of it. <br />A donde vas Enrique?
B00008S2VG|5.0|First of all, I am really surprised by some of the reviews here, especially those state that there's no substance in this album, or the song American Life is no good. I think it's because the reviewers are all American, and can not stand some apt criticizm.<br />I first listened to this album in a music shop while waiting for a friend, and my friend came and tried to make me put the headphones down. But I couldn't because, this was the best thing I've heard from her, and I was so emotional about it. <br />I am not going to review the songs one-by-one, 'cause it'd be unfair for an album like this.There is absolutely no fillers here, great hooks, catchy songs, simple but intelligent lyrics. And oh!! the mixture of electronic pop and guitars... some clever keyboard additions.. they are all perfectly arranged.<br />It's a little irony that Madonna is questionning the American system, which, in the past, helped her to become the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot;. It is obvious to me that she'll always remain as the legend.<BR> <BR>My comment: I have all the Madonna albums to date, I mean it from the heart that this is her best together with &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989).
0345448898|5.0|I bought the first two books of this trilogy several years ago for my brother for Christmas.  He neglected them for a long time, so I decided to pick up The Golden Compass and give it a try.  It took me a little bit to get into it, but once I did, I was hooked.  As soon as I finished the Golden Compass I picked up The Subtle Knife, and finished reading it in about 3 days (which is really fast for me, considering I'm not too big on reading) I then borrowed The Amber Spyglass from a friend of mine.  This is the only book that has ever made me cry.  Pullman is an extraordinary writer, I got so connected to the characters.  Any words of praise I have for these books cannot possible do them justice, that's how good they are.  This is definitly my favorite series of all time.  It is a good investment for anyone who is into fantasy, and anyone who isn't.
B000089RVX|5.0|Painful and hopeful, powerful and emotional... This is the sound of one of rock's newest musical groups, Evanescence.  Haunting, dark, and sorrowful are the lyrics of the eleven songs, but there's also a hint of light and hope amidst all the darkness.  The soaring voice of lead vocalist, Amy Lee, is simply beautiful.  Her poetic lyrics are brutally honest and will indeed haunt you, perhaps even cause insomnia if listened to at night. There cannot be and should not be any comparison made to any other rock bands; Evanescence stands out, shining in a place all their own.  It doesn't matter what they are labeled; I would just call it truly great music.  Lee's powerful emotion will captivate you and capture you, drawing you into the depths of each song.  Evanescence is fearless, exploring and expressing the dark side of life, with themes such as death and suicide, desperation, despair, and pain. There's no sugar-coated fluff here.  Just true music and pure beauty and, finally, some genuine and honest talent.  This is a CD worth your time and money.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I found myself yelling and screaming with the crowd as if actually at a concert-video and audio is THAT good.  As we know some live Zep performances on bootlegs are not the best--THESE ARE.  Truly illustrates the magic of a Zeppelin concert.  I cant overstate how good this set is.  And for the price?  WOW!  I am at a loss for words. My title says it best: UN BELIEVABLE!
B000000W6R|5.0|Perfect mix for those who live in extremes. This album is probably the Pumpkins best. It runs the gamit of feelings from the wanting to bang your head into a wall to wanting to curl up and depress the hell out of yourself. This album has something for you no matter what you're looking for. The blend of songs also keeps the listener wanting to listen rather than getting worn out by the depressing stuff or a headache from continuous hard stuff.<br />Highlights: Landslide (agree with other reviewers- blows all other versions away), Soothe, Whir, Blue, &amp; Girl Named Sandoz.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD set by Led Zeppelin kicks!  After watching this, I had a new found admiration of John Bonham as a drummer.  He was as important a part of Zeppelin as Page and Plant.  It's a good thing that there hasn't been any reunions so far with Page, Plant, Jones, and some other drummer; because the result would be lame.<br />I thought there were no weak parts.   Hearing Jimmy Page's remastered guitar solo with a violin bow during \\"Dazed And Confused\\" blew me away.  I am at a loss of words for \\"Moby Dick\\" where Bonham played heck out of the drums.  <br />In fact, I watched the first DVD twice before watching the second.  Disc two was very entertaining as well.  Overall, I thought this was excellently produced and the quality of the music was superb.<br />The Zeppelin flies on!
B000001FZK|5.0|Now that the majority of radio stations have been widdled down to four major corporations (will this make the cenosrs?  as if we all do not already know?) you will not see the type of record development that allows this kind of creativity.  Radiohead?  test-proven at best.  The sparse improv pop found on this cd may have started a new generation of music prior to the redundant grunge that followed, but three minute pop songs are easy fodder.<br />This is a cd of spares yet complex arrangments accented by Mark Hollis' intorspective voice. It is worth the thrid listen to get the &quot;pop&quot; jazz presented here.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I would definitely suggest any emo fan to buy this album. Actually if you listen to rock period, buy this album!

Written by Pedro Almodovar, Jorge Guerricaechevarria, Ray Loriga. Novel by Ruth Rendell.<br />It is Christmas 1970 in Madrid, Spain. A man working on lights above the street at night suddenly hears a woman screaming from a nearby apartment building. Dona Centro of the mesa (Pilar Bardem) hears the screaming too as well as the other tenants. It is Isabel (Penelope Cruz). She is pregnant and in labor. Dona tells her to get dressed. She can barely walk. They miss a taxi, so Dona gets in the way of an autobus. The bus conductor (Alex Angulo) explains to Dora and Isabel that he is off-duty and it is not his bus. It's too late. Isabel is about to give birth. She has a boy and names it &#34;Victor&#34;.<br />20 years later, 1990, Victor is a grown man and is riding to his date. At the same time, Sancho (Jose Sancho) and David (Javier Bardem) are driving in the city. Sancho is drinking. His wife, Clara (Angela Molina) has been beaten. Sancho thinks his wife is having an affair.<br /> Victor calls Elena (Francesca Neri) on the payphone outside. He had sex with this woman in a toilet last week. He is a virgin. He didn't get it in. She doesn't want him over. So Victor is not happy and just rides the bus for a while. When he sees Elena on the balcony looking for someone, he gets out of the bus and visits her. Clearly, she does not want him there and she points a gun at him. He tries to stop her and the gun goes off. Someone hears the gun shot and calls the police. It is Sancho and David that arrive. They are the police. No one was shot, but they are pointing a gun at Victor.<br />This night will change the life of everyone there.<br />The story continues to 1992 and 1996.<br /><br />Includes male frontal nudity and female nudity.<br /><br />Filmed in Madrid, Spain.<br /><br />Language in Spanish and Italian.

B00008J4P5|4.0|I like my reviews short and to the point, so here it goes. I thought Elephant was a pretty good album, considering the White Stripes are one of the only mainstream garage rock bands holdin it down. Choice cuts are Seven Nation Army, No Home for you..., and Ball and a Biscuit. Check out De Stijl though for real White Stripes material. Also other groups like Division of Laura Lee and the O.G. MC5 are great &quot;garage rock.&quot;
B00006RIO7|4.0|Energy is something that every CD, stage or otherwise, should emanate. And fortunately for this audience of one, the Chicago soundtrack certainly does just that. The music of Kander and Ebb tends to  have a zing on its own, but Zellwegger, Zeta-Jones, and Queen Latifah bring magic of their own to the piece. <BR>The film has rearranged some of the score a bit, which may be difficult for Broadway enthusiasts to swallow. Particularly sad is the absence of the comic fun of Mary Sunshine in her original glory (I will not spoil that for those who have not had the joy of seeing Chicago in the theater). However, the joy portrayed by this cast is unmistakable. Even the newer version of &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; is just dazzling. Queen Latifah's &quot;When You're Good to Mama&quot; is powerful and strong. <BR>I do not care for the final two tracks and the movie does cut a few of the great Kander and Ebb songs from the original. But this film's ability to cross over to the non-theater audience makes it a valuable, landmark film. This CD is an essential item for any personal collection.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am particularly biased towards DePalma films. Ever since Blow Out entranced me I can't get enough of them. Carrie is one example of the director showing off his stuff. The film is not a total horror film, although some people still say it scares the pants off them. Rather Carrie is the story of a very misunderstood and shy girl who is repeatedly tormented by her self-tortured mother and her insidious classmates. I don't want to put spoilers into the review so let me leave it at that.<BR>Watch the movie once to be pulled into the story, watch it a second time later to enjoy all the visual effects that DePalma is known for. And don't forget the beautiful score by the amazing Pino Donaggio. Highly recommended film, I don't usually give 5 stars but this one really stands out!
B000006TRV|5.0|PINK FLOYD THE WALL is excellent album. It is one of my favorite albums of all time. THE WALL is my favorite cause it is good musically and lyrically, it isn't like other concept albums that the music is good but the lyrics are bad. I got into Pink Floyd when Echoes came out, I bought that and then I got THE WALL. The problem I had with The Wall is how does it end ? From watching the movie and listening to the album I think he goes Insane. I also liked the movie, I bought out what the album is which is unique. I'm just glad the movie wasn't done like the \\"SGT. Pepper\\" movie.
B00005RDRO|3.0|This is one of those movies that has &quot;everything&quot;, in which a collection of talented actors get together to jam in a mystery/comedy.  It is a classic because of its genre and who is in it, but I did not think it was one of the great comedy classics.  By way of comparison I recently watched Clockwise with John Cleese which I thought was much funnier, even if it only had one simple plot and one famous actor.
1400031567|4.0|This is a strange, interesting story. Characteristically for Mankell, it opens arrestingly. The short prologue gives us a snapshot of Pedro Santana, a sugar plantation worker in the Dominican Republic. Years ago he got married to \\"the most beautiful girl he had ever seen\\" who then, for eight long years, failed to conceive a child. Now having at last done so, she is dying and leaves him with nothing but the baby daughter, Dolores, who, he now vows, will have a different, happier life. <br />The scene shifts to southern Sweden sixteen years later, where, as the 1994 World Cup gets under way, a brown-skinned young woman appears in a field of rape, apparently terrified, douses herself with petrol and sets herself alight. Chief Inspector Kurt Wallender is a witness to her death and the memory haunts him as he embarks on the hunt for a serial killer who kills his victims with an axe and scalps them. <br />Are these killings in any way related to the burning girl? Well, we find out, in a complex story about fathers and their children in a violent and dangerous world set against the backdrop of the kind of perfect summer in which, Wallander's outraged sentiments protest, monsters do not belong.
9998971950|3.0|I tried it, I thought - it was first, it should be best. But I must admit, although it's quite good piece of espionage literature, I've read better LeCarre's. So if you want to try some LeCarre I would recommend to read Russia House instead.
6305313687|5.0|For anyone who has never heard anything about this movie, it's about a Nazi (Edward Norton) who gets put in jail but comes back a changed man. When he comes back he finds trouble with having to deal with his past Nazi friends and his younger brother (Edward Furlong) who begin to attack him because he's against what he once enveloped himself in.<BR>   This movie is extremely gripping from the beginning as it goes between the present day and multiple flashbacks. Even as rough as the content in the movie is, it is a great movie teaching about the reality of racism and the world we live in.<BR>   While it is obviously not a movie for the younger crowd, for anyone else this movie is sure to leave you thinking and will not be one forgotten easily.

B00003CXHJ|3.0|An American submarine is launched on a hastily organized mission to recover the Enigma code machine from a damaged German sub.  If successful, this mission will provide the Allies with a decided advantage against the Nazis.  This film is historically misleading (the British captured Enigma), but exciting in an efficient, workmanlike way.  I was entertained as the crew careened from peril to peril.  There's nothing new here, but it's a fun ride.
B000000WA4|5.0|Being in the middle of things in the 1990's, being a high school geek intellect and fueled by literature, of course I also swam with alternative music.  Of course, people like Alanis Morrisette, Hootie and the Blowfish, NIN, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and the likes were common to them but somewhere along the line, \\"Siamese Dream\\" passed me by.  Then I heard \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" one day while doing some homework.  Like the 1994 hit \\"Closer\\" (look at my \\"Downward Spiral\\" review), I was floored by the song not only for its amazing music but for the deep lyrics as well.  Of course, other great SP songs came along too like \\"1979\\", \\"Zero\\" and the unforgettable orchestrated \\"Tonight, Tonight\\".  I realized that all these songs really were originals, that nothing I had heard up to that point even came close to the genius of these songs.  Of course, without a job, I couldn't afford ...to buy the album so I never got it until the Christmas of 1996 from my sister.  Let me tell you, this album stayed in my CD player for a long, long time.  Not only were there hard rock songs like \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Zero\\" but Mellon Collie also offered great harmonies like the near nine and a half minute opus \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\" (which I am listening to right now), \\"Cupid de Locke\\", \\"To Forgive\\", \\"By Starlight\\" and many others.  This double-disc ultimate sensation is a genuine toss salad of human emotion topped with a generous helping of blue-cheese dressing;)  Guaranteed, all those people who bash rock and roll for being brain-numbing need to hear this album.  Also, for those who think that rock and roll is teenage junkie [stuff], they also need to buy this album too.  To **** with Zwan (which I will bash later), Corgan's latest and wastest project, this album is Corgan at his creative best, and of course his band members, D'arcy, James Iha and Jimmy Chamberlain stretched their creative powers to create an orchestra of beauty and the occasional angst that is still amazing today.  5stars all the way for \\"Mellon Collie\\": but it right now!
0783235380|4.0|I have read other reviews on this film and I agree with some of them. I found this movie to be surprisingly entertaining! The characters were well written and well acted. This movie is fun and sad and real. It's something to really check out. The ending wasn't that surprising.  I think this movie is about all the what if's in life.
6302969352|5.0|This is absolutely the best movie to be filmed. Ever. I have seen a ton of movies but this was the best. Even though it has a simple storyline, it's a very complicated film. The characters are very well developed, Kurosawa is a born genius. It runs over 3 hours, but it is so interesting that you WILL keep watching it! It has action, humor, suspense and much more. <br />The story is set in the 1600's in a small village. The village is constantly being robbed of their crops by bandits and the townsfolk want to hire unemployed samurai to defend themselves, only giving them food instead of money. Enjoy the film, you will love it.

I like his concept of making more--money--while working less.<br />  As the title indicates, this book's only objective is to teach you to look at money from the other side, the rich side. Kiyosaki has motivated me to start exploring more ways to make the tax codes work to my advantage.<br />  I recommend this book to anyone who needs the motivation to get out of the &quot;rat race&quot; and get onto the &quot;fast track&quot; to become rich.
B000066NW0|2.0|I'll give it to Avril, her music is listenable and catchy as hell. I have listened to this album a few times through and it is overall a nice listening album, BUT.. and this is a big but... she is most certainly not how the media makes her out.  Alot of people make her out to be an amazing, guitar-playing punk rock girl who sings her own emotions.  One look at her songwriting credits will show that for almost every song on the album she is accompanied by a professional songwriters, a few on some.  She also claims to be a guitar player?  Sorry, no dice here.  She played guitar on one, count em one, song on this entire album.  And even that song is so simplistic it could be taught to a complete beginner.  She knows a few basic chords and isn't even that good with those.  Is she punk?  I'm not into limiting people to genres, but she is most definetly not punk.  Punk's purpose was to define set standards, bend them and break them.  Avril Lavigne does no such thing here.  Half this CD, if not more, is full of pop-ballads worthy of Mandy Moore or Michelle Branch.  Don't get me wrong, she's a listenable artist, but nothing new and most certainly nothing great.
1563898586|3.0|Any reader might think that by having 5 Victorian age characters together in a league, similar to that of the Avengers or JLA, will be the best thing that anyone has ever thought of. While idea has premise, it's really not a cut loose cannon one might think or want it to be. Alan Quatermain, Mina Murray (previously Harker), Dr Jekyll (an of course Mr Hyde), the Invisible Man and Captain Nemo, fight a battle against the greatest villain of that age.<br />The thing that makes this works is the story telling. Moore is able to project the intellectual, holier than thou feel of the 19th century an have it work in an action sequence. The whole story reads like a bunch of people fighting the good fight and still coming back home in time for the afternoon tea. It's a very gentleman, lady like approach to the story with everyone being so overly nice to one another. To the point of boredom. One might think how did the British ever rule more than half the world with that kind of attitude. Moore brings in the extraordinary approach to things and has all the characters fighting in flying machines, laser touting and against... uhmmm... the Chinese. Ah yes! Need I say more?<br />O'Neill's art is mediocre at best. While Moore tries really hard to capture the essence of the 19th century, O'neill's art is just trying to deconstruct it. It's shabby and not really conveying the time with which the story takes place.<br />All in all the story is not that bad. It has potential, but Moore may try to explore that in upcoming volumes. His stories are great, but the major problem that he falls against is that the artists chosen for him with his projects just can't make his mind's world into the real world. If comics were invented during those times, they would look exactly like this...

0060987464|5.0|This book The long hard road out of hell taught me that being an outcast is better than being popular. The part where he talked about his first time getting high hit realitively close to home for me. This book would be great even in your a Billy Graham worshipping bible thumper. It would show you what your up against and that we are some sick and hated people that if you want to have a religious battle with we love a good fight.  This book shows you that although he grew up in conservative little Ohio he turned out to be a freak and thats ALRIGHT.  Anybody CAN relate to this book, just read it and try to prove me wrong.
B00000DFSK|5.0|I want to tell you how cool and exciting the \\"Where the streets have no name\\" is !!!<BR>     First about the sound and the rhythm, the drum beats through all the music make me feel high. the music has the blue and cool color of sounds. This song has a cool rock rhythm.<BR>     Second this song makes me imagine a story that I can enjoy experiencing. Here,read the name of the song again:\\"Where the streets have no name\\".I feel that this is about walking on the streets and now leaving the familiar world by taking the first step into a strange place to start traveling to find something or get to a goal. There might be nothing along the street.There might be nothing on the plane except some trees, and there might be nobody around me. But I can feel a comfortable, cool wind driving at top speed on the one long straight road.Ican't see the goal in my field of vision;however, I believe this road leads to my goal.<BR>     Listening to this music, my heart always starts reading this story.Then I feel high!!! I love this song.I want to recommend this song to you and have you travel the vast plane while feeling the cool wind!!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I think I know why this CD is generally getting pretty bad reviews- because of the heavy guitar content. People know Madonna as the upbeat and fun singer and they don't like the straying style. However, AL is better than MUSIC, RAY OF LIGHT, and THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION because it has staying power in my CD player. I love the stop and go beat of the title track and other favorites are &quot;Hollywood&quot;-This song is really catchy, &quot;Mother and Father&quot;-real fun song with interesting rap, &quot;Love Profusion&quot;-cool guitar sound and chorus, I think it would make a good second single. Anyway, get AL if you like introspective music with a little guitar and electronic twist to it and total electro tracks (like &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;) The only song I can't seem to get into is &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; Other than that, A+! Kudos to Madonna for getting personal and talking about today's current culture is such a great way!!
B00008DZ0J|4.0|The White Stripes keep getting better.  This album grows upon White Blood Cells and goes off in a couple of new directions, but at it's heart it's still an excellent, bluesy rock album.

B00008PX8P|5.0|This collection of performances is beyond phenomenal. I still like &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; and always will, but this DVD does just blow it away. Its hard to believe that the 1970 recordings can sound as good as they do in DTS or 5.1 but trust me the sound quality is as good or better than pretty much anything recorded today. It does indeed sound like it was recorded yesterday. Jimmy Page is not only a master guitarist but a master mixer/producer as well. Of course no music presented today can even touch the energy or pure rockin talent Led Zep preformed. The 30 minute Danish TV section is worth the price of the DVD alone, but you get 5 hours more than this. And each concert section, oh my, just incredible. Among many highlights (the whole DVD is a highlight), check out Page's &quot;bow&quot; guitar in the 1970 concert, and John Bonham's drumming on anything, greatest rock and roll drummer of all time and it shows and sounds in thundering DTS sound. Best rock DVD ever --a must have.
1400031362|3.0|I am slightly concerned ... this has been to date such a charming series right up there with such classics as Wind in the Willows.  <br />But alas as series continue, especially ones so well received as the life and times of Precious Ramotswe, the author seems to come to believe it is his story.  In this particular case we find Precious discussing such unrelated things as the relevance of existentialism, the theories of David Leaky, women's rights, yada yada yada.  <br />Mr. Smith, if you out there more focus on Ramotswe and the trials and travails of the the Dective Agency and Speedy Motors and less as a vehicle for better world understanding.   sigh :(

B00006RU5B|5.0|This cd is so incredible it's almost beyond words.  Taking a talented singer like Chris Cornell and combining him with the great music of Rage is creating a completely new standard for rock.  &quot;Audioslave&quot; is a great cd, and I have been listening to it non stop.  Cornell's voice is amazing, Morello is one of the most talented guitar players around, and the band goes together so well.  This is a great cd, even if you weren't a huge Rage fan.  Go Audioslave!

B00008DDSC|5.0|This film is a testament to the new and engaging style of indie cinema.  Here we have an impossibly slick and beautifully stylized love story on the edge and I'm glad to see that it's appreciated.<BR>Maggie Gyllenhaal (who I've only glimpsed in Donnie Darko and Adaptation) is stunning.  Lee's journey from darkness to light, through what may be seen by many as a dark avenue, is touching and earnest.  She learns to live and be comfortable in her own skin, as well as finding the strength to fight for what she wants rather than timidly taking the path others set for her.  She plays opposite James Spader (a gifted and beautiful actor) naturally and without a single hitch.  Their relationship grows and transforms both characters with utter grace and sensitivity.  <BR>Possibly the most amazing thing about this film is the fact that it never becomes pretentious, preachy or even slightly over the top.  It is always honest, true to its characters and often comic, in spite of its rather taboo subject matter.<BR>Wonderful as the movie is, watching it at home on DVD is not without some difficulty.  If you have a player with a sound equalizer, use it. There are quite a few moments when the sound gets very soft and very loud - often back to back.
6304077939|1.0|As a cat lover, who had not read a review of this atrocity, I was appalled at the torture of the poor animal in this film.  I can't help but wish the director had been hanged above his bathtub instead ofthe lecherous grandfather character.  Can't comment on the film after the cat torture scene as that is when I pulled it from the VCR and smashed the tape with a ball peen hammer.
0767830555|5.0|Robert De Niro's performance in TAXI DRIVER remains, after twenty-five years, one of the most powerful ever witnessed in an American film.  It is almost shocking today that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.  The reason isn't hard to locate.  Just as Shirley MacLaine lost in 1960 to Elizabeth Taylor when Academy voters thought the latter might be dying (obviously, she survived), so Robert De Niro lost in 1976 when Peter Finch, who had been nominated for NETWORK, actually died.  I liked Finch in NETWORK, but today his performance seems to pale beside that of De Niro's.  In addition to Henry Fonda's mythic performance as Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, it is almost inconceivable that his performance was not acknowledged at the time.<br />De Niro is in very nearly every scene in this film, and without a stunning performance in that role, you do not get a stunning film.  Luckily, De Niro is unforgettable.  Although his famous scene in front of the mirror (the \\"You talking to me\\" scene, which was entirely improvised) is rightfully celebrated, in every second of the film his presence dominates.  I seem to remember reading years ago in an interview with screenwriter Paul Schrader that Travis Bickle was based very much on the narrator from Dostoevsky's NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND.  If he didn't say that, I will.  It isn't just that Travis seems socially out of place, but morally and metaphysically out of place.  He doesn't seem to be a person with a genuine core, and at the end of the film, he seems equally capable of good or evil.  He ends up doing good, but Scorsese has pointed to the arbitrariness of his actions.  He could easily have assassinated the political candidate instead of the pimp.  He ends the movie a hero, but an more an ironic hero than an anti-hero.  In a flip of a metaphysical coin, he accidentally ends up a good guy instead of a madman.<br />In a way, this film is a group effort, with tremendous performances by Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster, and a tremendous score by the legendary Bernard Herrmann (CITIZEN KANE, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO).  But the main credit for this film should go jointly to De Niro, Scorsese, and Paul Schrader.  Unbelievably, neither Scorsese nor Schrader even received an Oscar nomination.  This, of course, says a lot more about the inherent conservatism of the Academy than about the job these men did.  In fact, most of the greatest directors to work in American cinema (Hitchcock, Ernst Lubitsch, Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges, Orson Welles, among many others) never won a Best Director Oscar, and neither has Scorsese.  And very few better, more literate scripts have been produced in America.<br />I'm writing here on the assumption that anyone reading this has seen this film, probably more than once.  If that isn't the case, this truly is one of the greatest American films.  It is a landmark film, showing the ferocity and loneliness that many find in modern life in a way that has only rarely been portrayed in any art form, whether cinema or literature.

B00005JM03|4.0|Starring: Mark Wahlberg<BR>          Charlize Theron<BR>          Edward Norton<BR>          Seth Green<BR>          Jason Statham<BR>          Mos Def<BR>          Donald Sutherland<br />Directed by: F. Gary Gray (Friday, A Man Apart)<br />The Italian Job is a fast-paced, entertaining, and fun crime caper. In a year of pointless remakes, this one fairs very well and boasts a terrific cast who deliver excellent performances.<br />The admittedly cliched plot follows the same set-up as most caper films, including the recent \\"Ocean's 11\\" and \\"The Good Thief,\\" which, despite the hype, was boring and poorly edited: a crew get together to pull of a heist, the characters are briefly introduced, the preparation is set forth,and finally, it comes time to complete the heist, with lots going wrong. Despite the formulaic scenario, director F. Gary Gray's execution was high-energy and exciting, so the lackluster plot can easily be overlooked. One brilliant twis in the film has our characters rigging the stoplights of Los Angeles so they can drive right out of the city with a carful of gold (in a safe that they're stealing back after their double-crossing ex-partner, played by Edward Norton, stole it from them), with nothing but green lights, while everyone else gets red lights, thus keeping the roads plugged with the largest traffic jam in L.A. history and the police from pursuing them.     <BR>    <BR>All this leads to well-staged speedboat and car chases which produces nail-biting suspense in beautiful locations. From start to finish, the filmmakers rarely pass up a joke--they even find a way to use Napster inventor Shawn Fanning in a very funny cameo. <br />It's true the movie may have a few plot holes, and, yes, it works a little too hard to sell a happy ending, which is the only aspect of the film that DIDN'T work. But this kind of pure escapist fare can get away with a certain amount of flaws through high spirits and sheer inventiveness - both abundant qualities in The Italian Job. It's an adventure and a character study and a hoot-and-a-half worth of laughs. Frankly, all summer movies should be this much fun.
0792163710|5.0|Fifty years after its first release, SHANE remains one of the most highly regarded Westerns of all time.  At worst, people seem to regard it as one of the better Westerns, and many regard it as the very best.<br />If you don't like or enjoy ritual in a film--and many Westerns are extremely ritualistic (Sergio Leone took this to extreme levels in his spaghetti Westerns)--you won't like SHANE.  The entire film is structured around a host of rites and rituals that structure the relations of all the characters in the film.  Some of the rituals are a tad heavy-handed, like the scene in which Shane and Joe Starrett dig up the tree trunk in the yard.  More effective are the rituals of survival that have become an indelible mode of existence for Shane and Jack Wilson.  One of the great joys of the movie is watching Shane negotiate his physical surroundings, the intense awareness he evidences at every second of everything around him.  Rituals and games are closely related to one another, and the movie as a whole is a vast game between the farmers and the rangers.<br />As a whole, this is a first rate cast, with Alan Ladd handing in the finest performance of his career.  Was there ever a more despicable villain in a Western than Jack Palance's Jack Wilson?  (Trivia:  Palance actually could not ride a horse at the time he made this film.  Notice the various work-arounds during the course of the film, including his walking into town leading his horse, walking along in front of it, done because Palance looked so awkward in the saddle.)  The supporting cast is deep and rich, and many of the performers turn in memorable performances, in particular Elisha Cook Jr. as Stonewall.  Brandon De Wilde as Joey, the young boy who idolizes Shane, and through whose eyes the entire movies unfolds (in the novel, Joey is the narrator), manages one of the most likable performances by a young kid ever.<br />SHANE was filmed in Teton National Park, well before it was developed to the extent that it is today, and the exterior shots are as glorious as any film ever made.  If anything, the mountains are so magnificent that they actually detract from the story.<br />My only real complaint with the movie is that it isn't as good as the novel.  I am not a huge fan of Western novels.  Apart from the novel by Jack Schaefer and a couple of books by Larry McMurtry, the only Western novels I really like are those by A. B. Guthrie, who interestingly wrote the screenplay based on Schaefer's novel.  Very, very few movies are ever as good as the novel upon which they are based.

B00008AY3L|5.0|Okay, albums like &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; by Mariah Carey and Madonna's critically panned album &quot;american Life&quot; have better average ratings then this.  What makes this album so much worse than all his other stellar albums?  The first single is a great reggae song with the usual reggae theme of the liberal stance of saving the world.  But this album is filled with great melodies (title track, Amen Omen) and even has some great variety with the 6th and 7th track.  While there is no &quot;Waiting on an Angel&quot; on this album, &quot;Amen Omen&quot; is a great ballad on the disc.  This is definately going to go down as Ben Harpers best selling album as it has been sticking around the 70's and 80's positions on the Billboard 200 album chart, and to date has sold about 189,500 copies.  This album is definately the introductory to mainstream stardom for Ben, and thats what he deserves.  He's better than just about anythign out there right now.
B00005ATQD|4.0|...who, in his classic work, \\"Civilization and Its Discontents\\" asserted that repression of the unconscious is the foundation of what we consider \\"civilization\\" and a necessary evil.  Not all that breathtaking or revolutionary of an idea by itself---in fact, it's something that most conservative folk would basically agree with, though instead of \\"repression of the unconscious\\" they'd probably say \\"morality\\" or some other nonsense.  But it's the same basic idea: the basement is infinitely dark and scary, and you may want to go down and look around once in a while, but it's nowhere you'd like to stay for long.<br />Part of the genius of Stanley Kubrick is his ability to take fairly commonplace things and elevate/magnify them into something much bigger and more interesting things than they normally are.  He does this hear with the two mediocre lead actors (Kidman and Cruise), and also with Freud's little truism above.<br />Cruise is a handsome man, with lots of charisma, and has made a career of playing the seemingly carefree, cocksure alpha male---and his range is fairly limited to that.  Kidman here plays a woman at once ordinary and very sexual beneath the surface---even though she is a fairly attractive woman (often reminded me of a young Meg Ryan) \\"sexy\\" would normally be quite a stretch.<br />Yet both actors pull it off: Cruise shows flashes of genuine anguish, and Kidman (with the help of lots of tasteful yet sensuous nudity, most notably of her remarkable derriere) does project something other than the prim-and-proper-little-girl persona she usually dons for most of her other films.  And the film itself often does feel like a dreamy descent into the subconscious and much of its contents: fear, lust, jealousym, obsessiveness, sexual confusion, mistrust, etc.<br />As long as you don't focus on \\"what's going to happen next?\\" and just soak in the magic of each NOW frame, you learn to appreciate the richness of the present moment.<br />This movie DOES seem slower than most of Kubrick's films, but if you keep the allegory in mind, you start to enjoy the sheer visual mastery that's in almost every frame of any Kubrick film, the atmospherics, and of course the music, which was superbly integrated into the film.  I'd hesitate to say that this is Kubrick's best, but still pretty darn good by industry standards.wer than most of Kubrick's films, but if you keep the allegory in mind, you start to enjoy the sheer visual mastery that's in almost every frame of any Kubrick film, the atmospherics, and of course the music, which was superbly integrated into the film.

B00005KHKX|5.0|I could never imagine the lead roles in this movie being played by actors other than the magnificent Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee. They give the entire film a weight and importance in movie history that it might otherwise have missed. Woodward and Lee can act. Boy, can they ever.<br />I have some interest in the new age movement and its purported derivation from pre-Roman Celtic religion. Yet I'm well aware that the largely agrarian world of the Celts was a harsh and violent environment, with animal and sometimes human sacrifices often accompanying the more peaceful and hoistic spritual aspects.<br />This film depicts that blood-based world (put into a modern situation and context) magnificently. <br />As a depiction of modern communal paganism it is very realistic, even though most new-agers would despise the emphasis on sacrifice and blood-letting.<br />This is terrific movie-making.

No matter how popular the episode gets (or how well this CD sells), this will always signify to me that this was the season that signified &quot;Buffy's&quot; demise.

0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is Dan Brown's suspense novel about the hunt for the Holy Grail and those who would stop its discovery.  It is an intriguing presentation of theories about the Grail and various religious conspiracies, but fans of the suspense genre may sense a certain been-there-done-that feel to the book.<br />The story begins with Robert Langdon, a professor specializing in religious symbols, being called to the scene of a strange murder at the Louvre.  The victim has conveniently taken long enough to die to leave a riddle behind, a riddle intended to team up Langdon with the victim's granddaughter, Sophie, and send them off on a quest for the Grail.  They set off on this quest, pursued by the police (who think Langdon is the killer),  a mysterious figure called the Teacher, and a giant albino monk who is hired muscle (all these types of novels have some freakish killer) and part of an extreme sect within the Catholic Church.<br />Apart from some interesting theories about the Church and the Grail and various pieces of art (such as the Mona Lisa), this novel doesn't offer much, but Brown does write well enough to keep things reasonably exciting.  Though the story requires a lot of exposition, Brown does a good job of parceling it out in small doses mixed in with the action.<br />Although the theories in the story sometimes cross the line into implausibility, Brown does put together some rather intriguing concepts.  This is far from a perfect novel, and far from an original one, but it is a fun one.

B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen is one of the best CDs out there. Amy Lee has this beautiful but eerie voice that can haunt you for weeks. She and Ben Moody wrote all the songs on this album, and they're good, especially the lyrics. A little depressing, but they're a lot less shallow than, let's say, Mandy Moore or Mariah Carey or those other people who lament about getting dumped by their boyfriend. Anyway, whoever you are, you should go and buy this.

B000092Q7O|4.0|Summary:<BR>Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a concert pianist living in Warsaw just before the beginning of World War II.  When the Germans do invade, Wladyslaw, who is a Jew, ends up in the ghetto with his family.  Through a series of lucky turns and kind friends, Wladyslaw avoids being sent to a concentration camp and is hidden in a series of abandoned flats.  As the war winds down and is coming to and end, all of the people that have helped him survive have either been killed or captured and he is left to fend for himself.  He is finally caught by a German Captain, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann), but instead of killing him, the Captain gives him food and helps him stay alive until the Russians are able to free the city.<br />My Comments:<BR>The movie really is pretty remarkable.  I don't know that you can critique a movie like this without, in a sense, criticizing what happened, but I'll do my best.  There are three things that, in my opinion, make this movie great.  First, the cinematography and sets are stunning.  You really do get the impression that this was filmed in Warsaw in the 1940s.  There is one scene, when a tank shell explodes in his flat, that was superb - the sound was that of what Wladyslaw must have been hearing - a buzzing with everything else blocked out; incredible!  Second, the cold brutality of the Nazi's comes out very clearly.  People are killed for no apparent reason; dead bodies litter the streets.  Death becomes something completely foreign to those of us that have never experienced war and cruelty like this; but for those that lived through it, death was ever-present.  Third, Adrien Brody was pretty good.  As noted above, the movie really does come across as a combination of 'Shine' and 'Anne Frank's Diary'.  Considering how well these two stories have done over the years, combining them is bound to be an exceptional story.<br />As for the problems with the movie... Neither of these is really a problem, just things that, if unintentional, could have been improved.  However, if they were intentional, they just added to one's sense of what it must have been like.  First, you never really get to know any of the secondary characters.  If this was unintentional, then it is something that could have helped people relate easier.  If it was intentional, then, in a sense, this is what Wladyslaw was living through, the loss of all those close to him.  Second, the time that is spent in the different abandoned flats goes on and on and on.  If intentional, this is undoubtedly it must have felt to Wladyslaw and that is probably why so much of the movie is made up of his time in these places.  So, my two main criticisms aren't really criticisms, but rather pointing out things that could be seen as problems unless interpreted as having been intentional in order to help the viewer of the movie better understand the horrendous circumstances of Wladyslaw.<br />Overall, the movie is very powerful.  I hate to consider it slow, but it is kind of slow - but only because the war must have seemed interminable to those that were living through it.  Be warned that the movie is very graphic with the cold violence of the Nazi war machine ever-present but, like Schindler's List, this is a movie that people should see to understand what it was like.  <br />Did Adrien Brody deserve the Oscar for his performance?  He was pretty good; definitely more deserving than Denzel Washington for Training Day.  But until I've seen all of his competition, I don't know that I can comment.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|In the past few years (and months) we have had many greatest hits compilations from all of our favorite 60's, 70's and 80's bands.  I own quite a few of these compilations and this one is by far the best.<BR>Unlike, say Elton John's recent compilation, this album does an excellent job of spreading out the songs.  Its not chronological so its not like all of the &quot;Rumours&quot; songs are together.  <BR>Buy this album!  Its great!  Every single song is phenominal in its own way.
0060926317|3.0|I enjoyed this book while reading it.  It even gave me a feeling of inspiration.  But I never would have read it in the first place if I had known about the magical thinking it contained.  When I came to the part about dowsing, I said to myself, &quot;Some people believe in that stuff.&quot;  When I came to the part about telepathy I said to myself, &quot;I know what my wife is thinking before she says it; these 20 or so people were with each other 24/7 so they know each other that well.&quot;  Then I came to part about the compound fracture of the leg (it could have been the fibula) healing enough in one day so the person could walk on it without a cast or other support, I said to myself, &quot;No way, Jose!&quot;  Then a reference to flying saucers!  Yet I guess I was able to suspend my disbelief enough to really enjoy this piece of poetry.  Finally, I don't for one minute believe that the author wrote this just to make a buck - I feel that this is an inspired piece of fiction which contains some truly meaningful messages.  If you don't let yourself be put off by the hoakum, this can be a very enjoyable read.
B00005JLK1|4.0|The critics have been far too harsh on this movie. The creators aren't out to make highbrow films - they just like to scare their audience. If you're a fan of the old Saturday or Sunday afternoon black and white horror flicks, you'll appreciate Ghost Ship for what it is - great B movie horror. The setting is great, the story good, the actors do a good job in creating their characters, the opener is gorey and I found it had several good scares in it. <br />Not for the weak of stomach (a scene about half way through literally made me gag) nor for kids under 14 or so. But if you liked 13 Ghosts or House on Haunted Hill and are tired of horror movies that feature teenagers and/or screaming female victims, you'll be happy to curl up with some popcorn and dim the lights for an enjoyably creepy experience.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Well I think my title summed it up!  I am a very big history buff, and love anything to do with World War 2...as long as it is a true story!  This movie was amazing!  I was totally impressed with Adrien Brody!!!  What Talent!!!  Totally reccomend this movie!  It takes you on a very emotional journey of life hope love and faith!  Definatly a buyer!
B000089RVX|2.0|This band/cd would be the best ever if they lost the female vocal. She makes it terrible in my opinion, her voice does not match the rock. The male's vocals on the other hand are fantastic. If he ditched the chick the cd would be off the hook. But in some people's opinion she makes the album good.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Daredevil tells the story of a young boy who lost his genitals in a forklift accident and becomes blind.  With much passion, he learns to overcome this and become a fighter just like his father and he prowls the streets at night searching for his mother.  He dresses up in a dopey costume similar to the one featured in the movie Daddy Day Care.  Jennifer Garner plays a character who is just a token love interest, Colin Farrell plays a guy who can throw things really fast, and Michael Clarke Duncan plays a big kingpin dude.  The movie also features Bernie Mac portraying a midget and Jennifer Lopez as Ben Affleck's girlfriend.  Oh, and Queen Latifah sings something about mambo somewhere in the movie.  I give Daredevil a rating of 15.5 out of 4 stars.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Ok you know the album and you know the songs. This was the Who's Sgt. Pepper presented here for the first time from the master tapes. I noticed the better sound quality immediately.The bonus tracks are great too but what really is outstanding is Disc 2, the performance from the Young Vic show. Songs rarely if ever again performed live are featured here and the band is in top form. Roger's voice is strong and Keith's drumming is solid. The packaging couldn't be better with a booklet, gatefold cardboard sleeve and the Decca and Track record labels reproduced on the discs. It's like seeing an old girlfriend after a long time and she looks better than you remember. Package, sound quality,performance and songs, -5 Stars. Highly recommend.
0425129608|4.0|Agatha Christie's EVIL UNDER THE SUN was immensely respected when it debuted in the 1940s.  Today it pales a bit alongside the truly great Christie novels of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s--but it is still a tremendously entertaining read that will appeal to both new and long-established fans.<br />The novel is cast in a \\"classic English mystery\\" mold: a group of vacationers at an exclusive resort with limited public access fall under suspicion when a beautiful femme fatale is found strangled to death on an isolated beach.  Is the killer a jealous husband, a jealous wife, an unstable step-daughter--or is it connected with the occult, a possible serial killer, an unknown blackmailer, or a member of a drug distribution ring?  The plot complications come tumbling one on top of another, but fortunately for the innocent the island resort is host to a private detective on vacation: the celebrated Hercule Poirot.<br />The novel is particularly memorable for the way in which Christie requires readers to interpret the personality of her characters... and in the process leads you completely astray. Long time fans may recognize the plot device on which the solution rests, for Christie used it earlier in a number of celebrated short stories and would repeat it in a number of later works as well--but to give the Queen of Crime her due, she so neatly works the story that even the most astute reader is unlikely to arrive at the full truth until Poirot deigns to expose it.  Tremendous fun, and well recommended.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is an outstanding film from top to bottom. From Roman Polanski's direction the Ron Harwood's brilliant adaptation of Szpilman's book, to an incredible cast - not to mention the heart-breakingly brilliant performance of Adrien Brody, this is arguably one of the best films ever made about World War II and/or the Holocaust.<br />If there were any doubts that the young Brody could hold his own in a movie of this magnitude, his performance - and the 2003 Best Actor Oscar that he deservedly won for it - have all but shattered them. His performance is absolutely INCREDIBLE! Hollywood had better take notice.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Faceless is Godsmacks best work yet.  Every song on this album is amazing, beautiful to listen to. Godsmack has proven in this album that they have grown lyrically, melodically, and instrumentally while keeping their hard rock edge which makes them who they are.  I highly recommend this album to all the Godsmack fans that have not yet purchased it and to anyone who loves Rock music.  This album is the best!! Their is a song on this album for everyone.  Godsmack will no longer be Faceless after this album.  ROCK on!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I am a total Madonna fan.  This album continues her trend of taking us on her journey through life and towards enlightenment.  It is an emotional masterpeice that gives a look at the deeper Madonna.  If you can listen to &quot;Mother and Father&quot; without feeling something, you are dead inside.  &quot;Easy Ride,&quot; &quot;Nothing Fails,&quot; &quot;I'm So Stupid,&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; are definately my favs.  But to tell the truth at first listen I was like &quot;WHAT THE...&quot; this is not what I expected but the second time I really listened feel in love with th cd.  Since then I can't stop listening to it.  It is the perfect Madonna cd if you're a fan of hers or not.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is my favorite Metallica album, although Puppets is a very, very close second.  This album just seems to be the more [mad] one they've ever made.  There isn't a bad track on the album, and there are a few exceptional tracks (Blackened, Justice For All, One, Dyer's Eve, To Live is to Die, and my personal favorite, the Frayed Ends of Sanity).  It's music I listen to when I'm in a bad mood and want to stay in it.  If you are a Metallica fan and don't own this album, I don't know what to say.  The only drawback on this album is that it didn't have Cliff Burton's (RIP) talent on it.  Not to take anything away from Newsted, who is a fine bassist, but Cliff was exceptional.  Also, for some bizarre reason the band turned down the bass on this whole album to mess with Newsted, which is not only just paints them as jerks, it also means the album could have been even better.  I'm not sure why they did that.....but regardless, it's still an amazing album.  Some albums I want to give 4.5* but give 5 because there is no option, but this really is a 5* album.

B000002KN8|5.0|Depeche Mode's premier album was the start of both DM's career, and Vince Clarke's(later to form \\"The Assembly\\",\\"Yaz(oo)\\", and finally \\"Erasure\\").  The seeds for both stem right here.<br />From the opening \\"New Life,\\" we get an upbeat tune, very different from where DM is right now. \\"I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead\\" is a title that infers an ultimately depressing song, but like Vince's later \\"Oh L'Amour\\", its another popy upbeat song, with lyrics that narrowly contradict the music.<br />Most of the album carries on with even more catchy tunes provided by Vince Clarke, the master of synth, but, we also get to see the stems of modern Depeche Mode.  Although most of the tracks were written by Vince Clarke, DM's current songwriter, Martin Gore, gets two shots off in this one, and at this early stage, its hit and miss.  \\"Tora!Tora!Tora!\\" easily shows us where Depeche Mode would go with Gore at the helm.  The lyrics in this song are noticably darker than those by Vince, and the music has a much different sound than those by Vince.  \\"Big Muff\\" is Gore's miss.  A drab song by comparison, its nothing really special and probably the only song I don't play to death.<br />Finally, \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\".  This is the song that cemented Depeche Mode's career.  Vince Clarke/Depeche Mode's first hit, this song was performed at the 101 concert, long after Clarke left the group and is one of the classics that personified the 80's.<br />I will end this with some quick advice, if at all possible, get the UK version of this album.  It includes 5 extra tracks,<br />11)Dreaming of Me<BR>12)Ice Machine<BR>13)Shout<BR>14)Any Second Now<BR>15)Just Can't Get Enough (schizo mix)
B00005J6T0|4.0|TRUE BLUE is a classic dance/pop album of the 80s. Some huge hits were spun off this album such as &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Live To Tell&quot;, &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, even &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Where's The Party&quot; were minor hits. The album may sound a little juvenile but it's a fun classic party album. Definately the song that gets me going is &quot;True Blue&quot; with its infectuous flat drum beats and her fun vocals, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; is another song that does it for me. Madonna makes social commentary on &quot;Love Makes The World Go Round&quot;, which is a fun song. &quot;White Heat&quot; is another highlight on the album. &quot;Jimmy Jimmy&quot; is alright but kind of annoying with the background vocals&gt; There's also an extended version of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; and The Color Mix of &quot;True Blue&quot;. This is classic 80s, everyone should have this album!
B00008NRI8|4.0|Sandra Bullock plays a lawyer who is passionate in her defense of the downtrodden.  She ends up working for wealthy playboy Hugh Grant who is interested only in women and making a profit.  Soon their differing ideals begin to clash and Bullock threatens to quit because her job requires her to be on call 24/7 for such monumental decisions as to which tennis outfit Grant should wear to a benefit tournament.  The ending is a foregone conclusion, but it's fun getting there and Bullock and Grant manage to throw off just enough sparks to keep things interesting.  If you're looking for an evening of light entertainment, this might just be the movie for you.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This is Madonna's classic debut album, released in 1983. The album has a heavy disco influence, and introduced the world to Madonna. It opens with the bubbly &quot;Lucky Star&quot; which is one of my favorites on the album. &quot;Borderline&quot; is another catchy song that was a hit for Madonna, but perhaps the biggest hit of her career is &quot;Holiday&quot;. She's had many but a lot of people remember &quot;Holiday&quot;. The rest of the album has that classic dance feel, highlights including &quot;Burning Up&quot;, &quot;Everybody&quot;, and &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;. Not essential for every fan but every hardcore Madonna fan will want this classic dance album of the 80s.
B00005JKZV|1.0|Unfortunately this movie discards the story line of the Two Towers halfway through the movie.  Along with the incorrect emphasis on the battle of Helm's Deep, the interaction between Frodo and Faramir is absolutely incorrect.  I don't understand why the tale was so corrupted by this film.  I dread the release of The Return of The King because who knows how the wonderful original Tale will be corrupted like it was in the Two Towers.  The Fellowship of the Ring did a decent job (although it had its flaws) but it's nothing as flagrant as the disaster of the Two Towers.
B00005J6SZ|3.0|With LIKE A VIRGIN, Madonna dropped the producers from her first album and enlisted the help of Nile Rogers. The album spun a few hits, such as &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; which were important career songs for Madonna. However, the album isn't as good as her debut, and often falls short. It's simply too boring. Her remake of &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot; here in uninspired, however the newer version from SOMETHING TO REMEMBER definately improves on her original version of the song.  There's definately some throwaway tracks like &quot;Over And Over&quot;, &quot;Shoo-Bee-Doo&quot;, but some good moments like &quot;Pretender&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;. Overall not really essential by any means unless you are a big fan that wants everything Madonna has put out.
B000094J5T|5.0|Jewish pianist Wladyshaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is considered to be the most gifted pianist in pre-World War II Poland. Music lovers eagerly await his shows on Polish radio, and fans travel to Warsaw to meet him. But when Nazi Germany invades Poland, Polish Jews begin to be persecuted. At first they are forbidden from public places, required to wear arm bands identifying them as Jews, and are restricted in the amount of money they can keep. Then all of the Jews in Poland were relocated to a small part of Warsaw that became a Jewish ghetto and confined there. Wladyshaw Szpilman and his family were among them. Szpilman managed to survive the difficult and terrifying life in the Warsaw ghetto for several years, until only 60,000 of the original half million Jewish occupants remained. He escaped to the outside before the ghetto was burned and was hidden by some friends in the Polish underground. Even with the aid of others, Szpilman became deathly ill and nearly starved to death on several occasions before the Russian army finally drove the Germans from Poland and he was free to come out of hiding.<br /><br />&#34;The Pianist&#34; is the story of Wladyshaw Szpilman's struggle to survive the desperate circumstances that Polish Jews faced under Nazi occupation, based on Szpilman's autobiography. &#34;The Pianist&#34; was directed by another Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation, Roman Polanski (whose parents paid for a rural Christian family to keep their son while they were taken to a concentration camp). Roman Polanski has said that he would never make his own story into a movie, and he waited a very long time to direct someone else's. &#34;The Pianist&#34; is a long movie, and it contains a lot of material that would not be essential to tell Szpilman's story. The extra material helps pace the film and is included in such a way as to give the film a lyrical quality, create mood, and enhance our understanding of the environment in which Szpilman and his countrymen were living. Presumably for personal reasons, Roman Polanski did not cut this one to the bare bones. That's fine because the added length gives us a chance to see more characters, some very fine cinematography, and more of Adrien Brody's excellent performance. &#34;The Pianist&#34; is engrossing enough that its length doesn't produce boredom. There are a lot of minor characters, and all of the film's performances are impressive. I highly recommend &#34;The Pianist&#34; for its incredible story of perseverance, great performances, beautiful cinematography, and inspiring tribute to the power of music.ng.

B00003CXTG|5.0|I put off watching Pearl Harbor for some time, largely due to the dissatisfaction expressed by some viewers. Having now watched it, I have to say I was pretty much blown away by the movie. Certainly, this is no Tora! Tora! Tora! or any kind of definitive film about the events of December 7, 1941, and I think it is important to note the fact that it did not try to be such a film. The moviemakers tried to achieve a sense of realism but most of all they sought to recreate the experience of the event; no movie can even begin to show what the disaster was truly like to those involved, but Pearl Harbor comes as close as humanly and technologically possible. I don't really have any quibbles to make over historical accuracy because that is not a critical issue for me in this context. Certainly, the portrayal of certain characters is not necessarily correct, the main characters are not based on any real individuals, and a lot of the background story is not used to set the record straight on the unbelievably incompetent and, perhaps, treasonous decisions and actions that made our Pacific fleet a sitting duck to the Japanese attackers. In turn, very little of the Japanese side of the story is told. On the other hand, I was happy to see mentioned such things as the pre-attack interception of a Japanese sub entering the harbor and a recreation of Doolittle's Raid which gets far too little coverage in the history books.<br />The love story bothers some people, but I understand what the moviemakers were trying to do in this regard: to make a story as poignant as possible, it has to be shown through the eyes of someone the audience can identify with and care about. The love story in this case is rather complex, but in my opinion it strengthened this movie's overall impact, at least on me. All of the actors were fantastic in my opinion, particularly Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett. Cuba Gooding, Jr., had a tremendous impact on the film through his rather small role as the true hero Dorie Miller. Seeing Alec Baldwin portray a military hero took some getting used to, but he was terrific as Lt. Col. Doolittle. Another unusual casting job that came off well was having Dan Aykroyd portray a high man in naval intelligence. I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers actively sought out Pearl Harbor survivors and tried to integrate many of their stories into this monumental film; while a certain thing may not have happened to a given character, that thing most likely happened to someone who was there. Seeing the nurses and doctors trying to save lives in the most hectic of circumstances was a poignant reminder that the fighting and suffering did not end suddenly when the Japanese pilots returned to their carriers.<br />The special effects, I have to say, were amazing, among the best I have ever seen. The explosions are huge, the lifting up of the deck just before the Arizona exploded was quite impressive, the sight of Japanese planes zooming over Pearl Harbor just above ground level was breathtaking, the sight of bodies being literally thrown into the air as a result of explosions was incredible, and the listing and capsizing of the Oklahoma was downright amazing. I was eager to watch the making of Pearl Harbor featurette included with the DVD to see just how the visuals of this film could possibly have been created. That featurette also features sound clips from a number of Pearl Harbor survivors, and this helps make clear the intentions of the filmmakers to make the real heroes' stories an integral part of this motion picture. The History Channel program on The Unsung Heroes of Pearl Harbor was another fascinating video that is probably the most important thing included in this very impressive DVD package. Others may criticize the love story or dwell on historical inaccuracies, but I found this movie compellingly indicative of the Pearl Harbor experience and it was, for me, an honor to watch it.as the true hero Dorie Miller.

From Buffy's &quot;Going Through the Motions&quot; to Spike's &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; to the Scooby Gang's &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;, this will have you singing along in no time!<br />The cast of &quot;Buffy&quot; did a fine job of singing these songs.  It's not easy doing a musical episode of a tv series, but these guys did a great job doing it!<br />As a special bonus, this cd has instrumentals from classic episodes such as &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Restless&quot;.  A must-have for every Slayerette!
B00008J4P5|5.0|I first heard about White Stripes on MTV2.  It was their song \\"Seven Nation Army\\" that drew me to like the song.  I listened to the sample on Amazon.com so many times, that my sister outright told me to buy the CD.  I did and I am listening to it and I'm impressed.  My most favorite songs are \\"Seven Nation Army\\" and \\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\".  As an African-American, I like to listen to a variety of music rather than be limited to one specific type of music.

But i have to say India.Arie is calm and that's what i love about her. <br />She is a woman who is so calm, beautiful, smart, gifted, talents, lovely, nice, kind and warm. <br />And this CD delievers her personality. <br />EVEN IF YOU NEVER HEARD OF HER, listen to &quot;Video&quot; and you'll love her as much as i love her.
B000002GHH|5.0|I own two John Hiatt CDs, this one from 1987 and his 17-track career retrospective 'Best of John Hiatt', released in 1998. Great as the latter album is, this is the one I'd take with me on a long road trip, to be played over and over. This is really John Hiatt's finest music. But, to be fair, Ry Cooder should get equal billing with John for the superlative quality of this album. These two artists were lucky to find each other, and wise to capitalize on the musical chemistry between them. One senses that John could not reach his highest arc without the propulsion that Ry's electric guitar gives him, and that Ry needs the anchor of a songwriting and singing talent like John to give his amazing artistry a sharp focus and purpose. Many of the most rousing and touching moments on this album are provided by Ry. Take, for example, the rhythmic chopping sounds on 'Thing Called Love' that give it the strong scent of sex, or his long, bending, tearful slides on 'Lipstick Sunset'. I get chills just thinking about it. Another musical contribution of note is the quirky off-tempo thumping of Jim Keltner's bass drum in 'Memphis in the Meantime', giving the song an extra twitch of excitement.<br />But back to John. In addition to a great collection of songs, he has never sung better or with more believable passion than here, and he reaches his greatest vocal heights on 'Have a Little Faith in Me' (on which he also plays solo piano). And there is his sly humor, as in 'We can choose, you know we ain't no amoebas,' from 'Thing Called Love'. Now, that's an original pick-up line! But unlike other songs in the \\"let's get it on\\" tradition, this one is explicitly about married love. And that's John for you. With all the adventuring, road-lust and heartbreak in his songs, he's a sincere family man, who knows it takes a lifetime 'Learning How to Love You', and his values all point in that direction. He is one of the great singer-songwriter-performers of the last 20 years, and this is his peak ' so far.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes play rock music. They play it well and it doesn't have to be intellectualized to death. I play classical music for  living, but for recreation I like indie rock a la Raveonettes, Built to Spill, and songwriters like Buffy Sainte-Marie (thus the title quote). Once I picked up Elephant I could not get enough of this band, and within a week I had all 4 CDs. With an album of any genre I really appreciate variety and The White Stripes pull it off here with style and humor. They must be doing something right for Conan O'Brien to have them as musical guests for 5 nights in a row. This and their other CDs get plenty of repeat play in my household.
B000023VR6|5.0|This cd is too ill for words. it is trully a Dr.Dre masterpiece. There isn't one bad song on the whole album. Dr. Dre is a rap geniouse and this cd proves that. anyone who is thinking of buying this cd, im telling you now....BUY IT. you will be satisfied.This album is a remix to the originol masterpiece \\"The Chronic\\" and it is even better than that masterpiece. This album includes many huge hits such as The Watcher, Still dre, whats the difference, forgot about dre, the next episode, and bang bang. All the songs are bad so dont think those are the only good ones. This is the illist album ever recorded.
B00008OWZC|5.0|If you have just a passing interest in Led Zeppelin, get this CD/DVD set of them in concert, you will no longer just have a passing interest in them. I have been a Led Zeppelin fan for a long time, and my love for them just intensivfied 10 times. My only 2 regrets are that I never got to see them myself in person, and that they aren't still performing.
B000084T18|5.0|50 cent is a new star and he is doing extremely good for only having 1 big album. This cd is a masterpiece. every song is awesome. every flow kinda sounds the same but thats because all 50 can do is mumble after that gunshot to tha face. he is a very talented rapper and i advise anyone to buy this album who is thinking about it.
B000002O4S|5.0|The now almost classic(?) soundtrack to the 1985 film boasts the only #1 hit that \\"Huey Lewis & The News\\" ever had. This, I think, is the first soundtrack that features the music of Alan Silvestri. The sad part, and the major flaw, is that there are only two tracks that feature any score material of his from the film (\\"Back to the Future Part II\\" is pretty much the same style score as the original \\"Future\\"). They are worth listening to, as well as \\"The Power of Love\\", and \\"Back in Time\\". \\"Time Bomb Town\\", and \\"Heaven is One Step Away\\" should have been replaced w/ Silvestri's memorable score (I'm positive that Lindsey Buckingham, Phil Collins, and Eric Clapton aren't putting these songs on top of there most proudest moments lists). Great soundtrack all around.
B00006NSGX|2.0|This is not a bad CD, there is just something not quite right.<BR>The problem is that all songs are played with the exact same, flat emotion.  So a blues number like Have You Ever Loved a Woman, has the same light energy that an up tempo song like Wonderful Tonight or Sunshine of Your Love has.  It is middle of the road, and not fitting for any of the songs.  It is as if Clapton is becoming a lounge act, ready for Las Vegas.<br />Most of these songs have been done live before, and much better.  So this CD adds nothing new or special.  And there are some bad songs.  Reptile is a throw back to late seventies, Sunday Brunch jazz.  It sounds like something George Benson would have done, only not as good.  My Father's Eyes has some guitar work, but just drones on way too long.<br />There are some good parts, and Clapton does open up on guitar occasionally.  The best solos, however, are on keyboards, by Billy Preston.  <br />I am giving this 2 stars, because there are so many other better Clapton CD's.  However, anything by Clapton is better than most things by other artists.  If you want to here Clapton really rock or play the blues with some emotion, get Crossroads II, or 24 nights, or Derek and the Dominos Live.  Hear how Have You Ever Loved a Woman or Bell Bottom Blues should sound.<br />The other reason I am giving this 2 stars, is the slimely trick they play to get you to buy both the DVD and the CD.  If you want to just hear music and or play this in the car, you need to get the CD.  But, they purposely leave off one track so you need to get the DVD, if you want the complete show.
B0000691U1|5.0|This album has been talked a lot about and I can say little more about the musicians themselves, each phenomenal in his own right. But perhaps less mentioned is that while this session ended up being a bona fide success, it really had a very good reason to fail or at least flounder in mediocrity. That reason, simply, is that Duke, Roach, and Mingus, though all brilliant jazzmen, learned and played jazz in different worlds -- just diiferent enough that it could've broken down communication among them, resulting in something much less that what became the Money Jungle album. <br />Duke was a celebrated godfather figure of not just jazz, but of American music in general, at the time of this recording. His reign as a bandleader and contribution as a composer have never been paralleled. His rise to musical prominence was during the very popular swing era and his earliest introduction into jazz performing was in a time very different than that of either Roach or Mingus. Roach, although getting his start in the latter days of the swing era, refined his craft and paid his dues during the bebop era, when audiences and critics weren't so accepting of jazz's latest innovators, forcing the beboppers underground where their music became iconic for the various subcultures of the day. Mingus made a name for himself in a crowded post-bebop jazz world where he and his many notable contemporaries had to walk through an ever more dense forest of Ghosts from Jazz Past to find their own niche and make their own individual contributions. <br />It's easy to pick up this album and think \\"Duke, Roach, Mingus -- this MUST be good.\\" Yet, upon realizing just how different of musicians each of these men were coming into this session, the listener should be struck with awe at what they accomplished. Despite the very real chance that it would be dismal failure to connect, it ended up becoming a testimony to the greatness of these three musicians, both individually and collectively. Moreover, onlymusicians of a most superb caliber could transcend such personal and social differences so effectively without losing their respectively individuality and bring their individual contributions together so cohesively and complimentary as Duke, Roach, and Mingus did here. Because of this, the significance of this album lies not just in the fact that it's brilliant music. It speaks volumes of jazz as a genre spanning over generations and of the profound and astonishing degree of musicianship that can be found among some of jazz's greatest names. <br />For these reasons, it's downright criminal that this album's talked about much more than actually listened to. I can only hope that this better-late-than-never remastered edition will be incentive for jazz fans to cool the hero worshipping banter long enough to give this album some most deserved listening time.

B00006F83Y|2.0|If you're one of those feeling that's nothing good has been done since Nirvana, this album's definitely for you. It's pop songs dressed up to sound \\"creditable,\\" like much of Nirvana. But it's still an old game. Sure, some of the songs have great hooks, but like the pop music it really is, it's not very substantial. However, I don't wish to argue with the legions of QOTSA faithful anymore then I would want to get into a theological debate with Jerry Farwell. <br />The reason I'm writing this review is because I was misled about this band by one of their fans, and since their own fans seem to be deluded as to what they're really about, I figured I'd speak up. I bought this album because I was told this band was a \\"jam band,\\" which I thought, being a musician myself, meant they had spent hours \\"jamming\\" and therefore their music would have the music depth and finesse achieved when a group of musicians have a solid, intuitive sense of personal interaction with each other when playing. To good musicians and seasoned musician listeners, this intuitive interaction is an obvious aspect of the music, and QOTSA doesn't possess it. That's because they're a pop band and they play like one. They slap their songs together in a very conventional, proven-for-success fashion around the fabled \\"hook,\\" and record before the songs start sounding too \\"polished.\\" Cute trick, but not everyone's falling for it. To be fair, Josh Homme claimed once this music is meant to be the stuff guys listen to in their cars on the way home from a rough day at work, and it's just not anymore than that. Try to make out to be anything more and it just doesn't hold up, unless you rely on the media and label generated hype (or the no small amount of self-congratulating QOTSA likes to heap upon themselves). Bottom line: it's not a new religion, it's not prophecy of great things to come, it's flippant consumerist music for a shiftless consumerist market. If that can be accepted, then I've got no beef againstanyone eagerly blaring this from their car stereo as they tear out of the workplace parking lot on a Friday afternoon.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining on every level, \\"X2\\"works as an action film, a political thriller, and a surprisingly moving romance.  It also has a beautifully controlled subtext about \\"otherness\\" which drives some exquisitely accurate skewers right through the heartless chest of the current US administration.  Singer and his crew have managed something that few comic book adaptations even strive for, let alone achieve: they've taken the source material and made it resonate for a new audience in a new age.  They show us how good an effects-intensive film can and should be.  Beyond the sheer delight of digital imagery and fight sequences, Singer has clearly expended just as much effort on ensuring that the story is engaging and works as a film narrative and not just as two hours of eye candy.  He doesn't make the mistake of staking his film's whole appeal on a few elaborate, digitized set pieces which are entirely revealed by the trailer. \\"X2\\" confirms his place among the truly interesting directors working today (go back and look at the unfairly neglected \\"Apt Pupil\\" - his work there is superb, as is McKellen's).  Singer's talent for balancing spectacle, story and sentiment makes me wonder what he could have done with the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels - two films which fail on every one of those counts.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Jazz should have a earthiness to it, and at first listen you'd think Norah Jones has that down pat. Jones knows how to sound like a jazz singer, and she certainly has musical ability to her credit. Yet, that's somehow not enough to make this CD float with me. The whole album, with its notable producer and more notable musicians, seems to comes together effortlessly...to the point that it's suspicious. Give the pretty surface a scratch, and there's something a bit hollow underneath. After repeated, attentive listening, even that &quot;earthiness&quot; in Jones' voice begins sounding like mere wallpaper covering dry wall. <br />My conclusion is that this album is the epitomy of what &quot;easy listening&quot; has come to mean: not necessarily music that's easy on your ears or nerves, but music that insists that the listener not listen too hard. A hard listening would reveals it's not really jazz, but almost, it's not really beautiful, but almost, and it's not really soulful, but almost. At some point you may even begin thinking of the idea of &quot;Norah Jones,&quot; the living and breathing individual whom this music supposedly represents, as another surreal facet of the album's nonreality. The music has all the appearences of being, without any of the actuality. Which is fine, I suppose, since this album seems to be intentionally geared toward being a pleasent experience without actually stimulating mind, heart or soul. If you can listen without wanting that stimulus, then this album should be enjoyable. But if you're like me, a not so &quot;easy&quot; listener, the thing begins sounding unnervingly like some kind of deliberately ineffectual fluff music in the vein of Huxley's Brave New World.
B00005JLRT|2.0|As everyone knows this is the last TNG movie, so essentially the last movie in the best series that I've ever seen on television. The special effects are excellent; some of the action is really good; Picard is awesome as always...but other than that...<br />This movie was an incredible disappointment for me. The plot is thin, the notion of character determined by genetics, which has the potential to really become interesting, instead is reduced to triteness because it no one ever explores it beyond the basic ideas that everyone already has about it, and the whole thing basically feels dissociated from the rest of the series.<br />For some reason, all of the actors seemed fatter now.<br />And that would be okay, but it's just that there is nothing monumentally final about \\"a generation's final journey.\\" This feels like an extended episode--admittedly, a criticism often brought against all Star Trek movies--but for this one I think it's spot on. It's a substandard sci-fi action movie that lacks TNG's affinity for philosophical discussion, deep plotlines on two-part episodes, and involvement of the entire cast. Generations was about paradise and expulsion, and finding one's self and the believable insanity of Malcolm McDowell, and Data finding his emotion and it had Klingons and space battles and the Nexus. First Contact was about sophisticated plotlines where the action was integral and where our knowledge of the characters was drawn from the show. It was about visiting the past and uncovering the oft-alluded to, but never explicitly stated, trek elements. Insurrection was about love and immortality, about the exile of family. I don't know what Nemesis is about. Genes? That hardly receives sufficient interesting treatment. Family? Shinzon is a tacked on new character that we've never seen before, with no history with Picard. Endings? True, the sacrifice at the end is powerful, but there is this feeling that it has been wasted...like it could have been done for so muchmore. Ships have been on the verge of exploding hundreds of times in this show, so why this time did someone we love have to die? And Shinzon, this character with no history and in which we are not invested at all, is to insignificant to deserve the title of \\"nemesis\\". Even if the idea of nemesis alludes to selfness--the nemesis inside Picard--it's still to small, since when we actually see that realized we have no connection to him. The nemesis in TNG is the Borg, or Q--characters with incredible power, and intriguing minds, and mystique. Not some young guy who comes on the show with no history, and whom we are supposed to believe is remotely comparable to either of those entities, which are both possessed of history and demonstrated futuristic omnipotence.<br />I just don't buy it. This story is too narrow for a generations final journey. It's an anticlimax, and that is just such a tragedy.
0804106304|5.0|Human emotions remain unchanged through time and its a given that different generations who believe that their perspective of life is different and unique usually always come to a point were they discover that they are only making an interpretation of minor varitions of the same tune.<br />In this book most of the characters feel that the common element that define them as persons is their chinese ethnicity. However, as you read their stories a subtle veil starts to open and they perceive points of connection to their elders, other members of the family and the nation which is now theier country, which is by far wider that initially they ever imagined.
B00005JLEU|5.0|well..I am  15 and a girl. This movie has a great storyline and it has to have the most beautiful dragon that i have ever seen. It may look childish at first but it goes deeper. \\"Spirited Away\\" truely touches your heart. It leaves you in awe. I highly reccomend this to anyone at all who would like to see a young girl's courage and bravery save her parents.
0451196716|5.0|This book was very good.  It kept you interested all the way to the end.  Although the ending was a little weird (and could have been a little better) the book overall was excellent.  I enjoyed it very much and I highly recommend it.  You won't be able to put it down!
B00005JKPF|4.0|I've been reading the X-Men comic books since the 70's.  I really enjoyed the first movie.  The second one picks up where the last one left off and takes us from there.  It's still primarily focused on Wolverine, but the others do get their share of screen time.<br />After an assassination attempt on the President, a guy named William Stryker is authorized to infiltrate the Xavier School after showing evidence of a military operation beneath the school's surface.  He's really looking for Cerebro, which could be the key to wiping out all mutants<br />I won't give anything away more than that. Just be prepared for a better movie, with a lot more action and better special effects.  Those who know the comics or the animated adventures of the X-Men will get to read between the lines and anticipate would could be coming in future films.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Come Away with Me is a wonderful CD.  Norah has a wonderful voice - paired with decent song writing. Do not judge this CD based on &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; - A great start but not even close to the best song...
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is by far the most emotional, magnificient motion picture about the triumph of the human spirit since The Shawshank Redemption. A shattering, at times overwhelming account of Spilman's struggle for survival during the Poland invasion, this film is as depressing, maybe even more so, than Schindler's List. However the ending is one of the most uplifting finales since Dead Poets Society, and will leave you feeling as if you have gone through what Brody's character experienced, and you'll leave with the most awesome feeling of inspiration and love.
B000002AGN|5.0|Along with MILES DAVIS's ROUND MIDNIGHT,TIME OUT is probably the most famous jazz record of the fifties.Most of our uncles or fathers had a dusty vinyl copy lost in their basements.People who never heard about the DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET know at least the three famous melodies included here:BLUE RONDO A LA TURK,TAKE FIVE AND THREE TO GET READY.THREE TO GET READY became a FRENCH song LE JAZZ ET LA JAVA, recorded by CLAUDE NOUGARO and YVES MONTAND who often included it in his singing repertoire.As we often say,a classic even if it's not intented to be, always stands the test of time.Time will not run out on you,because AMAZON.com always have copies of TIME OUT ready for you to buy.

None of it is nearly as agonizingly awful as Wings bilge, but nevertheless it has no content whatsoever--no lyrical content and also NO MUSICAL CONTENT. The closest Paul McCartney ever came, as far as I can determine, to a decent solo album is &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;, and I recommend you buy that instead (but only listen to half of it).

B00006JKON|1.0|What does &quot;bungle&quot; mean? As a transitive verb it means, &quot;to work or act ineptly or inefficiently&quot;. As an intransitive verb (how it's used here) it means &quot;botch&quot;. As a noun it means &quot;a clumsy or inept performance, a botch&quot;. That's IT. Then what possible sense can &quot;Let's bungle in the jungle/That's all right by me/I'm a tiger when I want love/I'm a snake if we disagree&quot; have? Really, Ian Anderson might have just as well titled the hit single from this record &quot;MUNGLE in the Jungle&quot; or &quot;WUNGLE in the Jungle&quot; for all the information conveyed by the phrase &quot;BUNGLE in the jungle&quot;. Sound like baby talk to you? (Well, I'm thinking....)It does to me too. Goo goo ga ga.<br />Now take a look at the back cover. Is that just the sappiest thing you've ever seen? Well, they say you can't judge a book by its cover, but in this case you CAN judge a RECORD album by its BACK cover. Its sanitized sappiness very effectively mirrors the sanitized sappiness of most of the actual record. (Except for the emblem Ian Anderson is holding up and possibly his tights, the front cover, on the other hand, is fairly cool.)<br />By the way, I think we're all agreed that &quot;Skating Away&quot; is pretty good song--so maybe I should really have rated this one and a half stars. Whatever.
B000002A3T|5.0|This album is a true &quot;group&quot; attempt to get back to what Pink Floyd was before Roger Waters almost destroyed them.   After Waters' self-serving &quot;The Wall&quot; album and an equally depressing &quot;Final Cut&quot;, it was refreshing to see David Gilmour and Richard Wright get together and produce music which is &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;.  Although I liked &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; it was still missing an element --&gt; the musicianship and keyboard playing of Richard Wright, who came in halfway through the album.   <br />It was good to see Richard Wright come back and place his stamp on &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;.   The haunting sounds of 'Cluster One' and 'Marooned' are phenomenal. It reminds me of his great contributions to the &quot;Meddle&quot;, &quot;WYWH&quot; and of course &quot;DSOFM&quot;.   David Gilmour makes a much better attempt to write songs that sound more like &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; rather than &quot;David Gilmour&quot;, which is what happened in the AMLOR album.<br />If this is Pink Floyd's final studio album, then the final song &quot;High Hopes&quot; is the perfect farewell song for all Floyd fans.  This song is the icing of a very well baked cake that David Gilmour and Richard Wright made.<br />Thank you David, Richard and Nick.

B000002C1W|3.0|Maybe I'm not giving the number of stars it deserves....perhaps if this album was a David Gilmour album...it would get five stars plus.   Songs like &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; (which is my favourite song on the album) is just not a classic &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; song.<br />The only two songs that would be consider &quot;Floyd&quot; songs would be &quot;Signs of Life&quot; and &quot;Sorrow&quot;.   What was desperately missing in this album was the musical contributions of Richard Wright, who did not make any contributions (in terms of song writing) after the WYWH album until the 1994 album Division Bell (which is much better than this album).<br />As an album, this is one of the &quot;must haves&quot;.  But as a classic &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; album, you might want to make this one of your last albums to add to your collection.
B000050XEI|5.0|A Day Without Rain is undoubtedly one of Enya's best-ever albums. Surely the first three songs on the album make it a true masterpiece. The album opens with A Day Without Rain, a track without words, yet so comforting and uplifting your soul will resonate with its message. The second song, Wild Child, is exactly as it says- one of the upbeat tracks, sounding like a playful storm that got away. It leads into Only Time, a softer, quieter song that will lift you into the clouds. Next, Tempus Vernum returns to a louder sound, but more dark and mystical. Many reviewers have complained about Tempus Vernu. I, however, think it adds power to the album and gives it more variance. Tempus Vernum ends suddenly, leading into Deora ar mo chroi, a song for reflection. Flora's Secret is a happy song that will leave you smiling at the lyrics. Fallen Embers is another return to the soft vocals and quieter sounds. You will climb higher on &quot;Silver Inches&quot;, journey along with &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, march along to &quot;One By One&quot; and float away with &quot;Lazy Days&quot;. Enya continues to produce the best soul-soothing music anywhere in the world. An unforgettable, memorable album.
B00005QXXO|4.0|The first thing I noticed about the CD was the price tag. Seems a little expensive for 8 songs, but as EPs go, this is pretty cheap, so I went ahead and got it. This is a must for Radiohead fans. Radiohead always manages to change their songs a little bit for concerts and this does not dissapoint.<br />The National Anthem-I like this version better. It's not as \\"noisy\\" as the studio recording. (i.e. no brass instruments.)<br />I Might Be Wrong-This is sped up insanely. The drum beat is slightly different. However, you can barely hear anything over it.<br />Mornung Bell-You can barely tell that this is a live recording. It sounds so much like the original.<br />Like Spinning Plates-This is a nice piano version. A HUGE switch from Like Spinning Plates as we know it. I like it.<br />Idioteque-There is a nice echo in this song cause it's live. It fits really well. This sounds very much like it did on the music video. There are some annoying off-key beeps going on through most of the song.<br />Everything In Its Right Place-There is a lot more percusion. The vocals aren't as messed up this time. They record Thom singing and play it back at different points during the song.<br />Dolloars and Cents-They really didn't change much about this.<br />True Love Waits-This song isn't on any other albums (not including EPs, I don't know about them.). It's very nice. Acoustic guitar. Typical Radiohead slow song.<br />I really can't find much to complain about on this cd. Buy it if you're a Radiohead fan. If you're not, you won't get as much out of it as you would the studio albums. In short, this is not a good choice to start your collection.
B000094DUP|5.0|I'll admit that I was extremely skeptical at first when I heard that another Neighbours star was turning to singing. When I first heard the single &quot;Born To try&quot;, I loved it and knew that she was different than her predecessors (i.e. the manufactured Holly Valance). Her follow up single &quot;Lost without you&quot;,which I too loved,was performed live on &quot;The Panel&quot;. This showed me that not only did she play the piano but she had an amazing voice and could sing live, unlike so many other pop artists. Furthermore, she could have 2 consecutive number 1's without bearing her midriff, dancing and parading nearly naked in her videos. Her third single &quot;innocent eyes&quot; too is catchy and another great ballad. Her album is a collection of beautiful ballads most of which she co-wrote. If you love ballads this is a definite must.
0743243153|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read!  Let me say that to start.  I am putting up this review as a refutation to Rebecca's review.  If she would have literally turned the page and read the next paragraph, she would have seen the context in which the sentence is given.  Obviously, the sentence sounds quite pernicious by itself. But Mr. Peck clears this up in the next paragraph as he explains that the situation where he would need to have sexual relations with a patient doesn't exist.  As a Physics major,  We rely on the facts not emotional knee-jerk reactions to difficult situations...
B00008PX8P|5.0|I can not begin to say how great this DVD is. The sound and clarity of all the concert footage and interviews is outstanding. I have been a fan of this band since I was 13 (now 35) and I never got to visually experience them live. This DVD is the next best thing since it covers their entire existance as a band. If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin do not hesitate to buy this. Outstanding!
B00005JLRT|5.0|When I first saw Nemesis in the movie theatre, I wasn't extremely happy with it. When I first went to see it, I was a little tired, having come just after getting out of work. I'd been anticpating it something fierce, and I was mildly disappointed with the unexplained appearance of Welsey, and Worf. (Wesley left ST:TNG to travel through space and time, and hadn't been seen for something like a decade, and Worf became the ambassador to the Klingon Empire at the end of DS9.)Anyway, apparently, Worf's new job sucked, and he punched a few of the wrong people, and Wesley decided to pop in for a few moments. Oddly he vanishes right after the crew's first scene. I would have liked him included in the memorial scene, as he was very fond of... him. (I'm trying hard not to spoil anything. I'm sure most of you already know it though...)The story flows somewhat differently than previous outings, and this time there's some extremely excellent action shots of the Enterprise-E in battle. Most of the 'dog-fighting,' if you could call it that with ships this big, are breath taking and in a couple cases, jaw dropping! Digital Domain took over the special effects, as ILM is busy with the other 'Star' franchise, I assume, but they certainly did a hell of a job, and are to be commended for their fine work. And I certainly didn't feel the SE's took a lead role, the story is still very much character driven, with the SE's taking a supporting role, which is a good thing. Patrick Stewart (Picard) shines in the movie, with Sirtis, Frakes and Spiner (Troi, Riker and Data in order) all receiving some fine supporting work. Data most of all, of course gets a lot of time, and a huge scene, but Riker, Troi and LaForge all have some great scenes, but I felt the rest of the cast didn't have enough to do in the movie, Worf, most of all, seems to get shafted. Shinzon is a great villian, and his interaction with Picard is nicely done from beginning to end. The film looks great, and the transfer is crisp and smooth throughout. I didn't notice any flaws at all, honestly. (And with a film this new, there sure shouldn't be, damn it.) The 5.1 surround sound is great, as is Jerry Goldsmith's film score. The extras include several deleted scenes, and it would have been nice to see them in the context of the film, but I'll take what I can get. The documentaries are nice, showing some of the making of the film, and thoughts of cast and crew. I haven't listened to Director Stuart Baird's commentary yet. All in all, the film may have flopped at the Box Office, but it's really well worth another look. I'm happy I decided to pick it up, and my overall view of the film improved with a second viewing.p and smooth throughout. I didn't notice any flaws at all, honestly.

B00000DGUG|5.0|In &quot;Supposed former infatuation junkie&quot; Alanis Morissette shares with us her thoughts about the dark sides of the human spirit, through such songs as &quot;Thank U&quot; (desillutionment), &quot;Would not come&quot; (depression), &quot;Your congratulations&quot; (anxiety) and &quot;Joining you&quot; (suicidality). Dark the subjects may be, but they are dealt with in a daring, light and uplifting way. Her music - and the empathy of her beautiful voice - accompany these lyrics to make the experience of listening to &quot;SFIJ&quot; a rare and precious one.<br />Even we who are fortunate not to have been troubled by the dark sides of the human spirit, know how to appreciate her reflections, as they also provide us with original outlooks on humanness and spirituality in general. Personally, &quot;SFIJ&quot; contributed to broaden my horizons in a way that I'd never experienced with a music album before.<br />Let me mention, though, that I was left utterly desillutioned - for the first time in my life - when I got my hands on Alanis Morissette's miserable follow-up, &quot;Under rug swept&quot;. If you enjoyed &quot;URS&quot;, &quot;Supposed former infatuation junkie&quot; is probably nothing for you.

B00005MAM2|5.0|Okay, I have been reading through the reviews here and the main thing that everyone seems to have a problem with (well...besides the movie itself) is the new language track version.  Basically I like the new language track.  I grew up watching both the dubbed version and the old language track and frankly, the dubbed voices seemed to be a far cry from what the original Japanese voices sounded like.  At least the new dub makes the freaky old children sound like children instead of dirty old men.  Now, I will admit that there is a bit of nostalgia associated with the old language track (I do think it is a shame that Pioneer didn't include them both), but the new track is more accurate to the original Japanese and the got rid of all of they God-awful 80's cliches that filled the original dub.  <br />There, I have said my mind about the infamous redub...now on to the actual movie.<br />The film is more artsy than \\"normal\\" films (animated and non-animated alike).  There are long periods of character silence where the only thing the viewer can hear is ambient noises, sound effects, and the score.  The plot is also so warped, twisted, and utterly insane that most viewers will have to watch the film several times before they actually figure out what is going on (if they ever figure it out at all).  Basically, the best way that I can think of to describe this movie is to think of a Kubrick film.  Kubrick's films were long, drawn out, and so utterly convoluted and brainy that most people left the theatre (or their couch after watching 2001 in a single sitting) cursing and scratching their heads in dismay.  That is how Akira is too, only Akira has enough ultra-violence and twisted images to keep most testosterone driven males occupied.  <br />Okay, that description doesn't really make much sense.  To be honest, there is no real way to describe Akira besides using terms that you have probably already read here like Great Animation, Great Score, and the infamous The New Dub Job...  As far as the plot goes, it has something to do with special powers being unlocked, friendships, government conspiracies, inner turmoil, love, hate, freaky little wrinkly children, death, violence, and some big inhuman monster (if you watch CNN you will be used to all of that). So all that I can really say is if you like Kubrick movies, you will probably get a kick out of this film.   If you are a hardcore anime fan, you will most likely already own this movie.  If you are a huge fan of the graphic novel, you will think [bad of] this film ...(personally I am a huge fan of them both..but I am just weird like that).  If you like major brainless Hollywood films, you probably shouldn't watch this film because your head will explode.  If you are none of those things...mayb you should try renting Akira before purchasing it.  If your head explodes....you probalby shouldn't buy this movie.
B00005BCPC|1.0|this is the worst of the recent adaptations of jane austen novels. by far. i'd give it NEGATIVE 5 stars if i could. the story is rushed and confusing, and the characters have no depth or charm. even mrs norris is bloodless in this film. a terrible, terrible screenplay. this is what happens when a feminist decides to rewrite literature/history to fit her silly idealogy. <br />it's as if a male chauvinist decided he didn't like the 'effeminate', 'wimpy' hamlet, and turned the indecisive, tormented dane into an uncomplicated, take-charge, rambo-type action hero! what a total travesty that would be of shakespeare's classic. who in his right mind could sit for that?<br />so who in his right mind can tolerate what's been done to fanny price? it's the same thing. fanny has a right to be fanny, even if it doesn't agree with some woman's notions of what a woman 'should' be. <br />let's be frank: most women are NOT liz bennetts,  even if many think/wish they were. so why should all movie heroines be foreced to fit this one narrow, ideological mold? why can't women just be women in the movies like they are in life?<br />there's nothing wrong with fanny price. she's a beautiful character...read the book instead, and skip this film. fanny - and jane - deserve better than this.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I had this movie on DVD for ages, but never gotten around to watching it. When my friend came over on Friday night, she decided it was time we both finally saw it. What a dissapointment. <br />After hearing so much about this movie, I expected much more. Even if I had heard nothing of this movie, I would have found it bad.<br />While both actors are beautiful, that is not enough to make a good movie for me. Some of the songs were good, yes. But I don't buy the idea of their ove. Christian (Ewan) is in love with the idea of love; then, he sees her, the most beautiful woman in the Moulin Rouge, and, surprise surprise, falls in love. She mistakes him for a Duke, he sings her \\"Your Song\\", and she falls in love. He comes back later, they kiss, they're so in love. The movie continues to show us the couple making out and declaring their love for each other, but when did their love devolpe? Call me unromantic, but I don't buy their \\"love at first sight\\" exusce. Love does not stand on looks alone. And Satine's sickness seems like a lame exucse for more drama.<br />As for the music, while I understand it was meant to be deep how there's music from the 1990's in a movie taking place in the 1900's, again, I don't buy it. To me, it just seemed out-of-place. Come on, was it really that hard to find a soundtrack for this film?

0385720920|5.0|Tremendous. Witty and deep. The perfect antihero in the age of dehumanization. This book glories in its anti-intellectualism. Mr. Palanhuik is not for everyone, but definetly at the top of my list. He crosses the line between harsh realism and fantasy in such a subtle way that it becomes impossible to distinguish. This may seem like a criticism but it is the opposite.

B00008PX8P|5.0|This is my first review of any product that I have purchased from Amazon.  I am a hard-core Zep fan since I first saw them play at Live Aide.  There isn't much to say about this DVD except that it is undeniably AWESOME.  The band has miraculously kept much of its live footage under wraps and this DVD changes everything.  The set list is craniological and is excellent quality esp. for JAMMING on a 5.1 surround sound stereo system.  I am in shock that they have kept this footage underground for so long.  Easily worth the [money] for \\"Bring It On Home\\" alone!

B000002NFM|5.0|A must have album for anyone whose a fan of the Prodigy.  The flow through the whole of the 10 tracks is shear brilliance.  The sampling in Breathe really gets the adrenaline flowing as does the back beat of Firestarter.  My other favourites from the FOLT include Narayan and Fuel My Fire.  In summary, 5 stars is a true score for this masterpiece.
0066214122|1.0|Michael Crichton has a great formula for people to continue purchasing his books - it's a gamble that you will either be thoroughly entertained and enrapt in the story or thoroughly disappointed.  I'd put Prey in the latter category.<br />Jack is an unemployed computer programmer who's wife Julia is wholly consumed in her work on bio-and nano-technology at Xymos.  But Julia becomes more and more distant, a changed person - no longer the loving wife and mother.  Thus, the first 1/3 of the book deals with Jack as Mr. Mom, while trying to figure out if Julia's having an affair, as well as how he can get a job in a field in which 6 months of unemployment is a career-ending situation.  I felt as if I were watching a mid-afternoon soap opera.<br />Then Xymos contacts Jack for help.  It seems the computer program Xymos is using for its nano-technology ventures was originally started by Jack and his team and now the program has some &quot;bugs&quot; in it that needs his expertise.  Meanwhile, Julia's been in a car accident, Jack's sister is pushing him to get a divorce, his kids continually fight, oh the horror!<br />The sad thing is...this is when the book turns south.  The events and people that Jack encounters at Xymos are confusingly put together, very disjointed, and does not allow the reader to grasp   just where Crichton wants to take us.  The &quot;prey&quot; itself was confusing, its progression disjointed, its ultimate reason for killing not evident, its purpose left in the Crichton's mind only.  <br />I was not entertained, I was not horrified, I was not moved at all.  This was a very easy book to put down each day.  I finished it because I have finished EVERY book I have ever started (as well as it being recommended by some friends).  But beyond those friends remaining my friends, this venture with Crichton was not worth the time taken to write this review.
6305428522|5.0|The movie starts out with one of the main characters poised in a 1957 brand new Chysler as a car salesman schmoozes the man into believing things that he really wants to believe, but taken out of context, are simply untrue. This scene completely and surprisingly sets up the brilliance of the following two hours of cinema, called \\"Quiz Show\\".<br />America's fascination with the sale of happiness is told through the lens of the infamous 1950's \\"Twenty One\\" quiz show scandal. It tells the tale of one Herb Stempel, an ex-GI who's intelligent if not terribly charismatic.  His smarts got him to stay on the show, but soon you see the machinations of money hungry corporations calling the shots behind the screens. Herb needs to go because his mug isn't pretty.<br />Enter Charles Van Doren, family family and good looks to boot, who becomes the new darling of Twenty One. But first, he needs to beat out Herb hiimself, who takes a fall in hopes of preserving any hopes of an imaginary television career. Stempel's fifteen minutes are up, and he spends the rest of the movie trying in vain to get them back, or at least ensure no one else does.<br />The movie moves on with the investgation of Dick Goodwin, driven by passion for justice and a quest to find the truth. He chases that lucrative beast throughout the movie in hopes of pinning it down.  The brilliance of Van Doren manuvers him around it constantly, while the anger of Stempel is almost too raw to be believable.<br />What could have been a mere retelling of the scandal, which in and of itself is an interesting story. But this film aims higher, much, much higher, and the results are simply impressive. We in America want happiness, and we are willing to purchase it for any price. The fact that Van Doren was fed answers to his questions simply didn't matter; the public loved him, the sponsors loved him, and all were happy to buy into that illusion. The illusion of happiness, so wonderfully ridiculed almost in the final credits as the audience is shown rollicking and screaming at the results of a television show.<br />All performances in this movie are grand, from John Turturro's manic Stempel to Ralph Fiennes slick Van Doren, even Scorese as the slimy sponsor. Under Redford's smooth, stylistic direction, this film is a tribute to the late fifties as much as it is an expose.<br />This is one of those films that should be on more people's top ten lists. It instructs without being preachy, and fully showcases the strength that cinema can carry. A great movie, overall.as the audience is shown rollicking and screaming at the results of a television show. <br />All performances in this movie are grand, from John Turturro's manic Stempel to Ralph Fiennes slick Van Doren, even Scorese as the slimy sponsor.

B00008NG5V|3.0|Jack does an admirable job on his sophomore effort, but one has to wonder about the songwriting. Some of the lyrics appear to have been afterthoughts, and on lyric in particular...&quot;Blah, blah, blah, blah&quot; during &quot;Cocoon&quot; makes me wonder what the hell Jack was thinking...was he really in such a hurry that he didn't even want to bother creating a lyric for that line?????
B000002UVX|5.0|For an album with only 6 songs it packs more punch than any album i have in my collection. Machine gun is the best guitar performance ever recorded, and if you havent heard it this album is a must buy. This rates 10 stars in my book.
0872860175|5.0|Allen Ginsberg's epic poem, Howl, says so much about American society that it cannot be ignored or simplified. Ginsberg's views on America are still considered unorthodox and radical, but his observations both in the Hedonistic underground in the Baby Boomer-Leave It To Beaver 1950s, and his mentally ill friend Carl Solomon are as poignant as any poem written now, and represent a diminished sense of innocence in American culture, which predated feminism, the sexual revolution, AIDS, Reaganomics, ENRON, and even the full blown massacre of the Vietnam War. Very few poets have made an impact in writing now, but to me, Allen Ginsberg is the greatest poet of the last century, and easily had an impact on many writers today.
0156027321|5.0|I've often been motivated to write reviews for books that I've read, but after looking at the comments of other reviewers, my own thoughts seemed fleeting and unimportant. However, I think that there is something in this book which many might have missed, and I will perhaps try to expand upon that now. I hasten to use Amazon.com as a book discussion forum; so, for those who want a simple \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", suffice it to say that the experience of reading book is well worth its price. Whatever they are charging these days, and whatever better things you think you might have to do, do yourself a favor and read this one.<br />In Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi,\\" we are presented with two starkly different accounts of what really happens to the young Pi Patel. One version of the story takes place over 90 chapters, and it is as filled with wonder and mystery as any works of fiction that I've ever read. The other is explained over the course of two, maybe three pages, and plainly stated, it is awful.<br />At the end, and in many ways throughout this story, the reader is forced to suspend his or her disbelief - to sacrifice the horrible obviousness of reality on an alter of pure imagination (to twist the author's words). Yet, even being a rather mathematical person, I had no troubles doing this, simply because I was aware that I was reading a book - a work of fiction, pure and simple.<br />In life, however, I am often not so forgiving. The terrible destructiveness of nature; the starvation of millions; the unquantifiable suffering that we all endure has, in some ways, lead me to reject the idea of God. Like Bertrand Russel, a mathematician and devout atheist, is said to have stated, \\"Why, God, [if you exist] do you give us so little evidence of your existence?\\"<br />Its hard to see how people can read this book and find the importance of religion completely irrelevant. The same reviewers who identify the importance of telling, even believing in the \\"better story\\" fail to extend that idea through the work itself. There are many of us who go through life doubting an underlying reason for the happenings of things. Random chance occurances - flips of the coin that trigger events - for most of my life I've always thought that this was the way of things. <br />I don't think I'm doubting that now, to be honest. A story of life with God watching down upon me would of course be a far \\"better story\\" than one of probability, of cause and effect, of divine independence. That doesn't mean that its entirely believable - and I don't know if this book has made me \\"believe in God\\" the way its author meant it to - but such an explanation of reality is, of course, a \\"better story.\\" <br />In any event, I have tried to give words to vague ideas that flutter about in my mind, only minutes after finishing this work. For what its worth, I believe solemly that Pi Patel survived for several months with the company of a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. As for the rest of things - life itself - I remain skeptical.
B000002UAU|3.0|The Beatles were arguably the greatest rock band ever, and certainly the most significant, but they weren't perfect. Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, while it was groundbreaking and did influence many, receives more recognition and admiration than it deserves. People say that 'oh, people saw rock music as an art form w/ this album,' or 'this album changed the world,' but even w/ REVOLVER or some songs off of RUBBER SOUL, rock was seen as an art form, as well as artists like Bob Dylan, and underground legends Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground. <BR>Here's a song by song review:<BR>1. Sargent Pepper's: This song is an excellent intro to the album. It just flat out rocks. 5/5<BR>2. With a Little Help from my Friends: Sung by Ringo, which isn't as bad as Yellow Submarine. It's pleasant to listen to. 4/5<BR>3. Lucy in the Sky w/ Diamonds: By far the best song on the album, and one of Lennon's most tripped out songs. The imagery he uses is like Bob Dylan on LSD, and the music reflects the lyrics, and it makes me feel I'm seeing 'the girl w/ kaleidescope eyes.' 5/5<BR>4. Getting Better: \\"It's getting better all the time...\\" Paul's song about changing his life around. Not a bad song, but not their greatest either. 3.5/5<BR>5. Fixing a Hole: This gets a lot of praise, but it gets repetitive. The song really doesn't go anywhere. The lyrics are pretty cool though. 3/5<BR>6. She's Leaving Home: This song just annoys me. 2/5<BR>7. Mr. Kite: Uhhhh.... wow? Another tripped out,bizarre Lennon song about some ad for some... freakshow or something. Not to be listened to while intoxicated! 4/5<BR>8. Within You Without You: George's lone track on this album, further exploring his infatuation for Eastern music. Some say it drags out way too long, but I like it... a LOT. 4.5/5<BR>9. When I'm 64: A good song for weddings, but Paul's sentimental balladry goes too far. It's the 'Honey Pie' of this album. 2/5<BR>10. Lovely Rita: Another Paul love song, except more bouncy. It's good,not great. 3/5<br />11. Good Morning: Lennon returns after a 3 song absence w/ this rocker. I like the time changes in the middle, and the lyrics are very interesting. 5/5<BR>12. Sgt Pepper (reprise): Kind of the introduction to A Day in the Life. 3/5.<BR>13. A Day in the Life: By far the highest point on this album, and quite possibly the best Beatles song ever. You go through so many moods and textures on this entire album. perfect way to close off an album! 5/5.<br />So, there's my review of the album. Many of the songs on this album were excellent, but with a few mediocre songs, it only somewhat takes away from how essential and great many people make it out to be. It's worth listening to, and for a lot of the songs it's worth owning.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Well, after viewing this I have to say it's certianly more intertanting than Song Remains The Same. However, and this is going to make some Zep/Page fans a little mad..but I just feel Jimmy's playing live is a little messy..I'm trying to be nice here. An example is White Summer--just not a good rendition..there's a better live version of this he did with the Yardbirds. Jimmy is a genius make NO DOUBT--but his genius is in the studio and every studio recording they released is evidence of that. Jimmy himself will point out that he's not a great guitar player--but he is a great composer and arranger. But I ramble--if you really love Zepplin--get this--I am, and I did..If you just like Stairway to Heaven yada, yada, yada..don't, just listen to the studio CD's on a Damm good stereo.
0688163173|5.0|I've followed Dennis Lehane for most of his career, and find that he is best when not writing to a genre formula. As good as Mystic River was, Shutter Island will certainly up his reputation a few more notches. It has one surprise after another, and even when it becomes a bit predictable, it doesn't falter. I read it in two sittings, ( I am an admitted, but recovering insomniac.)and was not disappointed in the least.
B00004TDRD|5.0|I am not a scaredy cat, but this movie made me start looking over my shoulder every time I swim in open waters. It just gets inside your soul and you can't help but think about it anytime you get around the ocean or Gulf. It is one of the three best creature movies I have seen in my life. <br />The thing that really makes this movie is the psychological terror when it becomes apparent that the shark is actually hunting the men instead of the other way around. It offers everything that a great horror movie should have: the psychological tension, the building suspense, the sudden appearance that makes you jump and scream, and enough gore to make you cringe. This is a classic in horror!
B00008OWZC|5.0|This CD is a great addition to the live sets from The Song Remains the Same and BBC sessions. Some of Led Zeppelin's best concert cuts. Great solos and sounds quality.
0062502182|2.0|Hearing positive things about &quot;The Alchemist&quot; and seeing it on sale at the campus bookstore, I decided to give it a try. Unfortuately, the book left me terribly unimpressed.<br />&quot;The Alchemist&quot; is the story of a young Spanish shepherd boy who is told that he is destined to find a treasure near the pyramids in Egypt. The boy then runs into a man who claims to be a king and tells him that everyone has their own &quot;Personal Legend&quot; that they must fulfill. He is also told that the world is always conspiring to help everyone fulfill this dream. Very early on you can see this book is purely about destiny. It's a hard pill to swallow. Guided by signs that he sees, the boy makes his way towards Egypt in order to achieve his dream. Along the way he gets sidetracked several times, gets introduced to alchemy, falls in love and eventually runs into an Alchemist.<br />I had a hard time keeping my attention while reading this book. The plot offers little to no excitement as you always know everything is going to turn out right because it's the boy's &quot;destiny.&quot; The writing is littered with one liners that you would be better suited finding in a book dedicated solely to them. They make the book hard to read by fragmenting it into a bunch of paragraphs leading up to a new one-liner. They also tend to lean heavily towards some of the tennets of Christianity, making it feel almost like you are being preached to.<br />I find it hard to believe that people enjoy this tale at all. It seems more suited for a child than an adult reader but I wouldn't trust filling my child's head with thoughts about them having a personal destiny that they have to fulfill. Do yourself a favor and avoid this book.
B000002VMD|4.0|There have been a lot of successful soundtrack albums from &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; to &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Titanic,&quot; but in all of those cases the movies were big successes as well.  However, in the case of &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; the album was way more successful than the film selling over 15 million copies, spending 20 weeks at the top of the charts, and winning the Grammy award for Album of the Year.  Then there was the hit single, &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; a powerful cover of Dolly Parton's sweet little song, which hit the #1 spot on the Billboard singles chart and stayed there for 15 weeks.  Of course where &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; was different from most soundtracks was that the leading lady not only did her own singing but happened to be at the top of her game.  True, she only sang the first six songs on the album (what would have been the first side of the record back in the olden days), but these were songs that sounded like Houston was still recording &quot;I'm Your Baby Tonight,&quot; except with better songs.  Consequently, there is nothing here that is regarded as a stretch for the singer turned actress (compare the results with what Bette Midler had to do in her first film, &quot;The Rose&quot;; Midler is a pretty good singer but Janis Joplin-type songs are not her forte).<br />Most of the other songs made it high up on various charts: &quot;I Have Nothing&quot; was #4 on the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;Run to You&quot; was #10 on Adult Contemporary, &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; was #1 for Hot Dance Music/Club Play; and &quot;Queen Of The Night&quot; was #1 for Hot Dance Music/Club Play.  For four years the album made it to the top spot on the Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.  If you want more of an explanation for the album's success than Whitney Houston's voice and Kevin Costner's buzz cut, then the variety of charts these songs covered evidences its widespread popularity.  The only serious complaint is that Houston only does the first half of the ablum and the rest is just the sort of filler than usually makes its way onto soundtrack albums in the last decade or so even if having Kenny G, Aaron Neville, and Joe Cocker doing the filling was above average.  But in comparison to the way the album started the second half could not help but suffer in comparison.  There had not been a soundtrack so &quot;A&quot; side &quot;B&quot; side since the Beatles put out &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and I just cannot round this one up when it comes to the rating.serious complaint is that Houston only does the first half of the ablum and the rest is just the sort of filler than usually makes its way onto soundtrack albums in the last decade or so even if having Kenny G, Aaron Neville, and Joe Cocker doing the filling was above average.

B00005JL7Q|4.0|Will (Hugh Grant) is a charming cad who does not have to do anything but watch television and date pretty women because he has the good fortune of living off the royalties for a catch little Christmas ditty called \\"Santa's Super Sleigh,\\" written by his father many years ago (Elvis recorded it).  In Will's philosophy, \\"a person's life is like a TV show,\\" and as far as our hero is concerned he is the star of \\"The Will Show,\\" which is not, he points out, \\"an ensemble drama.\\"  To those familiar with standard movie plots and attuned to the nuances of script writing, we know that by the end of \\"About a Boy\\" we will see Will eat those words.<br />It is become more difficult for Will to keep find women to date, since any and all such relationships have a life expectancy of two months tops.  So he hits upon the idea of dating single mothers because he stumbled upon the great \\"truth\\" that they are less demanding (i.e., more grateful) and easier to break up with (i.e., they care about their kids more than themselves).  The problem is that in searching for a place where one can increase the statistical probability of finding single women Will comes across a meeting of SPAT (Single Parents, Alone Together).  The only male at the meeting Will cheerfully spins a yard about being abandoned by his wife and having a remarkable 2-year old son named \\"Ned.\\"  This bait hooks Suzie, the first of what Will thinks will be many fish in a sea of plenty.<br />However, because these single parents make a point of helping each other out (the \\"alone together\\" idea) Will comes into contact with young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), whose single mother, Fiona (Toni Collette), is not handling her new life all that well.  Circumstances force Will and Marcus together, and, not surprisingly, the young boy thinks that this would be the person to pull his mother out of her depression and make them a family.<br />What makes \\"About a Boy\\" and above average film is that while such an end point might be what the story has set up and what convention would insist should come to pass, that is not what happens in the end here.  In fact, the ending is much more satisfying than that predictable conclusion.  The main thing is that whereas \\"Ned\\" is a great help to a preying bachelor, having the real article hanging around your apartment is not at all helpful.  Of course, eventually all this contact with the boy engenders real feelings in Will and when he meets Rachel (Rachel Weisz), he is confronted by a woman who is too good for him.  Does having a real \\"fake\\" son work better than having just a car seat littered with cracker crumbs?<br />Ultimately the chief attraction of this film is watching the two main characters transform themselves into the possibilities of better people.  Marcus has an advantage because he is more mature, yet it is when we get a sense of honesty from Will, either when talking to himself or to another person, that we know we did not make a mistake in wanting the character to find happiness.  My taste in Hugh Grant films lends itself towards the \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" direction than \\"Mickey Blue Eyes\\" or \\"Two Weeks Notice,\\" but \\"About a Boy\\" ends up at least in the middle adn is therefore quite acceptable.  Hard to believe this 2002 film was directed by the same guy(s) who did \\"American Pie,\\" which reminds me that the biggest laugh on the DVD is probably in the deleted scenes where we learn who else besides Elvis recorded \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\"e story has set up and what convention would insist should come to pass, that is not what happens in the end here.

B00004RHZU|1.0|I don't know why I bought this album in the first place. I probably was thinking that all the songs on here would be good, just because I liked one of the singles. This is a horrible album. It is really consistent and you can tell that this has nothing to do with her real life. I'm sad to say that Pink should've never completed this [bad] album.
B000087DRK|4.0|... 'Apocalypse Dudes' is a Teutonic metal album obsessed with gay sex.  Does it \\"out-Spinal Tap Spinal Tap\\"? It does.  TRBNGR offers up first-rate satire: they're the most superficially stupid band of all time, and manage to pull it off with a flawless poker face.  Come on, this huge, hairy Norwegian guy growls and grimaces, the guitar player succumbs to the Johnny Thunders disease (can't pick up the instrument without lapsing into the MOST RIDICULOUS SOLO YOU'VE EVER HEARD), and the band unleashes riffs as devestating and pristine as an Arctic Ocean iceberg -- and all in praise of sodomy.  Imagine the Scorpions releasing an album with (intentional) explicit homoerotic themes, and you've got a pretty good idea what to expect from 'Apocalypse Dudes.'
B000068TPN|4.0|We Were Soldiers, Randall Wallace's 2002 feature film about the three-day Battle of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, is perhaps the best Hollywood depiction of America's \\"lost crusade\\" in Indochina.<br />Based on Lt. Gen. Harold B. Moore and Joseph Galloway's non-fiction book We Were Soldiers Once....and Young, Wallace's film version is a realistic and respectful account of the first major battle between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces in November of 1965.<br />Starring Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, We Were Soldiers begins with the Vietnamese destruction of France's Mobile Group 100 in 1954, the same year that Diem Bien Phu fell and French involvement in Vietnam ended, paving the way for America's long and doomed intervention.  This opening scene is graphically violent yet serves to drive home its point - to show the determination of the Vietnamese to drive off any outside force, even if it means being ruthless.<br />We Were Soldiers, unlike Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now or Oliver Stone's Platoon, portrays its soldiers realistically and without the anti-military post-Vietnam War bitterness that permeates those two films.  (To be fair, both Coppola and Stone's movies are well made, and in the case of Apocalypse Now, that film is not really about Vietnam per se but rather a Vietnamized adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.)  Some viewers might even accuse Wallace (who wrote and directed) of having a right-wing revisionist slant, but in the featurette on the making of the movie, he points out that he was inspired to do We Were Soldiers when he read Hal Moore's comment that Hollywood has never gotten it right when it comes to making movies about the Vietnam War.<br />We Were Soldiers not only has respect and admiration for the U.S. soldiers, but it also depicts the bravery and sacrifice of the Vietnamese People's Army.  True, most of the focus is on the American troops and, unusually for a Vietnam combat movie, their families.  But I personally have not seen the North Vietnamese portrayed with this much respect in a movie - even though I know Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth is a movie that deals with the Vietnamese.<br />Mel Gibson portrays Lt. Col. Moore with his usual earnestness, wit and warmth.  He allows us to see the human side to this very intellectual and dedicated soldier.  He is not only a very pensive officer who reads French history books about Vietnam and has various college degrees, but also a loving husband and father.  His scenes with Madeline Stowe, who plays his wife Julie, exude affection and true chemistry.  Also, the scene when Moore explains the concept of war to his youngest daughter is touching and tender. Rounding out the cast are Sam Elliott, Barry Pepper, Keri Russell, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and American Pie's Jason Biggs.<br />The depiction of the battle at Landing Zone X-ray ranks among the best, if sometimes grueling, war scenes.  The movie captures the horrible yet mesmerizing spectacle of battle, taking audiences from the roller-coaster exhilaration of nap of the earth helicopter rides to a three-day life-or-death struggle between two determined bands of fighting men.<br />Paramount's Widescreen Collection DVD is, as can be expected, a basic offering in comparison to other studios' releases.  Admittedly, the root menu is flashier than previous DVDs from Paramount, and it does have director's commentary, two different Dolby sound settings, and the aforementioned making-of featurette.lly have not seen the North Vietnamese portrayed with this much respect in a movie - even though I know Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth is a movie that deals with the Vietnamese.<br />Mel Gibson portrays Lt.

B00005JLRT|5.0|first let me say that Tom Hardy is the hottest thing to hit the screen since I don't know. Watching him as the oh so tragic Shinzon is a total treat. The characters are true to form and do something more, they evolve. I was very pleased that this Next Gen movie had nothing to do with the Borg or time travel themes this franchise has been mired in since they took to the big screen. I really enjoyed this installment and recommend it wholeheartedly to any and all, Star Trek fans or otherwise.
B00005JLT5|5.0|A true story about the life of pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, and his life working in Polish labor camps during WWII, and how he escaped deportation and capture by living in Warsaw's ruins.  It is a truly mesmerizing story.  While it is somewhat slow in the beginning at sucking you in, you will be fully there by the end, I guarantee.  <BR>The movie doesn't ever get political, nor does it get graphic or gory.  It's simply one man's account of what it was like to be a Polish Jew and live through that time in history.  Oh, don't get me wrong, there's plenty of death.  It's just not dwelled on.  Nor are the horrors of Auschwicz, though we know what's happening through what we studied in history class and what we do see on screen.  When thousands of Jews are \\"relocated to the south\\" we know fully where they are going and what their fate will be. <BR>While I admit I have not seen all the nominated performaces as yet, Adrian Brody must surely have desreved his best actor Oscar.  His performace was absorbing, as was the movie.  Even if you're not a fan of Holocaust movies, this one is highly recommended.  Not as a history lesson, but as an uplifting story of human survival even through the worst of times.
B000088E6D|5.0|This young man has an excellent voice and his performance is awesome.Bravo!!!Ruben F. Salinas
B000069AUI|4.0|The lead singer has a pleasant sounding voice and the band plays tight together. <BR>It is good rock music and not that loud metal...<BR>In my opinion - it's a good buy !
B00000IBRX|4.0|robin williams cry when he smiles and smiles when he cry....not too many can do that but i can't tell the difference so it looks kinda funny but nevertheless mork from ork knows how to give out an emotional performance on cue but its something to get use to if u never seen him act before. the movie is visually fantastic with all the bells and whistles to give one a sense of what heaven and hell could look like. i did cry a little in the end but not cry a river like some might. it has a good ending but gets depressing before that.
B000063CMK|5.0|pain of salvation have established themselves firmly into the prog scene with this album.  Remedy lane shines with prog rock all the way through, and yet there are some softer mellower moments in the album.  Some parts even turn to jazz, and yet this album has a nice heaviness to it, making the music flow from one moment of crushing guitars to a sudden moment of near silence, just acoustic guitar and mellow synths.  Undertow probably one of the saddest songs on the cd, is very powerful with Daniel Gildenlw voice and the very sad intro.<BR>During the time the perfect element part 2 was supposed to be written, Daniel Gildenlw had relationship problems with his wife, and instead of the perfect element part 2, remedy lane came out.  Gildenlw took out all his fustrations in this albums, and you can really feel it, he takes out all his anger and saddness in this album, and that makes it a great listen.
6300214400|4.0|This is one of my favorite trek movies as it center around the search for Spock who died to save the enterprise and it's crew. Did you recall the many is greater then the few, or in this case, the one. Spock is my hero and i would try to find him too. In reality, how can he comes back to life once he is passed away....only in star trek could that be possible.  So watch it and see how :)  Enjoy!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I find myself astonished at some of the criticisms leveled at this record and Linkin Park as a band. It begs the question, why do these people still listen? Linkin Park have never made any apologies for the type of music they make and they're not about to start now. And I for one am glad that they aren't. For the &quot;purists&quot; out there, this is never going to be a record for you. <br />But why limit yourself? Meteroa is without question the best album I've purchased this year. It is Linkin Park at their awesome best, making a hybrid of music that flows and combines so effortlessly and seamlessly. They are a band like no other and I find their music inventive and incredibly sophisticated. Meteora is a CD that is a culmination of painstaking work and effort and it shows. With each listen, each song becomes richer and swells with an array of sound that at first might not be discovered by the listener.<br />I like Linkin Park because they make music that stands out, that satisfies completely and they've topped themselves with Meteora. It's a gem of an album.
0790734850|3.0|L.A. Confidential was a good movie, but it wasn't great. Kevin Spacey is always good, but you'll see better Spacey roles in K-PAX, American Beauty, The Usual Suspects, Seven, Outbreak, and pretty much ANYTHING else with him! He certainly wasn't bad in L.A. Confidential, he just didn't stand out so much. Russell Crowe was fine in this as well. He has certainly improved his performance though with The Insider, Gladiator, and A Beautiful Mind. Guy Pearce was great in this, and he delivered the finest performance of the film. His better roles are Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. Danny DeVito was his typical self. He is never a let down, but his better roles range from Matilda to Batman Returns to Hoffa. And then there's Kim Basinger. I LOVE Kim Basinger, but I have absolutely no idea why she won an Academy Award for this. I would have thought that this was one of her worse performances. Watch anything else with her, and her acting will stand out more than this! She was up against Minnie Driver's performance in Good Will Hunting for the award, and Driver was far more deserving of the award. Don't get me wrong, L.A. Confidential was a fine movie with fine performances, it just was not Oscar-worthy in any way. It wasn't amazing. It isn't a kid movie, and its R rating reflects violence, language, and some brief sexual images. This was fine to watch once.
B000089RVX|5.0|OK...let me start by saying that I was a bit skeptical about buying this album at first. I had heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and liked it quite a bit, but that never means that the I will like the album. I broke down and gave it a shot and WOW, am I glad that I did. The lead singer has a powerful voice which is recorded lilting and rocking over mostly raw guitars and then over piano and strings. There's an energy and immediacy to this music. This is a welcome album to my collection.
B000001E8P|5.0|Well, best of the '90s anyway.<br />I was a bartender in London in 1995, when NME and Melody Maker were all about &quot;Oasis vs. Blur&quot;, and I couldn't understand it. Radiohead, Elastica, and Supergrass came out with much better albums and singles that year than either Oasis or Blur, and Pulp's &quot;Different Class&quot; was the best of them all.<br />If you like smart, witty, catchy pop music, buy this album now.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Profound gratitude to Jimmy Page for his painstaking work, retrieving and in some cases rescuing this material. Both this and &quot;How The West Was Won&quot; are of an uncompromised level of quality both technically and artistically. And it's clear from the promotional materials that this was a gruelling undertaking. What a gift to listeners now and in the future that Page has offered this stirring, gorgeous compilation in all its glory!<BR>As a viewer I find the early material the most compelling. The nearly hypnotic mystery of Jimmy Page's playing is more attainable when he is newer to the stage. Robert Plant as a younger man also seems closer to the wellspring of his inspiration. As the later footage unfolds, I have a sense of people who are in some sense removed from their art, perhaps because the World itself has dragged them, (as John Lennon said of the Beatles' live performance years,) through an experience resembling Fellini's Satyricon! It also appears to me that in their thirties, they became interested in more technical levels of musicianship, revving up their sound into a jazz-inspired frenzy, (the material from Presence), which seems a departure from their early fascination with mysticism and trance. Viewing the changes in the band members themselves, and the energy of their presentation, raises more questions than answers for me. But all are questions worth deep consideration, I feel. <BR>The predominant feeling that comes up for me, watching this material, and knowing that I'm experiencing it simultaneously with fans the world over, is love. Yes, hero worship and admiration, yes excitement and passion! But also a sense of love for the amazing places our culture went thirty years ago, and for the human beings that come together spiritually in the search for transcendance through music.<BR>Power, mystery, hammer of the gods! Live on!
0783225970|5.0|Since it's release in 1983, Brian De Palma's \\"Scarface\\" has become of the definitive cult classics of American movies, it's excesses have so imprinted themselves into popular culture that it's influence can be found in everything from clothing to popular lingo (\\"say hello to my little friend!\\") to rap music and rap videos. And yet, this is not a poorly executed movie, this is a brilliantly excessive crime drama filled with the kind of stylish, gritty quality that made films like \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\" equally effective (eventhough \\"Scarface\\" probably still stands as the bloodiest, edgiest film of it's kind). The screenplay was written by Oliver Stone before he became a visceral, provocative director and during the period when he was letting go of that notorious vice known as cocaine, he hung around with real Colombian gangsters and there is a unique authenticity to the film in it's violence and scenarios that helps it paint a portrait of the darker side of the American dream. Al Pacino is merciless and unforgettable as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant arriving on Miami's shores and ready to make big bucks and finds his answer with the world of drug trafficking. Watching the film, it is no wonder why Tony Montana has become such a potent figure in popular movie culture, he is a great character, so alluring in his perversity that the word \\"villain\\" seems too cartoonish for him. His accent is catchy and his clothes cool and colorful (Stone recently commented on how Montana's style in dress and jewelry can be seen reflected in African-American culture). The film is famous for it's scenes of violence, including a victim chained to a shower and killed with a chainsaw. Director Brian DePalma, not really known for excess gloriously lavishes in it here and films his movie with style and gusto, \\"Scarface\\" is unique because it feels like it was made with real respect for the material. Consider that you have one of Hollywood's future greatest directors writing the script and one of American film's most stylish talents directing and on top of that, an iconic actor in the lead role. Even the moody main theme is composed by none other than Giorgio Moroder. The ending is especially deliciously bloody, as if a normal shoot-out is for sissies. \\"Scarface\\" remains a potent movie because it has themes we can all relate to, we all want wealth, power and at least one beautiful woman, \\"Scarface\\" asks the question of what extremes would one go to to achieve wealth, and is it worth anything when it is dirty money?
B00008LDPU|3.0|Admittedly I waited with a lot of anticipation for this project; an anime-influenced lesson in story-telling from a series of Japanese masters about issues and things that they are well known for ' it seemed so much like a perfect match of Japanese current cultural thinking and awareness and American movie-making and marketing tie-ins. On DVD only. How cool is that?<br />For much of The Animatrix however it all seems to go horribly wrong. What appears instead is a sometimes cool, sometimes haphazard pitter-patter of stories and varying animation techniques that only really touch the surface of The Matrix and provide scattershot storytelling. Here are some examples:<br />Two of the DVD's nine segments, The Second Renaissance parts one and two, deal with an interesting overview of the fall of corrupt man and the rise of the machines. While it's nice to have a backdrop of the movies, The Second Renaissance makes you wonder why the characters should even bother or why you should care. Witness the imagery of the pyramid building and you'll get the picture.<br />The masterpiece of the Animatrix is of course the Final Flight of the Osiris, a total CGI love-fest created by Square Pictures (the Final Fantasy movie being their only other project of note). The plot involves the discovery of the machines boring tunnels leading straight to Zion, the resistance movement in the 'real world' and the attempt by the ship Osiris to deliver a warning to the Resistance via a drop box in The Matrix. Half of this segment however is geared towards a program-style training fight scene between Thadeus and Jue, two of the crew (and lovers apparently). In the context of everything that will take place, what the hell is the purpose of this scene, other than to show a perfectly rendered rear-end of Jue? Whole parts of this segment scream out to show you how cool it all is, but really are quite pointless.<br />In Kid's Story there's another unique animation style that is rather hard to describe -remember the a-ha music video 'Take on me' from the 80's, it's like that - which at times works really well and other times looks like it was scrawled by a toddler. This is another segment that ties into the movies (though is less apparent and doesn't involve the overall plot quite like Final Flight of the Osiris). So it wasn't half bad. <br />World Record is plum awful, and features an annoying exaggerated drawing style, especially the depiction of the agents. In the end, uh, what happened? The idea is interesting but how the story gets to the end, and the resolution, is just bad.<br />Program utilized another fighting program plot, though it turns out to be a rehash of a Matrix plot and is ultimately, again, disappointing.<br />Another segment was a black and white film noir-style piece called Detective Story, but felt out of place and in the end went nowhere. A Raymond Chandler-esque detective is hired by, well, a Program (basically) to find Trinity since the programs can't do it themselves. Using a computer interface and screen that looks like it came screaming from a set of the movie Brazil, the detective goes on his ultimate quest. The voice-over is terrible and again parts pay homage to The Matrix for no good reason.<br />Like Detective Story, the Animatrix fell way short of being a decent method of getting some good stories across. Maybe I was expecting way too much of this, but it sure seems like everything produced after The Matrix (the Matrix Reloaded, Enter the Matrix, and the Animatrix) have been below par. Instead of inspiring to produce better and more interesting stories, instead the Wachowski brothers, who oversaw all of the projects and are ultimately responsible, really lowered the bar a bit much.<br />That being said, the Animatrix still has some redeeming qualities and I'm glad the Wachowski brothers used a new method to expand on the universe of The Matrix. The problem is that with some superior writing and better coordination with the Japanese directing talents, it could have been so much better.<br />For parents: there is a bit of bloody violence and a wee bit of nudity here so being animated doesn't mean that the Animatrix is for kids. It's not.
B0000508U6|5.0|In \\"Parachutes\\" Coldplay has produced an album that is both simple and elegant at the same time.  The guitars are stripped down, and largely acoustic.  When electric guitars are used, they act as a nice counterpoint to Chris Martin's superb vocals.  At the same time there is heavy used of keyboards, and the drums and bass actually act as a rhythm section instead of acting as rock and roll heavy artillery.  The lyrics are as straightforward as the music, without being any less sophisticated for it.  Martin sings of timeless themes like love, alienation and hope, but never seems trite or derivative.  The end result is an album by a band that clearly recognizes that passion and talent are what make a band, not gimmicks and grinding guitars and morose wailing.<br />On a song-by-song basis, it would be almost impossible for me to pick a favorite song, for two reasons.  First, every one of them is good, which is almost shocking in today's music market.  Nonetheless, there is not a single song that I skip past, and more than that, there's not a single song that is noticeably sub-par when compared to the others.  Secondly, Coldplay has actually produced an \\"album\\" as opposed to a collection of songs, another rarity today.  Each song carries through common musical and thematic elements such that each one becomes something akin to a movement within a symphony.<br />That said, the songs are by no means redundant, and as such warrant some mention as individual entities.  First off is \\"Don't Panic\\", a plainly stated case for hope in a difficult world, the chorus \\"We live in a beautiful world...\\" pretty much sums up this track.  With great drum and keyboard work, \\"Don't Panic\\" sets the tone for the album.<br />Next up is \\"Shiver\\" a refreshing song about devotion in the face of unrequited love.  I say refreshing because in a world of throwaway relationships, Martin actually places some hope in blind love.  This is one of the prettiest songs on an album that has a lot of them (I know \\"pretty\\" is an odd description of a rock song, but you'll just have to trust me), and the heavy use of electric guitars is effective and fits in with the rest of the album.<br />Third is \\"Spies\\", which if I had to choose is probably my favorite song on the album.  As Martin sings about paranoia, the discomfiture we all feel in our own skin sometimes, the song takes on a spooky, befuddled vibe that is difficult to describe but fascinating to listen to.<br />\\"Sparks\\" is another beautiful, mellow song about devotion and love within a relationship.  It serves as a nice counterpoint to the well known \\"Yellow\\" (which received heavy radio rotation), in that its contemplative thoughtful love serves as a counterpoint to the overpowering infatuation considered in \\"Yellow\\".<br />Next up is \\"Trouble\\" which sets the stage with a beautiful piano melody.  It also contains some of the most interesting lyrics as Martin sings of regret, and the desire and effort to overcome the mistakes of the past.  Part apology and part introspection, this is a great track.<br />The seventh track is the eponymous \\"Parachutes\\", which despite only being forty-six seconds long is one of the prettiest love songs you're likely to hear in rock and roll today.  It is followed up by \\"High Speed\\", which contains the most unusual arrangements on the album.  Again, the tone is set by the first lyric \\"Can anybody fly this thing...\\" and the song goes on to consider what it takes to live in our complicated world.<br />The final two tracks perfectly bookend the album.  \\"We Never Change\\" is Martin expressing his desire to live a simple, decent life that focuses on what's really important rather than the trappings and complications of modern life.  And finally, \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" is another pleafor hope in a difficult world that perfectly captures what Coldplay is all about.<br />In the end this is truly and exemplary album.  From start to finish it maintains a consistent musical vision that is a joy to listen to.  Each track is a puzzle piece that fits into something larger than the sum of those pieces, but at the same time, each piece can be appreciated individually.  Ultimately, this is the rare album that transcends categorization and is approachable by anyone who appreciates great music.<br />Jake Mohlman
B00004W52U|5.0|I'm not a HUGE fan of the whole &quot;ska/punk&quot; genre, but I absolutely love this record.  All of the songs are awesome, fast, catchy, and 100% skank-tastic.  Operation Ivy were truly revolutionary, and were the first true ska/punk band, and without them, there would be no Reel Big Fish, Goldfinger, Less than Jake, Catch-22, Suicide Machines, Choking Victim, or Mighty Mighty Bosstones (just to name a few).  Everyone knows OPIV for having 2 members of Rancid (Tim and Matt), so if you're a Rancid fan, you should DEFINTELY own this.  If you're hesitant about getting into ska/punk, buy this record and see if you like it.  If you do, check out bands like Choking Victim and Link 80.  If you don't, go see a doctor.  You might have a severe case of &quot;horrible opinion&quot;.

0553573403|2.0|I've always known people in general were mindless sheep who needed to be told what to like &amp; what not to &amp; this is just another example.<br />This is fantasy close to it's lowest form. Come to think of it, this isn't fantasy at all. This is the civil war with swords &amp; castles. There's just enough fantasy elements in here for it to be called fantasy. Was this guy not creative enough to build a fantasy setting or just lazy?<br />Fans of War &amp; Peace will love this novel. It's just as agonizingly slow. NOTHING ever happens. Some have went as far as saying Martin is better than Tolkien &amp; Jordan. Please! While I had to watch LOTR 2 or 3 times to get into it &amp; even though I had to quit reading Jordan after book 8 or 9 because it was taking him forever to get the next one out, they were 100x's better than this clown.<br />This wasn't a complete loss. A writer should take some of Martin's approaches to storytelling &amp; just tell a better story with it. Having each chapter dedicated to a different person was brilliant - especially for an epic - &amp; his characters were entertaining. They just never DID anything.
B000089A07|4.0|RED DRAGON begins years before SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and is therefore a prequel that introduces a Hannibal Lechter (Anthony Hopkins), who paradoxically, looks older than in the latter film.  The opening minutes set the tone for both films as director Brett Ratner explains how Dr. Lechter was imprisoned in the first place.  FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) is consulting with a Dr. Lechter who has not yet been identified as a mass murderer.  The scene that reveals Dr. Lechter's true nature is shocking in its graphic intensity.  However gruesome this revelation may be both for Will Graham and the audience, it is necessary to place Dr. Lechter in a position of incarceration from which he will later be able to serve as yet another source of expert opinion needed to catch a new killer, the 'Tooth Fairy.'  It is at this point that the film takes a twist that diverts the dramatic focus from the mad doctor.  Unfortunately, this was the same twist that was earlier used in HANNIBAL, the third of the series.  Several reviewers have expressed dissatisfaction about what they saw as an overliberal borrowing from Dr. Lechter's future villainous roots.  This is, however, only a minor problem.  Hopkins is such an accomplished actor that he makes maximum use of his diminished screen time.  Even when he is thoroughly manacled or rendered harmless, his malignant eyes and hypnotically soothing voice still make him an object of fear.  More than once does Will Graham flinch whenever Dr. Lechter wishes him to.  Director Ratner wisely allows Hopkins' absence to be filled with Ralph Fiennes, who plays the Tooth Fairy, who in turn, forms first a bond of admiration for Lechter then later one of bitterness for Graham.  Fiennes is effectively creepy as the tatooed eye-gouger who is driven by his own demons that originated PSYCHO-like from a bestial grandmother that Hitchcock first envisioned.  <br />RED DRAGON is a suspenseful thriller that allows Hopkins, Norton, and Fiennes to bounce off each other at all the right moments.  True, this movie was first filmed as MANHUNTER in 1986, and comparisons are inevitable.  MANHUNTER is a superb piece of cinematic villainy in its own right, but the true test of a film that seeks to stand either as a prequel and/or a remake, is whether that film adds materially to our understanding of the protagonist.  What emerges from RED DRAGON and to a lessor extent from the others in the Hannibal Lechter saga is a portrait of a madman who kills because that is the only way that he can get interesting people like Will Graham or Clarise Starling to pay attention to him.
0452283760|5.0|i don't even want to say why, but this book changed my life, and you shouldn't read people's reviews of it because anyone you know that recommends this book will let you figure it all out for yourself. not only is the book extremely well written but it applies to anyone anywhere and has taught even the people who wrote terrible reviews of it something about life.
B00006F2TV|5.0|Without any doubt, Spiderman is easily known to be the best movie of 2002.  It is the second MARVEL movie made this century (With X-men being the 1st) and has more sequels to come.  It is also the best MARVEL movie so far, Daredevil sadly didn't turn out to be as good as this.  It has a good plot and great action scenes.  Although things don't go the same way in this movie as they did in the Comic books, it is still a fun Spiderman story to watch.  Tobey Maguire did a great job as Peter Parker/Spiderman especially when it comes changing from a nerd to a guy who will beat possibly anybody up and be fearless.  This movie had great acting.  Even this special edition DVD it comes on is great.  It is packed with 2 disks and a lot of neat x-tra stuff.  Here is the movie's plot.<BR>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is probably known to be the biggest loser in school.  He has only one friend named Harry Osborn (James Franko) and has had the biggest crush on a girl named Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst) in which he has had since like the first grade.  Anyway on a school field trip to a laboratory that studies spider the scientists have created spiders which has some sort genetic gene from three other different spiders put in it so it can became a \\"super Spider\\".  One of the Spiders escapes and goes \\"wandering\\" around in the lab.  It eventually goes on to Peter's hand and gives him a big bite, OUCH!!  At first Peter feels fine, but later things feel different.  Also, Harry has a father named Norman who is the President and one of the workers at a company called OSCORB.  What OSCORB does is make weapons for the military.  Norman is working on some sort of gas that can enhance human performance once inhaled.  But soon, Norman realizes he is in one of those now or never situations where he either tests the gas to see if it works or else his company goes down.  Norman test the gas but things seem to wrong and Norman doesn't appear to be the same person.  Anyway, back to Peter.  Peterstarts to feel weird but he when feels better, he notices some changes.  For starters, his eyes don't seem to need glasses anymore and plus, he seems to be stronger, make that much stronger and things tend to stick to his fingertips even when the object is non sticky.  And later he notices when danger is coming and he also notices a white sticky string come shooting out of his wriest.  And last, he realizes he has the ability to climb up walls and jump like 100 ft high.  With all his new abilities, Peter decides to join ameuter wrestling to score some big bucks.  He decides to draw out an attire which is a read and blue costume with a black spider symbol in the middle of the chest.  As he takes wrestling, his attire isn't exactly what he drew but it seems that scoring the big bucks won't be hard at all.  But when the wrestling manager decides not to pay Peter the amount he should have gotten (nor did what he got come even close to what he expected) he gets really [mad].  Then when the manager gets robbed, Peter lets the robber go feeling like he got even with manager.  But Peter's feeling change sad fully when he sees that his uncle's car was hijacked and the hijacker shot his uncle.  Peter is bent on revenge to finding the guy who did this and when he does Peter realizes something shocking- The hijacker was the same guy who was the robber who Peter just let go.  If he had cought him then when he should have, then his uncle would have never have been killed.  After that, Peter swears to have never let that happen again.  Before you know, a man now dressed in a costume, which is identical to the one Peter drew, now swings and crawls thru the city of New York stopping crime at now cost.  No matter who does the crime, he'll do the time because he was stopped by the one, the only: SPIDERMAN!  Now that peter's life has had a huge change he now faces many problems: 1, he cannot seem to hold a job cuz he is always staying up late to fight crime.  2, the girl of his dreams,MJ (Mary-Jane) is now dating his friend Harry.  3, the worst of all, a lunatic who travels on the oscorp glider decides to cause chaos over New York.  His name- The green goblin.  The green goblin is super strong like Spiderman, he likes to throw bombs, and the bottom line is that he is just completely crazy.  And what he wants to do is to cause destruction over the city, but to achieve that he must do one thing first-KILL SPIDERMAN.  And worst comes to worst when he discovers certain information on Spidey.<br />DVD Features:<BR>2 Discs<BR>Disc 1<BR>-Full Screen or widescreen format (for whichever version you get)<BR>-Trailor (s)<BR>-Mucic videos<BR>-Tv Spots<BR>-Commentaries<BR>Disc 2<BR>-HBO making of Spiderman<BR>-E!

B000000OQF|5.0|What can I possibly say about this album but WOW!! Every song on it is amazing. However, not every song was made a #1 hit, but when you hear them you do wonder why not. \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\"- come on guys, this gets more than only five stars alone. Other kickin' tunes like \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Rocket Queen\\", \\"You're Crazy\\", \\"Paradise City\\" and \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" are enough to turn any quiet, shy kid into a true rebel in a matter of seconds. \\"Sweet Child Of Mine\\" cannot be overlooked as it is definately one of the best on the album, and has possibly the best intro I've ever heard. If you only buy one rock album in your lifetime, make it this one. ROCK ON AXL!!!!!!!
0800196767|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. It is very true to the book, with only slight changes. <BR>     Matilda, the ignored super-genius, was well portrayed by Mara Wilson. She looks just like how I pictured little Matilda to look. Even her voice was good for the part. <BR>     Danny DeVito played her father. He illegally sells cars and is proud of it. He hates Matilda. <BR>      Rhea Perlman played her mother. While her body figure is slightly different from the mom's in the movie's, she is wonderful for the part. <BR>      Well, I won't ruin your surprise for much else. I just want to end saying that you could not tell it was just acting-and that is the sign of a true good film.

B000002MP2|5.0|Dookie is by far the best Green Day album and probably the best punk album of all time.  The unique vocals of Billy Joe Armstrong combined with his simple yet amazing guitar style hits you like a freight train the first time you hear this album.  And once you start listening to it for a while, you hear the amazing bass given to you by bassist Mike Dirnt and the fast beat drumming by drummer Tre Cool.  This is personally my favorite album of all time.

B00009L1TA|5.0|I've seen this movie twice and I'm convinced that it is now my new favorite one.  Don't go in expecting to be able to keep up or solve this impossible mystery.  This film tries it's best to confuse you...and I loved every minute because of it.  Not only is the narrative structure unique to this film, but the narration in the film is always changing.  I didn't notice it the first time, but even after several character names and situations are sorted out...things keep changing.  The film is out to confuse you.  And that ending...I was literally tossing my hands up the first time I watched it because it was mind-blowing.  I've never seen anything like it.  This film switched genres and mood completely in literally the last two minutes.  The final scene (with the re-mix of Black Betty playing behind it) is like a scene from a different movie.  It was great.  I tried explaining the plot of this film to friends, and it takes me forever and it's impossible to get it right.  This film will have you head spinning and you will be thinking about it for days.  I am a film major in Washington and I suggest at least checking this film out to everyone.  I know many won't like it because it's so incoherrent at times, but I think it's Travolta at his best and Mctiernan at his second best, lest we forget Die Hard.  Can't wait for the DVD...
B00005QY5Y|5.0|You could hate the rest of the CD but you'd have to be inhuman not to absolutely love &quot;When the Stars Go Blue.&quot;  Watch yourself melt to the floor.  It's hard-hitting, it's real, it's got soul, it's what music should be.<br />(The rest of the album is really great too, I swear, and after you experience the loveliness of When the Stars you should definitely listen to the rest of the album.  It'll become your new favorite album - that is, if you haven't already listened to Heartbreaker yet . . . can't top that.)
B000003C2S|5.0|This cd is incredible!  This is some of the best death metal you'll ever hear.  What's really awesome about Death, is that Chuck sings a lot about world issues and problems in society and religion.  Their first cd \\"Scream Bloody Gore\\" was an exception, as that was heavily influenced by horror movies.  Still a brutal cd though, excellent.  You can hear chuck's vocals greatly, and you can understand what he's saying, a rare thing in death metal.  The riffs by Chuck and James Murphy are some of the best riffs you'll hear.  The solo trade-offs between them both is also very awesome.  This cd is kind of slower then Death's other albums, but that does in no way mean its a bad album.  I prefer this cd over any of Death's other cds.  This is still a really heavy fast cd, but its just that the speed does not match up to their other albums.  If you want to get into Death, this should be one of your first cds.  RIP -- Chuck -- RIP, you will be greatly missed
B00006RCSR|5.0|Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella as never seen before. With a quick wit,brains,looks, and the willingness to kick alittle \\"step-sisterly bootie\\" , she wins over the heart of a handsome prince, played by Dougrey Scott. The story alters more with the help of a step-sister who in the end makes you love her as much as Cinderella. Also, you have a wonderful cast who brings this to life, altering a \\"fairy-godmother\\" to a \\"fairy-godfather\\" with the help of famous artist Leonardo. You will laugh and cheer as you let yourself be pulled into this wonderful story of love, comedy, and \\"just rewards\\".
B00008AY3L|1.0|This album is a total disappointment.  His last studio album was excellent all the way through and I was hoping for the same with Diamonds on the Inside.  Apparently Ben didn't try too hard with this one.  The only good song on the disk is When it's gone.  One good song doesn't make a good album.  All the rest sound either over produced or hastily written.  If the lyrics are any good the music is horrible or vice-versa.  It sounds like Ben sat out the studio session and let Lenny Kravitz take over.  ...

B00008OWZC|5.0|Undisputed artists of their generation, Led Zeppelin gripped the Nation by storm. Their albums have always bean highly prixed, and now with the release of How the West Was Won, their legacy will continue to reign supreme. Personally I have found that I have enjoyed this collection of live recorded songs for many reasons. I have only began to listen to Led Zeppelin, but I am familiar with their other works. The previous set, Led Zeppelin 1,2,3, and 4 were good and fun in their own right. But they lacked something. This something was the fans, yes the people that made the quartet more than what they were. Well this set of 1972 concerts do just what the other package didn't. I enjoy the remixes like, Stairway To Heaven, and Rock and Roll, make the listening to these songs seem like something new and allows for the listener to enjoy their product without worrying about buying another CD set with the same songs on it. The Art work on the album is very nice, and truelly goes with the other great sets. Plus, the complete length of some of these songs truelly give one the impression of being right off stage. When Was the last time anyone was in the middle of a 25 minute segment of Dazed and confused, or a Hole lotta love? Point taken. So, this was a worth while investment that will almost certainly garentee hours of enjoy ment. 5/5
3822884979|5.0|This is one of the finest collections of pin-up art from the talented artists that brought these beautiful women to life. These were very risque for their time but they were a true celebration of women. This is the kind of open mindedness and genuine appreciation missing from today's society. Women are wonderful, intelligent, beautiful people and life would be a tragedy without them. There...I said it!
B000062Y98|4.0|Remember the galloping bass signature sound of Iron Maiden, the finger tapping signature sound of Van Halen or the wah wah signature sound of Jimi Hendrix?<br />Imagine if such a sound was used and highlighted on practically all of the above artists's songs.<br />If such was the case, such an innovative signature sound would get boring, cliched and become an irritant upon hearing it over and over again, thus damaging the qualities of the song.<br />Well, Blind Guardian have a signature sound in the form of a rotating speaker/vocal chorus sound made by the guitar(s).<br />Unfortunately, this sound seems to be used and highlighted in the vast majority of the songs on this cd, which creates a situation mentioned above.<br />This is a shame, as the songs are top notch and often more progressive in structure and varied than the songs in their previous CD. <br />The vocalist is unique alone, so almost everyone who has heard BG in the past, would know a BG song when played without the need to almost always include and highlight this signature sound in every song.<br />The power/speed metal 16th note drumming is still present, but it is not in all of the songs, and where it is, it is often sucessfully blended into the mix.<br />With each subsequent recording, BG is slowing moving away from their power/thrash metal beginnings into a more progressive metal/rock group<br />I wish they would re-mix this recording and take this sound out on the most of the songs as it is not needed.<br />If such a sound was taken out, this recording would get a 9/10. However, with the constant inclusion and highlight of it every song, this recording gets a 7/10
B000089RVX|2.0|...but it falls apart quickly. Amy does have quite an incredible voice... if that's from the help of auto tuners, I don't know. I am hoping not. Anyway I, like a lot of the more... ehh I hate to say it but \\"educated\\" of the Goth metal scene and European metal will SCREAM Lacuna Coil rip-off when they hear this, and that's exactly what I thought too. BUT I have to say Lacuna Coil is musically much more interesting. Sure, Amy has a catchier voice... but... ack... The riffs and underlying chord progressions of these songs are SOOO cliché and boring if you are actually paying attention. The riffs are nothing... something an idiot Linkin Park fan in high school could write and play. Now let me say this... I don't even consider Lacuna Coil to be that inventive or complex musically... I get bored with them after a while too... but they STILL walk all over these guys. Listen to the album closely... and tell me the melodies and riffs don't sound 90% the same on EVERY song. They REALLY didn't bother to learn to write in more than one way... <br />I will say now though I do love Amy's voice and about 5 songs in I thought this CD was pretty cool. But halfway through I was just too much like.... ok... are they going to do anything new? You only really need 3 or 4 songs by this band. Bring Me To Life is pretty good, same with Everybody's Fool, and I think Hello and My Immortal are quite beautiful. BUT stop there. There's nothing else to offer on this CD that can't be found in these few songs. The other songs aren't bad per se, but they're basically just \\"bring me to life\\" remixes and variations I'd have to say. There's not much that sets them apart. Like every one is just a \\"single\\" and all based on the exact same formula. I can say I have no real interest in listening to this CD any more, it was good for one spin, and only My Immortal really caught my attention to listen to repeatedly.<br />I hope Amy breaks away from the band and does solo work or joins a band with a more ambitious scope of song writing... she is definitely the star of the band, and it's a damn shame that the band has no interest in writing anything but the SAME SONG over and over... oddly on their first album, Origin, the songwriting was a lot more varied... Anyway, if you enjoyed this album, I can say you would likely enjoy albums from Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, and Ambeon. Maybe not as initially catchy as Evanescence... but MUCH more to the bands than one style of song and simple boring riffs. It works here though, since the average person doesn't pay close enough attention to notice how bland and repetitive the riffs are since they are mesmerized by Amy's voice.... ugh I hate the superficial listening habits of most people... THERE IS MORE TO MUSIC THAN THE VOICE PEOPLE... ahh well that's never going to change... but that still doesn't make it any more of a tragedy in my eyes. I think Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree said it best in the song \\"The Sound Of Muzak\\"<br />\\"Soul gets squeezed out, edges get blunt<BR>Demographic gives what you want<br />Now the sound of music comes in silver pills<BR>Engineered to suit you building cheaper thrills<br />\\"One of the wonders of the world is going down<BR>It's going down I know<BR>It's one of the blunders of the world and no one cares<BR>No one cares enough\\"<br />Most of you reading this review will never understand how sad that last line of the song is to someone who spends their LIFE discovering and diving their entire conscious into music... Music is so much more than something to bob your head to and hum a catchy melody... by the way, to see how to write MORE than one style song and actually have some emotional depth and diversity... pick up Porcupine Tree's In Absentia album... The songs don't sound the same, have different themes, yet every one is an emotional masterpiece. There's a band anyone can enjoy regardless of preference.
B000002P5R|4.0|First Rays of the New Rising Sun contains the best of the songs released after Jimi Hendrix's passing. The majority of the tracks are just as strong as his first three studio albums. Excellent mix of styles here. Leading the way are the funk-rock of excellent \\"Freedom\\", \\"Izabella\\", and \\"Dolly Dagger.\\" There's also some great harder rocking tracks like \\"Room Full Of Mirrors\\", \\"Steeping Stone\\", and \\"In From The Storm.\\" A couple of Hendrix's best ballads are also here in \\"Angel\\" and \\"Drifting.\\" Jimi's playing on nearly track continues to be very passionate and creative. The tracks after \\"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\\" aren't nearly as good as the rest of the album with the exception of \\"In From The Storm.\\" Still, it's an outstanding collection of his best music released after his passing.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I've been absorbing this over the weekend and it brought a smile.<BR>While the BBC sessions give the listener a glimpse as to why Zeppelin was such a great band, this CD is hands down proof. There are very few bands, even today, that could so bravely improvise in the same league as Zeppelin. Disc 1 is simply a great collection of songs, nice redition of \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" nearly a year before the release of the \\"Houses\\" LP.<BR>The acoustic set is beautiully done, great interplay between Page and Jones on \\"Going to California\\" and \\"That's The Way\\", two songs that demonstrate what great song writers they were.<BR>Disc 2 features the gtreatest version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" I can recall hearing. Nice to hear great live takes on \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" and \\"Dancing Days\\". \\"Moby Dick\\" simply helps to show why John Bonham is considered one of ther great rock dummers ever.<br />Disc 3 helps to bring it all to a resounding finish, the closing notes of the guitar and Hermonica on \\"Bring It On home\\" brought a huge smile. OUTSTANDING! A teenager who picks up most of the studio albums and this recording will see why this band deserves the legendary status they've earned.<br />It's cliched, but don't walk, run to this release.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie has everything that Matrix Reloaded should have had but didn't.  The movie is set in the near, post-apocolypse future, in a world divided into sterile technology and burned out ruins.  The film borrows elements from Farenheit 451, Gattaca, 1984, Metropolis, and even Logan's Run.<br />Christian Bale's character, unlike Reeves' Neo, is someone you can truly sympathize with--self-deprived of emotions but ultimately all-too-human.  He begins to struggle in a society that adopts the creedo that only man's inhumanity to man can stop man's inhumanity to man.<br />The story is well-written and paced.  The fight scenes, using what is referred to as &quot;gun kata,&quot; are extraordinary.  Also impressive are the sets and CG (limited, thankfully).  While the ending is expected, it does leave the viewer asking, &quot;Okay, what do they do now?&quot;.<br />Rent or buy it, it's worth the money either way!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I've been a sort of fan of Metropolis since the 80s, when I first saw the re-soundtracked version of the movie.  I was overjoyed to be able to see a clean, as-complete-as-possible version with the original, moving soundtrack.  It made me feel like I was missing less than I had with other versions.  Additionally, I appreciated the fact that title card interstitials stood alone, and weren't superimposed over the action.<br />As for my feelings about Metropolis itself, I love this film.  The heart mediation theme is touching and hopeful, and the characters of Freder and Maria are adorable.  Additionally, the visuals are stunningly relevant to our postmodern sensibilities - the robot is chillingly beautiful...Yoshiwara is mysteriously exquisite...and the new Tower of Babel is simply gorgeous in an overdone, overbuilt urban way.  The city visuals are very compelling, influencing our future-notions even today (remember Horizons at Walt Disney World?  The future home of the 1920s?  VERY Metropolis-looking!).<br />Particular scenes I love include Maria's flight throught the catacombs, with Rotwang's flashlight of evil (tm).  The darkness, the shadows, the movement...everything conspired to make the scene undeniably frightening.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This has to be some of the best zeppelin on tape.  Some of their live takes are better than the studio versions.  Very tight.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I just don't understand! If you like movies that have awful acting, awful plots, and are simply unrealistic, this movie is for you! I like horror movies, but this one is bad. It's by far the worst &quot;horror&quot; movie ever, and believe me, I've seen them all! I mean, come on! What were they THINKING? oh.. they WEREN'T thinking...ANYWAY, please, I'm begging you, do NOT waster your time and hard worked for dollars on this amazingly bad &quot;movie&quot;. I mean, jeez, this is even worse than Urban Legends:Final Cut! And THAT's pretty bad. <BR>         I guess the most atrocious thing in this movie is the simply horrible acting.OH MY GOD. I have never seen worse acting. Especially in that car scene at the beginning. But I guess if you like watching bad movies, you'll enjoy this. Actually, maybe not. I like cheesy teen horror movies, but this was just TOO bad. It wasn't even a FUNNY kind of bad, like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer or Urban Legend. It was, in four words: AN EMBARRASSMENT TO MANKIND.
6305364648|5.0|Before Spetember 11, no one would have figured James Cameron was a prophet. Same for Tom Clancy. But where Clancy, who does something similar in The Sum of All Fears, has as his hero ubernerd Jack Ryan, INTJ, Cameron has as his hero the far more fun and accessible ESTP Arnold. Imagine James Bond written by alpha-male Americans for alpha-male Americans, instead of the cool and dry diehard Brit Ian Fleming. (To see what these tags of character's mean go to keirsey.com, which explains the whole business of INTJ's or ESTP's eloquently and simply.)<br />The Amazon writeup for this film implies Cameron doesn't like women. But Jamie Lee Curtis does look to be having fun. Yes, us men are going ga-ga for her as she is exploited. But (a) she raked in a heap of money (b) her stunning body has been immortalized in film and (c) how many women can claim to have turned on so many men at the same time with so little effort? (Hint: Curtis may very well be an alpha-female. Maybe and ENTJ.)<br />The action sequences in this film, as in all Cameron films, have a serious true-to-life feel. Arnold may very well be a psychopath as he slaughters deranged terrorist after deranged terrorist utterly without remorse or even blinking an eye. But the way it's done you really get the feeling that the violence is essential to the story and had to be done this way. (Again, unlike Sum of All Fears, which is a major letdown once you know anything about plotting. Why is the leader of The Greatest Nation on Earth not levelheaded?  The story's suspense derives entirely from the US President acting like a nincompoop. Which speaks well neither towards Clancy the democrat nor Clancy the patriot.) Which is why Cameron is better than Sam Peckinpah, who filmed Tarkovsky-like action sequences that often seemed out of place.<br />There's also enough gadgetry in this film to keep the editors of Maxim busy for at least a year. The subbasement of the building Arnold and co-star Tom Arnold work in is a standout true geek heaven. Cameron really delivers the goods.<br />Let's just hope he stops trying to grow up with this Titanic stuff and returns to the his teenage boy roots. He's in a league of his own.
B000002IGP|5.0|In the 1970's, heavy metal was full of bands with original sounds. No one band sounded just like another. Then in 1978, one of L.A's best bands made their recorded debut-Van Halen. Their album was praised as the best metal debut since Zeppelin. After VH's big breakout, several similer bands from L.A rode the wave to success. Quiet Riot was the next big winner, Dokken and Motley Crue were soon to follow. One band following the formula was Ratt. Formed in 1978, Ratt was a tight, talented metal band when they made their debut in '84. This album is one of the best heavy metal albums of the 1980's. The best new band of 1984, Ratt fell with all classic hard rock in the early 90's. Grunge killed off classic metal. This album stands as one of classic metal's best examples from the 1980's.
0553288105|5.0|Asimov was the all time master of the American sf of his era. Like all good teenage boys I really enjoyed the puzzling Foundation books. But the poor guy's world came to a shuddering halt with the arrival of the new wave in this continent and new worlds in the UK. Young sf writers were cross-pollinating with the high literature of the time, avant garde art and political vangardism. To them Asimov's sf simply wasn't up to the tasks they set themselves.<br />This book is Asimov's answer to the sf revolutionaries. For the tasks he set himself, his stories were simply the best. And the really nice thing is his answer is set in a fairly accurate picture of the world of academic science, with tightly drawn and believable characters. (I wish people in science studies would read this book because it's written by a scientist who says everything they do but doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.) When you put these together with his aliens in the parallel universe, you get one of the most ambitious and imaginative books he ever wrote. I'm still not sure about the science (why exactly do the aliens take the chemicals laid out in labs and not distributed throughout the universe). But it's a cut above Heinlein's in Stranger in a Strange Land.<br />It's thirty years later and this book still breathes. Enjoy.
B00005JM03|5.0|This movie does exactly what it sets out to do - entertain and show off the Mini Cooper. That's why I give it 5 stars - not because it's Oscar material, it's not trying to be, but because it accomplishes its goal with incredible surety and finesse. While parts of the plot have been done before, such as the master criminal who wants one last job before going straight and ends up dying, it never feels cliched. Everything about this movie gels. <br />The basic plot is a crew of criminals pull off a job - without guns - stealing gold bars. One of them decides he wants the whole shebang and steals from his pals. A year later, they try to steal the money back.<br />Donald Sutherland is wonderful as the master criminal mentor. Why does this actor not work more often? It's a real shame. He manages to be heartfelt, funny, wise and even sexy. A real star. Mark Whalberg underplays his straight-man part as the junior master criminal, and it's a good choice as the rest of his crew is very colorful, so he gives balance to the ensemble.<br />Seth Green does what he does best - don't ever grow up, Seth! Jason Stratham, the British actor, has a chance to relax in a non-death/bullets everywhere type movie and reallly shines. When he turns on his mojo to ensnare the actress from The Man Show, you can practically smell his testosterone. Instead of hearing how he manages to charm his target, we get hysterical dialogue supplied by nerdy, woman-challenged Seth Green as he watches in admiration and frustration.<br />Charlize Theron has never been spunkier or more vulnerable as the daughter of Sutherland. She drives fast and cracks million-dollar safes and makes it all very believable. Edward Norton is truly slimey - a crook with no imagination, who spends his ill-gotten gains on the very toys his betrayed comrades wished for, in effect, stealing from them twice. <br />The director manages both his ensemble cast and the action with a deft touch. The movie never drags but instead has a nicevarying dynamic from fast to slow to fast again. Unlike \\"Oceans Eleven,\\" things go wrong in this movie, plans are changed. <br />The music is a nice blend of hard-pounding soundtrack and classic songs. The two chase scenes are very fun - the first being motorboats in Venice canals, the second of course the Mini Coopers driving through tunnels, by trains, up on sidewalks, and through aquaducts. The cars seem cooler than any of James Bond's by the end of the movie. <br />Comparisons with \\"Oceans Eleven\\" and \\"The Score\\" are inevitable and I have to say I liked this movie better than either of them. \\"The Score\\" was tired, slow and pretty much boring, just really run of the mill. \\"Oceans Eleven\\" was fun, but it was a movie that showcased its stars. It was pure Hollywood, sterile, clean, no one really gets hurt and there's no hint of danger. <br />This movie is grittier and shows not only the master criminals but the seamier side of crime such as the Ukrainian mobsters who make our mafia look like schoolchildren. Justice is certainly served by the end of the movie, but they very cannily leave it up to our imagination.<br />This movie is definitely worth full price at the theaters, and worth seeing on the large screen. It's also one to own, for the soundtrack if nothing else.
0441172717|5.0|This is the last review for Yog. You may enjoy his other reviews.<br />I still say that this is the best sf book of all time. It follows a strict formula of action sequences about every 20-30 pages to massage the reason why the reader is reading the book (or at least this reader). And it also provides you with glimpses of the Universal. I don't know how Herbert managed to understand Heidegger better than everyone else (including most literary types), but he did. And Herbert really was influenced by Heidegger, because he names his hero in The Santaroga Barrier Gilbert Dasein. (Also a nod to the classic World of Null-A.) The one problem with the books is that they are so unrelentingly right wing. But that's the sf milieu for you and he did manage to get a lot of money out of it. The only other person who comes close to Herbert is Heinlein in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. (It really is a masterwork, working on at least four levels.)<br />There seems to be some confusion in the sf community over mortal or divine status the hero, Paul Atreides. Herbert deliberately wrote his book to make it ambiguous. But (a) Paul really is the Bene Gesserit's Kwisatz Haderach; (b) he is in those mystic nuns' blindspot, like the sun which blinds; (c) he rises to power over the Fremen by the (spectacular and exceptional) coincidence of the Bene Gesserit laying a prophecy into the inhabitants of Arrakis; (d) his sister says that he attains immortality in Dune 2 in his suicide, without any irony; (e) the later Dune books imply that God himself planted the worms on Dune.<br />The way the book works is that by making you connect the dots, you get an insight, you pass a threshold, and suddenly you are Herbert. Herbert attained immortality with this set of books. (See Derrida's Glas where this is laid out in some detail, however opaquely.)<br />I read some of the other reviewers' comments. The one below by a guy named Tozer gets almost everything right. But he gives Herbert five stars only to berate this enthralling classic for everything. Just relax, guy.
B00008O0WN|3.0|This movie is ok but not one of the best. I have seen better. Some of the other Star Trek movies were better.

B000003TA4|5.0|Why is it that the moment I grow up all the kids get to have much cooler toys to play with or bands to listen to? I was too old to play with Transformers when they came out and they were the neatest looking things. And then Nirvana came out when I was an undergrad in university. All these songs have the REAL high school experience written all over them. They sound a lot like America's answer to the Sex Pistols, only without the political posturing. The difference between these guys and the Pistols is that for some reason everyone loved these guys while the Pistols never made the charts where I'm from. (I love the Pistols to this day. \\"Seventeen\\" is one of the funniest songs ever written.)<br />It's a pity Cobain was touched by the Universal too hard, because, screwed up on heroin as he was, he managed to make some of the most stunning sounds ever. On the other hand, Dave Grohl has gone on to continue the great tradition of the rock'n'roll odyssey. This month Q Magazine (05/2003)had a song, \\"Come Back,\\" from the Foo Fighters album One by One that shows that thrashy trashy grunge still lives. It even has guitars in harmonies. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath indeed.

0380973650|5.0|This story works on a number of levels. It's an action-adventure Gotterdammerung. It's a meditation on the sacred. (Hint: Shadow's wife is an entirely loose thread in an otherwise supertight plot. Why is this?) It provides the raw uninterpreted experience of creativity. Like? There's some pretty deft red herrings with regard to the murder of teenage girls in the village where Shadow lives. Red herrings that give you the experience of passing the very threshold into magic that Shadow tricks people with so often throughout the tale.<br />This is a masterpiece. It deserved the Hugo. I'm not sure how it would play as a movie, though it has blockbuster all over it.
6302787300|5.0|Imagine returning in time to the past, being able to travel more than five hundred years ago.  What was the world like?  What were our ancestors like?  What animals lived in the new world?  The film &quot;1492:  Conquest of Paradise\\" directed by Ridley Scott opening in 1992 like celebration of 500 years of the discovery of the new world.  Rather the encounter of two different worlds with different ways of seeing the world.  It was during 1492, when Spain was united by the conquests of the Catholic kings, the Spanish language and the religion.  It was the same year that Queen Isabel (Siguorney Weaver) supported Christopher Columbus (Grad Depardieu) to travel around the world, which seemed like a trip to the space for us.  He was a man who sailed with stars to the unknown.  According to the film, it was in October 12, 1492 that Columbus and his men found land and natives.  The film presents many scenes of the beauty in the nature.  It displays the way that natives lived and as they knew the white men.  One of the most important questions than the Spaniards had when Columbus returned to Spain is who are these Indians?  Did God create them?  What God?  The questions are brought up because the Indians live naked and live paradise on earth.  The film shows that the Spaniards brought horses, dogs and other animals in the amricas.  The importance of the religion is represented by a great bell that put in a new church constructed by the Indians and the Spaniards.  I recommend the film for its beauty of the nature and theme of perseverance.
0441003257|5.0|The only book of truly popular negative theology ever written. Let's hope Pratchett and Gaiman collaborate again soon.
630027120X|5.0|\\"The Mission\\" is a film that takes us beautiful rain forests of Brazil where the tribe of Guaran Indians live.  The film is base on a true story that happened during times of slavery and colonies in the New World.  We visit the constructed missions where the Indians live and work.  The importance of the missions is that they are protections for the Indians against the slavery and abuses from the Spaniards.  Captain Rodrigo (Robert De Niro) was a man who bought and sold slaves, but killed his brother and looks for penance.  He goes away through forest and waterfalls until arriving at the mission of San Miguel.  The father (Jeremy Irons) of the mission shows compassion to the captain who later becomes a monk.  They are both accepted by the Indians and learn to live with their customs.  The problem in the film is that the territory where the missions are is under negotiations between the Spaniards, Portuguese and the Catholic Church.  The film shows how the Indians were converted to the catholic religion.  In the missions, the priests accept them and they learn to play the violin and sing.  The film shows the brutality of the Portuguese in not respecting the missions.  There is discussion of whether the Indians are animals and it is not possible that they can sing and adore God.  What was interesting for me was how the Indians changed their family life because of slavery.  They began to kill their third child so that they could escape from the slave hunters.  I recommend the film for the beauty of the forest, indigenous and religious music.
B000001ESF|5.0|These guys are the real deal. Sure they've gone and made Ayn Rand Gene Rodenberry. But they were the first to do it. And they are the best at it. When it comes to heaviosity (fuzzy, deep guitars, pummelling drums, screaming vocals belting out comic book lyrics) the only band that's better than them that gets more airtime on radio is Zep. Here's to another 25 years of great Canadian loud hard rock. &quot;Today the world, tomorrow the solar system!&quot;
B00005JMFR|5.0|I like everybody who have written reviews have not yet seen this film, but can hazard a guess as to what will happen. I suspect, having seen that neo can use his powers in the \\"real world\\", that it isn't the real world at all but a matrix, and the world they believe to be the matrix is infact a matrix within a matrix. Confused? well me too, and i suspect the movie itself will be even more confusing than my theorys. As for some other reviews that have said that it wasn't in fact neo who stopped the machines but a nearby ship using an EMP remains to be seen, if it was a nearby ship, then it is most likely to be the one that rescued them, and we have yet to hear them say anything about it. As for agent smith being in the real world, we are still to see wether that was a dream or not, i suspect not. anyways it looks set to be one hell of a movie.
0385503954|4.0|First off, this novel was written by a member of my baby boomer generation. That does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of depth, but I don't think this book has as much depth as has been claimed for it by so many reviewers.However, I'm not British. The protagonist off this novel is a prissy precocious young girl named Briony who aspires to be a writer but who nearly destroys a young man's life by falsely accusing him of a sexual encounter. In the process of her writer's intention to see life from all angles, she overdoes it in this one case. <BR>The book is quite ambitious (or should that read wordy?) in scope and execution but is reduced in stature, in my opinion, by the tenuous nature of its main premise. The whole book hinges on one girl's fatal and intentional misapprehension of an event. Presumably this is a reflection of the sexual mores of the times and I can accept this, having grown up in the '50's which weren't much better. In \\"Amsterdam\\" the interpersonal tension, call it back-biting if you have to, is contemporary and among three adults, and that makes a little more sense to me. \\"Amsterdam\\" is also much shorter. Though I would not want to participate in euthanasia myself, still it is a morbidly amusing concept that I believe is very British.

0385504209|5.0|Besides the story in this book was about christianity , I found the symbols described in the book are both informative and fascinating. The author provided elaborate details on many symbols that we all familiar with. I was amazed to learn the meanings of so many interesting and famous symbols that I was unable to decode before.<br />As for the facts about religion mentioned in this book, they are certainly constroversial. I think the author was inclined to do this. He provided facts that he found from researches, and he included a lot of his own perspective and opinons. Then, he left them for the reader to think about them.<br />Overall, I think the book was absolutely worth reading. Not only the story is fascinating, but also it allow me to gain a whole new insight of the world surrounding us.<br />I do agreed one thing. When the first scientist (human) said that the earth was a round,circle shape, all the people thought that person was insane. No one believed him at the time because people were told by what should be believed in and what shouldn't. In other words, we are often influence by what our society wants us to believe. What I am trying to say is, something that we think does not exist today, its existence might be proven some time later.<br />I hope anyone who read this book will enjoy as much as I do.

For those who read this book, I think that you will find it incredibly funny or incredibly weird.  In my case, I found it incredibly funny.  It is about Yossarian, a bombardier in the war (which one, I forget, hehe), and his life there with INCREDIBLY hilarious friends.  I can't wait to finish this book, and I hope that everyone will at least attempt to read it...I'll go finish it now.
B00008PX8P|1.0|Ok, here's the low down on this DVD. It shows a select number of songs from various shows throughout Led Zep's career. But it does some things wrong: it cuts between camera angles for dramatic effect, but it really just looks [bad]; it takes video cuts from different songs in the same concerts (watch Immigrant song, there will be a couple instances where JPJ is playing a different bass); the music just [stunk]. Jimmy Page plays very sloppy, so much that it hurts. Plant also has an uncontrolled soprano that just screeches around for no real reason. Its funny listening him do that simulate orgasm thing, which just sounds silly cuz at the end, i go \\"CHOO!\\". The first disc, almost all of the songs sound exactly the same, and Page does this solo called \\"white summer\\" which is extremely sloppy and unimaginative. He also tries to play fast, which really digs his own grave there. that's just the beginning of a bunch of things wrong with this DVD, save your money.
0446310786|5.0|Alas, this was another school book for English, but I must admit, my English teacher has good taste.  This book, To Kill A Mockingbird, centers around Scout (or Jean Louise) and Jem (Jeremy) Finch.  It is told through the eyes of Scout as sort of a reminiscence, beginning when she is six and he is ten.  I found this book amusing and touching.  It went through the lifestyle of the moderately poor in Maycomb County, Alabama in around 1930 and so forth.  It also described deeply the feeling of racism between the whites and Afrian-Americans at the time, how far it went, and it is a charming story of a little tomboy girl's life.  That sounds strange, haha, but it truly is a classic.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Zeppelin has long been criticized for having sloppy live performances. yes, like any other band they had their off nights. however, we finally have footage of shows when they were on top of their game. this dvd proves that on their good nights they were explosive, revealing a raw energy level no other rock act could match. <BR>   My favorite footage is from the 1970 Royal Albert Hall show. these performances show them before the excesses of rock stardom affected their play. they did have only the first two albums of material to draw from. however, they concentrated more on just PERFORMING instead of on the showmanship and strutting around that page/plant would show in the 73,75, and 79 shows. has anyone else noticed how page seemed to develop a sweating problem as the years went by? on the 1970 footage, he is not sweating much at all. by the 1979 show he is sweating profusely. i rack this up to drug/alcohol abuse. his playing at the albert hall is clean, quick, and simply AWESOME! don't get me wrong, he was super on the later footage, but he would play no better than at the albert hall concert. as far as plant goes, he could still hit those high notes in 1970 and the excessive strutting and theatrics of the later shows is not present here. he concerned himself more with just singing instead of acting like a sex symbol. i can't forget bonham. check out his drum solo on moby dick. much better than the version on \\"the song remains the same\\". his heavy powerful drumming was the essential backbone to the zeppelin sound. <BR>   The Denmark radio show in March, 1969 is another highlight for me. zepp seemed out of their element in a studio setting with teenagers gathered around in a tight circle. this setting forced zepp to just play since they had little room to move around. the kids could literally reach out and touch them! although the footage is in black and white and the sound is only in pcm format, the performance is top shelf. you get to see the boys up close and personal, and they deliver!<BR>  The other highlights for me are: <BR>- page on \\"in my time of dying\\" from the 1975 Earl Court concert. his combination of slide and picking on this song is a sight to behold.<BR>- \\"Trampled Underfoot\\", from the same Earl's Court session. more great playing by page and some nice synthesizer from JPJ to boot.<BR>- \\"The Ocean\\" from the 1973 Madison Square concert. why this wasn't included in \\"the song remains the same\\" movie is beyond me. page is again hitting on all cylinders with this one.<BR>   i found that bonham was the most impressive at the 1979 Knebworth show. his heavy drumming is the most evident here and shows how important he was to the band. i thought of all the members, his performance level dropped off the least through the years. if anything, he might of been at his best at the 1979 show, less than a year from his untimely death.<BR>   I highly recommend this 2 disc dvd because it is simply the best combo of audio/video of zepp available today. Enjoy!
B00000IPAX|4.0|I'm more hardcore emo and other types of music, but for punk, ill definately take (some) Blink stuff and Alkaline Trio.  This album in particular stands out to any albums Blink put out, including its predecessor Take Off... Alot of the songs are your average punk 3 chord progressions with childish lyrics. While i don't listen to any of the songs on the front or rear of the album, i immediately skip to the quality songs flat in the middle (tracks 4-8). <BR>Start with 4) Going Away to College, a great anthem song, which i wholly relate to (i'm 20 and listening to 16 year old's music!). it ends well then fades with a tingling riff into 5) Whats my Age Again, which is just plain funny, in a Weird Al sort of way. then 6) Dysentary Gary is not all that bad, but nothing spectacular, yet it reminds me of a friend's boyfriend and again is a song i wholly relate to...not including &quot;trying on his father's tights&quot; but after that intermission we have the classic 7) Adam's Song, definately the best Blink182 (my opinion) song i've heard to date with the exception of Anthem Part II, then finally 8) All The Small Things, finishes up my spree of favorite middle tracks, and is also a radio hit.  Who would hate such a light hearted song? Besides it ends almost like Adams song.<br />So basically tahts it, i bougth the album (used for 3 bucks) because of those middle tracks. But of course, the rest of the album fits the Blink182 experience well, and is worth listening to in the car (when you're not really paying attention...) Definately one of the better punk albums of late!
B000075BFK|4.0|2Pac Amaru Shakur does it again with his latest double album \\"Better Days.\\" This album was made during 2Pacs Makaveli period and has some very good stuff on here, including the two versions of \\"Thugs Mansion\\" and two \\"Fair Xchange\\" versions. Theres also good songs like \\"My block\\" and \\"Catchin' Feelins\\" which are two of my very favorites. Fans can also expect more from 2Pac from the summer of 2003 to the summer/fall of 2004 with another double album, film documentaries, and DVDs as the forthcoming projects in the case says.2Pac will continue to live on even after his death just like he states in the hidden trak 14 on disk 2 where he says \\"Expect me n**** like you expect Jesus to come back..I'm comin'.\\"
B000089A07|1.0|I'm not at all opposed to a good remake of a classic film, but I believe it should have something new to say, something that makes it relevant to the modern age and time.  Almost a shot-for-shot remake of the original and woefully underrated classic \\"Manhunter\\", \\"Red Dragon\\" fails on this score, and lacks the tortuous internal struggle of its detective and the trancelike, music-video pacing that made the original so creepy, poetic, and melodic.<br />\\"Red Dragon\\" comes across as a bloodless, boring, dispirited, dreary, and mechanical cloning of the first film, directed by Michael Mann, which told the same story back in 1986 with style, wit, horror, and cinematic aplomb. Trouble is, Anthony Hopkins hadn't signed on to the role as society psychiatrist-turned-serial-killer Hannibal Lecter at the time, and Hollywood didn't have two massively successful Hannibal Lecter movies under its belt to capitalize on.  The solution: remake \\"Manhunter\\", this time casting Hopkins as the cannibalistic Lecter.<br />\\"Red Dragon\\" introduces Hannibal Lecter by way of Will Graham (Edward Norton), an FBI profiler brought back to work on the case of a new serial killer nicknamed \\"The Tooth Fairy\\" by a yellow journalist (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at the National Tattler. Graham, nearly killed by Lecter, needs help in tracking and identifying the killer, and, like Clarisse Starling in 'Silence', visits the good doctor to get a 'scent for the hunt'.<br />There are some slight alterations, none of them for the better. Where \\"Manhunter\\" was about the internal voyage of the troubled Graham into the soul and mind of a serial killer, \\"Red Dragon\\" is Hannibal Lecter's movie. The first scene of the movie, which replaces the far eerier flashlight introduction to the Tooth Fairy in \\"Manhunter\\", is an account of Will Graham's near fatal encounter with Lecter. The scene is amusing, well-paced, and akin to the baroque sensibilities of Ridley Scott's \\"Hannibal\\", and earns the one star I've offered in this review; the viewer would do well to cut off the movie at this point and go watch \\"Manhunter.\\"<br />In every comparison with Michael Mann's original, the movie falls far short; having seen \\"Manhunter\\" and watching this workmanlike copy is like looking at your uncle's yellowed polaroid of the Mona Lisa, after having seen the original on display. The treatment of the villain in \\"Red Dragon\\" is similarly flawed; the Tooth Fairy is introduced too soon, Ralph Fiennes (who does a competent job with what little he is given) is unable to evoke the bestial Dolarhyde, and even one of the film's horrific centerpieces, the flaming-wheelchair scene, comes off as a disinterested photocopy of the horrifying original.<br />Gone is the mounting suspense of Graham's troubling inner journey into his own wounded psyche and his terrifying relationship with Lecter; in its place we have Norton's complacent banter with a visibly mellowed Anthony Hopkins, who manages to make a cannibalistic serial killer look like a purring, content kitten. Gone too is Mann's use of contemporary music to evoke the Lecter's nihilistic universe and Graham's tortured one; notable in its absence is the modern equivalent of Iron Butterfly's 'Anna Gada Da Vida', used to startling effect in the original to make the culminating sequence of that movie approach Italian grand opera.<br />What do we have in place of all this? A clumsy, contrived 'explanation' for the Tooth Fairy's depravity, a psychosexually abusive relationship with his dead mother that could have been lifted directly from \\"Psycho.\\"<br />\\"Red Dragon\\" is a technically competent movie, and to those viewers unfamiliar with the cinematic source material Rattner has pillaged it might serve as 2+ hours of pleasingly bland serial killer fare. But the viewer is best served to go out and buy \\"Manhunter\\" for a glimpse of true horror and a better perspective into the mind of a psychopath; \\"Red Dragon\\" is tapwater to \\"Manhunter's\\" chianti.review; the viewer would do well to cut off the movie at this point and go watch \\"Manhunter.\\" <br />In every comparison with Michael Mann's original, the movie falls far short; having seen \\"Manhunter\\" and watching this workmanlike copy is like looking at your uncle's yellowed polaroid of the Mona Lisa, after having seen the original on display.

1587990717|2.0|As a professional options trader and familiar with Taleb's \\"Dynamic Options Hedging\\", I expected a very professional book with interesting insights into the human and mathematical aspects of probability and randomness.<br />And while the book does provide some of that, the valuable information is embedded in writing that is overly self-centered if not egomaniacal.<br />I'd like to point out that I REALLY wanted to love this book.  But I didn't.<br />Taleb writes about interesting ways in which people do not understand randomness but he does it in a way which is unnecessarily insulting and condescending.  <br />Even worse, I find him hypocritical.  He spends a lot of energy talking about the value of being able to change one's mind, as well as the value of large sample sizes in probability-based decision making.  But then he describes how far out of his way he goes to avoid information (which might cause him to change his mind or which would increase his sample size.)  Further he implies that anyone who takes in certain information, like almost any form of news broadcast, must be an idiot and lives in a world of self-delusion.<br />Taleb writes like a smart but anti-social and holier-than-thou trader. He writes some very useful stuff about randomness and its misapplication in modern thinking.  But then he goes on psychological tangents which are nothing more than trying (and failing) to find a mathematical basis on which to defend his personality foibles (flaws?).<br />He over-generalizes about trading in a style which he does not employ, i.e. selling premium or making bets based on past occurrences.  He writes as if his way is the only way that makes sense, and implies that in the long run it is only because of randomness that anyone who does not trade the same way he does could be successful. (\\"Ergoditic\\" is definitely the best word in the book....)<br />Taleb gets very close to interesting discussions of a non-mathematical nature as well, such as the level of emotion involved with success or failure, as well as some interesting historical information.  But he lessens the effect of the good writing by then telling us how all this fits into how he lives his life, using as many obscure references as possible, in an ongoing attempt to justify (to the reader or to himself?) the lifestyle he has created for himself.  For example, he uses the above discussion to explain why he does not like to look at his own trading profit or loss statements.  And he writes it in a way that shows he expects us to think he's brilliant or heroic for having such discipline.  Very silly stuff....<br />Taleb describes his hero worship (of a philosopher named Popper) and it becomes clear that at least a partial goal of this book is to get the reader to revere (or emulate) Taleb the way he reveres (and tries to emulate) Popper.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.<br />Overall I found the probability discussion interesting, but not worth the tedium of having to listen as if the reader is Taleb's (badly needed) therapist.<br />Luckily for Taleb, he says directly in the book that he will ignore all reviews.  I think you should be able to find a less tedious source for the bits of valuable information \\"Fooled By Randomness\\" provides without having to suffer the insufferable smugness of the author.
B00005JL78|2.0|Though it seems this DVD has been released for ever, I just got it.  I was very sorry I did.<br />The plot is okay, somewhat convoluted, with Tom Cruise evading the precrime cops while trying to prove his innocence for a murder he will commit in 36 hours.  Odd sounding but that's why I thought I'd like it.<br />However, the filmmaking was horrible.  Its either too dark to make much out or its so bright everything has that soap opera glare to it.  And the action scenes were also poorly done - at one point you can clearly see a wire on Tom Cruise, and that's without using any DVD features!  I was so disappointed with the quality of the movie that I didn't even get to the second disk to see the extras.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is one of Disney's classics!  Great soundtrack, great characters, and great plot.<br />A young French girl named Belle goes looking for her father who got lost on his way to an inventions fair.  She ends up at this castle in the middle of the forest where she meets a prince who is actually this monstrous beast who had been transformed into this creature by a fairy princess long ago for being heartless.  Belle bargains herself for her father's release, and the story between Belle and the Beast begins to unfold.<br />Other characters in the movie include Chip and his mother Mrs. Potts (voiced by Angela Lansbury), Lumiere (voiced by Jerry Orbach...from Law and Order!), Cogsworth, and Gaston.  Typical to the Disney movie, it pits the good versus the bad in a somewhat more lighthearted way with great songs that everyone sings along with.<br />This new edition of the DVD I honestly don't think is much better than the original.  They have lots of added goodies yes, but the famous new scene added into the movie with the new song &quot;To Be Human Again&quot; while a cute song, just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie after you've become accustomed to the original.  I think they should've left it alone, but I wouldn't mind buying a soundtrack that included the new song.<br />Classic, great, been one of my favorites since it was originally released.  No matter how many times I see it, I laugh and cry in the same parts!  It never gets old!
B00000JCOV|5.0|This band have been my favourite since I was a pup in '99 and knew nothing about metal, and have remained so despite the broadening of my tastes and the gaining of knowledge that has erased so many bands from my collection. This has to have happened for a reason, and the reason is simple, its just such a damn good album! Lets take it song by song and sum each one up in a few words:<BR>1) (sic) - sheer hell, can't hear much korn influence here.<BR>3)eyeless - best track by far, contains the evilest breakdown ever and one which bands like irate and hatebreed have yet to better.<BR>4)wait and bleed - has a nice drop at the end, the best of their singles<BR>5) surfacing - very fast pedals, typical slipknot \\"stomping\\" song, chorus that proves no band on the planet conveys hate as well as they do.<BR>6)spit it out - this song is whack, lets move on...<BR>7)tattered and torn - this song is whack too, move on further...<BR>8) me inside - fast pedals, nice melodic chorus, but \\"purity\\" was far better<BR>9)liberate - nice and fast, im not too keen on it but its good live<BR>10)prosthetics - this song is evil, nice change in pace, im still waiting for the korn influence to kick in, and personally im hearing some black metal in here. Great song.<BR>11)No life - a song which contains rapping, bellowing and singing, nothing much stands out but its still a killer tune.<BR>12)diluted - tune<BR>13)only one - nice breakdown in here, has remained virtually in tact since \\"MFKR\\".<BR>14)scissors - undoubtedly evil, great riff once it gets going, but ive only ever listened to all 8 minutes a couple of times as i tend to skip on to...<BR>15)get this - ah. blastbeats. one of my favourites. mix of punk and grindcore, but retaining trademark slipknot anger.<BR>16)eeyore - amazing. i have no idea why they hid this track cos its nothing to be embarassed about. blastbeats from hell, pedals. pure death grind here.<br />overall - amazing album. Impossibly to place the band in any one genre cos to be honest, its all here - grind, death, punk, hardcore, melody. Proper good though. Buy this. Twice. Or three times in different formats like me.
0553577123|5.0|This complete edition of Anne's diary makes us realize how hard it was for Anne to live in her \\"Secret Annex\\", hiding from the Nazis. During the WWII, it wasn't easy for Jews to survive, so Anne, her family, and a couple of friends, decided to hide in a building, which they renamed the \\"Secret Annex\\". While the other editions omitted Anne's more private thoughts, this edition is more complete and Anne's private thoughts about sexuality are also included. Her fear about being caught by Nazis is overwhelming, however she soon ignores these fears and must face constant famine and the challenges of becoming a woman. Often disagreeing with her mother, she runs to Peter, a boy of her age, for advice. It is then that she slowly discovers she is having mixed feelings about this boy whom she rarely paid any attention to. She starts discovering what love is, but how can she continue her relationship with Peter when she hears Nazi airplanes throwing bombs in the city every night?<br />Anne was a very strong person and, day after day, was glad she was alive, even though things didn't always go her way. After a while, she got used to her routine and never thought the Germans would one day discover her secret hiding place. However, as the Nazis got stronger, they one day discovered the Frank's secret hiding place, and Otto, Anne's father, was the only one out of the eight people in the annex who survived the concentration camps. When he returned to the Secret Annex after his liberation, he found Anne's diary and passed on her message to the world. This book is a good way towards a better understanding of what Jews had to live through during the second World War.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Director Michael Bay breathes much needed new life into the war movie genre by making \\"Pearl Harbor\\" a crowd-pleasing musical in the tradition of the great MGM extravaganzas of the forties and fifties. Bay introduces colorful song and dance numbers into the Sunday morning tussle that welcomed America into WWII, and thereby turns what would otherwise be a pedantic history lesson into a popcorn-munching good time.<BR> <BR>The film opens with the performance of the jaunty \\"Rots of Bombs\\". The Japanese pilots are quietly performing pre-attack calisthenics on the deck of a carrier when Admiral Yamamoto (Akio Mikuni) appears and begins a spirited, samba-tinged call and response. Jumping jacks turn into rumba dancing as Yamamoto sings out questions and the pilots merrily reply: \\"Who has bombs?/We have bombs/How many bombs?/Rots of bombs.\\"<br />Back in Oahu, American pilots Dex and Dewey (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett)share the affection of nurse Rhonda (Kate Beckinsale). The three are tangled in the afterglow of a night of tropical lovemaking when the attack begins. As they drive their jeep to the airfield, Affleck and Hartnett show off heretofore unheard vocal talent when they sing the haunting ballad \\"Snuggle Time\\", which includes: \\"When we kissed our baby bye-bye/We tasted last night's mai-tai./Now we've lost our morning mojo/Thanks to Admiral Tojo./We should be sandwiching our baby /But they're torpedoing our navy./There is no bigger crime/Than missing snuggle time.\\"<br />The only misstep in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is an ill-conceived hip-hop tune by Alec Baldwin as Lt. Jimmy Doolittle. Leading his squadron on a reprisal bombing of Japan, Baldwin flips his fighter cap around backwards and begins rapping: \\"Whacha bomb my homies for/It's disrespectful, doncha know?/Now I gotta even up the score/And jack some pain on Tokyo.\\" It seems disingenuous that onboard the bombers are coolers of malt liquor.<br />Otherwise, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" combines the magic of Hollywood with the mirth of war. The seamless merging of rousing show tunes with exploding flight decks will leave you feeling proud and prickly.  And what's Yamato with that?
B000000WCX|3.0|Don't get me wrong, as this album is a favorite for many Bowie fans. I like it too, but not nearly as much as some of his other work. This album just doesn't sound like he put to much into it. Of course, I totally understand why. Bowie was trying to appeal to a younger audience, and he made some really cool music videos with these songs in the process. The album Outside had a similar style (not identical, but similar) with a much better outcome, if you ask me.<br />  Still, if nothing else, it's neat just to prove that Bowie can do anything he wants, this was one style of music he hadn't touched, and he did, fairly successfully. He doesn't work his vocals too hard on this album though, and it would be neat to see him tackle this style again, but working a little harder.<br />  His next album, Hours, heads in a totally different direction, and I think he did a better job with that.
1563898586|5.0|I'm usually not one to follow trends seeing how The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is about to hit the theaters in a few short weeks and how the graphic novel is available in the bookstores I frequent.  Yet I am both a fan of Alan Moore's work (The Watchmen in particular) and of literature from the 19th Century, from which some of the greatest written material ever. emerged.  So a mathematical equation popped into my brain :<br />Alan Moore + 19th Century Literature = a great read<br />BINGO!!!<br />In 1898, a mysterious young lady who calls herself Wilhelmina Murray is sent by the English government to find a group of 19th Century literary characters (Wilhelmina being one herself under a different name) scattered throughout the globe.  Her search leads her to Cairo to find Allan Quartermain in an opium-induced stupor and also Captain Nemo (who isn't that much of a fan of English Imperialism) coming to their rescue; to Paris where a gargantuan ape-like monster is murdering ladies of ill-repute; and back to England where a group of mysterious pregnancies are occuring at a school for girls.  Now this new \\"menagerie\\" of heroes has a mission: recovering the gravity-repellant material known as Cavorite (the same material used in H.G. Wells' \\"the First Men on the Moon\\") from a powerful London crimelord known as The Doctor.  And as Sherlock Holmes would say: \\"The Game's afoot!\\"<br />Also included in this graphic novel is the story \\"Allan and the Sundered Veil\\", which is printed in 1890s illustrated magazine format. \\"AatSV\\" not only describes the events that lead up to Quartermain's appearance in a Cairo opium den but also hints at events that might take place in TLoEG Vol. 2.  Here there are appearances by H.G. Wells' Time Traveller, Burrough's John Carter, and Lovecraft's Randolph Carter (who is revealed to be John's great-nephew).  I really liked how Moore wrote this story.  He should consider writing outside of comics once in a while.<br />Be warned.  There are depictions of violence and depravity that are far more graphic than one may expect from classical literary characters.  But this is not violence for its own sake.  It is how the creators of TLoEG feel these characters would act without the veneer of 19th Century censorship holding them back.  You have to understand that Hawley Griffith (the Invisible Man) and Mr. Hyde are apt to utilize methods as deplorable as what the villains would use.  But once you get past the violence and overall unsavory disposition of the heroes, you'll find TLoEG to be a jolly good read.ctions of violence and depravity that are far more graphic than one may expect from classical literary characters.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It takes some an otherwise standard plot that we can relate to (not that we've experienced, but that we can relate to) and entwines it with great characters and songs that we all know and love, and the result is one fantastic movie.<br />  Nearly everyone I talk to thinks this is one of the greatest movies they have ever seen; when favorite movies are brought up, this one always comes up quickly. Few movies can make you laugh and cry, or if you don't cry, at least feel for the characters.<br />  The first time you see this movie will be the best, but I guarantee you, this is one to watch again and again!<br />  Okay, now the special fatures. They tell you alot about the movie, and are extremely in depth. If you're into that stuff, this edition is the one for you. If all you care about is the movie (understandable) then go for the one disc verson.
B00005QFE5|5.0|The Road Home is a simply wonderful and touching movie. I cried when I first watched it. It moved me. It is not to be missed. I would highly recommend it to anybody. The scenery and the acting is excellent. It is a love story for the ages. Unfortunately the movie did not get enough publicity when it came out. I read a review of the movie when it came out and noticed that it was highly recommended. So when the DVD came out I had to get it for my collection. I was not disappointed. See it and you will not regret. The beginning of the movie is shot in black and white to set up the plot but then it goes into splendid color when the story line goes back when the characters first met and fell in love. This has the original Love Story beaten.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Pitch Black is a fun movie. There are a good number of plot twists, good characters, and it's a fun story. Basicly a ship crash lands on a deserted planet. The survivors find an abandoned human settlement and are about to leave when the planet plunges into darkness and aliens come out to hunt them. I think that the story behind the previous humans and what happened to them could have been developed a little more, but maybe that's just me.<br />  As with many sci-fi thrillers, there is language galore. I've never really understood that point, and especially in this film. It doesn't add very much to the moive, or even seem realistic. I understand cursing when it adds to the movie, but sometimes it almost wants to make you laugh here, it just sounds silly.<br />  There are some great scares in the movie, and it keeps you guessing till the end. I personnaly think the alien in this movie looks a little silly, not scary like the creature in &quot;Alien&quot;.<br />  But, all told, it's worth seeing. It's a good movie.
B00004W52U|5.0|Operation Ivy was a punk/ska band (with Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman from Rancid) from 1987-1989, and in those years they performed 150 live shows (with Tim Armstrong), realeased a couple EP's, and made a full length album (all with Tim Armstrong in the band). This album comprises one of their EP's, the full length album, and two of their tracks off of a compilation (goddammit, and with Tim Armstro...err, Lint). <br />The album, called Energy, is a powerhouse from beginning to end. Pure punk energy that made me want to overturn furniture and smash windows. And listen to Rancid. Damn, I'm obsessed with Rancid, but OpIv is just as good. My favorite song is: all of them, but most of the sound quality is shoddy-okay at best.<br />Hey, 27 tracks! Can't go wrong, now can you?<br />If you like OpIv, you'd like, duh! Rancid!<br />Bottom Line: A punk powerhouse classic.

037542217X|5.0|If  you'd like some relief from profound, violent, or even sugary sweet characters, this is the book for you.  The story just rocks along at a pleasant pace.  You may guess some of the endings of each part but still it's fun just to see that ending unfold.  Read this ...you'll be glad you did.
B000089RVX|4.0|I just saw Evanescense in Concert a few weeks ago and they blew me away. they area ll great preformers and Amy Lee is incredible with her vocals and song writing. Although there are obvious flaws here and there with some repetivness it is overall a very good Cd. If you like Evanescense Try the band Kidey Thieves. Kidney thieves (aka KT) has a female front vocalist and also awesome sound. They are also very awesome and very talented.

B00000ICD9|4.0|I loved this movie, especially the paint scenes.  It is certainly a thinker movie.  By the end when the wife gets so depressed and he tries to rescue her, it really brings you down and made me not want to watch much more.  If you have been depressed, you can really relate, and it is sad.  I think if you don't buy this movie, you should at least rent it once to see it.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I was first exposed to Jack Johnson's music when he appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and once I'd heard him sing, I knew that I had to find his CD. I am a huge fan of Dave Matthews, and Jack Johnson's lyrics, and his sound in general, remind me of something that you would hear on a DMB album - that's a big reason why he's become my favorite new artist.  He has a really mellow sound to his songs, and although his lyrics may seem kind of &quot;out there&quot; at first, once you really listen to what he's trying to say, you come to appreciate his music on a whole different level entirely. My favorite songs on this album would have to be Times Like These, The Horizon Has Been Defeated, Taylor, Gone, and Dreams be Dreams, among others. If you like the mellow sound of artists like Dave Matthews, then I think you'll really like Jack Johnson.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|I am a Lenny fan, but this cd I didn't feel was his greatest.  There are even songs on it that I skip right through, such as Mr. Cabdriver.  Then again, there are many beautiful songs on it that I can put on repeat.  Over all, I wouldn't recommend this.  It is just ok.
B00000JGEH|4.0|Ah, it's that time again.  After twelve years involving bankruptcy and multiple court cases, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, sequel to the star-making Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is finally going to arrive in theaters.  What most people don't realize, however, is that when they think of Terminator they think of Arnold Schwarzenegger duking it out with Robert Patrick's undestructable liquid robot.  These people don't know that the Terminator was not just a shoot-em-out flick.  The original, filmed in 1984 when Schwartzenegger was still considered young and strong, was the one that actually broke all the rules of movies.  Judgment Day was kind of like an expansion.  With a brilliant story and believable characters as well as a not too short yet not too long screenplay, Terminator exploded with beautiful action scenes, explosions, and gun-fights.  If you ask a true Terminator fan, I'm sure that he or she will say that they would rather choose the classic truck scene in the Terminator than the final battle between Arnold and Patrick. The Terminator truly does not have as much action as T2 but it brims with suspense and a romance story which fuels the addictive part of the film.  T2 was just battle to battle with several boring moments in between.  And personally, I enjoyed Schwartzenegger more as a villain than as a     world-saving cyborg.<br />Schwartzenegger along with Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn star in this original.  In the future (2027 or 2029) there is a gigantic war between the humans and machines, which are basically robots.  The machines have destroyed a large amount of humans but the humans are nonetheless winning the war because they are led by a strong and courageous leader by the name of John Connor.  Now go back to 1984.  Sarah Connor (Hamilton) is a waitress who dreads her terrible life.  She doesn't know that the son she will have will help the humans fight the machines almost fifty years later.  The machines, or cyborgs, create a plan in thefuture to send back one of them so he can kill Sarah Connor.  If he succeeds, she will not have the baby and the battle will be lost.   The humans, however, send back a human named Kyle Reese (Biehn) to protect Sarah as well as destroy the machine known as the Terminator to save the human race.<br />The acting in this film is not Oscar-deserving but still better than someone like Leonardo DiCaprio.  The stars magically pull it off and seem like real characters.  When you think about it, there are only about three or four actual fight scenes in the film but to see the plans that Kyle and the Terminator plan to kill each other are brilliant.  Kyle is after all able to take pain.  The Terminator is almost undestructable.  So go ahead, buy this flick that you should watch one Friday night when there is nothing good on TV.  Don't even watch the TV versions because they edit so much needed stuff from this film.  Be warned, though.  The film is rated R for strong violence, language, sexuality, and nudity.  You might try to keep the kids away from this but it seems that already half of them are gloating about the sequel and not looking at this masterpiece, which in my opinion, is fifty times better than the second.  Happy viewing.
0156027321|5.0|This fabulous novel certainly deserved the Booker Prize, and is one of the best I've read in awhile, and impossible to put down. Pi is a young teen in the 1970's in India. His family runs a zoo, and early on he acquires an encyclopedic knowledge of animals of all kinds. In his spare time he also becomes a student and practitioner of several diverse religions--India is certainly the place to sample all the great faiths of the world. His family decides to emigrate to Canada, but never make it when their ship sinks, and Pi is the only human survivor--or is he? What follows is an extraordinary tale of courage and survival, of taking the forces of nature and working with them--in the form of a tiger named Richard Parker--rather than against them. Martell's writing, his descriptions of sky and sea and rain and sun, are magical. Pi's religious views do not sustain him in any conventional sense, but he views creation as mystical and powerful. As fabulous as this tale is, Martell forces us to suspend disbelief, as Pi survives a horrific storm, a carnivorous island, and an encounter with another murderous castaway.<BR>Pi is rescued of course, to encounter complete disbelief as the representatives of the shipping company attempt to discover what really happened to the ship. During the interview we are presented with another version of the story which at first blush seems more believable, although in many respects more horrible still. Suddenly the reader is doubtful--was this whole thing real at all? (Keeping in mind of course that this is a novel!) But then one asks--if the second &quot;believable&quot; story were true, would Pi in fact have survived? Think about it.
0066214122|4.0|This book was pretty good. However, way too predictable. Reading the summary of the book, they talk about nanotechnology escaping. Through the first quarter of the book, the guy is suspicious of his wife being weird. He knows that his wife works at a place that makes nanotechnology. Now isn't it obvious that some nanotech has gotten into his wife?<br />The ending of the novel was weak as well.

0385504209|5.0|It's interesting how most of us accept the Bible without a lot of thought.  Reading this book you may realize like I did that there were a lot of hands making a lot of decisions about the Bible that have changed our view of reality forever.  And maybe not in a positive way.  Brown reminds me of Ludlum in that there's always some major unthinkable thing that will happen in the very next chapter.  It's a great read and the historical implications regarding our view of Jesus, the role of woman, the holy grail and da Vinci will never be quite the same.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|The one which no anime has since surpassed, the standard bearer, the inspiration the one which, over a decade later, is still the best.    The art of anime may have improved, but in terms of story, characters and direction, nothing compares to Akira -  the godfather of anime films.  To be honest, its difficult to see how, in the space of two hours, an anime film could be made that could better this in terms of story and structure.  A century from now, when anime is written about, it is akira that will be cited as the \\"capolavoro\\" of the genre.
B000002WPI|5.0|If you are a rap listener and dont have this cd, you aint no fan, no Rap collection is complete without 36 chambers period. This is real hip hop, no bling bling ... Every track is good. Rza's beats are of the hook. <br />GO out and get it
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway to Hell\\" is the final album AC/DC recorded with singer Bon Scott, and for many listeners, it's the best record they made before his death (my personal favorite happens to be \\"High Voltage\\").  I remember seeing the album cover for the first time when I was a kid and being intrigued by the fake devil's horns poking out of Angus Young's head.  It was enough to let me know that this wasn't going to be any ordinary album, and the music confirmed that belief.  The opening title track is one of the group's signature hits, known for Young's brash guitars and Bon Scott's abrasive scream.  It's a song of pure defiance and rebellion, and it got the attention of many religious groups and the PMRC, who would accuse AC/DC of promoting Satanism (yeah, right).  Other noteworthy tracks are the fast-paced \\"Walk Over You,\\" the catchy \\"Touch Too Much\\" and \\"Shot Down in Flames.\\"  This is the remastered and repackaged version, and as with virtually all of the Sony AC/DC reissues, there are no bonus tracks.  However, there's a booklet containing some interesting color photos of the band, and it comes in a nice Digipak case.  Diehard fans who already have prior versions of \\"Highway to Hell\\" should debate on their own whether to get the same album twice, but if you're new to AC/DC, this edition is the sure way to go.  I'm not sure if I would exactly call \\"Highway to Hell\\" a classic (1980's \\"Back in Black\\" gets that honor), but it sure comes awfully close.
014028009X|3.0|This book, which as everyone knows, was also made into a movie with Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant is a fairly decent light read that would be OK to read on a train journey or a long flight.<br />The gimmick here is that it is essentially a modern rewrite of Jane Austin's classic late 18th century novel Pride and Prejudice. Just as the earlier fin de siecle novel provides a commentary on the manners and mores of its time, so does the latter-day version which constantly has you asking &quot;have we really sunk to this?&quot; as we follow the adventures of our slobbish heroine.<br />An amusing light read, and if it inspires a few people to pick up and read Jane Austin's chick lit prototype, then so much the better.
B000007WNN|4.0|The Cult's 1987 \\"Electric\\" sounds like the great record AC/DC never made, and I mean that as a compliment for both groups.  Like Lenny Kravitz, the Cult have always gained a reputation for mimicking legendary acts from the Doors to Led Zeppelin, and, under the production of Rick Rubin, the British group makes a tribute to AC/DC on \\"Electric.\\"  Guitarist Billy Duffy plays in a style so similar to Angus Young, you'd half-expect him to prance around in a schoolboy outfit as Angus often does onstage.  From the opening guitars of the infectious \\"Wild Flower,\\" this album often sounds like it should be re-titled \\"Back in Back in Black.\\"  Other cuts like \\"Memphis Hip Shake,\\" \\"Little Devil,\\" and the single \\"Love Removal Machine\\" rock on aggressively with singer Ian Astbury's howl.  But the album's best track is the one they didn't even write: their version of the classic \\"Born to Be Wild.\\"  What should have been an embarrassment of mammoth proportions actually passes off as a thoroughly successful cover, and it works just as well as the original.  Over a decade and a half since its release, \\"Electric\\" still sounds fresh.  It's been a while since I've played this disc, but it's recently been getting some rotation in my CD player. Listening to it is like being reunited with an old high school buddy.
B0000025T6|3.0|This CD has a good feel to it. It's a dark, harrowing trip through the shadowy side of America. SOme of the songs are a little boring though. However, it is to be noted song #2 is one of the best songs I've ever heard. It's about gambling and people coming back from the dead. That's two plusses in my book.
0790742780|5.0|Ok after reading a few of these reviews I cannot resist the urge to get the point accross that ninety percent of you reviewers must be the types of people that fall into the crowd of politically correct nerds that cannot accept that total equality is a fallacy.  For the most part, your interpretations of this movie are misconstrued by your own biases and the main point of the movie, that the average white working male (yes I said average white) is a thing of the past.  The movie is, more or less, geared towards a changing society and delivers a powerful message that good and hardworking men... the kind that keep their mouths shut and just do their jobs respectfully... are no longer guaranteed success in life (as the old motto would have us believe that hard working men and women will ultimately get what they deserve).  <BR>In all, this is a great movie.  I wanted to stand up and cheer for Micheal Douglas's character throughout the movie.
B00005JL2O|3.0|I saw this with my 11 year old son who had seen the other austin powers movies...  First I have to say it is really REALLY hard to understand why this is rated pg-13 and martix reloaded is an R...it makes no sense to me.  The jokes/language/innuendos (and not subtle enough to be  lost on an 11 year old) are from beginning to the end of the movie.<br />The sight gags were pretty funny all the way thru and the beginning of the movie was priceless.  I really thought I was in for a great movie after the first 15 minutes (won;t spoil it by describing it)...  but I think, for me, it went downhill.  I will say that my son totally enjoyed himself the whole way thru.<br />I think the problem with the movie was that all the other movies were spoofs on 60's spy movies, where as this one seemed to be a spoof of the other austin powers movies.  Maybe it was a subtle difference, but for me it made a huge difference.  The other movies seemed funny as a whole...this one seemed funny only becuase of the sight gags and off the wall (and off color) humor...  Another subtle difference...but it made a ddfference to me.<br />I have seen the other movies multiple times, this one, just the once.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Chicago although is a very good musical but MOULIN ROUGE WAS FAR BETTER and SOUND OF MUSIC WAS BETTER THAN BOTH OF THEM do not forget the best family oscar winning movie out of the list!Chicago has it's original songs but it was a bit dark and Moulin Rouge!didn't have any original song I think besides COME WHAT MAY and Moulin Rouge! was so colorful it's so nice,superb! spectacular spectacular!if Chicago won Best Picture this should have won!Remember Chicago fans Moulin Rouge was the whole reason why Chicago was made and won Best Picture they honored the Best picture to Chicago because they didn't let MOULIN ROUGE WIN! By the way, SOUND OF MUSIC is superb!very nice! sometimes the kids these years don't appreciate THE SOUND OF MUSIC!
B00008DDXC|5.0|We have a lot of DVD's in our collection, and this one is by far the most-viewed. The thrilling plot and climax keep you on the edge of your seat, even after you have read the book!! Daniel Radcliffe gives an excellent portrayl of Harry Potter, as do the other actors and actresses. Even if you aren't a big fan, you should still view the movie as it has amazing technology advances, an exciting plot and climax, and excellent actors. Not just for kids!! A highly reccomended movie from a Harry Potter freak!!
B00008J4P5|1.0|After reading all of the reviews praising this group, I had to say something. This is quite possibly the WORST band I have ever heard in life. Jack White can't sing...well I wouldn't even classify it as singing. I'd compare his voice to a rusty bike tire....it's just annoying, plain and simple. And Meg White playing drums, I could make better sounds using bowls in my kitchen. The White Stripes are a disgrace to rock music everywhere. Everytime I see one of their videos played on MTV the same question pops into my head every single time 'Why God? Why?' So unless you are looking for a frisbee then don't buy this garbage, because that's basically all it's good for...garbage just shear garbage.
0525468021|5.0|Jan Pienkowski's Haunted House is a terrific book, with lots of great colorful detailed illustrations and a variety of popups, pullouts, dial turns, etc.  Except for the last, each of the five double pages has at least three \\"activities\\", and some have more.  Many of the pictures are funny, with things like a black cat in the toilet--the bathroom scene is one of my two favorites, in fact, with a fantastically silly buglike alien with peppermint lips bursting through the wall and an alligator in the tub.  Although nothing is particularly frightening for most, parents will want to exercise a bit of judgement if their children are very sensitive--there's no blood, but there is a skeleton in the closet and a ghost hovering over a bed.  If my child were prone to fears I would definitely skip this one.  But most kids will love it, and, like Sesame Street, adults will find a few details put in only for them--the bookshelf, for example, has books labelled \\"Poe\\", \\"Bosch\\" and \\"Von Dani\\" with the remaining letters of that last name off the page--recognise it?  (Hint: There's a spaceship on the same page!)<br />We were given this book for my son probably 16 years ago. My daughter also enjoyed it as a child and in fact was just studying the pop-up techniques for her high school design technology class.  Our original copy has held up well after all the years and all the loving, which speaks volumes for its construction--kudos to \\"paper engineer Tor Lokvig\\"!  Pages are thick card stock and only a few of the popup effects have suffered any of the ravages of time in our copy; but I still would recommend getting a new copy rather than buying one used, especially sight unseen.  And at the price, even a new one is definitely a bargain!
B00008OWZC|5.0|OK, I'll try to keep this short.  If you:<BR>(a. buying the BBC Sessions<BR>(b. have the BBC Sessions<BR>(c. want to add to your Zep collection<BR>(d. are just getting introduced into the world of Zep<br />...then this album is for you.  These 3 discs capture the magic and mystique of the band, particuarly in a live performance, much better than BBC Sessions, or perhaps any other Zep record, does.  Don't waste your time reading any other reviews.  Go treat your ears to something delicious....How The West Was Won.
0784011710|4.0|Meryl Streep truly deserved the recognition for her performance as a survivor of the Holocaust. The film of course is much more than this, but is essentially the foundation. Kevin Kline plays her lover, and his role is also interesting as the schizophrenic. It's hard to believe the film is over 20 years old. Many have argued that the film is slow paced, and that it takes awhile for the flashbacks. I think this is important though for character development. Sophie's Choice is a tragic overwhelming story that deserves a place in your film collection.<BR>DVD SUMMARY: If you read the \\"Widescreen Review\\" report, you would probably want to steer cleer of this DVD - because they've given the film transfer a less than impressive rating. Apparently this DVD is not 16:9 enhanced (AKA anamorphic).<BR>Well, I obviously can't tell the difference between a film that is 16:9 enhanced and one that isn't, because Sophie's Choice is a better transfer than I expected. In fact, it's just as clear as DVD's that I own that apparently are 16:9 enhanced. In a nutshell, I was pleasantly surprised with the transfer of \\"Sophie's Choice\\" in light of \\"Widescreen Review's\\" analysis.<BR>The audio is disappointing, so I agree with them on that. However, if you have a 5.1 amplifier, you can utilise all the speakers in a pretend type surround, and this helps to a great degree. It beats listening to it just on the front speakers. The extras are great. There is a documentary, but not in the true<BR>sense because it is more based on the the film, although it does, at times, speak with Holocaust survivors. This doco is about 1 hour in length, and is a true bonus. Production notes, actor's notes, and a trailer complete the package.<BR>Regardless of what \\"Widescreen Review\\" report, this DVD is still worth buying. Trust me, the picture quality is great. And more importantly, the story is a must see.
B000002J1B|2.0|I really like quite a bit of Yes's 70s output, even the oft-maligned &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot;, but this is just too over-the-top pretentious, even for Yes. &quot;The Gates Of Delerium&quot; has five interesting minutes out of twenty-plus (&quot;Soon&quot;, at the very end of the song), &quot;To Be Over&quot; is unmemorable, and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; is, quite frankly, unlistenable, a practically atonal unfocused mess, with Steve Howe achieving possibly the most jarring and irritating guitar tone in rock history on his solo. Skip this one.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I don't listen to a whole lot of country music, but when I do I generally like it undistilled. There are a few C&W artists I like without reservations and then there are those who are enigmatic enough that you never know what to expect from them. Johnny Cash fits into both categories.<br />Cash's \\"American\\" series has been interesting and I was eager to hear what was on offer here after his tremendous Solitary Man album. For once, here's an album which lives up to industry hype. I'll be hard pressed to improve on amazon's adulatory paean to Cash's latest work.<br />I was floored by the ragged glory of Cash's interpretations of this eclectic material the first time I heard it. Very little of it has any connection to traditional country, but with Cash behind the mike, the country just seems to burst forth.<br />Some of the more familiar songs I heard with new ears. Songs like Hurt, In My Life and Desperado have a whole lot more meaning when sung by a man of Cash's age as he can look back on life's triumphs and disappointments and sound as if he really means what he's singing.<br />I like the entire CD, but my favorites are the hellfire and brimstone The Man Comes Around, the mournful Hurt, the remorseful I Hung My Head, the reflective In My Life, the swaggering Sam Hall, the plaintive classic Streets of Laredo, and an uplifting rendition of We'll Meet Again.<br />The video of Hurt is well worth the extra buck fifty. Watch it...again and again and again! Cash's beloved wife appears in it and her recent death gives it a poignancy money couldn't buy.<br />I agree with the reviewer who said that Johnny Cash is every bit as important to American music as Elvis Presley. In the autumn of his life, he proves with American IV: The Man Comes Around that he still has what it takes to take his place in the pantheon of American music greats

B000050IE6|5.0|ever sence I discovered opeth ive been dazed with there works mixing jazz, classical, and of course tradtional black and death metal to form a great style all there own.  This album is my personal favorite by the band, and maybe my favorite metal record ever. There is not one bad track on this cd, BUY THIS CD .
B00000ILDF|3.0|You morons that say this is &quot;the WORST movie EVER!&quot; are sad cases. Are you saying Ron Howard's the Grinch is better? Home Alone is better? Battlefield Earth is better? This movie isn't even bad. You're just mad cuz all the &quot;cool people&quot; from Aliens were killed off. Face it, it would've been weak if they lived. I wouldn't wanna see Hicks and Bishop and Newt being chased around the prison-planet.<br />Anyway, I think Fincher created a very slick and stylish sequel. I appreciate it for what it is.
B00006M183|5.0|This album is one of the best of 2002. Pearl Jam always puts out great music every album. \\"I am MIne\\" is a great song which should've gotten more radio airtime. Buy this album and enjoy.
B000002LVB|5.0|I was 20 years old the first time I heard this album in 1970.  I was studing for finals in college and a friend of mine loaned it to me during a two-day break between some of my tests.  I played it once, then twice and then over and over and over for two straignt days.  As soon as the record finished, I turned it over and started it again.  I poured over the cover, searching for some tidbit of information.  Who was this Lou Reed, this Doug Yule? (I was unfamiliar with VU then)  I simply couldn't get enough.  Up to that point in my life, the only album that affected me like that was Abbey Road.<br />Over the years I lost touch with that record and like so many vinyl albums (and yes, I did buy this one) it was lost along the way of my growing up.  Years later as records became cassettes and then CDs, every now and then I would look for it in the music store just becasue I wanted to hear it agin, but to no avail.<br />&quot;Do you have 'Loaded' by the Velvet Underground?&quot; I would aske the clerk.<br />&quot;No, I don't think I've ever heard of that one,&quot; would be the inevitable answer.<br />I began to wonder if indeed &quot;Loaded&quot; had ever existed.  I mean after all, you could always find The Velvet Underground and Nico or White Light White Heat in the bin.  Where was Loaded?  Maybe I was too loaded myself all those years ago and imagined the whole thing.<br />Then suddenly, there it was!  It DID exist!  I got it and played it again just to see why I had gone so crazy for it thirty years ago.  Now I remember.  It's one of the best pieces of music ever made.<br />Sure some of the production is a little rough, and Lou Reed's voice cracks occasionally, but the melodies and lyrics as well as the arrangements more than make up for any dated production glitches.<br />Who hasn't covered (or loved) 'Sweet Jane'?  And 'Rock and Roll' is one of the best anthems to the genre ever created.  'Her life was saved by rock and roll.'   Hey, mine was too!    'Oh, Sweet Nuthin' makes you want to weep with pity for poor Jimmy Brown, Ginger Brown, Pearly Mae and Jordan Love, who lose everything and then still sing, 'Oh sweet nothing, ain't got nothing at all.'  And I just wonder if these guys are the ones who actually coined the phrase 'New Age.'<br />My advice?  Buy this cd and hang on to it, you just might need it someday.
B00003CXXM|4.0|This movie had just the right amount of suspense to make it entertaining all the way through.  There are several scenes that keep you on the edge and rooting for the protagonist (though you don't know if he's a good guy or a bad guy).
6305313687|5.0|Basically American History X is about a teenage skin, Danny, head forced to write a paper on how his brother Derek was put into the path of killing two blacks when he turned in an english paper on Mein Kumph (hitlers autobiography). Derek, who was the lead skin head in town, realized the errors of his ways while in prison and now whats to teach Danny the same lesson before he gets into trouble.<BR>This really is a movie that everbody should take the time to watch. It not only is enjoyable but it shows that people have to be taught to hate and shows how one persons oppinion can spiral into something out of control. <BR>This movie will leave you speachless and ultimately make you think.
B00005OWEH|5.0|This is one of the greatest films ever made. When I first saw it, i was blown away by how excellent it is. Other reviewers seem to think that this version is worse than the original, but come on, thius is a frickin good film. Probably my favorite war film, in fact, even though by conventional standards its not really a war film...more of a psychological tour de force. Favorite scenes; the beggining, the air raid, the part where willard reads kurtzs final letter from his outpost, the bizzar 'carnival' scene (thats the best way i can describe it) and the scene in which willard actually kills kurtz (intercut with the natives killing a wild boar. Yes, perhaps the frecnh plantation scene does go on a little to long, but as I say, there is no perfect film. Great performances, especially from robert duvall, expertly staged battle scenes and a very atmospheric tone make this one of my all time favorites
B00008OLYN|5.0|All Opeth releases are classic. This one is just gorgeous!<BR>Stripped down acoustic with some synths (a first). Don't know why the masses are listening to Linkin Park while this creative energy is around. Do not hesitate to buy! HIGHLY recommended!!
038533558X|5.0|If you are thinking about reading Harlan Coben's latest novel solely based on the praise of \\"TELL NO ONE\\" I can assure you that \\"GONE FOR GOOD\\" will not disappoint!  \\"GONE FOR GOOD\\" is an action packed, roller coaster ride of a novel that will keep you guessing until the very last page.<br />Will Klein has been leading a pretty normal life since the disappearance of his brother Ken over a decade ago.  He has a good job at Covenant House, a girlfriend he soon plans to marry and has finally begun to put the past behind him.  That is until his mother's death brings the circumstances surrounding the believed death of his brother back to the surface.  This coupled with an abrupt departure of his girlfriend lead Will to believe that these events may somehow be connected, forcing him to take a closer look at the events surrounding his brothers disappearance. This eventually leads Will to the realization that Ken may not really be dead after all.
157492589X|5.0|I hereby thank a good friend of mine for introducing me to this very fine film, which indeed deserves high honor in the TV miniseries Hall of Fame.  LONESOME DOVE, a sprawling and picturesque epic set in the old American West, is based on a novel of the same name by author Larry McMurtry.<br />This is a saga of two friends, retired Texas Rangers Augustus McCrae (Robert Duvall) and Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones), who dare ensue seeking out what fellow former Ranger Jake Spoon (Robert Urich) has described as a \\"cattleman's paradise\\" - the virgin wilderness of Montana.  Before long they're off, stealing back from thieves across the border large herds of cattle and horses, readying themselves for a journey that's quite destined to become -more or less- the great American odyssey.  This bold undertaking, originating in the southwest of Texas, is reckoned to end - once having conquered the vast unforgiving wilds of Indian country - in the rich wide openness of western Montana.  Gathering a motley crew of cowboys and other notables:  among them an old comrade in arms, Joshua Deets (Danny Glover), Captain Call's illegitimate and unacknowledged son Newt (Rick Schroder), the town's kind-hearted prostitute, Lorie (Diane Lane), and Gus's two pet pigs, Gus and Captain Call embark upon their grand ambitious trek.<br />It is a trek filled with unrelenting adventure - fraught throughout with quirky happenstance, scenic romance and omnipresent danger.  In addition to horse thieves, snakes, and Indians, Gus and Call must contend with a vicious, murderous half-breed named Blue Duck (Frederic Forrest).  Also, in an interesting sub-plot, the ne'er do well Jake is pursued by a sheriff from Arkansas for an accidental murder committed there.  However this sheriff, July Johnson (Chris Cooper), soon changes his course after finding out his pregnant wife had run off on a whiskey boat in pursuit of a wastrel lover.  Meanwhile, after having rescued Lorie from the clutches of Blue Duck and his gang of nasty villains, Gus makes room in his ample heart for the love of two women: Lorie, who's evermore from that moment devoted to him, and Clara (Anjelica Huston), an old flame he intends to visit while en-route to Montana.<br />Just as Dickens did, McMurtry fleshes his characters out - even the minor ones - and gives them souls.  Gus and Woodrow are, in particular, drawn forth with amazing depth and insight - Gus's warm sensibility plays perfectly off Call's stern straightforwardness, and it makes for a friendship that is rich, pure and patent.  Truly Duvall must be a real cowboy at heart, and the role of Gus McCrea was just made for him!  And Tommy Lee Jones was absolutely stellar.  My favorite minor character is Janey (Nina Siemaszko), a girl from Arkansas who chucks rocks with perfect aim at a scurvy bunch of backwoods outlaws trying to rob her new friend - my 2nd favorite minor character - Deputy Roscoe Brown (Barry Corbin).<br />The acting is actually superb throughout, which I suppose should well be expected from such a first rate cast:  two with Oscars already tucked under their belts (Duvall and Huston), two future Academy Award winners (Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper), as well as a future Oscar nominee (Diane Lane) - it lends no insignificant amount of credit to a television movie when there are actors of such renowned caliber starring in it.<br />I cannot say this film was quite as moving as I had expected it to be - though realistically portrayed, some of the tragedy seemed too coincidental or, in some subtle way, even contrived.  Yet, although this movie is somewhat slow and slightly dry at the beginning, it does gradually warm into an alluringly endearing glow by the end: a spark lovingly fanned along the way by Basil Poledouris's exquisite score.  The dry dusty landscape is exquisitely filmed, and much of the dialogue is woven with bits of subdued genius.  Overall, I must say that though this is a brutally honest drama, it is possessed, much like Homer's Odyssey, of a mythical quality all its own.uch like Homer's Odyssey, of a mythical quality all its own.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Over twenty years late and right on time. This is the godsend that Zeppelin fans have been waiting for. No more terrible quality bootlegs to suffer through, where the sound of the band seems to be coming through a filter, no short peeks into the band's performances like we saw in MTV's, then VH1's documentaries. Nope. Here's the real thing. Loud, raw, powerful and so utterly Led Zeppelin. Hallelujah!<br />Since the band's breakup, Jimmy Page has told reporters that a live anthology of the band has been one of his dreams. Until now, most fans could only have &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; which while fun, was hardly the band at its best (filmed at the end of their record shattering 1973 tour, one can tell the band members are going on auto pilot in their performances, and simply, they just aren't in top form). Instead, Page didn't just deliver a live anthology on CD, but instead, gathered up the few filmed and taped performances, transferred them to digital format and mastered them. The end result in a gorgeous package that is both pleasing to the ear and eye. The effort might have taken a year, but it is well worth the effort. The Royal Albert Hall in 1970, Earl's Court in 1975 and lastly, their last English appearance at Knebworth in 1979. The beauty of the band is that they never had few, if any bad performances. Here, Zeppelin is in excellent form at both the Royal Albert Hall and Knebworth, and everywhere in between. Most interesting in their appearance on Danish TV where they scorch the audience with a four song set. <br />This is simply a must have for any Led Zeppelin fan.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album was great. No, great doesn't suit it--superb would give it more justice. You know what every teenage girl (maybe boy, too, but I wouldn't know) feels nearly every single day of her life? Yeah, there's a song for that. It's like a recorded diary, put to music. and, you know, on every cd there's a few songs you don't really like? Practically nonexistant here. It's awesome, it's creative, it's innovative, it's refreshing, would you like me to continue with my raving about this product?
0425152251|4.0|I wish this book had been out there when I was 14. Hm. I have mixed reactions. If you're not familiar with the book, it is about a young girl who is getting mail from someone she doesn't know and the mail is basically a philosophy course. The mail challenges her to think about her own life, etc.<br />The book seems easily broken down into two parts. There are parts about what is going on with Sophie and then much of the book is the philosophy lesson in the form of the letters she's getting. The letters read somewhat like you'd expect a letter to read - it sounds like a philosophy teacher breaking down a class lesson and reformatting it from &quot;lecture&quot; mode to &quot;conversation&quot; mode. I guess because I studied philosophy, it just seems like...reading a very basic philosophy book. What puzzles me is the number of people who are willing to read some basic philosophy as long as it's couched in a storyline - even though the book goes for pages without touching on the storyline. The storyline is basically a medium through which someone can learn some basic philosophy in a written format that is colloquial instead of formal. I guess I can't help wondering, &quot;This? This is all it took for someone to read some philosophy?&quot; I mean, I guess I can see how reading about ancient philosophy might not be up everybody's alley but it strikes me as sort of funny that if you pad it with a storyline, it becomes interesting to folks. As for the story part...well, hm. The storyline doesn't seem to be the heart of the book (I suppose that might be obvious) but I do think that thus far, the characters are a little two dimensional. However! I don't think the author necessarily set out to write War and Peace here. I think the purpose was to teach philosophy and quite frankly, if the thin/flimsy storyline is enough to do that, well, he achieved his purpose. <br />The storyline does read a little like this: &quot;Sophie wanted an apple. She went to the kitchen. There wasa banana. Sophie did not want a banana, she wanted an apple.&quot;  It make me cringe a few times.  For the most part, though, if you'd like to ponder of some life's questions and have it presented in a straightforward and understandable way, this is a decent book for achieving that end.

B000089RVX|5.0|Ok, now i'd never heard of evanescense bfore i heard the single bring me to life, but thats pretty much when i became an avid fan. my god this chick can sing. im still struggling to understand the comparison reguarlly made from evanescense to linkin park though. clearly Hello (most fav. song on the track for me) isnt a typical linkin park song, at least, not the linkin park i listen to. I luv songs with depth, u know, with some kind of real meaning and of course a good beat (heavy or soft) wit great instrumentals. Guess thats why i luv this cd so much, it pretty much has it all.  <BR>I've never been really bothered to write a review bfore so this is proof as to how much i like this CD. dam its good. would strongly advise you grab it. the best songs are at the end of the album i reackon (though i luv everyone of them) so if you like the samples of the first couple, then u'll luv the rest even more!
0440418569|3.0|Philip Pullman is a good writer.  His vivid storytelling captures one's imagination.  Unfortunately in the words of poet John Ciardi \\"he sold his soul for a pot of message\\".  Much has been written about the religious or anti - religious message of Pullman's trilogy.  The problem with the book is his storytelling is forced to conform to his message.  He badly want to say something of \\"GREAT AND SIGNIFICANT MEANING\\".   But his story while told well is so convoluted, he has so many important things to comment on -  religion, God, consciousness, relationships, love and compassion - good - that he can't even remember his characters natures.  And that is the most important element in such stories.   He has too many balls in the air and can't remember how to tie them all together.  In every book the personality of Lyra and her mother Ms Coulter change, with no reason why.  Lord Asriel is noble for taking on the totalitarian Kingdom of Heaven but he is also cruel heartless and completely self absorbed.  Truly it was hard to know who to root for in the book.  To those who would compare JK Rowling and her Harry Potter series unfavorably with this series, they must have a chip on there shoulder from Rowling's popularity.  She is truly a magnificent storyteller, original where Pullman  merely tweaks convention, lucid where Pullman is convoluted and lost, a sense of humor where Pullman is so awfully serious.  And the ending - why? It just fizzles out.  All of the lead in - we are tempted with analogies to the Temptation of Eve story throughout the first two books, lead to nothing.  The only thing this book was really good for was wasting time until the new Harry Potter book comes out.
B00000I8NC|2.0|I'm sorry, but no. This music combines the pretentious attitude of Keith Jarrett with the musical inventiveness of The Backstreet Boys. You see, on this album the chords and melodies take a back-seat to volume fluctuation. Their music is extremely boring, and not because of my inability to listen to lengthy pieces of music, but for their inability to make those lengthy pieces of music interesting. Bands such as this think that they can create emotion and elevate bland, simple music to the level of greatness by adding distortion or lots of volume. They can't.
0151008116|3.0|While I can see the immense popularity of this book, it is far from the best I have read of late.  The plot often feels contrived and forced, and Martel's symbolism is far from subtle.  This usually serves to bash the reader about the head with his clunky version of truth.  Despite this, the book still proves to be fairly compelling, regardless of plot faults.  It is worth reading, but unless you have a decidedly religious mindset, the book will have no lasting value.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I saw the original play on Broadway; a review in Atlantic City, and again by a local theatre group.  Yes, I loved the play and could hardly wait for the movie - saw that 3 times also.  Now I am looking forward to getting the DVD in August.  Do I love movie musicals - oh yes!  I've seen Yankee Doodle Dandy 30 or 40 times.  My other big favorites(viewed many times each) are The Pirates of Penzance and 1776.  I never get tired of watching the great ones, and Chicago is right up there with the best.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Boy, this left me hanging.  I kept homeing something better would happen, something to build on what going to be pretty interesting if it kept up.  Jeremy Irons was very good, I liked him, but expected more.  It seemed like everyone was playing bit parts.  I have yet to read the book, but expect it is better than this.  Also, the way they made part of it sound, it was some terrible secret waiting to be explored, but I never figured it out.  What were they babbleing about?  The world may never know, because i don't think the director does.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Hmm...who would have thought it? So many people slapping around one of the truly great rock albums of all time, and yet I still have the heart to listen. Actually, Jethro Tull's critical nadir was reached during A Passion Play (one of their greatest works, by the way), so I guess I can scratch off that criticism of Heavy Horses. Rolling Stone, a most anti-Tull publication, gave HH a great review. Mojo also included it among the top-ten greatest folk albums of all time.<br />Oh, and being a Tull fan, you can probably guess that I'm not too concerned with the top ten. Actually, considering that bands like Boston and Fleetwood Mac were at their commercial peaks during this era, I consider Heavy Horses NOT reaching the top ten to be a ringing endorsement! As far as any perceived artistic fall is concerned, that is a purely subjective call. I believe that the Songs From The Wood-to-A era to be this band's greatest.<br />To call these songs \\"verbose\\" and \\"banal\\" betrays the taste of the person who uttered these comments. Apparently, this person dislikes artfully crafted lyrics (an utterly rare phenomenon in rock music), or this person believes that rock music should forever confine itself to boy-meets-girl cliches or emerging male sexuality.<br />Actually, I must admit that I found the accusation of HH being \\"pseudo-literary\\" to be hilarious. To attack admirers of Heavy Horses as \\"puerile\\" is quite harsh, but one is entitled to his or her opinion. But the analysis of the \\"Acres Wild\\" lyrics is incredibly pedantic. Anyone who bases their appreciation of poetry or prose on the literary bean-counting of an English comp class will probably end up teaching it. Have you ever read Langston Hughs or Robert Burns?<br />Some have remarked about Ian Anderson's growl. Well, Heavy Horses describes the harshness of nature; it's not about making it seem mystical or gentle. That growl aptly conveys the message of the album.<br />Anyway. Heavy Horses is truly an awesome artistic statement. This batch of latest remastered Tull classics represents the band's best work. I think it's fair to say that Heavy Horses represents Tull at their very best; Songs From The Wood & A Passion Play both tie for second.<br />\\"...And The Mouse Police...\\" has incredible charm. Ian whispers a warning to the mice of the encroaching feline gestapo. Musically, the song is impossible to fault. A tightly coiled arrangement and a paranoid ending compliment it perfectly.<br />\\"Acres Wild\\" has some incredible drumming from percussion maestro Barrie Barlow. The song itself is very sensual (despite what some may tell you). The mandolin and fiddle instrumentation accent the pronounced Scottish flavor of the piece. In fact, the whole of the Heavy Horses disc sounds very Scots-Irish.<br />\\"No Lullaby\\" is an endorsement of twitching paranoia. More incredible drumming from Barlow, and some less-than-comforting words addressed to a child remove any of the cheerful feelings fostered by Songs From The Wood. This is one of the most powerful Tull performances!<br />\\"Moths\\" describes the suicidal possibility of True Love, as the moths hover ever closer to the flaming candle. The music is so engaging, and the analogy so clever, that \\"Moths\\" is compulsively listenable. I love that song.<br />\\"Journeyman\\" features the melodic bass playing of the late John Glascock. God, what an incredible player! Ian Anderson's description of life on the go is realistic, not banal or self-indulgent (in my opinion).<br />\\"Rover\\" can either apply to a dog or a man on the run. Musically, this piece is closest to the progressive rock of an earlier Tull era. The bucolic guitar part adds a bewitching quality, though.<br />\\"One Brown Mouse\\" is probably Tull's prettiest song. Again, this lyric can apply to a mouse or a man; and incredibly charming it is, too! Musically, it reaches into the furthest reaches of Scottish folk. David Palmer's lovely pipe organ duet with the flute is incredibly appealing.<br />\\"Heavy Horses\\" is a multifaceted epic that encompasses some incredible guitar playing, hymn-like calm, a fiddled wild romp, and (yes) some great lyrics.<br />\\"Weathercock\\" is a tough little rocker, with a blistering guitar coda by Martin Barre, excellent drumming by Barlow, and some effective singing by Anderson. A great closer!<br />The bonus tracks only add to the grandeur of Heavy Horses. \\"Living In These Hard Times\\" is, once again, about the realities of life. The tune is infectious and rollicking, the lyrics dark, like so many other Tull tunes. A very appealing (and schizoid) combination! \\"Broadford Bazaar\\" is almost overwhelmingly beautiful. Why it had to wait for release until Nightcap is beyond me. Heavy Horses is, perhaps, the greatest rock album ever. Idiosyncratic it certainly is, but that is exactly what endears it to so many. Hey, give it a try. Thanks to Ian, Martin, John E, Barrie, John G and David!Heavy Horses\\" is a multifaceted epic that encompasses some incredible guitar playing, hymn-like calm, a fiddled wild romp, and (yes) some great lyrics. <br />\\"Weathercock\\" is a tough little rocker, with a blistering guitar coda by Martin Barre, excellent drumming by Barlow, and some effective singing by Anderson.

0066214122|5.0|I love to figure things out and stayed close, but crashed on a few curves.  Tracks right along, deeper and deeper into trouble.  The end ties up the beginning.  A fun read all the way through.
B000059HCN|4.0|basically it's just a \\"scared straight\\" downhill spiral nightmare about the evils of drug addiction, pumped up with great performances and hyperkinetic editing.  based on a hubert selby jr novel, but that's not a recommendation [none of his books are any good except \\"last exit to brooklyn\\"].  but the acting is mostly GREAT and it certainly makes a strong impression...  the sort of film you'll end up mentioning to your friends.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When SHREK came out in 2001, I was immediately convinced that it might be something of a breakthrough for CGI film.  While TOY STORY and the other Pixar films had been first rate and enormously entertaining, they were still primarily targeted at children.  SHREK, on the other hand, seemed clearly targeted at both an adult and child audience.  The humor appeals to kids, but has more of an adult sophistication.  It reminded me a bit of the original Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons in this way, just as the movie as a whole seems akin to their Fractured Fairy Tales.  Whether the film is a breakthrough will be determined by what comes after it, but at the very least, it indicated that CGI could be used not merely to adorn a more adult tale, as in THE LORD OF THE RINGS or THE HULK, but could be used to create the entire movie.<br />The movie contains more wonderful moments of parody than in any other animated film.  The pastiche on Robin Hood (voiced by the French actor who played the bad guy in BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF) was superb, as was the brief take off on THE MATRIX during that sequence.  And no lover of the movie BABE will miss the great moment when Shrek pets Donkey on the head and says, \\"That'll do mule, that'll do.\\"  Lord Farquaad's Dulac definitely is a parody of Disneyland, and there are scores of take offs on a variety of \\"Fairyland Creatures.\\"  The movie even ends on a parodic note, with the Gingerbread Man mimicking Tiny Tim.<br />The movie looks awesome.  I have seen parts of this film a dozen or so times by now, and no part of it fails to be an utter delight to look at.  And while the figures all move a little stiffly, their appearance is a huge leap forward for CGI animation.  My only concern is with the teeth.  Why do teeth look so odd in CGI?  I'm sure they will fix it eventually, but the teeth need to look a heck of a lot more natural than they already do.  Interestingly, the huge, exaggerated teeth of Shrek and Donkey are less of a bother than Princess Fiona.<br />In most animated films, the voices usually could be better accomplished by professional voice-over artists, or as well done by a score of other performers.  That is not the case in SHREK, and unquestionably the case for Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy.  It is not an exaggeration to assert that in both cases this is some of the best work either has done in film.  Like many fans of the film, I am delighted that all four principles.  In SHREK 4-D, a 15-minute short, Lord Farquaad returns as a ghost, which I assume will be how he will appear in the sequel.  In whatever form, his reappearance will be welcomed.  This will definitely be one of the films of 2004 that I will be looking most excitedly towards.Fiona.<br />In most animated films, the voices usually could be better accomplished by professional voice-over artists, or as well done by a score of other performers.

B00008LOS1|5.0|It's embarassing telling you how many times I've purchased this awesome title.  I'm sure I bought at least two of the good old vinyl Lp's back in the 70's and early 80's.  In the Cd age, I bought the first MCA edition which lacked a good mastering.  Around 1995, MCA released a &quot;Remastered&quot; version with bonus tracks - it was nice, the bonus tracks were cool, but there was still some annoying &quot;static&quot; in WGFA.  About a year later I purchased the &quot;GOLD&quot; MCA cd - not impressed!  Next came the Mobile Fidelity version, still had the static and sound still a little less than perfect.  <br />Well, all of those Cd's can finally go in the basement as this CD finally gets it right.  The sound is awesome, nice liner notes, bonus live CD.  I think about the only snag is that a couple of great &quot;Lifehouse&quot; tracks like &quot;Relay&quot; should have been included.  This probably could have been a 3 CD set!  Anyway, if you're undecided - GO FOR IT!  Thanks MCA, for finally getting it right!
0385504209|5.0|I had never heard of Dan Brown, but after being advised to read this book by one whose advice in such matters is usually on the mark, I shall be reading more of his works. There is simply nothing not to like and admire about this book, while remembering that it is a NOVEL which weaves facts, historical and topical, into a fascinating search for answers to many questions. I had the good fortune to read this novel while on vacation and during a rainy day and a half when I could simply settle in and let the story wash over me. If you buy only one book to read this year, you would be well advised to make this that one.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is a great set.  If these songs are what it took to win the west i dont think anyone else can ever win the  west.  The songs on here are great.  It even has the acoustic set! I didnt think Led Zep could get any better live than the are on Song Remains the Same, but this is a whole lot better.<BR>a must for any Zep fan.
6304698526|4.0|This isn't a bad movie, kind of slow in parts, but makes up for that with the awesome car chases through the streets of San Francisco.  If you like muscle cars, watch this one.
B00008PX8P|5.0|5+ hours of concert footage, interviews, promos, etc.  This is an amazing collection of Led Zeppelin material.  Best of all, the quality (both video and audio) is absolutely outstanding.  Crystal clear concert video footage from 1970 through 1979.  3 audio tracks: DTS, Dolby 5.1, or PCM Audio.  The DTS track sounds like you're sitting front row at these concerts.<br />Led Zeppelin fans must own this.  Even remote Zeppelin fans should own this.  Must have DVD for any collection.
B00005RDCA|4.0|This album was my first exposure to the Airplane and to the mid-Sixties San Francisco rock renaissance in general. It's certainly their best-known album, with the closest thing they ever had to hits in &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit.&quot; It has a passel of great songs (I'd include &quot;She Has Funny Cars&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Coming Back To Me&quot; among their best), and Marty Balin was never again so prominent (as singer and songwriter) on an Airplane album. So what's not to like? For one, the production sounds wrong to me--everything's drenched in reverb, and it waters down the power this band projected at their best. For another, it sounds like a folk-rock band in transition--not a bad thing in itself, just (again) Jorma's lead guitar and Jack's bass, especially, come through a lot louder and clearer on later albums. So by all means pick this up, but also check out &quot;After Bathing at Baxter's&quot; and &quot;Volunteers&quot; and &quot;Bless Its Pointed Little Head&quot; for a more complete picture of what this band could do.
6303314015|5.0|This has to be the most inspirational animation.  It teaches many lessons for life: have fun with life, believe in yourself, and most importantly, remember who you are.  It is a great experience just to watch it.  If you have not seen it yet, you are missing out on a lot.  Forget all those trips you have planned, because the most important thing right now is that you watch The Lion King.  I think everyone should have this experience and the knowledge that there is always someone out there who cares.
B000059HAI|5.0|This is the way that Historical Movies should be.  There is a great deal of the events that lead up to the fateful meeting at Pearl Harbor.  There is the fact that we had broken the Diplomatic codes, there is also the fact that the Japanese embassy had bad typists.  The effects aren't bad when you consider when this movie was made.  In fact, many of those effects end up reappearing in the not so good Midway movie made later.  The acting was pretty good as well.  The look on the face of the guy playing Admiral Short was classic as he looked out the window.  The guy who played Yamamoto was pretty good too, especially his line at the end of the movie.
B000002H97|3.0|It appears the boys from Metallica are Back in Black again!!  This is basically the album that started it all for these heavy-metal giants, and the results are certainly astounding!!  I remember this album being released during the heart of grunge, as it promptly kicked the butt of every single Seattle band at the time!  This is a hard-rockin' album where metal-maestro Hetfield sounds angry the whole way through!!  For true metal, this is the album to get.
B000000OE7|5.0|This CD was released on November 17, 1995; four years after the death of Freddie Mercury, the lead vocalist of QUEEN. The recording was started from the beginning of 1991, about a year before his death on November 24, 1991. The cause of his death was bronchitis complicated by AIDS. This album was made in Freddie's remaining days, and completed after his death by the other members of the band. In particular I recommend cut number 5 \\"My Life Has Been Saved\\". From his clear and gentle but vigorous voice, I could hardly believe that he ws singing in fear of his own death. His vocals really cheer me up  when I'm down. If you even feel down  you must listen to this song. I guarantee tthat Freddie's vocals will give you the power to go ahead.
B00005JLXE|5.0|A lot of people were turned off by the violent and dark demeanor of this faithful and fantastic comic book adaptation of one of Marvel's most interesting characters. A year before, millions of people worldwide embraced the film \\"Spiderman.\\" While Spidy's film was, in itself, quite good, it had a different atmosphere altogether. The mood fit the comic's style and story. Unfortunately, with a hero like Daredevil, the general 'comic fan' is unaware of the mood of the DD comics - dark, gritty, and ultimately quite realistic. I loved comics as a kid, and one of the books I had a subscription to was Daredevil. I liked the fact that although he was a good guy, he played by his own rules. DD would rather kill the bad guy than bring him into the cops like Spiderman would. This fact turned off a large number of viewers who were looking for another Spiderman-esque kid-friendly film. The sadthing is that the viewer is treated to the most faithful comic book adaptation since Tim Burton's magnificent \\"Batman\\" film. The only thing about this film that I didn't like was the choice of its villian. True Bullseye was a good choice, and Colin Farrell did the character justice, I would have rather seen the film focus on the Kingpin...or even Typhoid Mary, my personal fav DD bad guy. Regardless, the film is an amazing introduction to those unfamiliar with the DD universe(believe me there are quite a few!), and hopefully will spawn a GOOD franchise. This might be one that the kids who loved Spiderman want to stay away from - the film is dangerously close to an 'R' rating with its dark violence.
B00008PX8P|5.0|It is natural that a Led Zeppelin fanatic would love this DVD. 5.5 hours of incredibly rare concert footage, interviews, etc. If you know the words to every Zeppelin song and wore out your Zeppelin t-shirt in high school or was one of those who wrote zoso all over your notebooks, this is right up your alley. But what about the more casual fan?<BR>I, for one, for the most part have fallen into that category, the casual Zeppelin listener for some 20 years. I've always enjoyed the group's work but didn't really start to like it until long after the group's breakup. I've dabbled in Classic 60's groups (like Cream, the Jefferson Airplane, Buffalo Springfield, the Stones, etc.), pop metal (KISS, Ratt, White Lion and many others), mainstream pop, blues, even country (though not much). Through all of this, Zeppelin never made my list of top five favorite groups....<BR>Until perhaps now.<BR>A big part of my increased respect is thanks to this DVD. In short, it's fantastic. By now, you've seen the reviews of Zeppelin ''experts,'' discussing the specifics of sites and years and songs. But what will really hit the average rock and roll lover is the ENERGY throughout these concerts, the tightness of the sets. Most groups are the same or worse live; they can't help it. They're victims of the technology that helps sell them. Zeppelin, as is the case with only the very greatest, is BETTER live, often MUCH better, giving whole new meaning to classic songs in these displays.<BR>No rock and roll connisseur's library is complete without this. Slap down your [money], or whatever it takes, clear some time from your schedule and imagine almost being engrossed by the epicenter of rock and roll passion. You won't be disappointed.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Like many Buffy fans, I burned my own CD from MP3s clipped out of the musical episode before this CD came out.  At the time, I promised myself I would buy the &quot;real one&quot; when it came out, and I recently did just that.  I'm very glad I did.  This CD is great quality, and contains the complete songs without dialogue, extraneous sound effects, and other nonsense that creeps in when you try to clip songs out of the TV episode.  Moreover, some of the words were not very understandable before, but are now clear as day.  It helps that the producers have access to the original master tapes to work from, instead of trying to get the songs from the broadcast version of the show.  The quality difference is like day and night.  You won't be sorry you bought the CD.<br />Because the musical show had very little spoken dialogue, you can experience the entire episode again just by listening to the CD.  Great fun for Buffy fans -- highly recommended.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|BAGDAD CAFE is a wonderful example of how two very disparate people from different worlds can find harmony together and produce magic from their union.Jasmin, played by Marianne Sagebrecht, is a staunch, uptight German tourist who is abandoned by her equally staunch, uptight German husband in the middle of the Mojave desert.  With no possessions to her name except a suitcase of men's personal articles and a thermos of very strong coffee, she wanders aimless through the desert and happens upon the Bagdad Cafe and Motel, a dilapidated motel/cafe/gas station frequented only by an eclectic cast of locals and the odd trucker or two.The Bagdad is owned an operated by Brenda, played by CCH Pounder, an irascible African-American woman who is stressed and overwhelmed at turns by the responsibility of running the Bagdad.  When Jasmin comes for an indefinite stay, Brenda chafes at this odd foreign woman who seems to have come from nowhere.  The tension is increased when Brenda notes the unusual objects in Jasmin's suitcase, one of which happens to be a magic kit which, later in the movie, literally and figuratively brings magic to Bagdad.The women come to realize that though each is from a different world, they share common bonds: each has an apatheic, uncaring husband who has been cast aside, and each is struggling to find a niche in a seemingly uncaring world.  When they join forces, they transform the Bagdad from a dismal, lethargic desert outpost to a sparkling, enchanted oasis. The music is excellent!  I loved the haunting theme song and that enchanting piano melody (I think it's Bach?) the young boy pianist constantly played.
B00008LDPU|4.0|My video store put this out this weekend and I rented it to see if I would buy it. In the end Ive decided to pass but my wife and I did watch the whole thing including the bonuses.  To begin, although the content here does help give some of the backdrop for reloaded, only 2 of the 9 short episodes really directly pertain to the action<BR>Final Flight Of The Osiris: Tells the story of how the humans discovered the machines were drilling down.  It is fully Computer Generated, and quite realistic... much like Final Fantasy.  <BR>Kids Story: Tells the story of how a boy liberates himself from the Matrix.  This is the same kid from Reloaded who keeps thanking Neo.  It is hand drawn and has one of the coolest animation techniques you will ever see. It is one of two contributions from the director of Cowboy Bebop.<BR>2 other shorts will be quite interesting for Matrix the movie fans, these are The Second Rennaisance 1 and 2: This is a sort of history lesson on how the machines came to power. The second renaissance refers to how machines found a way to harnass the power of humans (in the first one humans learned how to use machines).  It also shows how the world was destroyed by the war between the 2 groups, and from a story stand point this is really neat stuff.<BR>The rest of the shorts take place in the matrix world but dont add a lot to your understanding, they just sort of flesh things out.<BR>Program: Its a old fashion samurai duel in a virtual training mode.  By the director of Wicked City, and Ninja Scroll.<BR>World Record: A runner who will let nothing stop him to break the world speed record, he somehow manages to break out of the matrix temporarily.<BR>Detective Story: Also directed by the Cowboy bebop creator is the second most interesting animation wise.  It does have Trinity in it, but it really adds nothing to your understanding of either the matrix or her.  Still its an interesting stand alone, and the animation is very memorable.<BR>Matriculated: Is about asmall group of humans that are reprograming machines in the \\"real world\\" to help the humans.  Its really hard to understand the story here and is probably the most high reaching, but least interesting of the bunch. Its by the creator of Aeon Flux, so that should give you some idea if youll like it.<BR>Beyond: takes place as a girl searches for her lost cat. Her and a group of children find an area that may be a \\"rip\\" in the matrix where wierd stuff happens - bottles crashing then being rejoined, levitation, etc.  Natives say the place is haunted - A neat twist, along the lines of the wearwolves and ghosts from reloaded.<BR>More importantly, and perhaps as enjoyable as the shorts themselves, the disc features a short documentary on the convergence between anime and Hollywood action movies.  Perhaps the best line is when a bemused Todd McFarlane wonders aloud, \\"Its strange how the same people who laugh about comics, Love action blockbusters.\\"<BR>In addition there are individual documentaries for each of the shorts. Hearing (or reading as the case may be) these Japanese masters talk about their craft is really inspirational and interesting.  <BR>That is why, the disc is more for Anime lovers than Matrix fans.  Of course there is no doubt there is a large overlap.  Still, the disc is probably not worth owning if the documentary features dont interest you a lot.  Id recommend a rent first.  For lovers of evangelon, bebop, akira and ninja scroll... This will be an excellent addition to your collection.<BR>In fact if you have an anime \\"collection\\" to begin with (or know someone who does), this will almost certainly be a very appreciated item.

0800141660|5.0|OK, I confess...I love costume dramas!  And boy is this a great one!<br /><br />According to the great commentary that comes along with the DVD (really illuminating;  they run the entire film with behind-the-scences comments as the film runs...very enjoyable), the movie only used two lines from the Austen novel.  Hmmm, how true to the book can this movie be?<br /><br />I don't know, and it really doesn't matter!  This movie stands well on it's own two (or more) reels.  I can't help but think that, based upon the other Austen adaptations I've seen, this is very much in the same vein.  The acting is superb, as you'd imagine, with a cast that includes Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kate Winslet, and Alan Rickman.<br /><br />This DVD is a bargain, as I've watched it three times now, and found it enjoyable and entertaining every time.  The acting is first-rate, especially Thompson's.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  This is a film I will (and have) watched over and over again.  Enjoy!
B00002R0MC|5.0|I first heard Bob Marley's music in the 80's. A firend of the family had the Legend cd. I was immediatley entranced by the upbeat happy music and the mellow voice of marley. Since then I have evolved into a huge fan of all of his music. If you are going to buy one marley album than buy this one! It includes most of his more popular songs on discs 3 and 4. The first two discs are the gem of the set though in my opinion. The acoustic medley on disc two is numbing and the first disc showcases his talents at a young age. I was fortunate to have bought the set back in 92 when it was originally released and came with a booklet of song descriptions as well as a brief history of Marley. Although this set does not contain the book it is still a must have for the music content alone. Wether you're an avid fan or a casual listener this cd is a must have. It is over 4 hours of great music. I guarantee that anyone who buys this album will fall in love with it.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|At this writing, there are 162 reviews of this movie.  I liked it very much, but I'm going to comment only upon the uneven reviews that Amanda Root got in playing the lead role.    I think she's great in the role.  Personally, I don't think the beautiful Emma Thompson (in Sense and Sensibility) is really representative of the women of Jane Austen's time.  Amanda Root is.    Let's face facts.  Emma Thompson is a modern woman, forthright and forward.  Amanda Root in Persuasion is much more of a 'mouseburger', which I just can't help but believe is more true to the times.  She's passive, she's not showy, she's not pushy, she's not a 21st century feminist.  And that's all to the good...much more believable.    I really liked this production, especially Ms. Root's performance.  She really makes one sympathize with a woman of that time, whose future life depended almost entirely upon whom she married.  Women who didn't marry well, and early, didn't stand much of a chance.  She would have be dependent upon her relatives for the rest of her life, and would have been the lowest ranking member of the family.  Ms. Root played the fear and lost hope of a woman in her situation very well.      Highly recommended.    Update:  It's been years since I purchased this DVD, but I've watched it several times.  The reason?  The over-all excellence of the film, and (especially) Amanda Root.  Another viewer called this 'Persuasion' the best of them all, and I heartily agree.  Gosh, it is just so good.  Root is PERFECT in this role.
0380789019|4.0|Richard Mayhew, a young Scot recently moved to London, was only doing what he thought was right when he picked up literally off the street, bruised and bloody and frightened, and took her home. But his good deed gets him sucked down into London Below, which is not a nice place. That's where people live who have fallen through the cracks of society, and some of them have been down there for centuries, moving through the sewers, living in abandoned Underground stations, doing business at the Floating Market, and generally being invisible to London Above. The girl, whose name is Door, is an Opener, like all her family -- but all of them, except Door, were killed by Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, as viciously evil a pair as you'll ever find Above or Below. Door is looking for an explanation, and maybe vengenance, with the assistance of Hunter, her bodyguard, and the thoroughly dodgy Marquis de Carabas, and with Richard (who finds he also has ceased to exist in the upper world) tagging along simply because he has no choice. Gaiman is a master of odd and very original characters and slightly off-center dialogue, and his prose is a delight to read.
0425188809|5.0|The reason I am such a diehard Koontz fan is that he can take the ordinary daily routines in life and create something that will absolutely terrorize you. He does not reach into a parallel universe or develop some unimaginable creature. Instead, he uses the characters that would surround you in your daily activities. To me, that is much more terrifying that a spaceship or a genetically altered, mutant space creature. The Koontz style is total psychological terror instead of slice N dice, blood and gore.<br />I have most of Koontz' books and have yet to be disappointed by one. They are all stories that I enjoy reading over and over. It seems that I pick up different details with each reading. <br />Get this book and see what I mean. It will make you look over your shoulder! Before you see the movie, read the book. It will make you enjoy the movie much more. I am glad to see movies from the Koontz books. Check out \\"Sole Survivor.\\"
0688163173|4.0|Lehane's Shutter Island, is a fast-paced thriller but not in the league with his psychological thriller, Mystic River. Nevertheless the reader is plunged into a fascinating story set at a 1954-era mental hospital for the criminally insane on a lonely island. Two U.S. marshalls have been summoned to find an escaped mental patient, Rachel Solando, who drowned her three children in a lake behind her house. Marshalls Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule start immediately to question patients and guards. They find a reluctance to help and evidence of the patients being coached on their answers. One of the patients scribbles in Daniels notebook \\"run\\" when the guards aren't looking. He also finds cryptic clues left behind by Rachel Solando and notes that he suspects involve some conspiracy about a missing patient.<br />Daniels came on this mission with an ulterior motive,to find the inmate who set fire to his apartment house that resulted in the death of his wife. He suspects the man is being housed in Ward C, a lockdown for the most dangerous patients.<br />A major hurricane hits the island and shuts down the electricity and thus all security.  Daniels find more clues about Andrew Laeddis, the suspected arsonist and possibly the missing patient.<br />A vanishing partner and no imminent escape routes from the island build suspense and keep you turning the pages.<br />The clever surprise ending will have you rereading the book to look for the now obvious (in hindsight) clues.
0679411585|5.0|Wow! What a story! This is one war story that keep you driving forward until you reach the end ... with no coffee or bathroom breaks. You just have to know what happens. In my opinion, war stories just don't get better than this! (Remember that I am a veteran of the 101st Airborne and hate nothing more than the war stories where people can run through a solid curtain of bullets and never get scratched.)
0312952813|4.0|This second in the Harry Bosch police procedural series features Bosch at work in the Hollywood divison after having been reassigned from the prestigious LAPD robbery homocide division. On call over Christmas, he hears about a murder on the police scanner in his jurisdiction and wonders why he is not called. The call involves the apparent suicide of a cop on the narcotics squad. Bosch is suspicious that all is not what it seems and when a folder from the dead cop with a note to Harry turns up, Harry takes up the quest in earnest.<br />We learn about black ice (cocaine, heroine and PCP) a designer drug originally from Hawaii but now made in Mexico and smuggled into the U.S. The intrigue involves rival drug smugglers, a mexican drug cartel made up of men who grew up in barrios (Mexican slums) and crooked cops in the U.S. and Mexico. <br />The ending is a surprise but cleverly set up so you figure it out exactly when Harry does.<br />The fans of Harry Bosch, the loner, anti-establishment cop will enjoy this episode as will those new to the Harry Bosch series.
1587990717|3.0|One of the most important lessons of Taleb's book is the importance of risk management, the ability to recognize how the market might go against your initial analysis. Poor traders, he notes \\"get married to positions,\\" are quick \\"to change their story\\" and have \\"no precise game plan [...] as to what to do in the event of losses.\\" In contrast, strong traders possess the ability to revise their opinions \\"rather rapidly, without the slightest embarrassment.&quot; Taleb's own trading style employs the use of \\"skewed bets,\\" in which he tries to profit from \\"rare events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently, but, accordingly, present a large payoff when they occur.\\"<br />Unfortunately, Taleb does not give us enough examples of such trades from his own experience--or even the experience of others--to whet our appetite on this score. Instead, we get a heavy dose of Taleb's defensiveness about how the role of chance makes certain traders less successful than others. Like many financial professionals turned writers, he also tries too hard to convince us of his erudition. Finally, the sheer number of the trading caricatures he employs becomes strident.<br />Taleb's strength, however, lies in his ability to make the discussion of randomness lucid; his discussion on skewness and asymmetry, in particular, is excellent. In this sense, Fooled by Randomness is an interesting complement to books like Burton Makiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street, which provides more better historical background on some of the manias that Taleb mentions. And in the end, Taleb offers a peace offering to those that he mocks. &quot;I am just like every single character whom I ridiculed in this book.&quot;
B000062YAZ|5.0|This CD changed the landscape when it came out.<br />Thrash/Metal had been, at that point, \\"evolving\\" into long overly complex songs with lots of guitar solos. That's not to say some of those records aren't great but when I originally got this on vinyl I couldn't believe how raw and stripped down the whole thing was. Clocking in at just over 25 minutes Reign in Blood is rage, pure and simple. <br />There's nothing subtle about this record, it's just fury. To this day there's no other record that gives me the same adrenalin hit as this! There's no selling out and playing longer/slower songs, every song is fast almost the entire way through and the lyrics are more of the same. Araya never sounded better...screaming, cursing and blasting away at subjects from organized religion, serial killing, canabalism and Auschwitz. The lyrics of this LP were so intense that there original label dropped them rather than release it...thank Rick Rubin of Def Jam for saving this masterpiece and making it available to us all.<br />The cassette was the only full length LP I had that fit the entire record on both sides of the tape.<br />In closing, this is possibly the most important record of the 80's. It sums up how I felt and changed my life (I heard this in 6th grade....) I hope you enjoy it too.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I repeatedly watched this movie as a child and saw it again recently. And, still, I believe this is the best fantasy movie ever made. As Tolkien is to fantasy books, Oz's Dark Crystal is to fantasy movies.<br />The story is that of Jen and Kira, two young heros who are the only male and female left of their kind. Jen is set with a task to battle against the odds to find a missing shard of the Dark Crystal to be placed into the crystal to make it whole again. All this, in order to restore balance to the world and allow all creatures to live in peace and harmony ever after from the magic-sucking creatures who destroy all. And of course, all of this has to be done before the three suns meet in the sky. In his journey, Jen discovers not only himself, but also meets some interesting and unsavoury characters, as well as the lovely Kira, who joins his quest. Jen needs to decide who to trust and finds himself in some very sticky situations.<br />The director on this film must have had tremendous patience and vision, since all the characters are puppets. Although initially distracting, we soon forget about the puppetry as we become caught up in the fascinating story. Ne'er have I rooted so hard for a hero. The ending is both sweet and sad at once.<br />The puppets allow a tremendous amount of creativity for developing all the different kinds of creatures, both good and evil. To some who don't like puppets, this could be kind of scary, but I find this unusual approach refreshing amidst a time when computer generated graffics are often bad and over used. The artistry of something that is created by humans is both touching and charming and has a genuine/honest feel to it.<br />A predecessor of fantasy film that has yet to be matched by its successors. Truly eloquent. Without doubt, a classic.<br />.
B00005JLRT|2.0|First, the good:<br />1. Special Effects were amazing, as always.<br />2. The acting was, for the most part, terrific.  It was good to see the cast cutting loose.  The melodrama present in the first few seasons was gone (it made a reappearance in the first TNG movie) which was also good.<br />3. The story could not fit in a single episode, unlike Generations and Insurrection, also very good.<br />Then, the bad (brace yourself for length:<br />1. Inconsistencies.  As I said, I am no fanboy, but I could pick out dozens of inconsistences.  The least of which being technology that is present in the Trek timeline, but not utilized in this movie. Convenient that the technology would have altered the present. This is lazy, lazy writing.<br />2. The villain was pointlessly evil and stupid.  A person does not rise to a position of domination over billions of people, and then gloat over a single ships destruction.  Again, lazy writing, as this EXACT SAME PREMISE is present in dozens of episodes.  Villain almost destroys Enterprise. Enterprise crew constructs plan.. you know the rest.<br />3. Troi gets weird.  She magically displays abilities far and away different than anything she has ever displayed before.  They were even conveniently made up AFTER the [stuff] hit the fan.<br />4. He looked nothing like Patrick Stewart. Lazy casting job.<br />5. Where did the Remans come from? Why is there no mention of them EVER?<br />6. The Super Ship of Death and Pain was a terrible, terrible plot device.  Come ON. Super Ship of Death and Pain is a too common a theme, why not something more sublte?<br />7. Speaking of plot devices.  The little transporter.  I didn't question it's existence.  I really, really didn't.  I am not a trek nerd, but this thing was a terrible, lame contrivance. Lazy writing, AGAIN.<br />8. Leader of Romulus? Please. A militaristic society doesn't kneel down like scared puppies like that.<br />9. Three on one and they still get the snot beaten out of them?<br />10.  The list goes on and on and on.<br />This movie is lame.  I will not get cerebral in this review.  It was simply, undeniably, agonizingly lame.  I am done with Trek movies forever.The list goes on and on and on.<br />This movie is lame.  I will not get cerebral in this review.

0312965788|5.0|&quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; is a passionate and autobiographical account by James Herriot of his early years as a vet. Recently qualified, the young Scottish James finds work in the 1930s in a remote area of the Yorkshire Dales, during a time when jobs, let alone paying jobs, are scarce. In possession of only a small suitcase, he makes his way to the middle of nowhere in Northern England, waits around for an interview with his new boss, which he lands despite having fallen asleep in the garden when his boss finally returns.<br />The eccentric Siegfried Farnon hires young James, and together they run a practice that mainly deals with cattle and farmers. Of course, being a stranger in this community is not easy, nor is it easy being a vet. Farmers have their own conclusions about cow diseases and some bizarre (non-scientific) treatments for them. It is up to James to convince them of his new found skills and to prove his worth in what is a reticent but deep down, a kind-hearted and generous community. In his job James runs across a bunch of interesting characters: his boss, Tristan who is the boss' carefree and accident-prone younger brother, farmers, a rich lady with a fat dog to whom James becomes and adopted &quot;uncle&quot;, as well as a girl or two.<br />The story is warm, funny and heartwarming. The story is not only an interesting personal story, but also fascinating from a historical and scientific point of view. And let's not forget James' relationship with all the animals. Herriot demonstrates a rare talent for telling an engrossing story.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended to audiences of all ages.<br />.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I could not wait for mail order to come in so it took me 5 stores to find the DVD...I have spent 10 hours the past few days watching in awe how mighty this band was.  I have seen numerous concert videos of other bands and nothing can compare to what these 4 men did on stage.  The sheer force and energy that came from the hands of page, jones, and bonzo is extraordinary.  Pending on what type of zep fan you are and what songs you prefer, I think any song will demonstrate what kind of performers they were.  The power numbers are great, featuring trampled under foot, nobody's fault but mine, kashmir, or achilles last stand.  The rhthym section of jones and bonham blow you away.  The bluesy nuumbers of since I've been loving you and i cant quit you baby are great as well.  The video quality can be shaky at times but hey, its old and has been lying around for years.  But the sound quality is amzazing, I dont know how they were able to pull off this kind of quality.  For the pure fan, you must listen through a home theatre system and crank the volume.  Thank you Jimmy Page for your work to put this together and allowing your fans to enter into the vision of the greatest band to ever live.
6305909326|1.0|You think Johnny Depp is going to be directed by Roman Polanski, and you get pretty excited.  Instead you get absolute drivel.  The \\"mystery\\" of the books is mildly interesting, but the rest of the story makes absolutely no sense.  Let's see now, let me get this straight; satan himself, who is sort of like a god, right?  He drew woodcuts for a paper book?  What, he was on holiday and took some art classes?  He even signs them, out of pride I suppose, it's a sin, but so are the stupid pictures.<br />But nevermind, we'll let that go, but the deal is if you put all these pictures together . . . uh, actually, it isn't really clear what happens.  One guy thinks they'll confer some sort of power on him, but of what sort isn't clear.  What are the rules anyway?  Do they have to be within so many inches of each other or something?  I think \\"Warlock\\" had this figured out much better.<br />And then you have Depp, who is supposed to be a ruthless profiteer of old books, but for most of the movie actually seems to be a decent person.  I mean, he doesn't kill anyone or anything like that.  Yet, in the end, when the last picture appears out of nowhere in a really bad plot twist, all of a sudden he's off to some castle to make a pact with the devil, or whatever  is suppose to happen; that's left unsaid, maybe because everyone just got bored and justified that a mysterious ending was sort of cool as a cop out.<br />Then's there's the nameless kung-fu fighting girl, who's role in the movie is . . . uh, who the heck is she anyway, and what side is she on?  In the end it seems she's in league with the devil, but if so, why did she help Depp thwart the bad guys?  If she knew where the last page was, why didn't she make a deal with Langella?  I think she's in the movie just to have an outdoor love scene with Depp (her name is, heh heh, \\"Emmanuelle\\").<br />Shamefully stupid, with many of the usual corny scenes that would be at home in any \\"cult\\" type movie (don't these cults ever have decent security for their gatherings?  Is it that easy to steal exotic cars in Europe?).  The only possible explanation is that Polanski and Depp were pursued by someone with big checks in hand and didn't have any other commitments.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This DVD has a terrific transfer and the audio is top-notch.  The second disc of bonus material has been done a lot better thatn the one from The Sorcer's Stone.  This time. you don't have to play the games to get teh bonus material if you don't want to.  Thank goodness!<br />Some of that bonus material is deleated scenes.  A couple of which should have been left in the film as they help to define characters and set up plot points.  They're a joy to see.<br />Also enjoyable is the interview with Chris Colombus and J.K. Rowling.  It's obvious how much they care for the characters and the wizzarding world.<br />As for the movie itself, well it's SO much better than the first one.  The kids are much more comfortable in their roles and therefore pull you in t the story that much more.  The story itself is darker than the first, dealing with a mysterious force petrifying the students and staff.  It might be too much for the youngest of children, but kids over 7 should have no problems with it.  This is one movie that will be watched over and over and over again.  Well worth the purchase price.
B00004T9UF|5.0|\\"Do you fools listen to music, or do you just skimp through it?\\"<br />Powerful words from Jay-Z on the \\"Renegades\\" track off his Blueprint LP, and never before have they been more true.<br />People dis Em because they say he complains too much and just wants people to feel sorry for him. That's not what it is. If you looked a bit deeper into the message he was trying to convey, you'd find that this album is the story of Marshall Mathers. A biography from Marshall's point of view. The first album was from Slim Shady's point of view.<br />Em speaks the anger that's on his mind. I'll bet that everybody goes through a period of anger through something way less significant than the matters that Eminem speaks of on this album.<br />This LP is nothing short of brilliant, Dre's production shines and Em has genius lyrics. If you skimp through music as the quote above states, then you will not appreciate this album as much as it deserves to be. But if you look a little deeper you'll find a masterpiece.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Great casting and especially great casting as the much underappreciated Michael Clarke Duncan makes Kingpin infinitely better than the doublewide Lex Luthor of Spider-Mans John Romita days back in the 1960s.<br />Colin Farrell is terrific as Bullseye; he knows that fans of the book, as few as there are, as well as illiterates who read less than the contents on their Happy Meal box need to see a well-rounded character. He delivers. Jennifer Garner is hot stuff. TVs ALIAS chick can kick the [stuffing] out of DD, but in this terrible, terrible condensed cream of comics, Frank Miller (who cameoed in Bullseyes bar scene) should have beaten the writers with the stupid stick; there is no character progression for Elektra at all. The character, no fault of Garners excellent look and portrayal, is cut to minutes, not years, of face time. What the [creators] at 20th Century Fox and Regency Films SHOULD have done was to develop her alias alongside of DD from minute one, but they were probably jonesin for their own cashcow like Spider-Man.<br />Alas, too many kooks spoil the sloth: lazy writing and too many whacky characters cut this down way, way too much. Superficial and with less depth than a Rolaids commercial, try as I may as an old DD reader, I didnt hate it, I was bored by it, and thats worse.<br />Ben Affleck looks the part and does a [heck] of a job as Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, but we never can figure out what exactly he can see and what he cant: in the comics, DD could read ink on a page and had sonar-like abilities. Affleck has some of that and none of the other; not his fault, just...a writing team who should have received a remedial course in writing effective narrative. There are so many... unexplained element s...of DDs life that we wonder who the nimrod was who thought that this was brilliant... and why.<br />THE CGI was dismal stuff: even a sleepy kid in the back of the theater could have caught the same Daredevil moves twice, and they pretty much [stunk]: cmon guys, not even Jackie Chan can run across buildings like that.

B00008H2LB|5.0|OK, first off any person who says these guys don't have talent are full of it.  <BR>Linkin Park blew me away with Hybrid Theory's intense, dark, and beautiful sounds and singing and I thought they good become no better then the level they had reached.  Then Meteora came out and I finally heard what they really sounded like.  While, Theory had a magic probably unequalled by many debut albums of the last 5-6 years, Meteora was Linkin Park for real.  Chester's voice was not so mechnically enhanced in this album so that his voice did not come off as totally perfect (though he does have a great voice).  My only disappointment was Mike's vocals.  In Hybrid Theory, his raps were quick-paced and full of feeling, whereas in this new disc, his vocals seem empty and slow.  All and all though this a terrific album, all nu-metal, rap-core, and rock fans should check this disc out!

0380789035|4.0|The Christian right likes to claim that theres not nearly as much God in America as there should be, and that our faithlessness is directly to blame for many, if not all, of the ills of modern society. Never mind separation of church and state, never mind freedom of speech; if only the purported Christian majority were allowed to rule, things would be much, much better. (Better for whom, they wisely decline to specify) In _American Gods_, Neil Gaiman puts it a little differently. The problem is not, and never has been, that theres not enough God in America; the problem is that there are too many gods  plural  all jostling for space, all desperately trying to gather the worshipers they need in order to survive.<br />Shadow is serving out the final days of his three-year prison sentence, counting the moments until he can return to his beloved wife Laura, get a job from his best friend Robbie, and start putting the past behind him. When hes summoned to the wardens office and told he can go free a few days early, Shadows naturally suspicious; the prison system isnt known for impulsive acts of kindness. It turns out that Lauras dead, killed in the wee hours in a car accident. No need for an autopsy, though  its quite evident what her last meal consisted of, since she died with her face in Robbies lap (the sexual act being the direct cause of the accident). So: no wife, no buddy, no job, no life. Shadows a free man, but hes far from happy.<br />On the flight home, barely able to think through the maelstrom of anger and sorrow and bile, Shadow gets a job offer from a strange man in a pale-colored suit who introduces himself as Mr. Wednesday. Shadow declines, but Wednesday persists; Shadow flees, but Wednesday follows. Hes offering a job as a sort of bodyguard or messenger  Shadow will go where Wednesday wants him to, and do as he asks. For this, hell receive five hundred dollars a week, and when Wednesdays done with him, Shadow can go free. Numb with misery and indifferent to his fate, Shadow reluctantly agrees, and drinks three glasses of mead to seal the deal. And thats when things start to get really strange.<br />America is, of course, a melting pot. And when all the immigrants over all the centuries settled here, they brought their gods with them, and anchored them to the land with belief and prayer, ritual and sacrifice. And thenthe believers died. They were succeeded by generations who dismissed the old gods as quaint, or turned them into cutesy, powerless caricatures, and finally forgot them altogether. But gods need worshipers to survive  they feed on belief, and on prayers dedicated in their names. Gods can die too, and without the support of the faithful, they simply fade away, helpless and forgotten.<br />Wednesday is a member of the old guard, and he tells Shadow that theres a war coming between the old gods and the new: snotty upstarts personifying technology, or media, who are determined to refashion America in their own image and sweep the board clear of all the doddering old-timers. Wednesdays making the rounds, ferreting out all the disappearing gods and trying to convince them to join up for one last, glorious battle. If they cant regain their old dominions and power, then at least they can go out with a bang, and take some of the obnoxious new deities along with them. As Wednesdays right-hand man, Shadow follows him through strange realms and other worlds, on a desperate scavenger hunt of the gods. But Shadow has a much bigger part to play in the upcoming struggle than he suspects, and his path will take him to places hes never dreamed of  or, more accurately, places that exist only in dreams.<br />Neil Gaiman is best known for his excellent comic book, \\"The Sandman,\\" and Gaiman fans will recognize familiar themes in this novel: the slow deaths of old gods, the blurred boundaries between reality and dreams, the idea of deities as human creations that take on independent existence but which ultimately rely on humans for survival. With an impressive and, apparently, comprehensive command of mythology, Gaiman effortlessly throws gods and goddesses into his narrative by the handful, like a master chef who doesnt bother measuring but trusts his skills to make the mixture come out right. And it does: rich, dark, and deeply mysterious, Gaimans beautifully imagined vignettes (short stand-alone chapters about ancient peoples and their gods) add touches of poignancy and, yes, humanity to the gods bombastic grandstanding. As I read, I visualized Sandman-esque art enhancing the text; this would make a friggin awesome graphic novel.<br />Surprisingly, theres quite a bit of character development, centered on the conflict between the gods and goddesses larger-than-life egos and their diminishing power and influence in the world. If anyone comes across as a little flat, its Shadow, but he has to play the straight man in order to guide us through this strange and marvelous alternate reality. Not a light read, by any means (if only because youll want to stop and enjoy the inside jokes and references Gaiman sprinkles here and there), but intriguing and compelling, American Gods is a deeply satisfying read. If you think theres not enough religion in America these days, maybe youre just not looking for the right gods.human creations that take on independent existence but which ultimately rely on humans for survival.

0767830520|2.0|I had heard for a long time that this was a good movie. So I orderded it from amazon. Now I only wish I hadn't. The first few times I tried to watch it I ended up having to turn it off and go to bed. Note: I am not someone who falls asleep at movies easily!! This movie is just so boring!!! And there really isn't much of a story line to it. It's just stupid. It has a weird ending too, where your kinda like ok what just happened? It's a waste of time. Don't see it!!!
B000002UBU|2.0|Do not get me wrong, Don Mclean can make an incredible song.  American Pie is, in fact, my favorite song of all time.  It is fantastic, a timeless masterpiece.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his album bearing the same name.  First off, the album version of American Pie is not the 8-minute version.  Instead, it is 2 minutes.  This is an outrage, without the full length, the song loses all of its magic.  Also, just about every other song is awful.  I read reviews of the album and many have said that Vincent is just as good as American Pie.  I strongly dissagree.  Vincent is possibly my least favorite song of Don's.  The lyrics make a great poem, but a [bad] song.  So, if you like American Pie, just download it, just dont waste your money on this cd.
B000005JA8|5.0|My Beefheart story goes like this. I've heard most of the bands' stuff, except for \\"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\\" which I really wish someone would remaster and release on cd, please!! I liked moments of Trout, couldn't stand moments of it, and generally thought it has its moments but I didn't get why it's seen as THE ONE. Until earlier this week.<br /> I hadn't listened to Trout Mask Replica in quite a while. I felt I was in the mood for it so I popped it in. I don't know what, why, or how something was different, but it was. Everything inside me clicked and it was just... *BAM*, revelation time!<br />I'm not sure how I can even describe it. I just have to listen to this album differently than every other recording. It wasn't even something I was really aware of until earlier this week when I felt like I somehow picked the lock that allowed me to get inside Trout Mask Replica.<br />If nothing else, what allowed me to finally unlock this album is the fact that I may hear a given album 10 times, not be blown away by it, but I'll still keep my options open towards it. Just because something didn't move me today doesn't mean it may not tomorrow, or 2 years from now. Music should be about nothing more than tapping into moods and emotions, things that change and evolve inside a person. I never felt cool or uncool about thinking this was an okay album before. That's just what I thought of it, and to me, that's all that matters. Just the same as I don't feel any more or less cool about \\"getting it\\" now.<br />What helped me sink into this album was the fact that now I kind of hear it as almost 2 different albums happening simultaneously. What I mean is, sonically, to me at least, there seems to be this crevice between the vocals and the music. That crevice is where I listen. This may make no sense at all to anyone else, but when I listen to this album from inside that spot, everything falls magically into place. I've listened to it 2 or 3 times a day everyday since it hit me, and its many highlights have blown me away every time.<br />There is no doubt that if you just pop this in as background music it will sound like people who [stink]. There is some music that can be enjoyed as background music and some that cannot. This album cannot. I'm not pulling any elitist jive here, or saying one is good and one is bad, I'm just stating the obvious.<br />This isn't backyard family barbecue rock, unless you want your family to leave.  =)<br />The one specific thing I want to comment on is the solo vocal tracks. Where some people have labeled them stupid hippie ramblings, I think they are missing what Beefheart is doing. First off, most of the solo vocal tracks are decidedly not my favorite tracks, but if you come from beyond just a rock or jazz background, the solo vocal tracks on this cd are all quite reminiscent of many of the field-recordings made in the American upland South in the first half of the 20th Century. The pre-bluegrass mountain music. Lots of stuff similar (though much older, with vastly different lyrical concerns) to this has been recorded in Appalachia, the Blue Ridge, Ozarks, etc...<br /> Beefheart was obviously familiar with these old recordings and in his own demented way, wanted to play around with that same sort of solo, disjointed, semi-tortured song form. But yes, I'll still take Vera Ward Hall, Almeda Riddle, etc...<br />For me, it's about the band. The whole. Not just the Captain.<br />In the end, words are useless. The bottomline is that, for better or for worse, if you haven't heard this album then you haven't heard any music like this before. You may kinda like it, but more likely, you will either love it or you will hate it.

0553260111|4.0|Robert Ludlum wrote this story of twists and excitement brilliantly to keep the reader wanting more.  Jason Bourne looks into the eyes of his would be killers throughout the whole book and is able to avoid death even though he doesnt know where death will be threatening from next.  Ludlum puts you inside Bournes mind as he tries to figure out where he came from and who he is.  The only thing that Bourne is sure of is that he needs to kill Carlos, the worlds greatest assassin, or be killed by him.  It becomes a battle of wits with Bourne the underdog being hunted by his own team from Treadstone.  Ludlum did a great job writing this book.  He kept me guessing until the very end (even then I wasnt sure).  I just wish the movie were more like the novel.
0780626966|3.0|I'm a big Fred Krueger fan, been once since I was like two, and trust me: This DVD has a lot, but it's missing so much more. Sure, you get the 3-d Sequence in Freddy's Dead (complete with 3-d glasses), a whole DVD full of cool as hell stuff to watch, even commentary on two films... but with the good comes the bad: All of the movies are cut. Majorly. Its a ploy from New Line and if you're a big Freddy fan like me you'll fall for it. For one, after each film in the Box Set, you get a nice featurette on that film. These were SUPPOSED to be included on the Encyclopedia DVD. Must have slipped New Line's mind, because they aren't. Other footage SUPPOSED to be on VHS is on the DVD, from the same interviews. Also, the films themselves are cut. Nightmare 5 is missing 50 seconds at least of footage that was cut! I compared my DVD copy to my VHS copy when I noticed a VERY important scene was cut that relates to another during the movie and cutting it screwed the movie up! Yeah, the DVD contains all sorts of cool stuff, blah blah blah, but there is still too much missing. If I were New Line, I would release a DVD (or two) that contained everything about Freddy just on its own, with adpatations from the book \\"The Nightmare Never Ends,\\" but that will never happen. The films are high quality, but there is just so much removed... if none of it was removed, this would be the best and the only, your number 1 source for all things Fred. But when so much from him is missing... I wonder if Robert Englund knows about this... or Wes Craven for that matter...
0151006903|5.0|Of the three novels of his that I've read, Eco does his best work in Baudolino. While building on the themes common in both The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, the peculiar mix of mythology, history, and imagination in Baudolino is quite original. And quite unlike The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, perhaps because of the length of time we follow our hero, we feel a closer connection to the protagonist, even though he is a rather Machiavellian schemer.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina shows in this CD her great talent! She really matured, not like Britney!! Singles off this album are 'Dirrty' feat. Redman, 'Beautiful', 'Fighter' and 'Can't Hold Us Down' feat. Lil' Kim. I hope there is more to come.<BR>My favourite Songs:<BR>#1 'Soar' - inspiritual song, wonderful sound<br />#2 'Infatuation' - latin-style song<br />#3 'Dirrty' - a party song<br />#4 'The Voice Within' - nice song<br />#5 'Cruz' - song about leaving home (or someting else)<br />I don't really like 'Make Over', 'Walk Away', 'Get Mine Get Yours' and 'Impossible', but there is no bad song on this CD!!!
0385507755|4.0|Few books that I've read have left me reeling the way that this first work from James Frey did. I honestly went back and reread parts of it almost immediately after finishing it. It's a brutally honest look at life and the good and evil inside of all of us.<br />This man is going places. And even if he never writes another book, he has secured his place in American literary history.
B000089RVX|1.0|What the bloody [heck] is this..., i bought this CD because so many people it was \\"great\\" and \\"awsome\\", i must be one of the few people with Decent taste in Music.  This \\"band\\" has a terrible recipe for success, which surprisngly works, take Linkin Park's music (only water them down alot first), add a dash of pseudo-religious lyrics... and a lack-luster female vocalist, and a heavy helping of TRL, MTV, and Corprate over production, place all in a blender, put it on high and pour out the concoxtion to waiting 15 year old girls who like to pretend to be sad because it's cool.  ...i'd rather listen to a John Denver Album than this piece of utter tripe, not worth your...money.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck makes you happy to be sad. The intense feeling is phenomenal. It's easily identifiable as Beck, yet it is almost impossible to comprehend the fact that this is coming from the man who once sang, &quot;I got a parking violation and a maggot on my sleeve.&quot;<br />Times change.<br />Oh, and if you didn't catch Beck's solo appearances singing &quot;Lost Cause&quot; with just his voice and an acoustic guitar, you missed out.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I WASN'T EXPECTIING THIS DVD SO SOON. I DIDN'T THINK THE BAND HAD SO MANY QUALITY SHOW TO MAKE THIS DVD. BUT IT'S WAS A SURPRISE TO SEE THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE AND SOUND ON THOSE 4 SHOWS. IT'S A LITTLE BIT DARK ON THE FIRST CONCERT IN LONDON, BUT IT'S IMPROVING WITH THE OTHERS SHOWS. THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL FROM THE MADISON SQUARE GARDEN SHOW IS VERY GOOD. BUT THE MAIN ATTRACTION IS THE SHOWS THAT INCLUDE SOME PHYSICAL GRAFFITI SONGS.I GIVE 5 STARS BECAUSE OF THE QUANTITY OF MATERIAL HERE DESPITE THE INCONSISTY OF THE QUALITY SOMETIMES(MAINLY IN THE EXTRA FEATURES). A MUST FOR LED ZEPPELIN FANS AND FOR THOSE WHO WANTS TO DISCOVER ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCKN' ROLL BAND.
6305313687|5.0|This is the quintessential movie about race relations in the United States. A stark portrayal of neo-nazism in the United States, American History X is the tale of the young Derek Vinyard and the transformation he undergoes, as he realizes that a life revolving around hatred of others just isn't worth it. What sets this movie apart is its ability to give the audience a critical insight into the thought process of white supremacists. It doesn't justify their behavior, but it rationalizes their thinking and makes the audience understand where they are coming from. This movie is almost entirely devoid of subplots. There is no hidden message or underlying theme. It is amazing that a movie so simplistic can have such a powerful emotional effect.
6305165912|5.0|This is one of those movies where you own the DVD and have watched it 10 times, but when it comes on cable you can't turn it off. Almost every actor in this Cohen Brothers' masterpiece turns in a character acting performance that is absolutely stunning. John Goodman steals the show as a violent, overweight Vietnam veteran who can't control his anger at bowling tournaments. Julianne \\"Before I was famous\\" Moore plays an offkey role as an eccentric, butch haircut feminist. John Turturro plays a child molesting bowler named Jesus who even John Goodman doesn't want to get near. Jeff Bridges is bland but brilliant.<br />The movie meshes from scene to scene with effortless cinematography that could only be drafted from the minds of Joel and Ethan Cohen. The dream sequences are absolutely over the top, and the dialogue is brilliant in its simplicity. Score one for \\"The Dude\\" this move definitely prevails. One of my top 10 of all time.
B00000J7JO|4.0|ok first off, this cd is worth buying for 3 songs, scar tissue, otherside, and californication, those songs are great, but its like they half assed the rest of the cd, anywayz i would recommend this cd if u like the &quot;softer&quot; side of rock.
B00000FBRE|5.0|If you are into the whole fat wreck chords genre of music , this album is a must have. Every song is a melodic pop punk explosion full of lightning fast drum lines and stops as clean as they come. The precision lead guitar work is complemented by timely vocals that actually say something ! Lagwagon wasn't always as tight as they are on this album, but this is the best display of their raw talent to date. What happened to these guys? I took them for granted when they were on &quot;the scene&quot; but looking back they have great music that doesn't lose its power when the drumlines approach breakneck speed.
B00005JKOI|4.0|Ah, this is part of my lovely guilty pleasure group of 80s/Brat Pack movies. A little John Hughes is wonderful sometimes and makes for a great movie night... On to the review:<br />I really, really want to give this 5 stars, but can't bring myself to do it. The plot is just too off for me. The whole rich/poor thing is an odd premise, and he asks her to prom after one date? Plus, the predictability of it all is so sickening. And Duckie... my poor poor Duckie.<br />The acting in this movie is great for the most part. The supporting cast especially. Jon Cryer and Annie Potts made this movie. And if only James Spader didnt look 30, I would say he was perfectly cast as well. Ringwald and McCarthy did alright with their parts, not great, but not badly either. I also thought this script lacked something other John Hughes movies seemed to have. It just didnt grasp me as much. Basically, this is a good movie to watch on a movie night with the girls.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is Prince's jazz and funk album. jazz-funk extended jams all over the place, this really shows how he can change into different music anded with the funk that he's been using for years.Cluttering this music with religion.what's also so different isthe spoken word,in the beginning i might had not totally liked it but i didn't care since it was what he did i just listened.If anybody likes jazz and funk it's worth buying.<BR>this is the first time he's done this.Even giutars are used,in one area it reminds me of when he used it on \\"lets go crazy\\" from \\"Purple rain\\".i was even starting to like it cause of its mix and religious topic.I recommend this Cd....
B00005JLK1|3.0|This movie was really cool, until the ... end. It is spooky and freaky but it needed a new end. Because the Ghost!!! is like Jason and cant die. I give 2 stars just because of the beginning kills.
0312265859|3.0|I've recently discovered this series and have read books 1-8 in a matter of days. First off, the series itself is EXCELLENT. Fresh and inventive, and outrageously funny. However, Hard Eight was a bit of a disappointment. <br />Mrs. Evanovich, some things for you to consider:<BR>Enough with the cars blowing up. We get it. Let's not go overboard and beat a dead horse.<br />Characters need to grow. Grandma needs a steady boyfriend. Lula needs to start working full time as a bond enforcer ON HER OWN, not just as Steph's wacky sidekick. Morelli needs to find a new girlfriend, if only to realize it's Steph that he truly loves. Steph needs space to become independent. Ranger needs more than a 2 paragraph resolution on the sex issue. We need to see the BatCave. Put a blindfold on Steph to get here there if you have to, but we need to know more about Ranger!<br />And as for our heroine. First, she needs to practice with the gun more. For someone who is very smart, she occasionally acts very stupidly when she forgets to bring or won't use her gun. Plus, she needs to take some damn self defense courses. It wouldn't hurt to see Steph kicking some butt once in a while.
0780631684|4.0|This Movie is Scary and Surprising at most moments. It is a little bloody and frightning. I much recemend it over FD2, that one has no plot at all. Just Killing, even this one mostly has just killing but it is an awesome buy.
B00007L4MJ|3.0|If key scenes from the only extant copy of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; were destroyed, would the restorers have the presence of mind and the personal integrity to re-create the original without diluting it by adding their own personal &quot;stamp&quot; on the restored version?<br />This is basically the dilemma that presents itself to anyone who attempts to re-create METROPOLIS.<br />The &quot;Restored Authorized Edition&quot; is the umteenth release of a &quot;version&quot; of Thea von Harbou's and Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS. And, again it's a not the &quot;original&quot; release. It's someone else's idea (in this case Enno Patalas's) of what METROPOLIS was supposed to look and sound like in 1926/7. Still, the Patalas' version-- in stark contrast to other famous re-releases such as the Giorgio Moroder version released in the 1980's-- actually shows a more faithful adherence to the von Harbou/Lang vision and offers the viewer a closer approximation to what they intended. In comparison to the Patalas release, Moroder's version is nothing more than historically anecdotal. The color tinting and the grotesque, &quot;modern&quot; soundtrack Moroder added were totally inappropriate. Thankfully, the Patalas release avoids such self-aggrandizing vanities. On the very big plus side, the Patalas version uses the original Huppertz soundtrack.<br />Did these restorers have the presence of mind and the personal integrity to re-create METROPOLIS without diluting it, adding their own personal &quot;stamp&quot; on the restored version? Sadly no. Perhaps, someday someone will. Until then this is an enjoyable alternative. The process of &quot;restoration&quot; and transfer to DVD are not without their flaws, but given the fact that the orginial is nearly 80 years old, the copy is clean, crisp, and worthy of kudos.
B0000399WI|5.0|Shawshank Redemption is a movie that stands out amoung most movies.  A quiet man, wrongfully convicted of murder, a \\"hardened criminal\\".  Unlikely pairing for friends, in a place like Shawshank Prision, yet this is what the movie is ultimetly about.<br />Tim Robbins plays the quiet banker, wrongfully imprisoned for killing his wife and lover.  He is brutilized his first few years in prison, but then little by little he earns the respect of fellow inmates and guards by showing them some of his hidden talents, particularly in finiance.  <br />Morgan Freeman is the natural choice for the hardened criminal who befriends Andy.  Morgan's character Red is a savvy businessman in his own way, and part of what keeps him alive and respected in prison.<br />The movie is quite long, but you will be ingrossed in the movie and never realize it.  Every scene is well worth the time to watch.  The music more than fits the movie.  This Oscar nominated movie is defintly one to add to your collection.<br />It's a bit unusual considering it's a Stephen King movie, yet it's my personal favorite of all movies based on Stephen King's writings.  Take the time to watch it. You won't be sorry you did.
0060989157|5.0|Whether you are a fan or not, this book is awesome.  I couldn't put it down, and my sister, who was never a fan, even felt the same way.  This band practically invented \\"sex, drugs and rock and roll\\" and told us what it was like on the inside.  It was brilliantly written!  It will have you laughing out loud and even crying.  Highly recommended reading.
B00007G207|5.0|In spite of some extra scenes that I think are unnecessary, this extended new version of &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; stills makes a great impression on me.  This Italian masterpiece about the growth of a Sicilian kid (Salvatore Cascio, in a brilliant debut) from childhood, adolescence (in the person of Marco Leonardi), to manhood (in the shape of French actor Jacques Perrin) through movies is marvelous, touching, and truly entertaining.<br />When I first saw &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; back in 1990, I fell in love instantly with it, thus becoming one of my favorite movies.  The innocence of Toto as he wants to learn how to handle a projector, thanks to the help of Alfredo (French acting legend Philippe Noiret); the tough times in his adolescence, working as a projectionist, having an impossible romance with Elena, doing military service; and his loneliness as a movie producer in his adulthood.  Everything caused me a great impact, and still does everytime I watch this film by Giuseppe Tornatore.<br />Now, in this extended version, I like the fact that Toto -as an adult -has the chance to see Elena again and discovers why they failed to meet at the Paradiso prior to his departure for Rome.  In my opinion, that's the most important new scene of the movie.  I really wanted to know that, and now I feel satisfied.<br />All in all, I still like this great work of love everytime I see it.  A work of love towards life, innocence, romance and, above all else, movies.  A great homage to cinema.
630024797X|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in over 10 years, but it came up over dinner last night and I came in search of the DVD ... why oh why has this not been released yet?!  <br />Even after 10 years, I can remember the movie vividly.  It's brilliant. The scene with the two-way mirror is perhaps the most riveting and emotionally draining scenes ever made.  The unfolding story in that scene is made utterly believable and totally absorbing.  <br />The movie avoids cliches and easy answers. The father is obviously not your average well-balanced guy (he did, after all, put cow-bells on Nastassia's leg so he could catch her sneaking out at night!).  His brother's family are rightly anguished at the thought of losing the child they raised for several years. And Nastassia - is she really fit to raise that wonderful little boy?!<br />And the crazy guy on the freeway overpass - what a memorable scene! Altogether, the music, cinematography, story and acting come together to create a phenomenal movie ... please get it out on DVD soon!
B00006G8HX|4.0|I have to admit that Leonard Nimoy's directorial debut left me a bit impressed.  Especially when he handled the stealing of the 'Enterprise' scene in a very exciting, capable, and funny way.  However, as soon as Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and company embarks on a voyage towards the Genesis planet to look for Spock's body, the movie starts losing its pace.  Although, there is a moment of excitement when our heroes confront a Klingon Bird Of Prey, concluding with the destruction of the 'Enterprise' -a moment that I consider the saddest after Spock's death at the end of \\"Star Trek II-The Wrath Of Khan\\".<br />\\"Star Trek III-The Search For Spock\\" is a fine film, as well as an OK debut of Nimoy as a director, but I think this movie should have needed a bit more energy.  But then, this collector's edition has a very interesting number of documentaries -the one about the visual effects is my favorite -that makes this movie a nice pick to any DVD collection.
B00008BRB5|5.0|They had done it. With their fifth album, &quot;Synchronicity&quot;, The Police had ascended the pop pantheon and taken over the world.<BR>The 1983 album was number one for over four months...late summer, fall and early winter.<BR>With each record, they got better, with nary a misstep. Although Sting WAS starting to hog the spotlight, you have to admit a few things.<BR>A) He was one of the best pure pop songwriters since Lennon and McCartney<BR>B) He had a voice unlike no one else on the radio<BR>C) He had matinee-idol looks<br />He was becoming a rock god. Andy and Stewart, giants in their own way, were left behind. (However, Sting alone was never better than Sting with these guys...)<br />So here you have their masterpiece. Song after song of provocative, driving, melodic, interesting, thoughtful and often surprising music.<BR>I say surprising because when they dropped &quot;Mother&quot; in the mix, they must have known it would make initial listeners say, &quot;What the...?&quot;<BR>It seems Sting can toss off one song per album that impossibly becomes a classic the day it's released. First &quot;Roxanne&quot;, then &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot;, &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic.&quot; Five in a row now, with &quot;Every Breath You Take.&quot; Not the love song people think, it's actually a fairly sinister meditation on obsession, but breathtaking in it's elegance and simplicity.<BR>Oh heck, realistically I could spew 1000 words on each tune on the album...it's probably the &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot; of my narrowly defined era...but it's a classic album that has held up over 20 years.<BR>Before you knew it, they were gone...dissolved. Yeah they all went on and did stuff, but they quit at their peak, and in retrospect that's a pretty cool, classy thing to do. No one will ever say they overstayed their welcome, and millions of us still wish for more...

IT JUST AMAZES ME HOW SILLS AND CALLAS FANS ALWAYS TRY TO PUT DOWN SUTHERLAND BECAUSE OF SUTHERLAND'S OBVIOUS GREATNESS.<br />YES, SILLS HAS A GREAT VOICE, BUT SHE CAN'T TOUCH SUTHERLAND AS TURANDOT OR ANY OTHER ROLE.<br />YES, CALLAS WAS A GREAT ACTRESS, BUT SHE CAN'T TOUCH SUTHERLAND AS TURANDOT EITHER.<br />THE ONLY DIVA WHO CAN MATCH SUTHERLAND AS TURANDOT ON CD IS BIRGIT NILSSON. THAT IS THE TRUTH, AND THAT'S FINAL!<br />NOW LET'S STOP THE CHILDISHNESS AND DISCUSS PUCCINI'S TURANDOT!
B00008BRDX|4.0|After &quot;Outlandos&quot;, The Police craft another outstanding album in &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;. <BR>You can check out my review of that first album, and know that this is no way will be an objective review, as The Police, in their day, were my Beatles. For a few years there, they were the greatest band that ever was. Ah, the folly of youth.<BR>Still, to this day, I will argue that they're one of the great ones, and this album goes a long way to prove that. Moving up from their primitive punky beginnings, there are a half-dozen tracks here bursting with newfound polish and maturity.<BR>In &quot;Message In a Bottle&quot;, they once again (after &quot;Roxanne&quot;) have created a song for the ages...an instant classic. You hear it once, you never forget it. They discover how to slow down the tempo while maintaining a sense of urgency in the twins, &quot;Walking On The Moon&quot; and &quot;The Bed's Too Big Without You.&quot;<BR>A few tracks pale in comparison (like &quot;Contact&quot;), but the breakneck rush of &quot;No Time This Time&quot; and the humor of &quot;On Any Other Day&quot; fill out a surprisingly strong album.<BR>One small step for the Police, one giant step towards the Hall of Fame.
B000083E79|5.0|Cher is simply one of the best parts of American culture today, yesterday, and tomorrow. From her songs from the 60's, her very first hit \\"All I Really Want To Do\\" to \\"gypsies tramps and thieves\\" to \\"I've got you babe to the modern hits.<br />She can play country and wear a soft country outfit, she can wear bell bottoms, (after all she created them it seems) and then she can go to tatoos and hard rock and leather. Cher has been a part of my life my entire life. Don't miss her farewell tour, you can also see it on VH1. It is simply spectacular. \\"Follow this you ...\\" she says with a cute grin on her face!
0156027321|4.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is a story of survival against the odds, but two things make it stand out from the typical castaway tale. Firstly, the odds are particularly heavily weighted against the castaway, and secondly, the castaway himself, a boy of 16, is brimming with religious faith. The hero of the story, Pi Patel, practices a mixture of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, and his unorthodox religious views condemn him to an inward solitude in his native India. In a way, then, the loneliness of the ocean, for all its misery, is a natural sphere for Pi. During his odyssey, Pi's battle to retain his life and humanity nearly dehumanises him, but his faith and his companion the tiger keep his spirits up. Occasionally, the descriptions of solitary life on the sea drag a little, but overall this story will probably not fail to draw you in.
B000002IJL|5.0|Since I say the stand by me soundtrack is as good as the movie you realize there's just a word that can define it: perfect. The songs aren't just good, they're so amazing that they're visible. The images from the movie go into your head as you listen to the music and bring back all the emotions you felt while watching it. The 50's tracks are very well chosen and fit the perfection of a timeless movie.
B00007ELEL|1.0|This movie is Terrible. I am not sure which one stinks most, Murphys' &quot;Holy man&quot;, this movie or &quot;Manhattan&quot; by Woody Allen. These kind of movies should be label &quot;sleeping movies&quot;

B0000035E7|5.0|Nirvana's 1989 debut, BLEACH, cost only $600 to make, and they recorded it in less than a week. The cost of the production shows, since they recorded it in a cheap studio in Seattle, but Jack Endino did try to make the album sound good, which it does for the most part. The sound is sludy in parts, but a lot of the songs sound incredibly raw, like the bitter \\"Scoff,\\" \\"Big Cheese,\\" and the REM-influenced love ballad \\"About a Girl.\\" <br />The only downside to this album is the drumming, provided here by Chad Channing, who would later be replaced by the excellent and proficient Dave Grohl. He gets the job done and he does it adequately, but his drumming style does not fit w/ Kurt Cobain's vocals and guitar playing, a void that would be filled when Grohl joined the band a year after BLEACH's release. Even Dale Crover (Melvins drummer), who played on \\"Floyd the Barber,\\" \\"Downer,\\" and the suburban nightmare \\"Paper Cuts,\\" gives the band's sound more justice than Channing.<br />This was Nirvana in their primitive form and was a sign of later triumphs. It contains some of the band's greatest songs, like \\"Negative Creep,\\" and the underrated \\"Sifting.\\" Lyrically, it might be one of their best lyrics, and musically, their abrasive tones and melodic senses can be traced easily. Pick BLEACH up crank it and enjoy it.
B000002LCX|5.0|Having been cheap and only owned the singles, I let down my guard and bought \\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\" on the basis of \\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me.\\"  What a wonderful surprise!  This album is the best Smiths album, without question.<br />Every song is a gem, rendering timeless melancholy.  Signs of the band's final days are looming throughout the mix, particularly in the cacophonous opening of \\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\\" and \\"Paint a Vulgar Picture,\\" in which Morrissey reveals that the perils of the record industry were present in 1987 as well.<br />What is astonishing about the album is that it manages to convey its messages fully in the concise 37 minutes of the album.  All ten songs are drawn out well, and the listener is left wondering how they could have accomplished so much in a small amount of time.<br />A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Ours- 10/10<BR>I Started Something I Couldn't Finish- 9/10<BR>Death of a Disco Dancer- 10/10<br />Girlfriend in a Coma- 10/10<BR>Stop Me If You Think That You've Heard This One Before- 9/10<BR>Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me- 10/10 (their best yet)<BR>Unhappy Birthday- 9/10<BR>Paint a Vulgar Picture- 9/10<BR>Death At One's Elbow- 8/10<BR>I Won't Share You- 10/10<br />I am not a Smiths sycophant and was indeed a hard sell, believing they couldn't live up to their contemporary rivals, The Cure, New Order and Depeche Mode.  However, this album made me a believer.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Can THIS FILM GET A RATING OF MINUS 5 STARS? cause it deserves it! I watched this film as it was soooo highly rated! What a joke! This movie was a way for men to keep a little porn around the house and callin' it an \\"artistic masterpiece\\". If I wanted to watch porn---I'd rent one!...I dont care if its producers wanted it RAW, we arent so stupid we have to be literally shown EVERYTHING. WE GOT THE POINT without it. And if you like happy endings...... skip this flick.....This is more like an educational say no to drugs film than a masterpiece meant to entertain---and isnt that why we watch movies? To be entertained and be removed from the headaches of daily life? This is NOT IT!
B000002KY8|5.0|\\"1999\\" was incredibly relevant at the time and its messages loom large today as well. In 1982, the world was in a mess. AIDS was festering in Africa. The Soviet Union and the USA were entrenched in the frigid Cold War. The tension in the Middle East was augmented. The world's economy experienced an enormous crash, rendering several countries in South America and Africa paupers in the world market (many of which have not recovered). Who wasn't worried about the troubled times? \\"1999\\" tunes in perfectly to those fears. The title track is a viciously funky premonition of not only the current state of affairs, but things to come. Prince really tapped into his view of the future with this album. The foreboding messages of the title track are echoed in future classics like \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" and \\"Crystal Ball,\\" but none are as timely nor as timeless as \\"1999,\\" which is funny as \\"1999\\" is tied to a specific date.<br />\\"1999\\" also reigns supreme due to its paradoxes. Whether it be Prince clamoring, \\"I'm in love with God, he's the only way\\" in juxtaposition with the single dirtiest line in a top 10 record on \\"Let's Pretend We're Married,\\" the dedication of a sexual thrust to \\"love without sex\\" in the midst of the passion of \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" or the sonic paradox of \\"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute),\\" a song literally being torn apart by the opposing forces of order in the form of the computerized synth and turbulence in the passion of Prince's guttural screams and the beat which is systematically chaotic, Prince was clearly functioning on a new level with this album, not just personally, but in music as a whole. Nothing previous to this had been as irreverent as \\"Let's Pretend We're Married,\\" only to turn a complete 180 and declare love of God. Nothing prior to this had seen a song effortlessly blend the primitive outburst of screaming and the forward-looking sound of \\"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute).\\" What was this guy thinking?<br />\\"1999\\" also earns the award because it breaks so many formats. The smash singles are all placed at the beginning of the album, after which it meanders into much darker, experimental territory. The outburst of raging, swaggering funk in \\"Let's Pretend We're Married,\\" \\"DMSR,\\" \\"Automatic,\\" \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" and \\"All the Critics Love U in New York\\" are stunning not because they are so drawn out (all but \\"All the Critics\\" are over 7 minutes in length), but because they still seem concise. Not a beat was misused, not a measure was misplaced. Speaking of \\"All the Critics Love U in New York,\\" this song stands out not only as the most experimental song in Prince's career, but among the most experimental music of the modern era. Supremely funky, Prince turns a swipe at critics and hippies alike into a nasty, frenetic, rhythmic explosion over seemingly disinterested, lazy half-rapping.<br />\\"1999\\" has a distinct sound. The entire album is tied together by a common sound, with instantly recognizable beats, synths and attitude. Despite this bond, the songs are easily distinguishable from each other. Regardless, no song on \\"1999\\" can be mistaken for being on any other album. I believe that albums work best that stretch the palate of one sound as far as it can go. \\"1999\\" is arguably Prince's most minimalist work, employing few instruments in the mix, yet it propagates a dense fog of funk that sounds both sparse and forebodingly full. Prince pushed himself to his creative limit with this album and the outtakes most associated with it. Prince incorporates inexplicable gurgling sounds, elephant noises, soldier footsteps and city noises into the mix and they perfectly fit the scheme of the music, sounding as if they were recorded for the sole purpose of inclusion on this album. Other albums also are deeply rooted with a single sound, but none, with perhaps the exception of David Bowie's \\"Low,\\" Prince's \\"Lovesexy\\" and Bjork's \\"Vespertine,\\" involve as much creativity. \\"1999\\" is a black beacon of foreboding funk.<br />\\"1999\\" also rules the rest because it was recorded by an incredibly gifted artist on the brink of superstardom. This was the LAST music Prince recorded before becoming a bonafide mega-star. It exhibits all of the hunger, drive and determination of the first four releases, but it adds a confident swagger and a new maturity as well. This was Prince's rite of passage into manhood. Prince KNEW this music was legendary and stood out on its own. It didn't need any gimmicks- it didn't need Prince to grace the cover in some provocative pose. The music spoke for itself. Anything recorded after \\"1999\\" was created by someone who was already a household name. \\"1999\\" came from a relative unknown, making it all the more surprising.<br />Lastly, \\"1999\\" is so stunning because it is entirely the work of one man. Certainly, studio engineers were involved in the mix. Prince even includes \\"the Revolution\\" for the first time on this album. However, Dez Dickerson's influence is nowhere on this record. It's not Matt Fink's vision. This album is 100% Prince himself. Not only does Prince unveil all of his cards in this release, he turns them over in your face, making them impossible to ignore. This album is the culmination of his genius, the pinnacle of an artist whose talent is unrivaled by anyone of the modern era.<br />I rest my case.
B00005JKED|4.0|I was really surprised at how good this movie was. Itz just a real gritty cop drama with a solid story line, great acting, suspense, and the feel of a gansta movie. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because about the last 20 minutes or so it getz kinda far fetched. Itz still a great ending but itz just that the rest of the movie seemed so real and this just kinda made it feel like a regular action film. But itz such a great movie other wise that it only gets a quarter of a star taken off. BUY THIS MOVIE!

B000068PQ0|5.0|Yoshimi took a few listens to wear on me, but six months later I stilll listen to it all the time.  It's a beautiful thing to find an album that I can't seem to grow tired of--one that gets better with every listen.  It's tough to compare it with the Soft Bulletin (they are both masterpieces).  The only thing that I think can top this album musically is seeing the Lips in concert.  Now THAT is an experience I will never forget.
B000002KLP|5.0|While \\"For You\\" sounds immature and \\"Prince\\" offers a tease of things to come, Prince did not release a truly representative album until 1980's \\"Dirty Mind.\\"  <br />At the age of 22, Prince boldly went where no musician had gone before (or consequently has gone since).  An unabashed tale of exhaustive raunch, \\"Dirty Mind\\" is the album where Prince became a freak.  From the thumping bass line of the title track, Prince seduces the listener into the bonanza that follows.  \\"If you got the time,\\" Prince offers, \\"I'll give you some money to buy a dirty mind\\" in his signature falsetto.<br />What follows is the rock classic \\"When You Were Mine,\\" whose status as a gem is ascertained by its inclusion on \\"The Hits/B-Sides\\" despite not being a single.  The bizarre love triangle of the song is only a prelude to what is to follow.<br />\\"Do It All Night\\" is a straight-forward come-on, while \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" offers the album's only hint of vulnerability.<br />The second side opens with Prince's first true masterpiece, \\"Uptown.\\"  While a geographic reference, \\"Uptown\\" transcends to become an abstract utopia of sexual and racial harmony- \\"black, white, puerto rican, everybody's just a-freakin'\\" he proclaims.<br />The next two songs form the core of the controversy that surrounded the album.  Lil Kim and Foxy Brown are tame imitators of the vulgar display of sexual prowess detailed in \\"Head,\\" in which Prince coaxes a virgin on her wedding day to give him oral sex, and \\"Sister,\\" in which Prince details the fictitious libidinous accounts with his much older sister.<br />The album closes with a preview of what was to come.  \\"Partyup\\" offers social commentary which became more prevalent on \\"Controversy.\\"  It closes with a rhyme not dissimilar to the \\"People call me rude...\\" chant on \\"Controversy,\\" which offers a clue as to why the two albums are so often linked.<br />\\"Dirty Mind\\" is an uninhibited landmark of music that encapsulates the emergence of a superstar who would provide classic material for decades to come.
0945353642|5.0|One August evening, ten guests meet at a mysterious island mansion-owned by an even more mysterious Mr. Owen. They soon discover that they're not on the island for a relaxing summer holiday -- they're there to die. Each one has been accused of a murder -- a murder that couldn't be proven and prosecuted by the courts -- and Mr. Owen is taking justice into his own hands.<br />One by one, guests turn up dead -- each a carefully planned murder. After a search of the island, it's obvious that no one is hidden there -- so the murderer must be one of the guests. But which one? Is it the bitter old maid? The doctor, who could easily possess the deadly chemicals required? Mr. Lombard, who admits to bringing a revolver to the island? As guests try to protect themselves from the murderer, they're forced to decide who can be trusted -- and who can't.<br />In the six-and-a-half hours it takes to listen to this recording, you'll second-guess yourself repeatedly -- and you'll never guess the conclusion. Ten Little Indians is an excellent, captivating mystery written by an extraordinary, well-loved writer. It's hard to imagine a cheery little grandma writing about such sinister murders -- but Dame Agatha Christie did it with refined style.
0446677450|5.0|I bought this book on the assumption that Kiyosaki's real dad was &quot;poor.&quot; In fact, Kiyosaki's real father had a high income and all of the usual blessing of a rich person; big house, had a great education and so.<br />Kiyosaki's rich dad was the contrast. He made much less money than his poor dad. One difference--rich dad had more cash flow and fewer financial problems.<br />Poor dad depended on his job for income. Rich dad depended on real estate, stocks and other investments that provided a passive cash flow.<br />Some people feel that more money will solve their problems but as Kiyosaki explains, it's not how much money you have, it is how you handle it.<br />If your house is your biggest asset, you are in big trouble.<BR>If your job is your main or even worse, your only source of cash flow, you are in big trouble.<br />If you think that a college degree equals financial success and wealth, you are in big trouble.<br />Since reading RD/PD, I realized that I was like Kiyosaki's poor dad. So were the people in my family. So are my friends. But when I looked around, none were doing that well financially. So I decided to change---made some new choices.  Changed my core values towards a Rich Dad mentality.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is a excellent book that should be read by everyone who wants to reach financial success.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I thought it odd at first to anachronistically use all those modern songs and yet it works, and quite well too. It's funny, campy, romantic, dramatic, sad all rolled up into one. The extras on the DVD are nice too. This film is one of my all-time favorites, if you missed it in the theater, get it on DVD!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Zeppelin fans buy this now ! I have all the Zep Cd's but this DVD is truly a pinnacle.  My only regret as a lifelong fan is I never saw them live. This DVD almost makes up for that in some ways. The last peformance on the DVD is Knebworth, England in 1979 and the fab 4 are truly at the peak of their prowess. Pity we had to wait 24 years. Perhaps some genius at their record label will realize that many of us would also want all the material they did not use on this DVD - give us all there is !<br />5 hours of great Zeppelin.  For those who are not Zep fans - watch this to learn what rock music is really about. This truly ranks amongst the best rock music DVD's released to date.
6305308659|5.0|Pleasantville is not only a great movie, but also a great message to all who see it about the true meaning of kindness, love, and...well, pleasantness. I believe that if there were more movies like this, our world would be a much better place. Although the situation is a little fakish, the plot is incredibly smart and fresh, and I personally believe there are no better visual effects out there so far. Acting is a little stiff, but the characters are fantastic. One of the best scenes is the basketball court, when they make and then miss. A truly magical movie about the way our world should be. DVD could use a little more, however is fine the way it is, and the movie in and of itself, is nothing short of perfect, entertaining, and a gem.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Actualy, I don't know if this is any better than VDoP. But I do know that this album and VDoP are truely mustgets for any real metal fan. Even though this isn't as heavy or violent as VDoP, it still rocks. <BR>Highlights on &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, &quot;Primel Concrete Sledge&quot;, &quot;Psycho Holliday&quot;, &quot;Heresey&quot;, part of &quot;Cemitery Gates&quot;, &quot;Domination&quot;, &quot;Shatered&quot;, and &quot;The Art of Shreding&quot;.<BR>You're gonna love this!
B00005JKHN|5.0|I wish i could give this movie 10 stars. Or maybe even 1000. I first saw this movie, im sure since i was born, but the first time i remember it, was around the ages of 6-8. At first, it was the scariest movie ever lol, however at 10, i couldn't see it enough. This is the story of a beautiful youth named Aurora, who, after she is born, is put under a fatal curse that will cause her to die 16 years later, when she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel (a great, rather eerie and scary foreshadowing vision of this happening is shown during Maleficents' speech of this spell). However at the party are 3 fairies, who quickly, with good use of magic, tame the curse so she won't die, but will only be put into a deep coma-type sleep, until Prince (Prince Charming) Phillip  rescues her with fighting and the kiss of true love. A beautifully made, wondrous, dazzling, eerie, triumphant movie, perhaps Disney's greatest, that no one should miss or fail to enjoy.
B000002JOH|5.0|I've had this album for a 2 years and it still gets me on!<BR>I remember seeing \\"This Love\\" on VH1 back in August 2001, and since then I've been a real PanterA fan.<BR>Highlights on \\"Mouth for War\\", \\"A New Level\\", \\"F**king Hostile\\", \\"This Love\\", and \\"Rise\\".
B00006GEXR|5.0|This movie is a wonderful portrayal of human nature, in which a carefree and entertainingly shallow but likeable bachelor makes friends with a &quot;picked-on&quot; 12-year-old boy with a depressed mother. The details in the movie are completely clever and funny, yet the human issues in the movie add depth to the story. It's worth watching over and over again just to catch all the amusing anecdotes. The music in the movie is ideal and adds the perfect touch, turning a highly entertaining and enjoyable movie into a masterpiece. A total Must See.
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD has it all for all people. It starts off with a classic hard rock/grunge ballad &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot; followed by a pop rock &quot;in bloom&quot; and then it goes into everything from acoustic solos (&quot;Polly&quot;) to window shattering heavy metal (&quot;territorial pissings&quot;) if you own a cd player, get this album.
B000002H97|5.0|Oh my God, how can anybody slam this CD?  Yes, it is a departure from their earlier work.  Yes, the songs are shorter and more---(dramatic pause)---accessible, but why is that a bad thing?  I was a Metallica fan before the Black Album was released (I came on board with Justice)and I became an even bigger fan with this release.  This CD has so many musically great moments that I can't count them all, from the sinister opening riff of Sandman to the exotic opening of Wherever I May Roam (my favorite 'tallica song of all time, by the way) to the restrained beauty of Nothing Else Matters.  There is not one single dud on this album, pure and simple.  This was the last truly great album Metallica has made, although Load and Reload are by no means worthy of the heaps of scorn rained on them by people afraid of change.  This is the peak of creativity thus far for a band with unlimited potential (St. Anger, don't prove me wrong!)and quite possibly one of the greatest metal albums ever.
B00005JLSE|3.0|The choreography is amazing.  The casting is fifty/fifty.<br />If you know the broadway version, you will be disappointed. They remove some of my favorite songs, amputate some of the others.<br />Renee is waif thin- you can see bones on her I didn't even know existed in a human body.<br />Queen Latifa was PERFECT for her role.<br />Richard Gere as Billy Flynn?  Ummm...No.  Too Old, Can't sing, it just didn't work for me.<br />Despite that problem, if you are into dancing and choreography as I am, being brought up in stage theater, you will LOVE how they filmed Razzle Dazzle and Cell Block Tango.  I am also glad they left in Mr. Celophane, although it didn't fit in with the movie as they cut out Velma's song, I Know a Girl.<br />It's worth seeing once, but I'd have a hard time telling anyone to buy it unless they can get it for under 15 and they have a problem with late fees at the local rental place like I do.
B000002JSJ|5.0|whether you like it or not, presence is one of the best led zeppelin albums. achilles last stand - an amazing 10 minute epic song and my favorite zeppelin song. for your life - a great multilayered song. royal orleans - cool and funky. nobody's fault but mine - awesome heavy blues song. candy store rock - underrated interestingly put together song. hots on for nowhere - catchy, good led zep song. tea for one - perfect, long blues song.<BR>It's not only the content of the album that makes it one of the best, but it's also the short time that was used to write and record it. awesome album.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film functions on several levels, which adds to it's ability to convey a myriad of meanings.  With that in mind this film can be taken a couple of ways.  One way is to view it as a more intense cautionary tale of drug abuse.  On this level nothing comes close.  Take any anti-drug commercial out there and it won't hold a candle to this film.  While watching it I didn't doubt that were this film to be shown to even the worst of junkies that they would certainly wish to quit their habit.  The film is able to convey the message of drug abuse so easily due to superb imagery and an amazing soundtrack which I did not hesitate to buy. Another way to take this movie is a bit more depressing.  The whole of the movie ends on a massive down note.  It's basically a destruction of hope.  And after watching this movie it's kind of hard not to be a little depressed or at least sorry for the characters who in the end, lose it all.  And this brings me to another part of the movie which is excellent, is the ability for the actors to really draw the viewer in.  These characters make you want to feel sorry for them, and you cannot help but emote with them.  However this bond between the characters and viewer does make the end of the movie a little hard to take.<BR>I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that this movie would be very hard to watch a second time, however I do plan to do so.  Because even though the movie is more intense than anything else I've ever seen, it's also perhaps the best movie I've ever seen.  I'd recommend this movie to just about anyone above the age of 16.  The movie really makes you think, another major accomplishment of the film.  So with that I'd advise you to watch this film, you won't regret it.
B00005ATQH|4.0|There is another recent version of the Lolita story, starring Jeremy Irons. This one stars James Mason. <br />I expected a character drama, but the first minutes quickly set me straight. This is a dark comedy. With that in mind, Kubrick's version of the famous story is highly enjoyable, if somewhat ham-fisted. It is mainly a comedy about cruelty : Humbert's cruelty towards Charlotte Haze, Lolita's mother, Humbert's cruelty towards Lolita, and Lolita's cruelty towards Humber. <br />It is, of course, pathetic, and the opening scene (which chronologically is the ending) is a good display of that, as Humbert guns down a drunkard in his own house. Who that drunkard is, and why he is gunned down, is part and parcel of the whole story (albeit no one will have trouble seeing how it will all end after the first hour). <br />Charlotte Haze: Whenever you touch me, darling, I go as limp as a noodle. <BR>Humbert Humbert: Yes, I am familiar with that feeling.
B00008LDPU|5.0|All 9 episodes are of the highest quality - the animation is simply stunning and while the pace of the stories may seem a bit sluggish they are all atmospheric and totally fit in with the whole Matrix trilogy.<br />The background to the Matrix world and the whole insight into other areas or details that links the films (Final Flight of the Osiris) is amazing and helps to give a much fuller, richer environment to enjoy the whole Matrix phenomenon.

B00008VGL6|4.0|Martin L. Gore comes with this cover album recorded at Electrical Ladyboy home studio and give us the chance to explore eleven tracks from different styles. Produced by Martin's friends, Paul Freegard and Andrew Phillpott, Counterfeit II contains songs from David Essex, Nick Cave, John Lennon, Brian Eno and Lou Reed, among others. Instead of staying at home doing nothing musically, Mr. Gore reinvented these songs in a way he is only capable of doing. The highlights of the album are the  first single \\"Stardust\\", a very dark song with good arrangements. \\"Loverman\\", Nick Cave's song is a great sample of Gore's ability to put his mark in other people's songs. German fans will be pleased with \\"Das Lied Vom Einsamen Madchen\\". There is nothing more to say that: Thank you Mr. Gore. We are all waiting for Dave Gahan's new album and afterwards a new Depeche Mode album, hopefully for 2005.
B00005Y2EL|3.0|I had to write this review since the only other one rated this at two stars. This album is better than that and deserves at least 3 stars. This was a transitional album for the group for sure. It introduced Darren Wharton (Keyboards) into a permanent role with the band and without the experimentation that happened here, Thunder &amp; Lightning probably would've never existed. Yes it plays with many different styles, but it is also unmistakably Thin Lizzy. It is true that Snowy White probably wasn't the best fit for this band while he was a member, but his contributions are still noteworthy. There is no Thin Lizzy record that rates less than 3 stars during the dual guitar lineups. This CD is essential in determining where the progression to Thunder &amp; Lightning came from and is a worthy addition to any Thin Lizzy collection.

0060229357|5.0|I encountered Harold when I was very young and a copy of this book has accompanied me through years of moving around...  Recently my 5 year old insisted on having his own copy since I was always showing mine to everyone else... Harold's imagination, ingenuity and unique problem-solving skills are an inspiration. Simple, creative and extremely effective - if I were stuck on a desert island with only one book, this would definitely be it. (And I'd like a purple crayon too, please...)

B00002MZ2T|5.0|I have enjoyed Savage Garden since I first received their self-titled CD by mistake a few years ago. It was one of those 'I forgot to send the card in on time' arrivals from a CD club -- the kind of mistake that often as not yields a good surprise. This time it did, and when I learned of a follow-up album released by Savage Garden, I determined that I would not await fate and actually purposefully purchase this one. I am not sorry I did.<br />I live more than an hour away from work and school, and thus am constantly in my car. I thus have a lot of time to spend listening to music. Savage Garden's Affirmation has become a regular in my rotation of CDs for driving. Their music is generally upbeat, pop-sounding without sinking to the worse aspects of pop music, with interesting and meaningful lyrics and a variety of tempos to keep the CD interesting for the long drive.<br />The first song, Affirmation, from which the album derives its name, is essentially a creed, a wonderfully undogmatic statement of what Daniel Jones and Darren Hayes believe. Okay, so it will not replace the Nicene Creed anytime soon, but I would much rather have the youth of today singing along to this kind of music than some of the recent things that have dominated the radio airwaves.<br />Darren Hayes sings lead and background vocals for most of the songs (ain't technology grand?), and Daniel Jones plays and engineers the keyboards, synthesizers, drum machines and other rhythm instruments. Being a macintosh user, I appreciate that they use macintosh for much of their programming, too.<br />Hayes and Jones concentrate on romantic and uplifting songs. These songs are meant to highlight societal situations (to make you think) or a strong emotion (to make you feel). Very much at home in mainstream pop music, their songs nonetheless stand out as beautiful, melodious, and lyrical. From their first 'hit' from this album, the emotive poetry, expressed by Hayes high-pitched yet soul-full voice, backed up by music that gently accompanies and guides without overpowering, one can sense a great love:<br />I knew I loved you before I met you<br />I think I dreamed you into life<br />I knew I loved you before I met you<br />I have been waiting all my life<br />A song such as Crash and Burn ends up being a very different song from what it sounds from the title. Whereas one would not be surprised at an urban-influenced song with this title highlighting the violence in society, this song is instead a fairly gentle, friend-in-need song:<br />Let me be the one you call<br />If you jump I'll break your fall<br />Lift you up and fly away with you into the night<br />If you need to fall apart<br />I can mend a broken heart<br />If you need to crash then crash and burn<br />You're not alone<br />This is an album of strong sentiments, of deep feeling that shines forth in every song. They are a very welcome import from down under (Australia) and I look forward to their continuing releases.by music that gently accompanies and guides without overpowering, one can sense a great love:<br />I knew I loved you before I met you<BR>I think I dreamed you into life<BR>I knew I loved you before I met you<BR>I have been waiting all my life<br />A song such as Crash and Burn ends up being a very different song from what it sounds from the title.

B000096I9G|5.0|I have Seen the Cure live, I own many of the Cure's live VHS tapes (Show, in Orange, ect) I have all the Cure's CD's, but this DVD is Cure Perfection. Everything the band is about is caught here on DVD, filmed in High definition video and surround sound. This Concert Sounds beautiful but the film work captures the band almost as good as seeing them live, take it from me. They play their 3 darkest and richest albums live in full completion plus two encore songs. This DVD is worth every cent and more. This is a cure fans dream, and anyone else who enjoys high quality emotional, dark, music. There will never be another group like the Cure and this DVD is your chance to see them in all their glory. Enjoy Cure Fans!
B000002NHN|5.0|This is far from Loreena McKennitt's first album, but it may be her breakthrough album. In this recording she has captured a glorious cross-section of Celtic-influenced international-themed songs. The 'chart topper' on the album is 'The Mummer's Dance', ironically not in the version that was heard on most American radio stations (that is a souped-up version released on CD-single, which was also used for the theme music for a short-lived television series called 'Legacy'). This has the rhythms, instrumentation and lyric qualities one has come to associate with modern Celtic tunes (a la Enya, Marie Brennan, Clannad, etc.).<br />Other songs are modern-day retellings of folk songs: 'The Highwayman' is a decidedly anti-British-occupation song, in which the heroine sacrifices her life to save her lover who is about to be trapped -- the Celtic peoples have learned from Roman times to the present to drink deep from the cup of sorrow, and this song (among others on the album)is a generous portion for that cup.<br />My favourite song, however, must be 'Skelling' -- it conjures up visions of monastic vows and solitude, a journey into life's vocation that requires both inward and outward travel far from home, never to return, but ultimately being content and safe in the community. Sweet and melancholy, the learned monk, reminiscent of Saint Francis for his love of animals, is essentially giving his final will and testament, a most spiritual treasure beyond valuing, from someone with vows of poverty.<br />Interspersed are several instrumental interludes, with differing characters (some decidedly oriental, others western, all however bearing a strong Celtic stamp).<br />This is a perfect introduction to McKennitt's work, but do not stop there. Her previous work is well worth exploring.
1586211676|5.0|While I have long been called a bookworm, people close to me also call me a tapeworm due to the fact that when I am not reading, I am listeing to something motvational/inspiritional/educational in the form of audio tapes/cd's.This program by Robert T.

B000066HHK|5.0|This is the most amazing EP I own. It's the Hybrid Theory EP by Hybrid Theory who are now known as Linkin Park.<br />Carousel- A dark song with a solid meaning that introduces the fabulous vocals of emcee Mike Shinoda and \\"screamer\\" Chester Bennington.<br />Technique (short)- A short (very short) forty second instumental done by Mike Shinoda and DJ Joe Hahn.<br />Step Up- A fabulous piece sung by Mike Shinoda that puts down copycats and other posers who think that they're a true emcee or a real rock/rap band. This song isn't completely gone. You can hear samples of it mixed into KYUR4 TH ICH on Linkin Park's remix album Reanimation and It's Going Down on the X-Ecutioners' debut album Built From Scratch.<br />And One- My favorite track on this great work of art. It has superb guitar riffs done by Brad Delson, wonderful drum beats produced by Rob Bourden, and some of the best vocals ever done by Chester Bennington. And the song closes with a smooth and unique solo done by Mike Shinoda.<br />High Voltage- I can't believe it, but a LOT of Linkin Park fans absolutley hate all three versions of this song. They say that it's to hip-hop. But what can you expect from a rap/rock band?! Anyways, this wonderful song contains wonderful beats and bumps along with a supurb rap that's spat by, you guessed it, Mike Shinoda. The chorus is [bad], but the ending of this song has some of the best beats on this EP.<br />Part Of Me- My second favorite. The songs starts with static brewing up, followed by mild samples, a guitar riff, and drum beats. Then Mike comes in and does an angry rap followed by a heavy chorus done by Chester. And after this armfull of greatness, the song ends with a pile of static. Well, that's the last track! So long folks!<br />But wait... there's more! Fast foward Part Of Me through six minutes of static and you'll hear distant beats and sweeping sounds followed by a meloncholy sounding two and half minute instumental that later becomes Session on Linkin Parks sophmore album Meteora. <br />I give this EP a 5/5. It's a great buy and is totally worth it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I bought this two days ago and have watched it repeatedly ALL weekend. Having been disapointed by the quality of The Song Remains The Same, I was a tad worried, but that only made this even more wonderful. The performances on this disc are godlike; no other way to state it. Excellent video/audio quality, a great selection of tracks, outsanding performances, and some very good bonus material all make this a must have. Heck, I'd have spent 10 times what I did for this and not feel cheated in the least. This is no exageration, you will not be dissapointed. This makes the performance on TSRTS seem like a cover band!
B000092T6M|3.0|Costner needs a personality.  The performance is flat.<br />Now Alan Rickman, on the other hand, WOW!  Buy the DVD just to watch a real actor work (forget Costner). Rickman has long been a terrific character actor.  In Robin Hood, he really shines.  He is both funny and terrifying.  I find myself almost rooting for The Sheriff!
B00006CXXU|3.0|When my best friend was flipping out about the new Christina album, I have to admit that I rolled my eyes and profusely laughed at him.  Yes, she was a complete Britney Spears copy on her first album (I'm sorry, those of you who actually LIKED it).  When he said he was going to make me listen to the CD in the car, I was looking around the store to see if they sold earplugs.  Though after getting through the first 3 songs on the cd, I was more than surprised.  Christina has definitely changed, though not all good though.<BR>First let me start off by saying she has a powerful voice.  Songs like \\"Fighter\\", \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Walk Away\\" literally gave me chills at first listen.  Though I'm sure they'll be overplayed, as everything on the radio is, it's a good thing I don't listen to it much; I would go insane.  On the downside, she uses her powerful voice too much.  I would love to see a softer side of Christina.  <BR>OK, I have to make a point here.  I am totally for woman singing a little more freely about sex, but there is an extreme.  Songs like \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" and \\"Dirrty\\", though musically encapturing, quite frankly disgust me.  Yay for you being a woman, but please show some taste.  Sex appeal is definitely important in the music industry, but Christina can rely on her talent only and still sell albums.<BR>Overall, this is an eye opener for me.  I am impressed and somewhat disappointed in the direction Christina is moving.  I am definitely interested in seeing what growth comes out of all of this, and hopefully for the better.
0393312836|5.0|Forget that stupid, overrated movie!  This book is where it all began, and it's just as poignant now as it was when it was first published.<br />When addressing the problems of crime, evil and violence, most people (conservatives and liberals alike), would prefer the \\"pop-the-pill\\" remedy of making people conform to the standards of \\"good\\".  Unfortunately, it's not that easy, and this book proves that.  Alex, the murderous droog, is put through a program that will remove the \\"evil\\" from him.  But as we eventually see, he's worse off without the ability to choose good.  Without his free will, he has become \\"a clockwork orange\\", because he does good not because he wants to, but because he has to.  Simply brilliant!<br />One problem is the \\"Nadsat\\" dialect it's written in.  Sure, it's ingenious use of language, but it gets old fast.  It does not detract from the book, however!  But the best thing in here is the fact that Alex, who commits rape, murder, assault, and theft, is a huge fan of classical music, especially Beethoven.  That oughta show \\"in-your-face\\" to those bozos who think rock and metal cause violence.<br />Read this book: prepare to be shocked.  And enlightened!
0743244249|3.0|...actually quite an entertaining read. At twenty-eight, billionaire playboy Eric Packer reminds me of the anti-heroes of Brett Easton Ellis novels: coolly amoral he gets his comeuppance in the end. It's not much of a novel - and as for the \\"statement\\" about the shallow inanities of materialistic pursuit that Delillo seems to be making, it's all been said before - but with that said I kept turning the pages and there are a couple set pieces that, while not necessarily inspired, are well-conceived - particularly the anti-globalization riot that forms the centerpiece of the narrative and the opening pages that introduce the reader to Packer's impossibly decked-out limousine. This limo alone is worth the price of admission.<br />There's a cinematic quality to the proceedings. At times, this reads more like a screenplay than a novel. The dialogue is brisk and Mamet-esque though from time to time it comes off stilted. <br />All in all, not a bad way to knock off a few hours' reading, but don't expect to be wowed or pondering hidden depths days later.<br />I can see Christian Bale now...
B00000255F|5.0|For years I've been telling everyone that Born to Run is the most perfect rock and roll album ever made, and the most awesome driving music too.  But it had been a long time since I listened to it all the way through, so I recently took it out for a test drive on the New Jersey Turnpike.  I glanced at the impossibly young Bruce on the CD cover, popped the disc into the player, and braced myself for a flood of nostalgia - but instead heard music as compelling to me in my late 30's as it was at 15.<br /> \\"Thunder Road\\" could be the stirring climax to any other album, but here it is merely a invitation into the world of Bruce's characters on the cusp of adulthood.  Even if you're sitting at home, you will feel you are speeding down the highway with the wind in your hair - and if you are driving, you will feel like you can fly.  \\"10th Avenue Freezeout\\" and \\"Night\\" maintain the restless, relentless energy, propelling you into the breathtaking tale of love and betrayal that is \\"Backstreets.\\" CD's don't have sides, so you barely have time for an appreciative sigh before being hit with the thrilling rush of the title song.  \\"She's the One\\" sets frustrated longing to an urgent beat.  \\"Meeting Across the River\\" - a quiet vignette evoking the poignancy of innocence about to be lost - sets the stage for the epic \\"Jungleland\\" (and gives you a chance to ease off the accelerator; one hazard of driving to this album is the inevitable speeding ticket). And then it's over: not a note is wasted.  The lushly layered \\"wall of sound\\" production lends a timeless quality to the songs.  The vocal performance encompasses wordless wails of raw emotion as well as poetic lyrics that reward repeated listening.<br />If you are thinking of replacing your well-worn vinyl album, what are you waiting for?  Buy the CD and fall in love all over again.  If you are new to Bruce, start here - \\"Born to Run\\" remains the reference point for all his later work.  Whether you are in your teens and struggling to find your way in the world, or recalling those days from a comfortable distance, take \\"Born to Run\\" out for a drive on the highway.  Roll down the windows and let the wind blow back your hair... you owe it to yourself.find your way in the world, or recalling those days from a comfortable distance, take \\"Born to Run\\" out for a drive on the highway.  Roll down the windows and let the wind blow back your hair... you owe it to yourself.

B00000I8BX|5.0|This album is, without a doubt, Fear Factory's best release.  I have all of their albums, and I have long been a fan of them since the days of this album.<br />Too many so-called \\"fans\\" label this album a \\"sell-out,\\" \\"too mellow,\\" \\"not heavy enough,\\" etc.  These accusations could not be farther from the truth!  Yes, it's melodic, but that only adds to their ultimate heaviness!<br />A concept album about the fate of the earth in a very TERMINATOR-like fashion, here we are presented the story about mankind's struggle for life from the very machines he created which are now the masters.  Since the 1960's with The Who's TOMMY and others, concept albums have existed, but in the world of heavy metal, there had never been that many.  This album is one of these few and mighty.  The story is explained not only through the lyrics, but also through narrations in the liner notes and even news reports from the album's setting!  The images evoked of the dismal future are reminiscent of such apocalyptic fiction as THE TIME MACHINE, I AM LEGEND, 1984 and BRAVE NEW WORLD.<br />Now, onto the music.<br />Burton C. Bell's vocals have never been better: his mighty death metal-like roars of fury help reveal the torment of mankind's struggle against machine, and his very well-performed singing always manages to send a chill down my spine.  My favorite performance by him would have to be on \\"Smasher/Devourer,\\" when he bellows long, haunting howls of the word \\"Sal...va...tion...\\"  Supberb performance here.<br />Dino Cazares is probably the most underrated alt-metal guitarist out there; true, he never did a guitar solo in his whole time with Fear Factory (besides the fact that solos wouldn't fit their style, anyway), but just LISTEN to those riffs and crunches of pure metal fury!  And just as suddenly, he can make great, sweeping melodies--damn, this guy can PLAY!  He obviously knows his chords, and he used 7-string guitars long before the endless numetal bands of today made them a must--andfinally, except perhaps for Steven Carpenter of Deftones, how many guitarists other than Dino are out there that are overweight?  Looks do not compare to sound in music, and Dino proves it.  Go Dino!<br />Raymond Herrera is one of my drum GODS.  He is so fast and so loud and so damn heavy...I've heard some of the more demanding people on Amazon.com that play drums say that his technique is nothing complex or intricate, but like with Dino's guitar playing, this is not something Fear Factory is about--his solid, grid-like drumming neatly fits the band's technological themes and sound.  His best drum track: \\"Freedom or Fire.\\"<br />Christian Wolde-Olbers, bass master.  Again, nothing too complex is performed on the album, but with his deep, thundering bass, the sound of pure heavniess is perfected.  His best performance is on \\"Edgecrusher,\\" where he plays a standing bass solo.  So good!<br />And finally, the \\"fifth Beatle\\" of the group, Rhys Fulber.  He does most of the keyboards, samples, and effects on the majority of their albums, including this one.  He makes excellent fades and intros to songs, and it totally helps with the mood.  My favorite sampling would have to have been on \\"Securitron (Police State 2000),\\" with a feeling of a futuristic police raid going on.<br />The songs are all perfect...I really can't describe each and every one; they are just so well done.  The absolute \\"crunchiness\\" of \\"Shock,\\" the beautiful melodies of \\"Resurrection,\\" all are so good.  Just...buy this album!<br />Oh, and I am probably the only person I know that actually *likes* the bonus tracks, especially \\"Cars.\\"  They must have had fun covering this old Gary Numan song.  And he even returned the favor to them--he did the spooky, robotic voice at the beginning of the title track.  Trust me, get the digipack.  It's worth the extra money.<br />MAN IS OBSOLETE!

Every song on this album is a true work of art, drawing up every emotion possible. <BR> <BR>The fun &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; and &quot;I Miss You&quot; to angry &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;Enjoy&quot;.  Though perhaps where she shines the most (to me anyway) is in her sadder love driven songs such as &quot;Hyper-Ballad&quot; (I still can't stop listening to this song!) or &quot;You've Been Flirting Again&quot; and &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; (recognize that song on &quot;Insomniac Music Theater&quot; from Vh1?).<BR>  <BR>I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  No one can pull this music off quite like Bjork.  And this is her at her best.
B00005JJXU|5.0|Since I was a kid I'd see this movie box ,it's title never appealed to me.Then(at 27 yrs. old)I had wathced just about everything there was too see. I picked up this movie and decided to give it a shot.I never really liked classic movies, luckily this one was in color. I put it  in while I was still running around the house (distracted), then came this tune (moonriver)which made me stop what I was doing I suddenly felt so happy and sad at the same time.I sat down and instantly fell in love with Audrey.Her face,her waist,her stucture-so beautiful,elegant.It was so  natural,graceful.Grace is something that you are either born with or  not-you can't act it.                       <BR> <BR>I'm not sure I would  classify this movie as a romantic comedy.Some may consider this movie as \\"campy\\". In my opinion this movie has a realness that no movie to date has ever had.        <br />The point is that no movie has ever made me feel the way  this film has (good all over) + need to review it .I have never felt the need to opiniate myself to thousands primarily because I'm not a reviewer.<br />This movie is over 40 yrs. old.It's situations and subject matter are far ahead of it's day.<br />This movie is basically about a scared girl who on the outside party's, \\"dates men\\", and lives by the moment.Like all of us(well atleast like me) in the end comes to find out that eventually  it's time to settle down.Despite being a guy this movie made me take a good look at myself for what I am/am not, of what I got/don't got at 27.<br />This is why I have a problem calling this work a romantic comedy or some  \\"campy\\"work. This movie is about finding yourself.It sure hit home with me.I classify this movie as being real. <br />Rent this movie for yourself ,you be the judge<br />                                                            Adios.
B000002HPV|5.0|It is true.  Many may try and they will all fail.  This is the Bjork sound.  Though not my favorite Bjork album (&quot;Post&quot; being my favorite), every song on this cd captivates me.  Yes, I even liked Pluto (there's a really great remix of that song out there BTW).  Beautiful string arrangements, awesome and original bass and beats, and of course Bjork's one-of-a-kind voice.  This album is quite like a story.  Every song a chapter and they all fit together.
0066214122|2.0|I expected much better from Michael Crichton.  \\"Timeline\\" was one of the more exciting books I've read, and a book close to the level of \\"Jurassic Park\\".  But in \\"Prey\\", Michael Crichton fails to build the believable tale he's embedded in previous works.  The dialogue, especially between Jack Forman's children, is borderline ridiculous, and the threat from the technology (usually a hallmark of Crichton books) degenerates into a series of \\"deadly monster chase scenes\\" that reads like a typical episode of Scobby-Doo!  Most of the premises upon which the plot is built are erroneous and impossible, but prospective buyers should read for themselves.  True fans will probably still like it.  For those who need alternative, try \\"Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller\\".  That book provides a far more accurate portrayal of self-replicating nanotechnology and does so without the cartoonish characters, bad dialogue, and endless chase scenes (I wonder if our heroes will get away???).  Throughout the whole of \\"Prey\\", the writing seemed very sloppy and rushed.  If you're looking for an average Michael Crichton book, read \\"Prey\\".  If you're looking for great nanotechnology fiction, then you're far better off with \\"Conquest of Paradise\\".
B00003CXI1|1.0|What should have been a light hearted, whimiscal children's movie becomes an over drawn tale of boredom and eye candy.  The major problem is that the director treats his material like Lord of the Rings when it is much closer to Cat in the Hat.  Instead of telling a story and giving children a new idea for playtime, every little detail of is spelled out for us.  This is not a rich and fully developed world, however, and the more we're shown, the less it is believable.  Two and a half hours of film wasted.
0375758992|2.0|I just finished reading\\" Don't lets go \\", and I have to say, I find myself totally disturbed. On the one hand the story is fascinating. But I was hoping that at the end Alexandra would come around and not be such a racist.Black Africans are hardly mentioned except as inept servants. Even at the end of the book she says that there aren't any europeans living nearby for her parents to talk to now.<BR>I'm wondering what she now teaches her children.<BR>I thought that the way she turned her mother's alcholism into humorous episodes was  false. there was an absence of fear of the situation which i think would be inevitable if your parents were as unstable and idiotic as the ones portrayed in the book.
068484267X|4.0|Having read this book, I realize i would never have picked it up and cchose to read it myselelf, But I am glad i did. It opened my eyes to how different lifestyles can be between cultures. The Irish have suffered for so long, and i have had so good and didn't even know it. I have a warm home, clothes on my body, food in my belly and then some. During this time period in Ireland, children as young as 5 or 6 could be working to help support their families whereas in America at the age of 5 or 6 children will only be starting school. I think it is a great book for seniors to read in the World Literatue/ English class category. This book takes human emotion by the core and opens peoples eyes to all the different aspects of life. It makes people realize how much we take for granted and makes us appreciate what we are fortunate enough to have.
B00007E8V4|3.0|Any band that releases a bunch of songs they rejected from their last album is just buying time.It pains me to give SOAD anything less than 5 stars but this collection is just not good. There are only 3 good tracks:I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Thetawaves, and Roulette. The streamline here is not as good as the version on the Scorpion King. Chic'n' sty , Boom,and Mr. Jack are still good, but frabnkly disappointments. Pick up Their first two albums before you even think of stealing this.
6305508550|5.0|I just bought this movie for my stepfather because I thought he would appreciate seeing this movie.  I saw it a couple of years ago and thought that it was so funny!  It's directed by Mike Judge who created \\"Beavis and Butt-Head\\" and \\"King of the Hill\\".  It definitely has that kind of humor in it.  In some ways it's probably an honest look at how some people are treated at work and how some people try to take revenge.  It's a very good movie.
B000002WPI|5.0|...I'm heard this<BR>album for the first time at local radio station in the midnite weekend of the year 1998 and for some reason they played the whole album. One day at year 2001 i saw this album in a local record store at imported cd price in very limited stock and i thank God for hearing my pray. ITS ONLY TOOK ONE WEEK AND THE ALBUM WAS SOLD<BR>OUT. Until now its impossible to find this album in any Indonesian record store. And i'm glad that i'm the only few hip-hop fan inIndonesia whose able to cop the real album. (Mine is German's 2000 release). When i heard this album in the radio, i knew that was Wu Tang Clan cuz I already had their second album Forever. I don't know before what their first album sounds like and for the rest more than 50 minutes,i got my ears glued to my radio speaker. By the time the album is over, i can't close my jaw, i've been shocked and i can't believe wit what i've just heard. The album sounds like demo tape but it works carrying the terms of rugged and raw what hardcore rap should serve and done. The spirit contains in this album like fire that had been set up on an gas station, its start with a song called \\"Bring the Ruckus\\" which is quick to take you to the<BR>introduction of the album and followed with \\"Shame On The *igga\\" that shows how filthy and sweathy ODB's style is, and then GZA solo's \\"Clan In The Front\\" which tag him as the best lyricist among others members (can i say rapper's rapper) Every members came out with their own unique distinctive style that easily draw to your ears. Jusk check out Master Killa line on  \\"Da Mistery Of Shadowboxin' \\" , <br />...BR> <BR>The rest others song it works like magic spell in your ear which makes you wanna bang your head to the wall just like GZA said at his line in \\"Wu Tang 7th Chamber\\" , <br />\\"I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock<BR>Like getting smashed by a cinder block<BR>Blaow!  Now it's all over<BR>*iggaz seeing pink hearts, yellow moons<BR>orange stars and greenclovers \\"<br />Its don't need to argue that this album is get down as one of the 5 best album in history of hip-hop and should be on every true list of every honest hip-hop fans. This is what you get if you put one of the best producers of all time (RZA) and eigth full talented MCs into one album = CLASSIC (Collectively Laboured As Something Should In Collection)
B00000IPAX|5.0|1. Dumpweed: B- An okay song to start off the CD, only the chorus is really good.<BR>2. Don't Leave Me: A- Great song, Tom really shows off his guitar skills in this one. <BR>3. Aliens Exist C+ A song about Tom's belief in aliens, good drum intro, but the rest of the song is just okay.<BR>4. Going Away To College: A+ Wow, this song is probably in the top 10 of all time greatest Blink songs. Seriously. It's that good.<BR>5. What's My Age Again: A What can I say? A classic song, great chorus.<BR>6. Dysentery Gary: B+ a pretty good song, but the last 30 seconds of the song are AWESOME. <BR>7. Adam's Song: A+ Another Classic. This is a slower song, but it is one of Blink's best.<BR>8. All the Small Things: A The reason Blink became so popular. Great song.<BR>9. The Party Song: B+ The verses are good, and the chorus rules!<BR>10. Mutt: B A pretty good song, this is in &quot;American Pie&quot;.<BR>11. Wendy Clear: B This is song is pretty unknown to non-Blink fans. Still a good song.<BR>12. Anthem: A A great way to end the album. Great song.<br />This is one of Blink's best albums. The best songs are &quot;Going Away to College&quot;, &quot;Adam's Song&quot; and &quot;What's My Age Again&quot;. Buy this album!

0743244249|4.0|One of my very favorite quotations is from Don DeLillo: \\"Californians invented the concept of lifestyle. This alone warrants their doom.\\" It's a delicious quote, and until recently reading Cosmopolis, it's been the only thing I know about DeLillo, other than the fact that he's considered a sophisticated writer with a sophisticated following, and that the quotation is from White Noise. So after reading a couple of short reviews of Cosmopolis, I decided to give it a try (which is saying something, since I read science fiction and horror almost exclusively). Cosmopolis follows one day in the life of New York billionaire asset manager Eric Packer. What sort of guy is Eric? Well, if you were ever a fan of the TV series ThirtySomething, think of evil advertising executive Miles Drentell, only immensely more rich and powerful, and maybe not QUITE as nasty. Do people like this actually exist? I shudder to think. There obviously do exist people who live such lives of luxury, protected by swarms of security people, insulated from the grittiness of the real world; experiencing Eric's life vicariously was almost appalling for little old me. DeLillo has an obvious talent for dry, matter-of-fact prose that at times begs to be read aloud. But I have to subtract a star from my review, because the narrative tends to fall apart toward the end (as does Eric's life), and the story's climax is a bit of a letdown. BUT GETTING THERE WAS LOTS OF FUN.

6301174240|4.0|Before the loss of the nose, before the hints of sexual improprieties, before the \\"marriages\\", before the dangling baby over the balcony, Michael Jackson was indeed the master of the universe (or, at least, the planet Earth). This is most evident in the opening portion of this compilation video extravaganza: two intertwined live performances of the singer's \\"Man in the Mirror\\". Interspersed with clips of the great (Ghandi, King, Kennedy, Mother Teresa, to name a few), throngs of MJ devotees are shown in various states of euphoria for the singer. It is obvious that no singer, before or since, could attract the minions that the gloved one did.<br />For that, he has earned his place in history.<br />And that is basically what this video is: a look back at what was, musically AND socially. The second clip is a montage/retrospective of Jackson's hits, as a member of the Jackson Five and as solo artist. This bombardment of songs that topped the charts in his mammoth reign further solidifies his place at the top of music's upper echelon.<br />Following that is a cute kiddy version of \\"Bad\\", featuring two members of the now-defunct boy band, fittingly known as \\"The Boys\\".<br />The fourth entry is an over-the-top Claymation escapade set to the music of Jackson's \\"Speed Demon\\". After that is featured the first of Jackson's \\"expressions\\" of contempt for media scrutiny, the appropriately titled \\"Leave Me Alone\\".<br />The over-extended \\"movie\\" \\"Smooth Criminal\\", sadly, shows how the singer has unsuccessfully moved into the new millennium. His most recent video for \\"You Rock My World\\" was patterned too closely after \\"Criminal\\", complete with a similar location and gangster-attired dancers. Like contemporary Madonna, Jackson would benefit from musical makeovers, as opposed to facial ones.<br />A live performance of the Beatle's \\"Come Together\\" and African group Ladymith Black Mombazo performing the Jackson-penned \\"The Moon is Walking\\" complete the video package.<br />All in all, this is a walk on the moon worth taking, if nothing more for nostalgic purposes to those of us that were \\"there\\".this is a walk on the moon worth taking, if nothing more for nostalgic purposes to those of us that were \\"there\\".
0920236162|5.0|This was the first Munsch book that I bought and I quickly went out and bought a whole load more. He's an excellent writer with a wonderful range of stories and a beautifully simple and fluid style of writing that is both accessible to children and able to roll off the tongue of most adults. <br />As you'll see from the other reviews here, this tale is about a young girl who, filled with nothing but courage, charity and a fair bit of brains, goes off to rescue a young prince from a ferocious dragon. After using all of her cunning to defeat the dragon she discovers that the prince is a bit of a monster himself, and so she decides not to marry him after all. <br />Although I agree that the story has a wealth of small lessons for children to learn about boys and girls and expectations and disappointments, I think that one of its strongest points is that the book serves as a wonderful introduction to the fact that not all stories end the way we expect them to (it's still a happy ending, just a different one) and that sometimes a twist can be more satisfying anyway.<br />Highly recommended for children from 3 to 103.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Even though they had been known in their native Australia for years, it wasn't until 1987 and their hit \\"Beds Are Burning\\" that the politically conscious Midnight Oil, led by gangling seven foot tall bald lead singer Peter Garrett garnered attention on the other side of the Pacific--i.e. the USA.  It hit Billboard's Top 20 on the Hot 100.  The constant theme of this album is the return of the aborigines' land to the rightful owners and the criticism of companies that exploit the land for its resources.<br />The anthemic \\"Beds Are Burning\\" is about returning the aborigines land to them:  \\"The time has come/to say fair's fair/to pay the rent/to pay our share.\\"  The song says, the Australian desert can go up to 45 degrees C (113 F).  Hot!  I wonder if many Native Americans found this song popular, as they too suffer the same plight, especially the Navajo people in the area I live in.<br />The mid-paced \\"Put Down That Weapon,\\" which has a throbbing bass, seems to be a thematic holdover from their bomb album, the countdown-titled 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.  Key lyric:  \\"Put down that weapon or we'll all be gone/You must be crazy if you think you're strong.\\"<br />\\"Dreamworld\\" has a quicker pace than \\"Beds Are Burning\\" and sadly tells the aborigines that \\"your dreamworld is about to end.\\"  As for Garrett, he says, \\"Take me to a place where the dreaming never ends/open wide drive that mystery road.\\"  In other words, somewhere that has been left untouched by whites.<br />The elegiac \\"Arctic World\\" describes the soulessness of the exploiter company man, but it's also the despair of the activist who is frustrated from what looks like a losing battle.<br />The rocking \\"Warakurna\\" challenges white land occupation and laws in favour of aboriginal tradition:  \\"This land must change or land must burn\\" and \\"White law could be wrong/black law must be strong.\\"<br />The equally engaging second single, \\"The Dead Heart,\\" spoken from the aborigines' point of view, is another number that pulls no punches from the outset:  \\"We don't serve your country/don't serve your king/know your custom don't speak your tongue/white man came took everyone.\\"  Like the Native Americans of old, they have had to put up with their land being taken and exploited.  In Australia, it's \\"mining companies, pastoral companies, uranium companies, collected companies,\\" with the mentality that they have more say than people.<br />For those wondering what a \\"Bullroarer\\" is, it's a wooden slat attached to a string that makes a roaring sound when spun around quickly.  There's the sound of one at the beginning of the track. Its use is varied, from curing sickness, warning women and children away from sacred ceremonies, or to symbolize totemic ancestors.<br /><br />\\"Sell My Soul\\" describes hardships and the conflicts of not selling one's traditional ways in favour of white ways, and the quick-paced \\"Sometimes\\" describes the overpowering industrial concrete and steel jungle, and tells the aborigine not to give in.<br />This album got me turned on to Midnight Oil and I have four of their other albums as a result.  Question:  if you copy one of their CDs to a CD-R, would that be known as burning the Midnight Oil?  Sorry, I couldn't resist.no punches from the outset:  \\"We don't serve your country/don't serve your king/know your custom don't speak your tongue/white man came took everyone.\\"  Like the Native Americans of old, they have had to put up with their land being taken and exploited.

B000001XO3|5.0|First, I have never attended a Bayreuth performance.  What I know of the sound is derived from listening to and comparisng commercially released recordings of Wagner music dramas.  On that basis I offer the opinion that the Krauss recordings, because apparently made without benefit of the kind of engineering and remastering customary with such major-label releases as the Boulez &quot;Ring&quot; and &quot;Parsifal,&quot; and the Bohm &quot;Ring&quot; and &quot;Tristan,&quot; all originating at Bayreuth, offer a more accurate acoustical picture of a Bayreuth Festpielhaus performance.<br />What struck me most on the sound side of the things in the Krauss recording was the forwardness of the voices in relation to the orchestra.  It is well-known that Wagner designed the Bayreuth theatre using the then-revolutionary idea of putting the pit orchestra literally &quot;in the pit,&quot; i.e., out of sight.  There are various aesthetic results deriving from this placement, but certainly one is to facilitate a balance between the volume of sound produced by his orchetra scoring and the singers.  <br />The commercial records mentioned above all seem to bring the orchestra forward, and that fact is quite apparent when comparing them with the balances of the Krauss recording.  If the latter represents something like a &quot;true&quot; sound of Bayreuth performances as heard from the audience, then it seems clear that commercial recordings made at Bayreuth &quot;engineer out&quot; Wagner's intended sound picture in order to produce records for audiences that are responding only to sound, not the spectacle of a live staged performance.

Grant there is a few changes in the song, but so small you almost can't notice them unless you have one of the original albums, which I do.. Quiet Riot put this album together so everyone could hear some of Randy's playing and did a Great job. I am a Randy Rhoads fans always have been and always will be. Blizzard OF Ozz was with a different band so the sound is going to change to fit the band..Untill Quiet Riot gets permission to release more materal with Randy on it or Randy's mom decides to release some of Randy's materal, we should be happy with what we got. Q.R. didn't have to release anything with Randy Rhoads, they could of released a new album instead!! way to go Q.R.
B00003CXMG|5.0|As I was born in the 1980s, I can only check out the era of blossoming rock'n'roll (Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin) through books and movies. \\"Almost Famous,\\" a semi-autobiographical movie about the 1970s rock scene, gives a glimpse of the life of a young reporter (based on Crowe himself). A must-see for music fans!<br />When William's sister (Zooey Deschanel) left home, she gave him her collection of records: the Who, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. When William (Patrick Fugit) is fifteen he manages to get a writing assignment with Creem, and then with Rolling Stone magazine to write about the rising rock band Stillwater (think a mixture of the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin). William falls in with the Stillwater guys and their circle of adoring groupies, including an effervescent blonde, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).<br />Despite the displeasure of his controlling but loving mom (she claims adolescence is a marketing ploy), William accompanies Stillwater across the country. He keeps trying to get an interview with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), but Russell is too busy partying with Penny and diving off rooftops (literally) to give William his material. But some alarming incidents show William that the drugs, sex and rock'n'roll are only a veneer for what really matters.<br />\\"Almost Famous\\" is a fantastic mixture of expose and tribute -- there's music, there's romance, there's comedy. There isn't a lot of pratfall humor, although there is some (Anna Paquin running smack into a cement wall); the scene on the airplane where everyone confesses their sins is fantastic (Ed's only line is hysterically anticlimactic). We get to see inter-band conflict (who's the star?), groupies, rock journalism, and the unfortunate aftereffects for groupies. Yet the sort-of-romance between Penny and William is very sweet, rooted in genuine affection.<br />Both the glamour and the grit is shown here. The dialogue sparkles (\\"Last words: I dig music... I'M ON DRUGS!\\", \\"Forgive me Father, for I may sin tonight,\\" \\"I'm about to boldly go where... many men have gone before\\"), and the direction is superb -- it cuts forward just when it needs to; the camera follows people out onto the dizzying stage and then zooms in for intimate close-ups. Nowhere else could a stomach-pumping scene actually contain an element of romance.<br />Patrick Fugit is a surprisingly solid lead, with a sort of wide-eyed innocence that contrasts sharply with everyone else. Kate Hudson plays a sweet groupie who doesn't practice what she preaches (\\"Never take it seriously, you never get hurt.\\") and falls in love with Russell -- only to get tossed away. Her fragile \\"why doesn't he love me?\\" is one of the best lines in the movie. Billy Crudup has disarming charm and selfishness as Russell; Anna Paquin is very funny as one of Penny's groupie pals (\\"Don't worry, he's still a virgin\\"); Jason Lee is likably grumpy as Jeff Bebe, and Frances McDormand is fantastic as Fugit's weird mother.<br />Music lovers and rock aficionados will love \\"Almost Famous,\\" a bittersweet coming-of-age comedy/drama/music movie.

B0000683DH|5.0|\\"Now, this is more like it!\\"<br />So wrote film critic Janet Maslin in June of 1982 when Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan opened nationwide.<br /> You see, even though millions of Star Trek fans had flocked to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture in December of 1979, the reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Oh, sure, fans were happy to see Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew back in action. Yes, the redesigned USS Enterprise was impressive, as were all the visuals. And that Jerry Goldsmith score was just fabulous.<br /> Yet, for all that, Star Trek I was also a big letdown. And even though the attempt of the producers to make an intelligent, non-Star Wars science fiction story was laudable, the first of the 10 feature films did not fire up the imagination. Wags, according to David Gerrold in his book The World of Star Trek, dubbed it Star Trek: The Motionless Picture and Spockalypse Now.<br /> However, Paramount's accountants and executives did see good, if not Star Wars-sized, box office rentals, and they decided to give the franchise another chance. So they called in Harve Bennett, a well-known television producer, and asked him to take over from Gene Roddenberry as executive producer for the next Star Trek feature film.<br /> Bennett took a look at most of the 79 Star Trek television episodes, seeking the formula that would make a second Star Trek movie soar and take audiences where \\"no one had gone before.\\" Yet, ironically, the concept Bennett and co-writer Jack Sowards came up with was to make a sequel not to the first film, but to an episode which aired in 1967 \\"Space Seed.\\"<br /> In another brilliant stroke, Nicholas Meyer was hired to direct. New to the Star Trek universe, Meyer decided to start over almost as if the first feature did not exist. Although he would use stock footage from Star Trek I (which saved the studio tons of money), there would be new costumes, a new approach, and even a new score by James Horner.<br /> Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (originally titled The Undiscovered Country, a Shakespearean reference to death) is a Horatio Hornblower-like story of Admiral Kirk's midlife crisis - at 52, he is now a flag officer and faculty member at Starfleet Academy in 23rd Century San Francisco. Unhappy at his desk job, he longs for command of a starship. His former ship, the Enterprise, is now a training ship commanded by his former first officer, Captain Spock.<br /> It is also the story of Khan Noonian Singh, a tyrant from the late 20th Century who fled from Earth in the year 1996 after the Eugenics Wars (funny, we must have missed those on Fox or MSNBC) and was found by Kirk and Co. in the 2260s aboard SS Botany Bay, a sleeper ship. Revived - in one of those well-meant gestures by our heroes, Khan reverted to type and tried to take over the Enterprise. Only the triumvirate of Kirk, Spock and McCoy enabled the Enterprise to resist Khan and his followers, and he - along with Lt. Marla McGivers and his band of \\"supermen\\" - was exiled on Ceti Alpha VI.<br /> Alas! For one of the neighboring planets exploded six months after Khan's exile, and the result was catastrophic. Khan's world was laid waste, and many of his people, including Lt. McGivers, died. And for 15 years, Khan bided his time, until a Federation starship on an unrelated mission arrives.<br /> Star Trek II then becomes a classic revenge tale as Khan takes over the USS Reliant and battles Kirk for possession of the Genesis Device, a missile which can reconfigure entire planets. Starships duel, explosions flare up on screen, chaos ensues. Khan, of course, is thwarted, but not without great cost.<br /> Of course, 21 years after the fact, we know Spock gets killed. We know, also, that this movie started a story arc that continued with The Search for Spock and The Voyage Home and that, at least for Spock, death is only temporary.<br /> The Director's Edition of Star Trek II is subtly different from the theatrical and first - barebones - DVD versions.The story is the same....but this is the slightly longer edition seen originally in its ABC-TV network broadcast premiere in 1984. In this version we find out that the engineering cadet Peter Preston is Scotty's nephew. There are also bits of dialogue that are changed slightly, and some shots presented differently. There is also a great Director's commentary from Nick Meyer. He is a great speaker and very witty, at that. The text commentary by Mike and Denise Okuda is also informative and sometimes even funny. As in all DVDs with extra features discs, there are trailers, featurettes, and interviews with cast and crew....but this is the slightly longer edition seen originally in its ABC-TV network broadcast premiere in 1984.

B00008J4P5|4.0|Rarely have I picked up an album with such high anticipation (Rolling Stone gave this 5 stars) and actually ended up agreeing.  First listen didn't blow me away.  Second listen and I started to pick up a bit of a Beatles vibe.  By the fourth listen (all in the same day - headphones at work) I realized that his album features some diverse lyrics and musicianship.  It didn't sound like anything already out there - the cookie cutter does not apply to Jack White - and the album provided changes in speed, sound that make it a great album.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars (as petty as it sounds), is that although the last song is tongue in cheek, they should have omitted it.  Which means I had to skip a song...so it can't be perfect, but a tremendous album nontheless.
B000059XUI|4.0|Superman II<br />Shot simultaneously with Superman: The Movie, this first of three sequels proved to be one of those Hollywood rarities - a sequel just as good as the original.<br />Because Mario Puzo (author of both the Godfather novel and the screenplays) had written such a huge script for the Superman movie, producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind broke it up into two installments.  When they hired director Richard (The Omen) Donner, the deal was \\"$1,000,000 for two pictures), and that Superman II be released a year after Superman: The Movie's release.  Thus production began on both pictures back-to-back, with actors shooting scenes from I, resting, shooting a few scenes for II, then back to I again.<br />However, even though Superman II was halfway done, the Salkinds decided to replace Donner with British director Richard Lester, who had done The Beatles' \\"Help!\\" in the mid-1960s and also directed the swashbuckling The Three Musketeers and its sequel.  The change in directors and the death of director of photography Geoffrey Unsworth caused a delay in Superman II's release date from 1979 (if you have the VHS version of Superman I you can see a credit that says \\"Next Year: Superman II) to 1981.<br />The link between the two movies is the opening of Superman I: the trial of Krypton's three arch-criminals Gen. Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) for acts of treason and sedition.  They are sentenced by the Kryptonian High Council and Jor-El, Superman's dad, to spend eternity in a flat glasslike thing out in space's The Phantom Zone.<br />This scene (depicted in Superman II in a different fashion) is reprised, not only to set up a flashback laden title sequence but the movie itself, which is part love story, and part full blown conflict between Superman (Christopher Reeve) and the three Kryptonian baddies.<br />Because Superman I's role was to provide the \\"origins of\\" Kal-el/Superman and introduce us to the characters, Superman II's pace is brisker and focused. At last we get to see the romance between Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Superman go from simmer to heat (in a very touching scene, Superman gives up his powers to be able to love Lois).  It is, in fact, Superman's first rescue of Lois in this movie that allows the three hometown villains to escape from their imprisonment in the Phantom Zone.<br />Superman II reunites most of the first movie's major cast. Gene Hackman (one of my favorite character actors) returns as Lex Luthor, joined by the ever funny Ned Beatty as his hapless and clueless henchman, Otis.  Rounding out this trio is Valerie Perrine's loyal-to-her-Lex moll, Miss Tessmacher.  Also in the movie are Clark Kent's boss Perry White (Jackie Cooper) and photographer Jimmy Olsen (Mark McClure).<br />The DVD - released both singly and in a Superman boxed set - in 2001 is adequate but lacks the extra features of the first movie's DVD.  There are no making-of documentaries or director's commentary, just a theatrical trailer and a cast and crew list with a filmography for only a few major cast members.<br />One film flub mentioned in the funny and revealing book Roman Soldiers Don't Wear Watches: In the first movie, Jor-el is the parent who places the baby Kal-el into his tiny starship.  Watch carefully at the flashback title sequence...now it's Lara (Susannah York) who places the baby in the ship!e is brisker and focused.

B00003CXXI|1.0|For anyone who hasn't seen Shrek yet, and cannot decide whether to purchase this movie or not-please do not throw your money away on this film.  Shrek is vulgar and disgusting.  One cannot believe that this is what humanity has been reduced to in the twenty-first century.  Shrek is not for anyone who has any beauty in their heart or any intelligence in their soul.  I only wish I could rate this video 0 stars!

0767817478|3.0|Well, if you a fan of the man in the rubber suit Godzilla, the true king of monsters, then this film will disaapoint you.  I have been a fan of the KOM for 35 years now (started when I was six years old with the flu).  The redesign of the traditional Godzilla leaves alot to be desired, and most of the film you wish that the monster would step upon matthew broderick.  Yet this movie has a couple saving graces: 1). Jean Reno  his role is too small, but he makes the most of it, and 2).  the King swiimng sequence is amazing!!  Yes, I did attend the special premiere of the film when it came out, and saw it several times with various groups of friends.  I still was dissapointed by it, I guess I am old school.  If you have not seen the old films of the king, then try this first, you may like it alot.  the special effects are very good.  I wish I could say the same for the plotline.  yeah, a sequeal is still being disucssed as this time.  Toho took the rights back after this film, and has issues a couple pretty good man-in-rubber-suit films since then.
B000002KB8|4.0|There are only six classic Black Sabbath albums. Paranoid, Masters Of Reality, Vol.4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Sabotage and this one. In the movie Trainspotting the character Sick Boy had the theory that &quot;you have it, then you loose it and its gone forever&quot;. That much is true for Sabbath, their first 6 albums were great but they lost it and never regained it. <br />Still of the first 6 albums Black Sabbath is the weakest. They had yet to acquire a brillant song writing that would span a whole album. The title track and NIB revealed what was to come, and NIB is arguably one of the top five Sabbath songs of all time. However weak lyrics on tracks such as the Wizard and Behind The Wall of Sleep let down the raw rock brutality of their sound. Get this album if you love the true Black Sabbath, and stay away from anything recorded after Sabotage.
B00007L4OM|5.0|If you like Jean Leon and Crismon Rivers, you will adore this film!  Not only do you have action, with a body count, but you also have drama and a real plot, with humor and pathos too.  Jean Reno &quot;the coolest frenchman in the world&quot;, plays a french officer, with an out of control &quot;cop rage&quot;, and a past with special ops.   When he is given a manidatory leave, he finds out the love of his life (who disappeared 19 years ago), has passed away, and he must travel to Japan for the reading of the will.  From the moment he hits the airport, the action and the plot twists start.  The supporting cast is great, and his old special ops friend provides wondeful comic relief.  I bought the DVD as soon as it came out, and everyone I have lant it to, has thought it was get.  yes it is volient at times, but it can also help you with your golf game (hint).
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Cinderella has always been my favorite childhood fable. But what this movie has done was to show it a new light. For one thing, this movie started out conveying the fact that Cinderella was based upon real characters and events. In all truth, her name was Danielle and she was a servant who lost her father right off the bat. How would the prince met with this servant? Well, it was fate and luck. I will not give out too much of the story though. But these were characters you get to know and love. Hate, if you mention the stepsister. Leonardo Da Vinci plays the fairy godmother, or should I say fairy godfather. He was quite a charming fellow. The stepmother and sister are quite complex character beyond the scope of which Disney had portrayed them, but yet they are still after the same thing. That illusive crown. All in all, this movie gets a thumb up from me. A lovely movie with loveable characters, now only if real life was likes this.
B00008OE4W|4.0|This film is treat with the actor mix and the unique characters they play.  I take one star away, for if it was better written, we would not have been cheated out of several Sneakers sequels. The film has enough action for adults, yet cute and fun enough for kids to watch along with you.  I raced to the theater when it was released, and I am now racing to own the DVD.  Sit back and enjoy a film that has action/drama/humor/suspense, and a well put together cast.
B000008GS2|4.0|Remember 1987? that year all the big bands released there finest stuff (U2, Midnight Oil, Inxs, George Michael, etc..) well Icehouse was 1 of those bands too!  Man Of Colors Starts off w/ the smash hit single &quot;Crazy&quot; , Followed by there biggest Hit &quot;Electric Blue&quot; , co written by John Oates.   Other note worthy singles also fill out this album &quot;My Obession &amp; Nothing Too Serious&quot; respectively. The &quot;Title Track&quot; is a beautiful ballad &amp; &quot;The Kingdom&quot; is a surprise of pop intensity. The only problem I have w/ Man Of Colors is that it sounds too much like sell out. this album is the place to start for ALL new Icehouse fans.
0375703861|4.0|Maybe it's because I'm somewhat ignorant to British, West and East Indian cultures (i.e. i'm American), I thought the book was a fun and engrossing read.  I haven't really read much because I've spent the last 10 years working on a bachelor's and two masters degrees and the last thing I want to see most I the time when I get home is a book.  But I found myself absorbed and completely involved in the plot and entertained from beginning to the (somewhat disappointing) end.  I did think that the character of Irie was underdeveloped, though.  Simply put, I liked it.
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown has written another fast-paced, intellectual thriller, one in which deception, politics, and secrecy all combine to sweep the reader along.  It retains the suspense of Robert Ludlum \\"The Paris Option\\" with the build up found in Britt Gillette's \\"Conquest of Paradise\\".  From the Arctic ice shelf to the political rat race of Washington, DC, the plot twists and turns as the protagonists (and the reader) learn more and more about a plot that becomes more and more believable.  This is not a traditional formulaic thriller.  Brown's book is hard to put down, as the reader becomes more and more involved in the action.  A definite must read.
B000002BMV|5.0|This album rarely left my turn-table. Although I chose to play side 2 first then 1, it still made no difference in my mind. (In cd lingo that's track 6-10 first) This was the most emotionally moving and melodic compositions from the 80's. I cannot image a memory from my sophomore year in High School that did not have some riff or chorus from this album in it. How many of you remember &quot;Open Arms&quot;? Need I say more?<br />20-some years later (Has it been that long already?) This CD is still in my iPod and in my numerous mp3 players.<br />Thanks Journey, you gave me an album that keeps me forever young.
B000001Y79|4.0|This early album from No Doubt gives you a taste of how good the band was before the AWFUL \\"Rock Steady\\" which, by the way, fails miserably both to Rock and to be Steady. But, if you really want to listen to good stuff from a once-great band, \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" is definitely a good place to start.<br />Though it is on the lighter side of punk, this album is real, compelling, grab-you-by-your-collar music. Gwen Stefani shows effectively how much ... she can kick with vocals that manage to be grating, melodic, dramatic, and fun all at once. Brother Eric Stefani, on keyboard, creates sounds that range from humorous to creative and, on a couple of tracks, a little eerie. Tom Dumont does a masterful guitar, and Adrian Young's rythyms give the album its punk edge. But it's Tony Kanal, the bassist, who is truly unique. His bass is strong enough to add to most of the background, but subtle enough not to overpower everyone else.<br />All in all, this album, with its poetic lyrics and amazing talent is definitely not one to to miss. It truly baffles me that the group can go from a powerful, dynamic album like this, to \\"Rock Steady\\". Hopefully the next album can live up to the high standards that fans have set for No Doubt.
0345350499|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful. I love the fact that the women in this book are so real. They are all flawed, yet they are all perfect. This is definetly a book for women who are tired of male dominated visions of women in fantasy. The charaters are so rich, deep, and complex. If Camelot had ever been a real place, this is surely how things really happened.
0316666343|2.0|This book had a good message, in the end.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who cannot handle slightly disgusting situations.  At the very beginning, the main character has some troubles, and the author describes it in gruesome detail. There are also some parts which are very risque. However, at the end of the book I was happy for the character and her family.  Throughout most of the book, I was either sad for the situation or literally &quot;grossed-out&quot;.  This was quite a depressing read actually, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who couldn't handle it (if you know what I mean). This was not one of my favorites. I hope my review has been helpful!
B00003CWTI|2.0|This is the kind of movie that sours the more you think about it. It's full of ostentation, extreme life situations, passionate (over)acting, symbolic import, and noise.  When you boil it down to find the message, you are left with very little.  The triteness of the &#34;moral&#34; is captured in the confrontation that a harried young boy makes to his demanding father -- &#34;You have to be nicer to me.&#34;  Some revelation.<br /><br />A lot of the story lines in the movie are stretched out, seem padded.  In particular, the interview between the reporter and the Tom Cruise character, the part in which a kid is kept from going to the restroom, and the story with William H. Macy -- each drags out interminably and makes a single element of drama overstay its welcome.<br /><br />The beginning and ending segments of the film reach for some profundity concerning the connectedness between seemingly random events.  It doesn't wash.<br /><br />It's clear that Anderson has &#34;issues&#34; he wants to address -- but it's not clear to whom they should be addressed.  I'd wager he made the film as a way to yell at his own dad. Perhaps it was good therapy for him to do so (Janov's &#34;The Primal Scream&#34; comes to mind because of all the shouting and crying scenes).  The film isn't any better for it, though.
0452282152|5.0|This book was one I really enjoyed. It is historical fiction set in 16th century Holland.  The main character is sent by her family to work for the Vermeer Household as a maid, because her father can no longer work.  Vermeer (whom by the way was a real artist) hires her to clean his studio without moving anything from its proper place. I had a wonderful experience in my art History class, and really enjoyed learning more about how things truly were, even though this book is partially fictional. It tells of Greit's life story and has a truly wonderful ending.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys art, or just a good read; however, some parts were a bit risque. But that did not affect the reading at all. This was truly a wonderful book.  I hope my review has helped you!
0553103547|5.0|Remember how you thought the first three volumes of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series were so extraordinary?

B00003CXPJ|2.0|I love Owen Wilson (see him in movies with Jackie Chan).  I love Ben Stiller -- and his whole family!  I loved the premise -- dumb male model gets involved with spy types, action hero responses required, etc.  But somehow, I just don't think they pulled it off.  Though somewhat funny, the two male models weren't funny enough -- they needed to exaggerate the characters more. Or else, they needed to take it the other way, and make it more serious, with humorous overtones (aka: Jackie Chan).  I went away from the movie ultimately dissatisfied, feeling let down in my expectations.  Try again, fellas!
1559408855|5.0|Films like \\"Salo\\" are never made for the sake of entertainment, but they challenge the viewer's motivations and conceptions of what it means to be human. To watch this film requires to accept the challenge to be confronted with such fundamental questions, and to abandon simplistic and modern preconceptions of what film (and indeed art) \\"ought to be\\" for.<br />\\"Salo\\" is Pasolini's adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's last novel \\"The 120 days of Sodom\\", an 18th century catalogue of perversions commited by a group of \\"libertines\\" whose view of society is opposite to contemporary philosophical rationalism and optimism of the time. Pasolini transposes the story to fascist Italy at the end of World War 2, in Musolini's \\"republic\\" of Salo-a region in which Pasolini had resided, and where he experienced the fascist repression. <br />\\"Salo\\" tells the story of 4 fascist \\"signori\\", who retreat in a remote and decadently decorated villa to engage in, and act out a complex series of perversions (ranging from sexual violence to torture and murder) and degradation on a group of young civilian victims, and with the help of an equally young militia recruited from the same village.<br />Because of its extreme graphic nature this movie is definitely not for the faint-hearted. The scenes of violence and human degradation are truly shocking. However, what is equally shocking are the dialogues and the many details in the rigorous structure of the story that reveal Pasolini's underlying motivations. \\"Salo\\" is a gripping and thought-provoking reflection on power, modernism, decadence, and the limits of human rationality-and in that sense its relevance goes far beyond it being a comment on Sade's novel or on fascism. Few movies in the history of the genre had the power to raise these questions as strongly as Pasolini's \\"Salo\\", and it is to be doubted that more ever will.<BR> <BR>As much as being a chilling visual representation of human irrationality, Pasolini's \\"Salo\\" is a highly intellectual, and a deeply moral and moving reflection on (in)humanity, by means of the urgent and ever so relevant questions it raises. This makes \\"Salo\\" compulsory viewing for anyone to whom such questions matter.
B00005221M|1.0|Last of the Mohicans is one of the best movies of the 1990's and one that could potentially stand the test of time and be enshrined as a classic.<br />I say &quot;potentially&quot;, because this DVD is the &quot;Director's Expanded Edition&quot; and Mann has apparently taken a hacksaw to the original that we all know and love from the big screen, laserdisc and VHS versions. Gone are tons of important and memorable dialogue, total scenes are cut, the soundtrack has been gutted, and many of the scenes that remain unscathed visually lose much of their weight due to the &quot;new score&quot;. <br />This edition demonstrates quite clearly what is inherently wrong with many DVDs. We all go to see a movie, love it, and simply want to duplicate the experience in our homes. Instead we are forced to watch a totally new (and inferior) &quot;Director's Amalgamation DVD&quot; that only shows the critical importance of editing in the movie creation process.<br />When will these companies understand that if a movie was popular and critically acclaimed in its theatrical form, then it's probably not a good idea to let the director &quot;slice and dice&quot; the original into some Frankenstein-like equivalent?<br />As I toss The Last of the Mohicans into the &quot;do not watch again pile&quot; I worry that I will NEVER be able to get many of my favorite movies on DVD and re-experience the spectacle I witnessed on the big screen. Now that's depressing.
B000068QY7|5.0|Once in a lifetime comes a musical genious.  Noel is ours.  I have never seen better lryics and the use of such simple chords blended in so many different sounding songs.  You want to compare them to the Beatles? Ok... yes they are just as talented, but you are not listening if you say there music is the same.  <BR>   Every now and then a band will come out that has a sound unique and distinguished from everyone else.  They will last a long time, and continually pump out classics.  The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Boston, exc. and Oasis has these same principals.  I can put this album on, switch on my shuffle, and all the music is good.  In fact I can take every Oasis CD, put them all on shuffle, and every single damn song is enjoyable in one way or another.  <BR>   Heathen Chemistry is definately got a new ring to it, but the Oasis sound is still there and definately heard.  Don't let yourself be fooled, this is the CD I would expect and nothing less.  <BR>   And last but not least, they switched back to their old &quot;Oasis&quot; logo after the change on SOTSOG.  This makes me all warm and tasty inside.  Well from this lonely American Oasis fan, have a good night.

B00005JLT5|5.0|THE PIANIST [Adrian Brody / Directed by Roman Polanski / 150 minutes / Rated R for violence and brief strong language]<br />\\"The Pianist\\", Roman Polanski's remarkable drama about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust in Warsaw, Poland in the early 1940s, is the best depiction of the subject since Steven Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List\\"; in fact, in some respects it is a better movie. While Spielberg and his family grew up in the safety of the United States, Polanski [born in 1933] and his clan were Polish victims of the Nazi atrocities. If there is a problem with \\"The Pianist\\", it is that some viewers will find it too painful to watch. This is a horror movie in the literal sense because it depicts man at his worst in real life. To this day, I have difficulty accepting emotionally that all this occurred just sixty years ago, though intellectually I know that it did. <br />Adrian Brody plays real life pianist Wladslaw Szpilman, who was on track to becoming one of Europe's foremost performers when the Nazis invaded Poland. Within months, he, his family and more than 500,000 other Warsaw Jews were crammed into a ghetto comprising a few city blocks. It wasn't long before more and more people disappeared, having been shipped off to concentration camps. The pianist uses every trick he can think of to survive in a living nightmare which goes on and on and only gets worse. <br />Mr. Brody won Best Actor and Mr. Polanski Best Director at this year's Oscars. At the time it seemed a surprise upset to many people. In retrospect, the awards were richly deserved. <br />Because of its subject matter, \\"The Pianist\\" isn't suited for everyone. [Children should have a grasp of history before seeing it, for example. But it is also very rewarding and a great example of the art of movies.

0441003257|5.0|All I can say is-&quot;Oh my God!&quot; This book is an incredible novel rich with wonderful charecters such as Crowley (demon and love of my life), Aziraphale (an angel and rare book collector) and Adam Young (the antichrist). Pratchet and Gaimen bring this controversial subject into the modern world with the help of hilariously dark humor and an old crazy prophetise who is always there to lend a helping prediction. This is my favorite book in the whole world!! It took me a while to finish it the first time, because of all the plots that eventualy come together in the end for a large blow out finale. Yet I have read it three more times and I just can't get enough. This is a great tale for the young, the old, and the imaginative.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Not the best I've ever heard either.  I'd give it more like 3.75 stars if I could.  The cd trully is way too short to justify the cost.  I actually thought something was wrong with my CD changer or the CD...Maybe if it were [cheaper]I'd give it an even 4 stars.  Still one shy because the songs are decent, but the sound is  familiar.  Reminds me of many of the other singing/rapping bands...
B000089CPF|4.0|While some of the previous reviews gush with overwhelming awe, others fault Burns and Convertino for over-emphasizing the mariachi influences and chicano-inspired cover-art. What I like about this album is that Calexico has taken those border influences and integrated them more fully adding hints and flavorings but never letting it overpower. I wouldn't take the disguntled AZ fan's quip so serious about using a mariachi band for back up as offensive except that it shows a niavete on the reviewer's part. If street-cred was so important the Rolling Stones, Los Lobos, Wilco, etc. would not have been allowed to do anything. Ever listened to Exile on Main St? Its a heavily influenced blues album but being honkies Mick and Keith should have hung it up then lest they get other ideas. Los Lobos is as divergent as any band but does being latino preclude them from playing rock and experimenting with their sound or should they have marginalized themselves to playing mariachi and ranchera music?<br />Feast of Wire shows Calexico growing sonically and finding their own musical voice without relying on their influences and musical tastes as heavily as before. The sign of a good band is one that continues to explore its roots and yet create its own sound from that history. Calexico is moving in that direction. This album is a marker for the next phase of Calexico. Fans of music and the band should take heart that Burns and Convertino are growing and showing greater musical depth with each release leaving us with hopes for future jems likes this.
B00007KLJJ|1.0|Lavish production values and superb costuming cannot save this  version of the timeless classic -- This version is so weighed down with choppy plot flow, poor character development, and uneven (lukewarm) acting it's amazing it ever made it to the cinema.  Wes Bentley's character is uninspired and particularly hard to relate to.  There is an excellent \\"ambush\\" scene near the end of the film, along with a superb performance Djimon Hounsou, but most audiences missed it as they were already sound asleep.  BLAME THIS ONE ON THE DIRECTOR.  PEE-YOOOOO!!!!
B000002H97|5.0|I love metallica so much! This album just goes to show how much their music has evolved over the years, i think this is THE best album that metallica has released (well until st. anger comes out that is)every track has so much emotion in it, along with awesome guitar riffs/solos. Lars is just awesome, the drums on these songs are amazing. I recremend this album to anyone who likes hard rock/metal (considering metallica has metal in there name). Once again METALLICAROCKS!
B0000035E7|5.0|I'm trying to give a unbias account, but being such a big Nirvana fan its hard.<br />With big, gruff, fast but not too, er, &quot;trashy&quot; songs like &quot;Big Cheese&quot;, &quot;floyd the Barber&quot; and &quot;School&quot; this album gives a more rebelious tone than the image later put out on future albums. Its what ture grunge is about.<br />About A Girl, is obviously the crown jewel of it all.<br />And above all- this album seems to me to be the only one where Kurt is really happy. In all the others i've heard, Mr. Cobain seems to give off a sad tone. Trust me- its an investment any rocker will be glad with.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|One of the outstanding films of 2002!<br />The events of January 30, 1972 are familiar to most people primarily through the U2 song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday.\\"  On that fateful, tragic day, a peaceful march for civil rights in Northern Ireland ended in a horrifying massacre when British troops opened fire on the demonstrators.  Now, three extraordinary filmmakers - writer/director Paul Greengrass, cinematographer Ivan Strasburg, and editor Clare Douglas - have pooled their talents to give us their view of this watershed incident, one that so enraged Northern Irish Catholics that it ended up strengthening the hand of the IRA and heightening anti-British sentiment in that part of the world.<br />\\"Bloody Sunday\\" is reminiscent of those great films from the 1960's like \\"The Battle of Algiers\\" and \\"Z,\\" wherein the filmmakers successfully recreate a moment of terrifying violence in purely cinematic terms.  By employing a handheld camera throughout, Greengrass achieves the kind of reality and immediacy that is only possible through cinema verite style.  The camera bobs and weaves, becoming a major character in the drama.  Indeed, the film feels very much like a documentary feature recorded at the actual event itself.  The filmmakers do an amazing job staging the complex action, managing to view the incident from widely varied vantage points - from the marchers in the crowd, to the policemen standing by for trouble (and fomenting most of it themselves), to the demonstration's organizers, to the troop leaders at command center where the decisions for action are ostensibly being made.  The crowd scenes are so well handled in this film that they could easily become a textbook case study for future filmmakers seeking to make movies in a similar vein.  Greengrass also heightens the verisimilitude of the work by resisting the temptation to employ a background musical score.  Instead, the \\"soundtrack\\" of the film is composed of the perpetually ringing telephones that subtly reflect the extraordinary import of the moment.<br />Because Greengrass' main concern is in getting the physical details of the incident right, less time is, understandably, devoted to character development.  Nevertheless, he still manages to bring a few of his key people to life, particularly Ivan Cooper, a member of Parliament who organized the march, a man whose guiding philosophy is that people must have the right to protest peacefully to achieve social justice.  Ivan serves as the focal point for the audience, as we come to identify with his commitment, his passion, his level-headedness and his genuine concern for the people he represents.  James Nesbitt does a beautiful job conveying the humanity of this Gandhi-like central figure.  Greengrass also allows us to see, in telling glimpses, the differing attitudes that prevail among the citizenry of the town as well as among the policemen - both those giving the orders and those executing them - towards what is happening on screen.  Indeed, there is nothing less than a superb performance in the entire cast.  (In an interesting moment of visual irony, the camera catches a glimpse of a movie marquee with the words \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" emblazoned on it - a reference to the famous John Schlesinger film from 1971).<br />Some people may have trouble with this film on two counts - one ideological and the other technical.  There are some who may see the movie as somewhat one-sided, biased and slanted, since clearly the British troops are seen as the Bad Guys in the incident.  More serious, perhaps, is the fact that the Irish accents are so thick that those of us unaccustomed and unattuned to them may find a significant portion of the dialogue garbled and incomprehensible.  That being the case, it is a blessing that the film's greatest virtues lie in its visuals.<br />\\"Bloody Sunday\\" is an exciting, brilliantly executed tour de force that reminds us of just how powerful cinema verite can be.  This is, easily, one of the very bestfilms of recent years.best films of recent years.
B00004YA66|4.0|Just a short and quick recommendation here... a wild two thumbs up for FREQUENCY, the new Dennis Quaid flick.  It's great science fiction in the tradition of the old Outer Limits series.  It really played like an extended Outer Limits or Twilight Zone show, with great character development, suspense and action.  It's also a good mystery!<br />The plot revolves around strange sunspot activity which makes it possible for a NY City policeman to use a ham radio to talk to his father, a former NY City fireman who died 30 years previously in a fire.  Taking advantage of the opportunity, the son warns the father of his impending death and saves the man's life -- altering forever the future timeline in a strange and HORRIBLE way that the two race through the remaining two-thirds of the film to set right.<br />The filmmakers try really hard to put current quantum physics explanations for what's going on into the film, using an interview with a physics professor with Dick Cavett on the tele in the background on night... it's subtle, yet obvious to the audience that their conversation has to do with the events unfolding in the narrative.  This of course anchors the film in the realm of science fiction rather than science fantasy or scifi, and gives it an air of suggestible believability that helps propel the plot foreward.<br />It also has one of the most suspenseful and tense opening action sequences of any film I've seen in recent history -- a definite armrest grabber!  Three solid stars for this entertaining and at times engaging film which at least attempts to deviate from the old cliche' of time travel plots, even if it fails in a few of those attempts.  It's not easily predictable, but once you get a taste for the director's methodology, you'll start figuring things out.  And the film's ending is a bit overly sentimental, with drawn out slo-mo sequences that border on the worst of the old Kodak \\"special moments\\" tv adverts.
B000092Q7O|4.0|Films like The Pianist are important to watch for those of us born after WWII.  It is hard to believe such things actually happened, and if we forget such utter depravity is possible it will happen again.  This film shows how one average Jewish Polish family was destroyed during the Holocaust.  It portrays well how powerless human beings truly are against institutionalized evil.<br />     That being said, I could not help but compare this film with \\"Life is Beautiful (LIB).\\"  At first I thought LIB was the better film because it is more \\"entertaining,\\" meaning there is a greater range of emotion -- you laugh and cry.  The Pianist elicits mostly negative emotions, and can get tedious.  But then I realized that this is also a part of the suffering that the protagonist went through -- fear without relief for 5 years, waiting and not knowing what had happened to his family or what would happen to him, having to remain silent, hiding and waiting.  <br />     This movie is probably closer to the truth of human experience than LIB.  Although both protagonists of The Pianist and LIB are very talented, The Pianist does not idealize the life of its main character as does LIB.  The Szpilman family is also not ideal -- they do not seem to be particularly pious or observant Jews, they do not know each other well and there seems to be the average amount of family discord and jealousies.  Wladyslaw (the protagonist) is more lucky than brave or smart.  He survives by playing dead, but then is almost shot by Russians for wearing a German coat.  He allows himself to be separated from his family and is not able to return a kindness to a German officer.  He appears stunned and numb for much of the movie, simply focused on survival.  In short, he is an Everyman with one great talent -- like most of us.<br />     So, is The Pianist a good movie?  It depends -- if you are looking to somehow be entertained by a Holocaust movie -- then watch LIB instead.  However -- if you watch movies to engage your mind and you want to understand the realities of war and evil -- then this movie will help you imagine how terrible war is, and how powerless everyone becomes in its face.  This can be the first step towards whatever action your conscience leads you to take.  The worst evil of all is apathy.
B00006AUIG|5.0|It's tremendously spooky and atmospheric. Very disturbing. It's filmed on location at Danvers State Mental Hospital in Danvers, MA. I was just up there a couple weeks back with a friend, but we couldn't get onto the property because we hadn't cleared it yet with the MA Film Commission and the State Police -- we're planning on another outing in June.<br />The film is very simple. It's about five Hazmat guys who go in to remove asbestos with a one week time limit (or they lose their big bonus). While there, odd things start happening, they start acting differently, one of them stumbles upon some old reel-to-reel tapes in a deserted storage room. They are recordings of psychiatric sessions between a doctor and a woman who harbors a terrible secret buried beneath layers of multiple personalities.<br />The setting is downright creepy. The hospital itself seems alive, like a character all its own. This movie is successful in bringing to the screen something THE HAUNTING (remake of the Shirley Jackson novel inspired film) and Stephen King's ROSE RED failed to do -- it proved that some &quot;houses&quot; are just &quot;born bad.&quot;<br />Watching this film reminded me of some of the images I'd seen personally when doing a little &quot;investigation&quot; of the old Connecticut Valley Hospital a few years back, and of stories my Mom had told me earlier about her investigations of the place -- she was actually able to get a worker to give her a tour of the subterranean tunnels and &quot;cells&quot; where they housed the more &quot;disturbed&quot; patients -- the violent psychotics, the criminally insane. It's full of dark passages, cramped areas (claustrophobes will go nuts! ;)<br />It's not your typical modern horror film. It's mostly psychological. The director compares it to films like THE SHINING and DON'T LOOK NOW (and even THE EXORCIST).<br />Give it a look. Solid acting from David Caruso, Steven Gevedon and others make the characters real. A tight script with an emphasis on dialogue keeps them alive (for awhile anyway ;) No flashy special effects means the scares come from other places ;) All in all, a fine horror flick that will satisfy fans of atmospheric and psychiatric horror. Fans of only the teeny bopper pseudo slasher films like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM will find it mostly boring and too difficult to follow ;)emphasis on dialogue keeps them alive (for awhile anyway ;) No flashy special effects means the scares come from other places ;) All in all, a fine horror flick that will satisfy fans of atmospheric and psychiatric horror.

0385504209|5.0|I received this book on Friday and finished reading it by Sunday morning.  It is one of the best page turners I have come across in a long time.  I can't remember when I have been so entertained, enlightened, and engaged in a while.  It has all the things that I love in a book: mystery, suspense, a good education, and art!<br />Other reviewers have commented on avoiding this book if you are Catholic.  I am Catholic and as long as you are open to hearing about some alternative explanations, whether or not you embrace the ideology, then you will enjoy it.  I found the concepts interesting and appreciated the authors use of them in context.<br />While the end is a bit too tidy for my tastes, I can't think of any ending that I would be satisfied wit, especially because I didn't want it to end.
B000002I77|5.0|This cd is groundbreaking in an aspect that hasn't yet been referred to: the union of the more frantic 'Mahavishnu' type soloing ,(McLaughlin, DiMeola) with a more relaxed, blues inflected style,(Clapton,Allman), from Bolin. Up until this moment the two soloing styles had been at odds with each other; the fusion guys thinking the blues-rock guys weren't ambitious enough, the blues guys thinking the fusion guys weren't soulful enough. Bolin was the man for the job of unifying the styles, combining a relaxed bluesy vibrato with chops to spare; still the  hallmark of the best modern soloists.

B00000I07P|5.0|This was the album that put Bon Jovi in the same league with Van Halen, Aerosmith, Ozzy, and KISS. This was the heavy metal album of the 1980's. The big, arena sound was the epic sound of all 80's metal. Bon Jovi was the biggest band of the decade. They may not have been the best, but they had the record sales to say otherwise. This was not \\"pop rock\\". Heavy metal sounded like this in the mid 80's. If you want to get into classic metal, the 80's has just as many classic artists as the 60's and the 70's. This is one album you'll need for your collection.
B000067CPX|4.0|Does anyone else chuckle when others refer to the 91 and 95 albums as \\"Old Chili Peppers\\"? The 1987 record is my favorite. I guess that's what I get for being 31. As has been stated, this is a great album. Lots of melody, hooks, and \\"singing\\". It's apparent that the 1980's Pepper's have left the building. BUT, times change and we all grow up. RHCP's have the same right to change their sound as U2 and others have. It should tell you something that Amazon is trying to sell this with a \\"Dave Matthews\\" album, and not one from \\"Bad Brains\\" or \\"311\\". Anyway, regardless of when you came into the Chili Peppers career, you'll most likely enjoy this. It's good.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Okay, at first I liked this CD, but I really got annoyed by hearing that Vocoder on every other track.  What's more, this is a pretty weak album by Madonna, who's done much better.  The Material Girl is back, but this album could have been so much better.  But I still love her, though.  Try again, Madge!
0375414053|4.0|This book is on the reading list of every working mother I know.  How will they find the time to read it?<br />Kate Reddy is a hedge fund manager with a husband, a fixer-upper townhouse and two children.  She also has a surly nanny, a judgemental mother-in-law, some great friends and her very own philosopher/cab-driver.  There's also a poetic and handsome American client.  The novel deals with Kate's efforts to balance her responsibilities to her job, her kids and her marriage.  It perfectly captures the juggling act required of most working mothers.  I chuckled and gasped many time in recognition.  This is the ideal summer read - fast-paced, funny and honest.<br />My one criticism is that the novel presents only two options for Kate through most of the book - high-stress job with lots of travel or no job at all.  Most working mothers fall somewhere in between.
0790742780|5.0|In this excellent film, Michael Douglas plays Bill Foster, an everyday man working in the everyday world, although he is not the example of the American Dream (which to you older folks, no one ever is). He is divorced, has a high level of rage, has been downsized from his defense worker job, and is being scr##ed over by the system. One day, sitting in his car in a traffic jam during a heat wave, he snaps, and starts to walk home through gangland. He first encounters trouble with the system through a Korean shopkeeper, who charges 85 cents for a can of soda. When the shopkeeper attacks Foster, he takes his bat and smashes up the store, which after he leaves, attracts the attention of the LAPD. Along the way, he accquires a bag of weapons, and the movie becomes real interesting...<br />We all understand what is going through Foster's head, mainly because when a bad day hits its peak, we all, deep down, want to do that to our aggressors. Michael Douglas is great as Foster, while Robert Duvall is equally as great as the detective on his last day, determined to stop Foster. The DVD, however, is horrible (I only got it because it was in the bargain bin). The video and sound are excellent, but the extras are severly lacking. All there is is a trailer that focuses on the comedy elements of the film. A commentary and TV spots would<BR>have been nice!

6305291446|3.0|HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER     (USA - 1998)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS    Now living under an assumed identity as the principal of an exclusive private school in California, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is once again besieged on Halloween night by her murderous brother Michael, who appears to be targeting her grown-up son (Josh Hartnett).    Apparently instigated by Curtis herself in the run-up to the twentieth anniversary of the original HALLOWEEN (1978), and with uncredited script contributions by SCREAM writer Kevin Williamson, HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER was promoted by Dimension Films as the 'final showdown' with boogey man Michael Myers (though its success at the box-office virtually guaranteed even further sequels). An ingenious script - credited to Robert Zappia and Matt Greenberg - simply ignores the lackluster sequels which followed in the wake of HALLOWEEN II (1981) and makes a credible attempt to develop the characters beyond the usual stereotypical boundaries (plagued by nightmares which cause her to fear for Hartnett's safety, Curtis refuses to grant the boy his independence, leading to conflict and tragedy), all of which serves to underline the dramatic impact of Michael's subsequent rampage.     There are too many false scares during the first half of the film (one of which involves Curtis' real life mom Janet Leigh, cast here in a deliberate nod to her appearance in PSYCHO), and the influence of SCREAM and its imitators is evident in the hip dialogue and MTV-style editing, though Daryn Okada's widescreen lensing successfully replicates the look and feel of the first two 'Halloween' movies, and the relentless chase scenes which dominate the second half of the narrative are staged with genuine cinematic flair by director Steve Miner (previously responsible for entries 2 and 3 in the 'Friday the 13th' franchise).     Nancy Stephens reprises her role as a nurse from the original HALLOWEEN in a memorable pre-credits sequence, and Michelle Williams (TV's \\"Dawson's Creek\\") turns up in a supporting role alongside Adam Arkin (\\"Chicago Hope\\") and LL Cool J (DEEP BLUE SEA), while Hartnett (PEARL HARBOR) makes an OK big screen debut as the focus of Michael's psychotic attentions. The film is dedicated to the memory of the late Donald Pleasence.    Followed by HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION (2002).

0452284392|5.0|Linked traces the developers and development of network theory from 1929 to 2002.  Barabasi uniquely combines a sense of the theorist as a person and a personality with a summary of the theory they developed and the constraints it overturned.  He also applies these theories to diverse areas from cellular biology to corporate boardrooms and Asian financial markets.<br />It's easy to see how this book is applicable to Al Qaeda and the current SARS epidemic as well as to your own approach to work.  For example, in Chapter 4: Small Worlds, Barabasi relates the Strength of Weak Ties theory of Granovetter that in finding a job &quot;our weak social ties are more important than our cherished strong friendships.&quot;<br />The most suprising thing about the book is that Barabasi takes a rather boring, paradoxically isolated area of dry intellectual inquiry and manages to convey how exciting and applicable network theory is to everyday life.
0316666343|5.0|It is very rare that I find a novel worthy of such praise.  Seybold did a spectacular job in making her work complete; after reading the entire book I felt as if I knew everything that there was to know regarding the story, and was perfectly content with how the story progressed and ended.  It was positively beautiful and satisfying. The story is about a young girl who is brutally raped and then murdered.  As she looks down from her heaven, she watches her sister and brother and parents adapt to the earth-shattering change that has plummeted into the ocean of their lives...with never ending ripples.  I read this book when I was in Little Cayman with my family.  As I was lying in a hammock, person after person came up to me, talking about the book and how wondeful it was.  Wonderful, amazing, and thought-provoking, Seybold has certainly created a winner.
0385121679|5.0|This has to be Stephen King's masterpiece.  I've always loved the movie (the original film with Nicholson) and I just recently bought the book.  The print version devotes a lot more time to character development and there are considerable differences between the movie and the book.  If you're a fan of the movie, don't deprive yourself of this book!
B0000640VN|5.0|I've enjoyed this film since it was first released in theaters. A time-travel story that focuses on the &quot;leap of love&quot; certainly captivated my interest. And Hugh Jackman as the chilvarous hero didn't hurt either! I had had the VHS version before, but the DVD has so many goodies that I had to get it, and I'm very happy with the investment. The &quot;making of&quot; featurette gives much more insight into Meg Ryan's modern woman, who comes off a bit abrasive at times, but then melts sublimely with Jackman's old-fashioned Leopold. The supporting cast is also first-rate, and the message to savor life (and love) is sweetly apparent. I highly recommend this film if you're looking for some light-hearted, warm and romantic fun.

B0000028RR|5.0|Do you remember watching the mind blowing movie that was 'The Matrix' and witnessing Neo flying off into the sky, meanwhile witnessing one of the 'coolest' music tracks of the past 10 years (Wake Up)?? Well.. i do... and the very next day i went out and bought this album and i WAS REALLY, REALLY impressed. These guys sound so different to every other band at the time, and they mesh pretty well together (reminding me of flea and John from RHCP). Lyrically none can compare to RATM although their later works are more complex although this album showed the world what this band was capable of. Basically, this album is without flaw and all 10 tracks could have been singles if not for this being their debut album. DEFINITELY (and i stress this point!) worth your cash.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Great story but the movie could have been made better.
B000002MP2|5.0|...but I'll add my 2 cents. Yeah, so in 1994 I was 10 when this tape (yes, it was the tape I bought originally and not the CD) came out. I can remember not having the tape and calling and requesting &quot;When I Come Around&quot; over and over at my local radio stations. I remember tape recording all the Green Day videos off MTV that I could. When I finally got the tape I listened to it religiously, it was definently the first album I listened to from the beginning to the end. I could write out every single word without listening to the music. Out of every other album I've got, I've listened to this one 10x as much as my 2nd most played album. I am a lifetime Green Day fan (I own every single CD) and this is their best CD. The reviews are opinions, and in my opinion this is the best album of all-time. Every single music fan should own a copy of Green Day, Dookie.
B00005JLK1|5.0|The story was one of the best ever written. The script was o.k. The directing below medium. It's a story about a ship that was lost for many years and now was discovered by a group of searchers, hiding its secrets tied in it until...
B000060P79|1.0|Yeah, I saw these guys Summer 2002 when I went to the Green Day/Blink-182/Jimmy Eat World concert. I had never heard of them before so I figured I would watch them. They put on a pretty boring show. My friend burned me their CD and I have got to say I think this is the worst CD I have. The vocals are really whiney, simple guitar riffs, and the lyrics...oh my god. They are absolutely terrible. Did the lead singer write these when he was 12? Former BSB and N'Sync fans, now that that trend has passed...here you go. Just remember, no matter how hard you try or how hard the band thinks they are, this is NOT PUNK...this is NOT EVEN POP-PUNK. This is borderline boy-band genre.

B00005YW4H|5.0|When I first heard Norah, I was typing a term paper for my english 101 class and her voice came in. I paused for a moment and decided to see where this voice was coming from.  I went to my television and there I saw, a woman and her piano singing with so much feeling.  I bought her album as soon as it came out in stores, and fell in love with her easy going style.  She's very relaxed, but expresses so much feeling in her voice with out being over bearing; more or less she's free in her voice.  When I listen to her I feel free, and I am able to empathize with her feelings.
B00008WG3U|5.0|The first time I heard this album it seemed slightly unorthodox compared to previous NOFX albums, it still possesses the lyrics that fat mike is legendary for but the music seems more melodious in contrast to their prior albums. Songs like 'must separate church and skate' and 'regaining unconsciousness' still rock the place up, but then there are 'Franco un-American' and 'medio-core' which pleasantly surprised me and provided NOFX with yet another well rounded original album to add to their collection of master pieces! This is definitely one my favourite NOFX albums and is a definite for any fan of the band or the punk scene in general. \\"They may be getting ripe\\" but theyre certainly stopping me from being bored (extract from matersville).
B000084T18|1.0|He's no Biggie &amp; definately no 2Pac, but he's got a new refreshing style to be called his own.

He definately has those club bangers, and radio hits!
B00005JM03|5.0|The actors were great! The lines were well written! This movie has it all: comedy, action, romance, drama, suspense, and of course the gorgeous Mr. Edward Norton. It's worth watching just to see the stunts they do with those cars!

But, oh darn, I just can't resist: Think The Lucy Show meets Ian McCulloch and Bauhaus (or Tones on Tail). Think Radio Head born ten years earlier. Think Soho (New York, that is - or London) at 3am on a wintry, silent, snowbound night. Release yourself from bands whose names sound like the captions over the head of an Adam West 'Batman' fight (i.e. Strokes, Blur, Hives, et al).<br />I admit it, I was just old enough to drink when Echo and the Bunnymen, New Order (fresh off their tragic JD experience), Chameleons UK, Sisters of Mercy, Robert Smith and the lads first blew through various small venues in early 80s L.A. But I can tell you what: Interpol has the vibe.<br />For those of you born after Reagan became president, here are a few Interpol predecessors you might check out (other than the obvious bands already mentioned in reviews here): The Lucy Show, Chameleons UK, Killing Joke (&quot;What's This For?), Echo and the Bunnymen's import 'Heaven Up Here', Wall of Voodoo's first album.

B0000844I8|4.0|Before they achieved success with the idiotic Independence Day, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spawned this mind numbing sci-fi hit which would inspire a much more intelligent hit cable TV series.  James Spader stars as an Egyptologist who, along with Kurt Russell and his band of troops, are sent to the otherside of the known universe courtesy of an interdimensional transportation device called the Stargate.  Once there, they discover a culture much like that of ancient Egypt which is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson) who uses his boyish appearance to cover up his alien form.  When the film was released it was roasted by many a critic, but as the dynamic duo of Emmerich and Devlin later proved with Independence Day, it's the box office receipts that matter.  The special effects still hold up today, and the action scenes are rousing as well despite the hokey and lacking screenplay.  This seems like the umpteenth release of Stargate on DVD; first the Special Edition, now this Ultimate Edition; what's next the Super Extreme Edition?  Anyway, Artisan usually makes good and affordable DVD's (this one is no exception) but for God's sake, quit re-releasing and re-releasing just for the sake of more extras and different packaging.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album showed us Metallica's natural knack for being able to show musical, as well as lyrical evolution. Nearly gone are the fun, immature lyrics about partying, battles, urban warfare and Satanism. The album kicks off with \\"Fight fire with fire\\" and while sounding generic, offers some great drumming and very good soloing from Kirk Hammet. The title track is a timeless opus that features clever songwriting and more good soloing. \\"For whom the bell tolls\\" is a slow, plodding, melodic, groove oriented masterpiece. \\"Fade to black\\" is an intelligent, depressing ballad that doesn't fall into sappy cliches. \\"Trapped under ice\\" (which has a great chorus) is my personal favorite. Another great underrated tune is \\"Escape\\". \\"Creeping death\\" features good lyrics, and nice tempo changes. The album finishes with a bang with \\"The call of Ktulu\\", which is a patented Metallica style instrumental. It's a perfect outro in my opinion. Well, that's it! I hope people take this review to heart.
B0000032LS|3.0|RHPS is awesome. It just seriously [upset me] to find that this didn't have \\"Sword of Damocles\\" or \\"Planet, Schmanet, Janet\\".<br />... Buy one of the OTHER albums. I took off two stars, because it is completely and totally unforgiveable to neglect two songs from the full version, yet put on \\"Superheroes\\". BUY ONE OF THE OTHER SOUNDTRACKS. They come with booklets, as well, unlike this one.
B00005V331|5.0|Without this band, Thrash, Black, and Death metal ( and I'm talking about real Death metal, not Grindcore) would not exist. They were never the most skilled of musicians, but their influence on these three subgenres is undeniable. This band broke new ground in the way that they had a raw, primative, brutal, sound which had never been heard before in the Metal world which is evident in \\"Poison\\", \\"Live like an angel\\", \\"Witching hour\\", \\"One thousand days in Sodom\\", and \\"In league with Satan\\". It's a shame that such an influential band has gone so underrated over the years. Slayer fans take note: Without this band, you wouldn't be enjoying \\"Hell awaits\\" and \\"Reign in blood\\", so try to show a little mutual respect. Listen to this album if you want to hear the the roots of these three subgenres. ...
B000062XGJ|5.0|I REALLY LIKE ARNOLD AND I LOVED THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE.  IT IS<BR>A VERY INTERESTING AND WELL &quot;FXED&quot; MOVIE.  THE DVD IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE VHS BECAUSE OF CLEARITY.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HAVING THIS AS PART OF YOUR SCHWARZENEGGER COLECTION......
0385504209|5.0|I just finished \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" today, and it would not have taken me so long if I had had the time to just read it straight through. Dan Brown knows the secret to constructing a real page turner, and I hold him personally responsible for my lack of sleep.  This is a masterpiece of suspense and nonfiction conspiracy theory that will leave you with a number of unanswered questions. I loved it, and will no doubt read it again. As advice to anyone looking into this title, get a book of Da Vinci's paintings. You will not regret it. In fact, the only true reason I ever put this book down was to check to see if the clues were really true. They were. Only \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Conquest of Paradise\\", with their similar levels of heightened suspense, have ever moved me so far to the edge of my seat.  Dan Brown is certainly someone to be celebrated!
B000063DI9|5.0|This album was the 1st Maiden album I bought back in 1994. I knew the band before, but I was more interested in 80's pop stuff.<br />I think this is a very special album, and is able to reflect what Iron Maiden is in just 40 minutes. If you are 1st listening to Iron, I recommend that you begin with this one. Mythical lyrics, great atmosphere, and changes of the tempos of the songs. It's a progressive style, and it is so much melodic. During some guitar solos it sends shivers down your spine. Maiden used to play the solos in a &quot;dual style&quot; and in this album you may find the best examples for that. The keyboard arrangements were used so cleverly that they only help you to get more into the atmosphere. Also the quality of the record is really good, it doesn't sound outdated even today.<br />When I first bought it I listened to it non-stop for hours. There's something with this album, it just becomes your best friend. <br />I think Maiden's best era was between Killers - Seventh Son. With this album they just peaked what they have been doing from the late 70's. Of course, Maiden still brings out some good stuff, even today. But it is impossible, for any band, to come near to this. No song by song comments. This record should be comprehended as a whole. All the lyrics are related, and the music is, in a word, awesome.
1400034779|4.0|This is a delightful novel.. Life seems so peaceful in Botswana, in spite of the problems brought to Precious's delightful detective agency.  You will love the setting and the characters.
0140282033|2.0|I started reading this book when my book club chose it.  I wasn't too thrilled about reading it, because of some other reviews I read, but I thought I would give it a shot.<br />I didn't like the change in person in the book.  The author kept changing who was talking.  One chapter it would be Vianne (the owner of the chocolate shop) and then the next chapter would be the priest.  Both talkers would talk in the first person, (I did this...) and so it got a bit confusing.  The only saving grace was that in the edition I had, the font was different.<br />Second, there was quite a bit of french in the book. There was no translation, so if someone like me, who hasn't had any French training, it was complete confusion!  I had no idea what they said...I would have to go to a translation website or dictionary, and this was a royal pain!  It slows down the reading.<br />Finally, I really enjoyed the movie, because it flowed much better than the book.  There are scenes in the book that aren't in the movie and scenes in the movie that weren't in the book.  I think the scenes in the movie worked better and weren't as confusing.<br />I wouldn't recommend buying this book.  Borrow it from your library instead, and then only if you need to read it.
B00000K19E|5.0|I have seen many reviews on 'The Matrix' that don't discuss what makes it such a kick-ass movie. I don't know if it is because people are too ignorant to see past the kung-fu or it is really that hard to grasp.<br />'The Matrix' is NOT a remake of any other movie (see some review below) and it is NOT an easy movie to watch and grasp. I believe that this is an underground movie, that appeals to the masses due to the action, because unless you really sit down and turn on the subtitles, you miss what makes 'The Matrix' so awesome. People have said to me before that the first hour sucks because there isn't much action but in all truth, it is the first hour that contains the philosophical elements, biblical allusions, and backgorunds that leave you totally awestruck. <br />I have also seen reviews that say the acting sucked, which is total bull, because many have played their best roles to date in this movie.<br />All in all, please don't watch this movie unless you want a deep, thought-provoking movie, because if you sit down to see the action, you miss the parts of the movie that took the most work and thought. If you watch it with an open mind, you will become transfixed like I was in the thought that went into the screenplay and cinematics.<br />Once you understand what i am talking about, the movie will make sense, and so will the fact that the Wachowski brothers have created a masterpiece that should rank in the top ten in our movie libraries for a long time.<br />Don't forget to listen to the commentaries, watch the extras, 'take the red pills,' and follow the White Rabbit.<br />\\"I can only show you the door, you must open it for yourself.\\"<BR>                                        -Morpheus
0316666343|2.0|This book has circulated Juneau, Alaska this past year, and I read it on the recommendation of a friend who couldn't put it down.  Me?  I had a very difficult time wading through it!  I just couldn't get into it . . . didn't like the story line . . . and didn't like the concepts the book was dealing with.  After talking with several people who read it, we've learned it's one of those books a person either loves or hates.
0671027387|4.0|Deception Point is fast-paced, and hard to put down. Plot twists are surprising. Characters are well defined, as far as they go. This story would have gotten a five star rating but for its contradiciton of keeping NASA under government control. 'Government science' is a contradiction in terms. Force and Mind are opposites. Still, this was a great read. Worth your time.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Well all I can say is AWESOME!!!!!!! I am watching it as I write this, \\"Thats the Way\\" from Earls Court(1975) is playing and it makes feel like crying because its so beautiful.....Plant looks like a flower child with those golden locks flowing around his shoulders... Page is a god with that acoustic guitar, plucking out chords and smiling. JPJ is a hell of a bass player and his mandolin is crying into my ears..... John Bonham is a drumming machine thats never ending, Moby Dick is a thunderous wall of sound smashing my eardrums and I love it..... No doubt these guys were kings in the 70s.... If I had children I would make them watch this DVD till they knew every song by heart.... I know they would never listen to rap music after seeing this musical phenomenon...... BUY THIS DVD AND ENJOY MUSIC AT ITS BEST..... LONG LIVE THE MIGHTY ZEPPELIN!!!!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|As with TFOTR, there is going to be a \\"special extended edition\\" the The Two Towers released around November.  Why spend your money twice? ...unless you think that 3.5 hours was a long enough movie, and don't really care about all the extra scenes.  In my opinion, the extended version of Fellowship was a thousand times better, and well worth the wait.
B000063JDE|4.0|When I first saw Blue Velvet back in 1986, I couldn't understand what was so special about it.  Now seeing it again in 2003 I can begin to appreciate it. I say that, because it's difficult to interpret David Lynch films.  I think the best approach is to just take it in, don't try to think too much about it, and then think more about it later.  Blue Velvet isn't as complex as Mullholland Drive, but it still requires some thought.  Awesome performances from Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rosellini.<br />DVD SUMMARY:<BR>This is where we have hit the jackpot!  Fantastic transfer to DVD. Some great extras too, but also a sad revelation that Lynch originally shot 4 hours of film but was requested to trim it down to a 2 hour film.  Apparently the other 2 hours are now lost.  Let's hope they find it one day.  The DVD provides a montage of some of this 'lost' footage.  In a nutshell, the montage is pure gold for fans of this film.
B00005JLWN|5.0|All right, so it is a little cheesy in certain areas, and has a somewhat weak beginning, but gee golly is it cool! If you ignore the depressing parts and the rather goofy areas, it's a totally nifty movie! I was all set to dub it as just an &quot;okay&quot; movie to watch when bored, until of course I got to the end.  I won't ruin it for anyone, but I LOVED the ending, it just made me sooo happy and I wound up cheering for the whole darn thing.  So you should definitely check it out.
B000089RVX|2.0|As far as the music is concerned, some of it sounds like Linkin Park and some of it sounds like Tori Amos. So no new musical horizons are explored here (and if I were in a band just starting out, I think I would make every effort NOT to sound like Linkin Park).  I have read how many listeners are just gushing over Amy Lee's lyrics, so I had to find out for myself.  I sat down and read all the lyrics top to bottom, and for me there is simply way too much &quot;I can still see your face&quot; and &quot;I cant erase this pain&quot; and &quot;I feel so empty&quot; and &quot;I am screaming and bleeding&quot;...blah blah blah.  There are a few moments where the words show a tad of artistry, but most of the time it justs like the frustrated rants of a teenager.  I would venture that most people who praise Evanescence could write their own lyrics that would sound a whole like like Amy Lee's without too much effort.  I personally think a professional artist should be held to a higher standard than the common masses, but that isnt true here.  She might sound a little like Tori Amos, but its going to be a while before she can think like Tori Amos.
0316548189|4.0|Nelson Mandela was a legend.  Putting his life in an autobiography doesn't even do justice to it.  However, it is a very well written book and shows Nelson Mandela's high level of intelligence distinctly.  The events of this man's life, portrayed in vivid detail in his book, have rocked the foundation of the entire world.  No piece of literature recaps such an influential life as Mandela's with such accuracy and powerful detail as A Long Walk to Freedom.  The book may seem extraordinarily long and boring at first and resemble nothing more than another political biography, but this book is unlike any other book of its kind.  Straight from the beginning, Mandela describes his mostly uneventful childhood in a surprisingly interesting fashion, which is a great quality for snaring new readers.  The vivid retelling of many insane events as Mandela approached the climax of his political career is the trademark of his skilled writing, and brought on a flow of renewed interest before one could suspect the plot was dead.  The inclusion of countless crimes against humanity in the book, are the masterpiece behind its immensely famous influential power.  The description of these events allowed me to see on the same level as Mandela and gradually understand why he was permanently devoted to the struggle.  Nelson Mandela had no problem asserting the importance of his beliefs and justifying on a human level why his feelings and actions were pointed in the right direction.  This book asserts that the highest importance in life is freedom, and from reading about the many woes of the oppressed South Africans, one can see that this book makes an effort to show that the opposite of freedom will always be unethical mayhem.  This book should be read by anyone who understands it and wants to read it; I guarantee it will influence your views in some way and really have you thinking.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I don't know but I just love this movie! It's so great. I really like how the prince is able to break through the social barriers. The evil step-mom and the evil step-sister are just so incredibly cruel, it's so believable! All of the actors and actresses are perfectly cast. Oh my god the step-mom is PERFECT! And Drew Barrymore presents a very strong performance. I don't own this, but I sure would like to buy it. It's worth your time to watch this, and it's great that after over 700 reviews here on amazon.com it has maintained a perfect 5 star rating! You know why it has? Because the movie is really really good! It's highly recommended. Oh yeah, and just because it says \\"A Cinderella Story\\" don't expect a Fairy God Mother and a pumpkin turning into a carriage. It's just a real life - ish story. I love it! ENJOY!!!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is long overdue.  Led Zeppelin was famous for having a very distant and strained relationship with the press and media, and as a result very little is available of their live performances.  Other than the \\"Song Remains the Same\\", there have been some bootlegs, but nothing official.  This set is worth the wait, although it just really whets the appetite for material not included here.<br />Disc one contains some rare early footage, including some rather weak TV spots.  The highlight of the first disc for me was the encore section of the Royal Albert Hall show in 1970.  The blues inspired and feel of \\"Bring It On Home\\" is captured flawlessly, as are the two covers that proceed it.  They really could play blues and `50's rock and roll with the best of them.  Despite some classic recordings and performances from the very early days on disc one, the best of the set is disc two.<br />Disc two is amazing.  The songs left over from the Madison Square Garden show that is the center of their previous DVD release \\"Song Remains the Same\\", are truly gems.  In particular the slow and burning blues of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" are played perfectly, as is \\"The Ocean\\" a lively rock and roll single.  The set that follows, Royal Albert Hall in 1975, contains one of their all time great songs in my opinion, \\"That's The Way\\", done in an acoustic set, and another classic rendition of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.  The disc builds to the 1979 Knebworth shows, the last tour for them.  My only complaint is that the 7 songs from that show are not nearly enough.  The highlight for me is the (then new) song \\"In The Evening\\".  Also of interest are the music video's, listed as \\"promo's.  Included is one of the rarest and best of their recordings, \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\".<br />If you are at all a fan of Led Zeppelin, then this DVD set is worth every penny.  One hopes there is enough material remaining to produce at least one more of these.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I cannot say that OK Computer is the greatest album I have ever heard because albums like Kid A, London Calling, and The Doors will always be a part of me.  This does not make them more or less important than OK Computer.  OK Computer opened me up to different musical styles, at the same time expanded my mind.  It gave me a feeling I cannot put in plain words.  I have seen and heard art through visual and musical, yet I have never felt it.  It was, and still is, a truly stunning feeling.  No one will is or will be as amazing as Radiohead.
B00006LJ79|5.0|This is one of the best CD's that has been relesed in years!! my favorite songs on the CD is \\"All the things she said\\" and <BR>Not gonna get us\\" and Clowns (can you see me now) I highly recomend this CD to Everyone!
B000007T1M|5.0|First of all, i'll admit that I had not heard of System Of A Down until Chop Suey! but who cares... After I bought Toxicity I really enjoyed it, great guitar riffs, awesome drumming and crazy vocals, I decided I would find out more about this band and then I came across this album! It is miles better than Toxicity and Steal This Album! The reason it is better is because System Of A Down use thier talent more in this album. In Toxicity and Steal This Album there are few if not a single guitar solo and the vocals are less diverse. This album ranges from carnival sounds (Peephole) to slow, haunting ballads (Spiders). Serj and Darons great harmonizing is apparant (P.L.U.C.K - best song on the album).There are some filler tracks (CUbert,Ddevil) that are too short and just a bit too basic in terms of thought being put into it (\\"Loud and noisy, strong refridgerators!\\" - Ddevil) and some great solos (Soil, Peephole)<br />Overall I rate this album 9/10 as it lacks focus at times but hey, they were all off thier heads when they did this album so there's an axcuse....<br />Go and buy this album!!!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Ok,  I will admit that I miss Christine's sonic pop vocals and radio friendly songs weaved into the Mac mix but there is absolutely no denying that this is a awesome record without her.  Fleetwood Mac is a rarity in the music world and each member brings something different into the fold that is magical...whether it's Stevie's haunting vocals and valentine lyrics (the songs here are the best she has done in years) or Lindsey's underated genious studio wizardry and brilliant (if not spellbounding) guitar playing.<br />Way to often, there is never enough mention of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie's invaluble contibution's to the Mac sound....and one doesn't have to listen closely for the distinctive drums and bass that complete's thier counter parts.<br />Nearly every song on this disc is infectious!  Highlight's are songs like THROWN DOWN ( having heard the original demo....this version comes alive!) and SAY YOU WILL that is bound to change the music climate on the airwaves...PEACEKEEPER gives off the feel of one of those late night summer drives with the top down getting lost in the vocals...but the song is a clear message fitting in these strange times ( still think he's referring to the missle)...as you near the end of the CD it just keeps getting better with Lindsey's beautiful STEAL YOUR HEART AWAY and my personal favorite BLEED TO LOVE HER to Steve's pop rock fusion's of RUNNING THROUGH THE GARDEN and the absolute gems EVERYBODY FINDS OUT (crank this up every time!)and DESTINY RULES (it don't get much better than this!!!) But, saving the best for last, there is no better closers than Lindsey's dreamy SAY GOODBYE (gives me chill bump's to here those two whisper through this song)and Stevie's tearful, GOODBYE BABY.  Make's you sometimes wonder who they are actually singing to?  The drama continues and god bless you guys for it!!!!
0066214122|5.0|This book, which I hope gets turned into another Crichton blockbuster, shows how dangerous things will get in the near future.<br />Michael Crichton says in the introduction to the novel: \\"Sometime in the twenty-first century, our self-deluded recklessness will collide with our growing technological power. One area where this will occur is in the meeting point of nanotechnology, biotechnology, and computer technology. What all three have in common is the ability to release self-replicating entities into the environment.\\"<br />This idea that we will soon have weapons that can make copies of themselves is troubling!<br />One of the last sentences of the novel says: \\"'They didn't understand what they were doing.' I'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race.\\" <br />Michael Crichton is obviously warning us that weapons that can make copies of themselves could cause the DEATH of the human race. Powerful stuff!<br />I actually got my book for free since I am a member of the Lifeboat Foundation. They are taking his book so seriously that they are trying to get some people off the planet before this weapon is unleashed!<br />A nonfiction book that discusses such dangers is \\"Our Final Hour: A Scientist's Warning: How Terror, Error, and Environmental Disaster Threaten Humankind's Future In This Century-On Earth and Beyond\\" by Martin Rees. I recommend this book as well!
B00004RJ71|5.0|The story was epic...and unpredictable till the end. The musical score Beautiful and perfectly woven into the film. Jimmy Baca's first attempt at a screenplay was nothing short of Amazing. Few movies have moved me like this one... even the 100th time seeing it.

And yes, I too have found myself saying the quotes all the time.. \\"Vatos locos, foerver carnal!\\" You shouldn't be in here babycakes\\", \\"does it snow in LA?\\"... Too many to list...

B00004RD54|5.0|It doesn't matter if Lou Reed talks this album down, the opening number \\"Intro/Sweet Jane\\" remains one of the most riveting and powerful pieces of live rock and roll ever recorded.  The rest of the album has its moments but imminently forgettable as simply another live album with all the usual foibles.  Saying that, \\"Intro/Sweet Jane\\" is still worth the price of admission alone.<br />The piece starts out as a sweet teasing duet interplay between two solo guitars.  Each artist taking the lead separately and then combining for brief periods, lingering questioning themes.  Eventually drums and bass enter the growing crescendo of sound.  And it builds and builds and builds until the guitars growl and snarl with an urgency and fury that is rarely heard.  The playing is so incredibly tight, controlled and yet electrifyingly alive.  <br />When they finally kick into the thundering chord riffs of \\"Sweet Jane\\" with the sound volume pegging the meters, you sense Lou Reed coming on stage, stepping up to the mic.  When Reed delivers in his signature precise, crisp, clipped style...\\"Standing on a corner\\", ...at that moment, you are a \\"ROCK N ROLL ANIMAL\\".
B0000042H4|1.0|The music is too long and boring. Give me an Italian opera anytime. Wagner is not my cup of tea.
0385504209|5.0|A remarkable book, reminiscent of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum and also Eco's Name of the Rose.  A Havard symbologist, Robert Langdon, is summoned by French police to the Louvre, where the chief curator has been murdered.  Langdon initially believes that the police are looking for his help, but with the help of French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, realizes that he is a suspect, and has unwittingly stumbled onto an age-old mystey -- and to solve the murder and prove his innocence, he must do no less than find the Holy Grail.<br />The book has numerous word puzzles that Robert and Sophie must solve enroute to finding the grail, with the assistance of a rather eccentric British grail enthusiast.  The book hits much of the ground covered by Baigent and Leigh in their conspiracy classic, \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", as the two race to discover the secret of the grail and its mysterious guardians, the Prieur de Sion, ahead of ruthless rivals including a devout, yet murderous, albino monk from the conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei.<br />Many people consider the book anti-Catholic, and one wonders why Brown felt he had to single out a real Catholic organization to provide his villains, but Brown does carefully exculpate the organizations in the end through a series of plot twists, preventing serious religious fury, and no doubt, some lawsuits.<br />Nevertheless, the book is a rich tapestry of fascinating facts about Leonardo da Vinci, several of whose works figure in the plot clues, as well as taking a stroll through ground Grail conspiracy researchers know well -- the Louvre, St. Sulpice Cathedral, the Temple Church in London, and Rosslyn Chapel.<br />Devout Catholics will no doubt find the book disturbing, for it is not sympathetic to the church.  It is, however, a fascinating mystery, and  lot of fun for those who love conspiracies.
0385504209|5.0|Attracted by the window display at Borders Michigan Avenue in Chicago ..., I ventured into the store not knowing that I was in for four nights of sleeplessness.  For an art aficionado like myself (though not particularly crazy about the Mona Lisa or da Vinci), the plot was a definite hook.  And after reading a similarly riveting religious thriller, &quot;Conquest of Paradise&quot;, I was intrigued to delve further into the genre.  The very first page of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; reels you into its grasp to embark on a journey much like peeling away layers upon layers of mysteries and clues. The prose is taut, the dialogue crisp, and the narrative tight, encouraging you to turn page after page. You've heard it said before, but the writing makes you feel as if you are part of the scene, witnessing - albeit silently and anonymously from some dusty, shadowy corner - the world in which the characters roam. Sensational stuff, though the ending leaves me wanting to write an additional chapter or two to satisfy the urge to see what the Da Vinci Code fuss is all about, I am nevertheless looking forward to Dan Brown's next novel. Bravo!
B00005AQE8|5.0|The efforts that made this album come to life are to be honored, never before and i doubt that there will ever be an album to blow the market as this one. All Eyez on Me offers pure music, lyrics of reality, pain and hardships. since 1996, i never ceased to listen to this album. The Variety found in this phenomenon is outstanding, from Songs of pain to songs of joy and refreshment. When Tupac released this album, he surely wanted it to be perfect by all means for that he perfomed like a True king, never missed a beat and never had a word out of place. To me, This album never left my CD Changer, never a day passes without me listening to it. till this day, this album stays above all as a true street rap, that comes charched with feelings of hatred, sadness, misery, joy and love. As A Rapper my self, i never be ashamed to consider tupac as an Inspiration source, his poem-like lyrics are just overwhelming, this album isn't just for Rap/Hiphop fans, it's for everyone who wishes to know how is it like to be a survivor, it's for those who are willing to hear words coming out of a burden-charged heart.<br />Spotlight on:<BR>- California Love<BR>- Life Goes On<BR>- I Ain't Mad At Cha<BR>- Only God Can Judge Me Now
B0000041Q3|5.0|To the critic who is going on and on that Sills and Caballe are  better than Sutherland as a singer. What is the purpose of this? I thought this forum is to talk about and review this very much loved opera of Puccini and their great interpreters. One of best Turandot being Sutherland. <br />You say that Sills and Caballe have better techniques and more beautiful voices than Sutherland. But do they sing Turandot? If not, please don't bore us with your jealousy and immaturity.<br />You are obviously a very bitter person who can't take the fact the Sutherland is a very beloved singer. And what have Joan done to you for you to just plain put her down? What is your problem?<br />I've never wrote a review before but your hatred of our Joan is childish and can't go unchallenge.<br />This forum is for fans to let the world know how much they like or dislike an opera like Turandot. Not a place to promote Beverly Sills, a bel canto singer who can't even sing Turandot.<br />Being only 19 I've never heard Sills sing. If you want to compare her to Sutherland in bel canto operas. Do it in a bel canto opera like Lucia, not Turandot. Your comments here only show you to be very childish. <br />Grow up.
6304711875|1.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever scene. Don't these people know that this was intended to be a spoof on the slasher films. This was hysterical. I gave it one star to let people know that it wasn't scary. If you want scary see The Ring, The Exorcist, and Halloween.
0792841344|2.0|When Jody Pearson attends the funeral of a friend his 13 year old brother Michael spies from a distance with a pair of binoculars.  After the funeral Michael discovers something very strange, a tall man lifting the 500 pound coffin with Jody's body inside by himself.  Michael reports this to an old fortune teller who in return teaches Michael to push himself despite his fears.  On a night when Jody's in the graveyard with a strange girl that he met at a local bar, Michael follows them.  At the graveyard Michael is attacked by some strange short creatures and this leads to Michael launching his own investigation of the graveyard and the funeral home.  However, Michael finds something far more disturbing than what he expected.  Phantasm is a horror film that does not provide much horror for the audience, since the stiff and unnatural acting by the casts limits the authentic feel of fear within the characters.  In addition, the story sometimes feels incoherent and choppy, which makes the cinematic experience more difficult than enjoyable or horrifying.
B000070IXT|3.0|Resident Evil will probably never win any awards for subtly, acting or writing but it does satisfy the urge to watch an interesting horror movie. The original game was really a knock off of the concept from a number of previous movies (Night of the Living Dead, Warning Sign among many others). It's lack of originality is more than made up for with an imaginative production design and nicely paced narrative.<br />The plot is as simple as the game. There's dangerous research going on in the Hive. Someone has stolen a lethal virus that turns whomever it kills into flesh eating zombies. A crew is sent in to discover what's happened to the Hive when the computer shuts it down killing the infected staff of 500 workers.<br />It's clear that Paul Anderson's film owes a huge debt to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. While George Romero chose to inject an element of savage satire into his trio of films, Anderson plays his film as a straight ahead thriller. There's lots of close ups of gruesome things. The most clever and original element in this film is making the persona of the central computer into a little girl.<br />This isn't anything heartwarming or original about Resident Evil but it's a fun thrill ride for fans of the original game. It's a pity that Anderson chose not to add any additional subtext to the film as it would have given him and his performers more to work with given the thin narrative. This superbit edition has improved resolution (particularly noticable on a progressive DVD player and HDTV) when compared to the previous, regular editon. Is it worth buying again and paying more money for? Frankly, given the film itself probably not. It's not a surprise to see this film released in the superbit format (vs. more deserving films)as Hollywood has learning to fleece customers many times for \\"new improved\\" product.
0316548189|5.0|I was required to read Long Walk to Freedom for a class in school.  I had heard from students who were previously required to read the book that it was too long, and very bad.  I did not go into this book with high expectations, which made Long Walk to Freedom  a pleasant surprise.  <br />   Written by Nelson Mandela over the course of several years, beginning with a first draft written in prison (which was lost to authorities), the book covers each stage of Nelson's life.  Beginning with his early childhood in an African tribe, through his education and career as one of the first black lawyers of Africa, and eventually his decision to join the famed political party, the African National Congress, where Nelson began his struggle for equal rights for his people.  From there Nelson goes on to describe his life fighting for the freedom of the native people of Africa.  Harassed and `banned' by the authorities for his actions, Mr. Mandela's struggle is not an easy one.  He would be put on trial three separate times for crimes stemming from his political views, his third trial landing him a life sentence.  But with Nelson's natural resiliency in bad situations, and nations all over the world calling for his release, he did not fear spending the rest of his life in prison.  His years spent in prison would be long and hard, but he knew upon his release that the long walk to freedom would near an end.  <br />   The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela is written well, and its length is not of issue, especially when taking into account how expansive the story of his life really is.  The pacing of the story is actually very well done, years are written away in a few pages without anything seeming to be missed.  In my opinion, even if this book had the worst writing of any novel, it would still be worth reading; its story holds so much importance and teaches so much about so many aspects of life, that it would lose nothing.  <br />   Long Walk to Freedom leaves one feeling refreshed; if the racist policies of the government of an entire nation can be taken down by a group of common citizens, perhaps there is hope for reform in any nation that is going through a period of strife.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is one of the few movies which really made me think. The idea behind the movie is amazing - taking the whole story backwards.<br />And the part when the present and past (the backward story and the frontward story) connect is shown brilliantly.<br />The movie is about a guy who can't remember anything for more than five minutes - and so he makes notes, tattoos his body, and uses polaroids to assist him. He remembers that his wife has been raped. And so he goes after the killer for revenge. But it is difficult due to his memory.<br />And this is made more interesting as the whole movie is shown in a reverse order.<br />After the movie got over - I sat for hours thinking about it. And I re saw the movie the next day to understand it better. And you know what - it was more fun the second time - as I started getting a clearer picture.<br />How many movies can you see two times and say - that was just mind blowing?
B00005JLSE|5.0|Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is arrested for murder of her husband and her sister that she has just committed.  Roxie Hart (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) sees Velma's last performance at the Vaudeville Theater as she dreams of her own fame.  Roxie works hard to achieve her dream by cheating with a furniture salesman, but something goes wrong and she kills the salesman.  Through the hard way, Roxie learns that everything is run by Matron 'Mama' Morton (Queen Latifah) and she meets Velma who is still seeking fame from within the prison through Mama.  When Roxie finds out that she might get hanged she seeks help and Mama informs Roxie that she should get William 'Billy' Flynn (Richard Gere) as her lawyer, since he has never lost a case.  Over a night, Mr. Flynn turns the nobody killer Roxie into a star by tweaking the truth to what the news media wants to hear.  In the process, Velma falls into the shadow and becomes desperate to get back into the light of fame.  Chicago is an interesting film, since it implies the audience as a driving factor in the search for fame within the main characters of the film.  In addition, the film's musical and dancing elements boost the messages to such an extent that the messages become easily comprehendible.  The editing also increases the tempo of the film as well as the score.  Lastly, the cast helps provide a brilliant cinematic experience that is enjoyable for everyone, even those who usually don't enjoys musicals.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is an essential addition to your DVD collection.  I have always had a hard time believing that Stephen King - the horror writer of our times - could write such a beautiful story of friendship, determination, and drama.  It it perhaps the only story that I know of by King that has a wonderful ending that will bring tears to a grown man's eyes.  This is just that kind of movie that if you haven't seen it, you are definitely missing something!  Buy your copy today!
0385334206|4.0|I reviewed this book about a year ago but over that time have turned the story over in my mind enough to warrant another look. The story, I stated previously, is sub-par compared to Vonnegut's other works (Slaughterhouse, Cradle) and ultimately is a mess. Though I maintain that this is indeed an accurate description, I must submit to the possibility that such was in actuality intentional and that indeed many of the ideas presented outright in the novel merely constitute the very surface of what the author may truly be attempting to express.<br />If the works of Kurt Vonnegut have taught me anything at all, they have taught me this... If one fails as an artist to communicate any given idea or experience, their next goal by default as one who aspires to bring any meaning into existence is to communicate or express the tale of that failure. As much as I hate to admit it, this lends some logic to the Roman Catholic outlook on existence... Perhaps then, in the artistic realm, confession indeed purifies the soul. If one cannot skillfully tell the story that God or the divine does or does not exist, perhaps then the story of their failure will lend some important insight on the complexity of that particular riddle.<br />In light of this, and because nearly all of Vonnegut's works touch on this idea, the concept that \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is not what it appears to be can be considered valid. What then is this story about? I have my own theories, but perhaps they are incorrect.<br />This then is the tale of the destiny of a fictional character when presented with the role of communicating a singularity of meandering ideals, philosophies, and perspectives born of a society which amid it's evolution into chaos has grown inhumane, presented by an artist unwilling to chain everything into a working model of the divine or profound because of the equally terrifying possibilities of inhumanity and insanity. THIS then is the story of \\"KILGORE TROUT\\".<br />As I have stated perhapsI am wrong. If you read it however, consider for a moment everything Vonnegut brings up in his chaotic dictation on America and humanity. How could all of these ideas ever come together? Remember too that the story begins with a line from the biblical story of Job, a human born to suffer the torture of God to prove a point to Lucifer. Could you do the same to poor Job? What would it mean about humanity? What would it mean about God?
0316548189|4.0|Long Walk to Freedom is the autobiography of Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest leaders of South Africa.  It gives a detailed account of his childhood, youth, and adulthood.  It takes you through his years in college and his work as a lawyer as well as all of his political struggles with apartheid including his years in jail.  <BR>The book is extremely well written and gives the detail that only someone who witnessed the events could posses.  Mandela's hindsight as he reviews the events of his life shows a more personal side to him.  I liked the book but anyone who is considering reading it should be reminded that it is an autobiography so it does have a bias. He wrote the book as someone who had been wronged.  Long Walk To Freedom provides an interesting and detailed account of the South Africans struggle with apartheid.  It details Nelson's joining of the ANC (African National Congress) his rise in the ANC, and his creation of the MK.  It also gives facts about his personal life and the life of his family.  It is recommended to anyone who enjoys autobiographies or to anyone who is looking to learn more about the history of apartheid and South Africa.
B00005JL78|4.0|I really applaud Steven Spielberg for this one. It shows even that one of the most legendary directors will not settle on his trademark &quot;look&quot; and that he is willing to challenge and push himself to do something different. The first half hour of watching this I was amazed that this was a Steven Spielberg film. The style is dark and gritty and the main character is flawed. To compare this movie to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is unfair even though that is the first thing that will come to most viewers minds. But both movies undeniably have Dashel Hammet's influence throughout. The action and pace is great and there really is not a dull moment in the film. Tom Cruise gives us one of his standard performances. Which is to say that he does a good job, just not a great one like Magnolia or Born on the 4th of July. I also enjoyed seeing Max Von Sydow on screen again.<br />The features on the DVD are interesting, but there wasn't really anything special. I did like the segment on the hovercraft and the segment on the look and feel of the film. <br />Yes you could pick this one apart and over analyze the premise of the film, but don't. Just relax and let it take you for a really fun ride. Top-notch film that's done by the best.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I'm amazed this movie didn't make it to the big screen, it deserves top billing!  Beyond the exceptional Zen, sci-fi, martial arts moves, and stunning performance by gorgeous Christian Bale, this movie has an intense message, \\"Uniformity at the expense of one's emotions, makes one lose what it is to be human.\\"  On many levels, this movie reminded me of Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", Vonnegut's \\"Harrison Bergeron\\", Orwell's \\"1984\\",  and Huxley's \\"A Brave New World\\".<BR>This movie portrays the future as a cold, sterile, charred place, where everyone conforms to one mind, one order; under the rule of the one they call \\"Father\\".  War has been vanquished but at the cost of human emotions. All emotions are outlawed, and all feelings are controlled by a drug known as Prozium.  In a city called Libria, most likely the central nexus of the \\"one world\\" lives an elite force called the \\"Grammaton Cleric\\" whose sole task is to eradicate all human emotion and anything or anyone that provokes it.  Those who illegally feel are called Sense-phants and they or anyone associated with them are quickly annihilated.  But the state has something beyond underground rebels to worry about.  For its greatest enemy has awakened, John Preston, the highest of the elite clerics, has begun to feel.
0385335482|4.0|This book isn't going to change your outlook on life or anything, but it's a very entertaining read.  Although I'm not this bad, I heard some of my over-spending problems echoed in hers!  The heroine is also very endearing.
B000084T18|3.0|Wow this album woulda been top 10 for me of all time if it wasnt so overhyped. I mean, 21 questions and in da club are played at least 20 times daily on radio stations. The beats are one of the best of any album I own. However, the lyrics are nowhere near what they need to be for this to be a 4 or 5 star album. 50 is average at best with his lyrics and he has terrible clarity for a rapper as popular as him. <br />Overall, get this album, you wont be dissapointed
B00005V9IJ|5.0|&quot;Cast Away&quot; is not only a film about survival but one of courage as well. To anyone who is experiencing great pain due to the loss of a relationship (whatever the individual particulars may be), please watch this film. Listen to Tom Hanks' dialogue toward the end of the movie. I know it will help you. As a guy, I find it difficult to admit it if I cry, but I did near the end of this film. And the catharsis, at the conclusion, is presented with just the right degree of hope. <BR>Tom Hanks' performance makes it all work. I can't picture another contemporary actor with the &quot;everyman&quot; sincerity that he brings to the role.<BR>I immediately went out and bought the DVD. I highly recommend this film. If you let it, &quot;Cast Away&quot; will embrace your heart and give you hope.
6305428298|5.0|Astounding performances lift this movie and make it soar!  Michael Caine portrays perhaps the most vile character of his career with a range of nuance and expression that would challenge even the most adept actors.  It might well be his best work ever!  But his sleazy Ray Say would be just another manipulative has-been were it not for the work of Jane Horrocks' Little Voice.  Ms. Horrocks doesn't just recreate the voices of Judy Garland, Marlilyn Monroe and numerous other singers, she practically channels them in one of the most unique performances I've ever seen.<br />Little Voice or LV for short is a severely withdrawn young woman whose response to an earlier trauma has rendered her mute but for an ability to sing in the voice of past stars.  Her mother, Brenda Blethyn, is accepting of this until linking up with Caine's struggling agent, Ray.  The two seek to exploit LV, albeit for differing reasons; Mom wants her to succeed at something, while Ray sees nothing but profit in a client with more potential than his current stable of strippers and hack comics.<br />Ewan McGregor appears as an equally shy telephone repair man, with Jim Broadbent as a club owner that is every bit as low brow as his clientele.  Beyond the marvelous characterizations, the film's setting in a northern England city makes for a setting of pathos and futility that has you rooting for LV to escape not only her emotional prison but the physical one of her family and environment.  Horrocks will have your heart within the first five minutes and she never lets go.
B000007WK4|4.0|I have most of REA's CD's and bought this in germany, because it was on special. I had lost sight of him after the &quot;GREATEST HITS&quot;<BR>collection and I don't think his newer output was released in AUSTRALIA. ( SHAME ) This is a great CD from a true master. Great songs, great guitar playing and not a bad track amongst them. From rock to blues to ballads, this has it all and they are all excellent. I liked it the first time I heard it, now I love it. And it is still getting better. If you like REA or his style of music, you must buy this.
B0000029GA|5.0|Top 10 album of ALL TIME! Nas continues to be the best lyricist out there and although his beats all sound similar, his words will amaze you. He raps about everything and everything. He is the best NY rapper and every album he makes is amazing. Also get Stillmatic, and the Lost Tapes if you are a nas fan.

B00008OWZC|5.0|This is an awesome live album. Recorded while on their 1972 tour, Led Zeppelin was white hot in these two performances from Long Beach Arena and their personal favorite American venue, the LA Forum. <br />Now Zeppelin can lay claim to the mantle of one of Rock's greatest live acts with this three CD set. The Rolling Stones own live recording from their '69 tour &quot;Get Yer Ya Ya's Out!&quot; (a great album really) seems almost stiff in comparison. The nearest competitor is The Who's own &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; and even Townsend and company weren't as explosive as Led Zeppelin. Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham had a telepathy that borders on the scary. Musically, they could reach each other's minds and the results were bold explorations. Page himself once said that the songs on their albums are really going to take off on stage. &quot;It's the bud that's going to blossom onstage,&quot; he said. &quot;Like it or not, it's a fact about Zep.&quot; Yet while Zeppelin experimented with their songs, lengthening them and launched off on rave ups, somehow, they never changed the originals tempo. In short, a song like &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; would still retain it's menacing riff though the band was well known to use it for their rock and roll medleys and later, incorporating a scorching version of &quot;You Need Love&quot; (like at Knebworth on the DVD). In short, the band was able to maintain the difficult balance of pleasing the audience, but they were also able to please themselves as well.<BR>&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is some months distant, but that didn't stop the band from including &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; and &quot;Dancing Days&quot; into their set. One can only wonder what the audience was thinking, hearing these songs for the first time in their lives. Oh, to have been there!<br />Led Zeppelin.<br />A Great Band. <br />How the West Was Won.<br />A Great CD.<br />Buy it.

0312263120|5.0|I have read Digital Fortress twice already, and I've read many similarly entertaining books to Digital Fortress such as: Tom Clancy's &quot;Net Force,&quot; Britt Gillette's &quot;Conquest of Paradise,&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;.  None of which are as exciting or thrilling as &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;.

B00000K19E|5.0|When I first watched this film and was impressed with it's great detailed artwork, of course that was in 1999 now those kind of graphics are soso compared to some. <br />I had just watched the second film and was disgusted because of the quick change. This movie had fighting yes and it was used at apporpiate times unlike the second movie the fighting was bit of a overkill. I am not sayin that Matrix reloaded is not a bad movie, but it could've had a more in depth plot. This movie contains a great story line and great actors.<br />This movie is rated R for violence and language. I would have given it a rating of PG-13, but I thought that it's rating was appropiate because of kids that are very violent prone. Overall it is a PG-13 movie but you want to keep your little kids (10 and younger) away from it so that they wont be copying stunts and tricks that will provoke them to violent acts. Overall this movie is a 5 star
B00009P1O2|4.0|I was never able to attend a Queen concert but this DVD is the next best thing. With 21 songs like Bohemian Rhapsody, One Vision, Seven Seas of Rhye, and the crowd singing I Want to Break Free, it's a real thrill. The camera work is pretty good, Sound is great and the croud shots of a FULL Rockin' Wembley Stadium is Awesome!<br />O.K. here's for the drawback. The DVD is from Brazil so the back of the case and all albumography and accompanying words are in Spanish but other than that it's a must for the true Queen fan. I just wish that there were more live videos to buy.<br />Trust me, you'll love this one. Long live the QUEEN!
B00005JKED|3.0|I will admit that i did enjoy this movie, but I would not watch it again. The acting was great, they couldn't have chosen better actors. The plot was very weak and the movie picked up at a bad place.<br />This movie was about a cop in training, the instructor Denzel Washington (Best Supporting Actor: Glory) takes this rookie and shows him a day on the job. As the day goes on the rookie starts to realize Densel Washington was just a Con with a Badge. Everyone that denzel knows is in fear that densel will put him away for life. Denzel has enough proof to put anyone away.The end is just a big shootout and rebellion agianst Denzel Washingtons authority, the ending was quite different then others because of a unique twist.<br />This movie deserves a three because of it's lack of plot. So to sum it all up<BR>Action: 3<BR>Plot: 2<BR>Acting: 5<BR>Setting: 3 1/2<br />This movie has very strong language, gore, violence and a scene of nudity, ... <BR>If you are inside on a drowsy day that is a great time to watch this film.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Harry Potter is such a classic. It still amazes me when people of all ages enjoy the movies all the same. My two kids of 3 and 5 begged me to show them HP2 last night after they had finished watching the first HP on DVD. I was afraid that they were too young, but they told me monsters are not real. After their confirmations that they were not afraid of snake and nothing would possibly leave the screen, I played the DVD for them. They were too young to understand of Harry's parents' murder, but they knew of Harry's bravery and friendship. \\"Harry is not afraid of anything\\", they said. \\"He is so brave\\". That was the message they got after finished viewing the movie along with the laughter after seeing Hermione with tail.  Watch it if you have not already and let your kids watch it too.  This movie is truly for people of all ages.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I've been a Zeppelin fan since nearly the \\"beginning\\" (70's), always wanted to see them live, but came of \\"concert age\\" just as Bill Graham announced Zeppelin coming to town (SF Bay Area), only to hear shortly after of Bonham's untimely demise. . . . At the time, it was a huge let-down/tragedy.<br />So I've been waiting for something like this for over 20 years. Realizing my particularly acute anticipation, I was a little fearful of being disappointed.  Sure, the DVD promised to get me/everyone as close to a live show as possible . . . Yet, given 20+ years of anticipation, how could this video/recording of Led Zeppelin live up to such high and perhaps unrealistic expectations?<br />Well, quite simply, they exeeded all expectations; more than I could have known, it's been worth the wait.  The DVD is truly stunning.  When I put it in, switched to DTS surround, and sat down to just quickly take a look/hear at Disk 1, it took me by complete surprise, even in light of my palpable anticipation.  The whole thing just hit me like a freight train at full power.  I actually felt the adreneline kick in, as their performance from the moment they started playing just took off from a standstill to 100 mph in a heartbeat.  Everything was surprisingly striking:  the power of Bonham's drumming, the strength of Plant's voice, the intensity of Page's playing . . . it was all there, and more.  Even though I never saw these guys live, I have to think that this DVD has captured the overwhelming energy that made this band so successful.  It's been a long time since a movie/concert has impacted me with this much excitement, emotion and pure enjoyment (usually attainable only at live performances).  <br />I still regret never seeing Zeppelin live.  But now, having seen/felt what is the most \\"live\\"-like performance of any band I can think of, I regret it a lot less.<br />If you like/love Zeppelin (and especially if you have even a passable home theater speaker system), this one's a no-brainer.<br />...

0553213105|5.0|The story is a little bit complicated at the beginning because of the many protagonists introduced but in the end it is quite remarkable and gives you some insight into the life of the English landed entry.When you have read this book and and also understood its content, you will agree that it has been worth reading even if it is only for the language used. Since I have really enjoyed it, I would give it top marks.
0440213525|3.0|I rate the book with three stars, which means average. It wasn't bad at all, but it was a little bit far-fetched for me, because I can't believe that an eleven-year-old boy would be able to hire a lawyer all by himself and so such things like Mark Sway does in this book. How can a boy at that age be so clever and always helps himself?! I think it would be more interesting for me to read the book in the original version or to see the film. Another reason for giving only *** was that there was no excitement in it for me. I really like terrifying books, but this one was a little bit boring. Positive about reading it was that I was able to enlarge my vocabulary.
B0000057C5|4.0|I remember my first exposure to Rammstein when the music video for \\"Du Hast\\" first came out. The video was dark as was the music. I didn't understand what the heck Til Linderman was singing about but I loved the caustic, abrasive industrial-influenced metal sound that was coming from my television set. That was back in '97, '98. Then came the Columbine shooting in '99 and the band somehow found themselves on the ....list of parents and conservative right wing religious groups led by Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. I also heard rumors that the band held conservative right wing views which at the time I thought were true therefore turned me off from acquiring \\"Sehnsucht\\". Eventually those rumors were unfounded. I eventually bought \\"Sehnsucht\\" and was quickly converted into a Rammstein fan. Although I don't understand German or have seen the band live, it didn't stop me from enjoying the music with as much enthusiasm as I have for bands like KMFDM and VNV Nation. Like the band's other two albums, the production on \\"Sehnsucht\\" is stellar. Jacob Hellner does a excellent job of giving the listener an in-your-face sound. The beats are just brutal and unpolished. All the songs are great. I can't pick a favorite among the eleven tracks. To be honest I thought the english version of \\"Du Hast\\" sounded silly. I definitely prefer listening to the German version. Still it was a pleasant surprise to hear Til singing in english. I hope I don't have to wait too long for Rammstein to put out another album. These guys definitely could show a lot of today's nu metal bands a thing or two on what heavy  metal truly is 'cause most of them are just a bunch of wimps compared to Rammstein.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Logan's Run is the last great science fiction film of its era, before Star Wars came along and changed our idea of what a science fiction film is.<br />I loved watching this movie in the theater when I was ten, and I still love it.  Logan, played by Michael York, lives in and enclosed domed city in the future.  This city offers every creature comfort, and plenty of leisure time for its citizens.  Logan is a Sandman, and his job is to hunt down and kill runners who do not participate in the ritual of carousel when they turn 30.  In this society, it is the belief that there is the possibility of renewal, for those who must die when they turn 30 in the fiery ritual of carousel.<br />After hunting down and killing a runner, Logan brings back to Sandmen HQ items he retreived from the dead runner, including an Ankh, which is an ancient symbol for life, and also for what is known by the city's computer as Sanctuary.  After having seen this movie dozens of times, I wonder if the computer was preprogrammed to allow a Sandman to explore outside the city and bring about the collapse of this enclosed and protected world because conditions outside the dome were acceptable again for humans.<br />Logan has already seen the Ankh.  A woman he met the night before named Jessica, played by Jenny Agutter, was wearing it around her neck.  After the Sandmen HQ computer has ordered Logan to find Sanctuary, the computer has changed the crystal in his hand, also known as a life clock to a red that flashes with light, indicating that he has reached last day, and in order to survive, Logan must become a runner too.<br />Logan asks Jessica for her help, and they go to a plastic surgeon to make Logan look younger.  The surgeon finds that Logan is both a Sandman, and a runner, and tries to kill him.  After a really bizarre series of events, they escape the city, and to the outside.  I loved the scene in this movie where both Jessica and Logan see the sun and the outside world for the first time.<br />After traveling on foot through a world that is entirely new to them, they stumble upon the ancient ruins of a large city, which they both assume to be Sanctuary.<br />The best part of the whole movie was when they meet the old man, played by Peter Ustinov, living in what once was our nation's capitol.  I loved how Logan relates the story of how they got where they are to the old man, and the old man tells them about the cats that live with him by quoting T.S. Eliot.<br />After having bought the DVD, and having listened to the commentary, I found that this story was really rooted in 1960's and 1970's culture.  It was a common saying, \\"Never trust anyone over 30.\\"  At the end of the story, those who meet the old man for the first time learn that those over 30 can be trusted after all.
0743233832|5.0|The Hicks brothers' collaboration has produced a masterful translation of a masterpiece.  \\"The Emperor's Handbook\\" captures the sublime essence and ancient character of \\"The Meditations\\" but never strays into the arcane terminology of the ancient Stoics.  The Hicks brothers also avoid the forced and complex grammatical constructs found in other translations. This translation could easily be understood by a sixth grade child yet it sacrifices none of the profound meaning or prosaic beauty of the original. Most refreshing is the absence of any effort to turn the work into some New-Age mystical revelation.<br />Having read about nine translations I must say, this one is, by far, the best contemporary English translation available.  There are other fine ones such as the work by Hard and Gill or even the Loeb Classics version but they are better suited for people already familiar with Marcus Aurelius and Stoic philosophy.<br />My warmest thanks go out to David and Scot Hicks for a work that I hope will broaden the audience of Marcus Aurelius.

0393312836|4.0|It was really difficult to read for me. <BR>I think the novel told me a wonderful story that could never exist in reality, because all young men were brutal and killed people. It was thrilling. First little Alex was a cruel and crazy young man and he learnt nothing until he was in custody and when he was a victim of his state,  he became an adult. This was a wonderful turning of his life at the end. <BR>There were  serious moral problems in this book about free will. Should all people have a perfect and well-mannered characters or it's better to live in a world with some villains and criminals of their own making?
0393312836|4.0|It's really a good book I think. I always wondered what Alex would do next, and I really enjoyed reading about his attempts to come through all his adventures getting as few problems as possible. Burgess imagined some really smart steps with which Alex tried this. On the other hand the book made me think about \\"friends\\". How many \\"friends\\" in this world are there like Alex's? Or the other way around: what did Alex do that his friends thought they were right to do such things? I mean they betrayed him as they broke into the house of the old lady with the cats. Of course Alex wasn't exactly right playing the leader of the gang without knowing that his friends don't absolutely agree with him. But is this really enough to betray him in such a way? Or is it just the character of his friends to act this way? Still, it made me also think about the way they wanted to cure the criminals. Is this really a reasonable way?

B00008LOS1|5.0|It took them 4 tries to get to this version. This is the third version of this I own and it is definately the best.(I passed on the Gold disc) Yeah I have the bootlegs but the Young Vic tracks are far superior here, than anywhere else I've heard them. Yeah there are some tracks missing but so what. The band is in top form for this performance, probably because they weren't in the middle of a grueling tour schedule, and you get an opuurtunity to hear some songs they never or rarely played live.Maybe one day we will get all the shows compltete. The remastering is a little better here than previously released but not breath takingly so.The booklet is good too. I would definately reccomend this.

B00008OWZC|5.0|After listening to this over the weekend it makes one realize how lame rock-n-roll has been for the past 25 years. We are supposed to believe that bands like Radiohead and Nirvana are the equals from the legends of the late 60s and early 70s. While i do like those bands, they really should not be mentioned in this paragraph with the greatness of Zepplin.<br />WOW! Starting from the Immigrant Song this CD captures the band at their peak. This was when Page could supercede his studio recordings, instead of missing the mark as in later days. The rest of the band is also in fine form.<br />This release immediately takes it's place next to the Stones' \\"Get Yer Ya-Yas out\\", the Gimme Shelter DVD, and the Who's Isle of Wright DVD as the ultimate in Live rock music. After hearing the studio recordings of these band an endless number of times, it sometimes takes releases like these to fully appreciate why the 69-72 period was so special
B000002MG1|5.0|wow.. what can i say about an album like this that has not just touched and profoundly influenced my life.. but countless others. i still get the memories of me and my love swimming in the lake late at night anytime i hear nightswimming... (the violins just tear me apart everytime i listen). Drive just blew me away being the first song i heard from this album. The first song from the album before this one was pop song '89.. two completely different types of songs entirely. Micheal Stipe is in very good voice (strength and emotionially) to give every song on the album a life of their own (from the sublime and anxiety filled &quot;Drive&quot;, to the achingly painful &quot;everbody hurts&quot;, to the extroardinary genius salute to Andy kaufman &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, to the emotionially sweet &quot;Nightswiiming&quot;. A must own. this album should be the one that defines REM for the rest of their career.<br />Top 5 Songs:<BR>1)Nightswimming 2)Everybody Hurts 3)Man on the Moon 4)Drive 5)Sidewinder Sleeps tonight.

Unfortunately I enjoyed this book so much I saw very little of Ireland in between!!<br /> The reason for this is the amazing effect mr Gaiman's writing had on me. The quality of writing is both fantastic and enthralling and the charachter development is truley wonderfull I especially enjoy Shadows Total nonchalence about the crazy things going on around him<br />This is a fantasticly original concept and a thoroughly well thought out story. a Must for anyone but not one to take on holiday with you (at least not if you want to get anything done!).

B000067CPX|5.0|How this album did not win a Grammy much less not even be nominated is beyond me. Maybe some of the songs are just too Beautiful to be considered true Chili Peppers? This album is merely the continued genesis of the band that was evident in Californication.  Like any group with lasting power, their sound grows as they grow. Right now they are the best rock band out there. I put this CD in my player the week it came out and still cannot get it out. This CD is amazing, phenomenal, great and the songs range from hard driving to beautiful. Yes Beautiful. I can't wait to see what they do next.
0375701427|3.0|This is the story of a guy who tries to contruct a perfect life, from sports heroism in high school and marrying a beauty queen, to a huge house in the New Jersey countryside. Of course, his world of appearences comes crashing down on him when the going gets rough. ALong the way, there is lots about post-War American society as well as the ravages of aging.<br />Unfortunately, given this great premise and the inexplicable fact that it won a Pulitzer, this novel fails on many levels. First, it is written in a rambling, almost stream-of-consciousness style that is distracting but also totally failed to envelope me in its rhythm and world-view. It is personal taste to a degree, but I simply did not like it much. Second, while the tragedy is piercing and frightening to any parent, the novel keeps leaning towards melodrama without quite wholly falling into it. I mean, the guy could appear to have a charmed life without marrying a former Miss New Jersey and then suffer from something less than his beloved child becoming a fanatic political murderer. Life is hard, illusions are shattered, and falls are brutal by far less than all Roth's soap-operattish exaggeration. Third, the only truly three-dimensional character is the Swede, the paragon who crumbles under all the pain. You see him from a lot of angles, whereas the women remain the merest caricatures, peeping into his constructs and illusions without gaining much real life throughout. Even his brother is in the end easy to label as the angry-brother-become-arrogant-surgeon as is his harddriving-poor-immigrant's-son father. And none of these characters, not even the Swede, is rich enough to live on in my imagination.<br />WHile I was disappointed in these problems, which I believe make this novel mediocre, there were many interesting points, but again they tend to be personal and I don't believe would carry over for most other readers. I lived for a time in the New Jersey he describes and travelled often through bombed-out Newark, about whose history Roth informed me in the book.  I also very much enjoyed the stuff about the glove industry, but then as a business writer I admire business owners. Moreover, I knew people like the Swede and Roth makes a convincing case for the confusing anguish they feel when things go very wrong. Plus, as I said, it brings the parent's ultimate fears for their kids to the surface. Finally, there is the panorama of American life, which Roth succeeds in evoking, but again that can be viewed as parochial and of little interest, say, to my European friends, most of whom did not like this novel.<br />In balance, I did enjoy this novel and it got me to think, but I expected a far, far better performance. Recommended tepidly, with these reservations in mind.ut Newark, about whose history Roth informed me in the book.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|The first Moulin Rouge soundtrack cannot really be considered or described out of context with the later second volume that was released.  The deficiencies of this album are addressed for the most part in Volume 2, and thus this album cannot be judged as harshly as it was upon its initial release for the songs and numbers that are not included.  The earliest reviews of this soundtrack are justifiably critical, for many of the tracks featured here are not the actual versions from the film.  In essence, this CD is music that inspired and was inspired by the movie rather than an actual soundtrack.  This becomes obvious from the very start, when one hears David Bowie delivering the melancholy masterpiece Nature Boy.  David Bowie does a great job but it's not the movie version, and that is important because fans obsessed with this movie (including yours truly) are absolutely captivated if not in love with the actual movie versions.  If Bowie singing Nature Boy feels strange, just wait until you hear Beck singing Bowie's Diamond Dogs later on.<br />Thus, one has to put aside one's concerns about this album's vast differences from the actual movie's music, knowing that some (but, sadly, not all) of those original film versions can be found on the Moulin Rouge Volume 2 soundtrack.  Since I love the movie and music, so much, I'll say a word about every track on this CD.  After Nature Boy, one gets the familiar pop hit version of Lady Marmalade performed by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, and Pink.  The one great weakness of both soundtracks is the fact that this is basically the only piece of music you get from the unforgettable sequence in which Ewan McGregor first enters the Moulin Rouge.  Fatboy Slim gives us his driving version of Because We Can, a furiously upbeat track.  The version of Sparkling Diamonds included here is good, but it differs significantly from the film version; still, it features Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent, and their cohorts from the film and is quite enjoyable in this form.  Next is Valeria's version of Rhythm of the Night, a relatively minor song in terms of the movie, featuring special Moulin Rouge-specific lines.  While I prefer the movie version, something can be said about the version of Your Song included here; alongside Ewan McGregor's impassioned singing, the added vocal stylings of Alessandro Safina are emphasized, adding almost as much as it takes away from the film version.  Bono, Gavin Friday, and Maurice Seezer perform Children of the Revolution, a minor song which I would much rather hear the Violent Femmes perform any day.<br />Nicole Kidman blew me away in this movie, especially with her hauntingly beautiful rendition of One Day I'll Fly Away.  Once again, this version is not the original film version, and thus, although it is beyond beautiful, it cries out for the overlayering of Ewan McGregor's lyrical strains of Your Song, for this truly makes the song a force capable of fully subsuming one's heart.  As I've mentioned, the version of Diamond Dogs included here is sung by Beck, and while he's good, he's no David Bowie.  The next three songs are absolutely amazing.  First up is Elephant Love Melody, a daringly unique medley that worked its way straight to the bottom of my heart; I am happy to say that this version is basically the same as the original movie version, minus the exhortations of Satine for Christian to get down before falling off the Giant Elephant.  This medley never fails to give me chills, and the same can most certainly be said of the passionate Come What May.  This is the most achingly beautiful love song I've ever heard, but this version is one intended for pop music radio consumption, featuring a rich musical background tinged with strange little electronic noises; if you've watched the video of this song included on the Moulin Rouge DVD, you will already be familiar with this version.  At this point, one must stop and pause in homage to one of the most unexpected yet perfect and fervent performances of all time; I speak of course of El Tango de Roxanne.  This unique interpretation of The Police's Roxanne is amazing enough as it is, but when Ewan McGregor's piercingly heartfelt vocals enter the equation, all one can do is sit back enraptured at such passionate, moving music.  Complainte de la Butte is nothing special, and I still don't remember it being in the movie.  Then one comes upon Hindi Sad Diamonds featuring Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, and Alka Yagnik, an exotic track that somehow feels a little different from the film version.  Finally, the album closes with a second rendition of Nature Boy by David Bowie and Massive Attack; I'm really not sure why this track is included here, but the unremarkable version of the song ends quite memorably with Nicole Kidman whispering the words \\"I love you.\\"<br />This soundtrack cannot be said to feature the actual music from the soundtrack, yet I love it nonetheless.  In my opinion, you really have to buy both volumes of the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, and while the second volume features the original film versions of many songs, only this first volume contains two numbers this Moulin Rouge fan could not possibly live without - Elephant Love Medley and El Tango de Roxanne.  This CD cannot possibly take the place of the movie, but I believe any Moulin Rouge fan will overlook its faults and love it dearly.rfect and fervent performances of all time; I speak of course of El Tango de Roxanne.

1587990717|5.0|This is a very original book how luck pervades our lives, more specifically our financial one.  And, how we misinterpret luck for knowledge or expertise when our investments go up, and blame extremely rare `Perfect Storm' type circumstances when our investments go down.<br />In reality, most of us don't have much knowledge and expertise (this includes the majority of trading professionals too according to the author).  And, sooner or later we run out of luck.  The author gives this process an interesting mathematical term: Ergodicity.  This means that bad trades eventually catch up with you, even if they seem to generate very profitable outcomes in the short run.<br />In the middle of the book, the author defines the characteristics of bad traders:<br />1. An overestimation of the accuracy of their beliefs in some measure, either economic, or statistical.<br />2. A tendency to get married to positions.<br />3. The tendency to change their story, such as becoming investors \\"for the long haul\\" when they are losing money.<br />4. No precise game plan ahead of time as to what to do in the event of losses.<br />5. Absence of critical thinking expressed in absence of revision of their stance with \\"stop losses.\\"  Traders do not like to sell when their loosing positions represent an \\"even better value.\\"<br />6. Denial.<br />The book is rich in many other insights on investment, trading, and probabilities.  If you are interested in such matters, you will enjoy and learn much from this book.
B00005JLRT|1.0|As a science fiction and Star Trek fan, I was terribly disappointed with this film.  The story was disjointed a nd unclear, and the dialogue went nowhere.  I'd pass on this big time
B00005JM03|5.0|Well done! Now THIS is what I call a popcorn movie. No big drama, no great life issues; just a fun plot, great action, and good looking people packing the screen. \\"The Italian Job\\", a remake of the 1969 Michael Caine flick, is cinema escapism at its best and a great bet for a Friday night date.<br />Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie, acting head of a gang of high-tech, high class thieves. He's taking over for his mentor (played by the always welcome Donald Sutherland) as his team sets up a brilliant scheme for $35,000,000 in gold bars (the \\"Italian Job\\" of the title).<br />But things don't go quite as planned, and one year later Charlie reassembles his mates, plus his mentor's daughter (Charlize Theron) to take revenge on the man who betrayed them and set things right once and for all.<br />The action here is splendid, imaginative and well filmed. The script is tight, with plenty of snappy lines to go around (including a great running gag about just who invented Napster) and the musical score is surprisingly nice. All the actors have fun with their roles, especially Seth Green as a computer geek and Edward Norton as the slimy bad guy. And of course there's Wahlberg.<br />I like Mark Wahlberg. I can't help it. I like him more with every movie he makes. I like his quiet, confident walk, his little boy smile, and the way his forehead crinkles whenever somebody yells at him. He seems to actually get better looking as the movie goes along, and his chemistry with Theron is low-key but sexy.<br />I give \\"The Italian Job\\" five stars not because it was a masterpiece, but because I had a great time and know the film will hold up well with future viewings (it was a lot like \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" in this regard). Go on and see it; you'll like it. And probably want a Mini when you get out.<br />GRADE: A-<br />(By the way, I LOVED the way our heroes never carried guns or shot anybody. Old school baby!)
0671027344|5.0|I first read \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" in seventh grade, and I didn't really understand it, so I put it down for a while. Three years later, my friend called to tell me that her school was putting on Perks as a play, and invited me to go see it. Being the reader that I am, I immediately read the book, as to understand the plot when I saw the play. At that time, I realized what an amazing book Perks really is. Charlie is a character that almost anyone can identify with. He is very blunt, and tells his story through letters. The story starts on his first day of freshman year, and ends on the first day of his sophomore year...of high school. I recommend this book to everyone!!! I've read mine at least five times in the past two months ;-) and I still love it, I've underlined my favorite passages, there are quite a few, and I am still reluctant to lend the book to anyone, for fear of never getting it back. So buy it, do whatever you can, read Perks and love it!
0060554142|4.0|What gave this novel the kick it needed was the excellent narration by Tom Stechschulte. He gave this very eerie story power. Dennis Lehane is a fine author but I think this novel ranks just a bit below his last.<br />Highly recommended for the audio.
B00005JKPF|4.0|[...]P>It sure looks as if \\"X2\\" is on the right track for a sequel, and if anything, it seems better. The budget is obviously bigger as we see the truly amazing special effects in the beginning of the film, and though the action never quite again reaches its high-point as in the beginning, it sets the film up for other non-stop action sequences, just like the James Bond movies are known for doing.<br />But that's not all \\"X-Men 2,\\" or \\"X2\\" as the posters abbreviate, is all about. It has an important human element that adds to the pure, non-stop, full-blooded action-spectaculars throughout the film. The cast is bigger, the budget is bigger, the story is bigger, and the action is plentiful. Teenagers will enjoy the action side, and adults will probably enjoy the human side to the story. It seamlessly combines both these two elements/techniques even more than the original film did. I didn't expect to enjoy this film more than the first, but I must say I did.<br />It reunites the old cast for a continuation of the struggle for mutants and humans to live together in the same world.<br />[...] \\"X-Men\\" was an excellent comic-book adaptation, in more ways than one, and \\"X-Men 2\\" is only better. It contains more action than \\"Spider-Man\\" and its human factor is even more active than it was in the original, which is ironic, since the original was praised for having both action and human attributes.<br />The cast is first-class, but the real scene-stealer, just like in the original, is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The Aussie actor disguises his accent with a rough American one, just like British chap Bob Hoskins did in \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\". If the filmmakers want a new James Bond after Pierce Brosnan, they need look no farther, because though he may not look the part in this film, Jackman can look very suave and proper (see \\"Kate and Leopold\\"), and is my top choice for the next Bond.<br />Comic book films are usually hit-or-miss. They're never in between. \\"X-Men\\" was an unexpected hit, but more than that, a good unexpected hit. It wasn't all hype. It was smart, action-packed and hat a great character side to it. Like I said before, \\"X-Men 2\\" improves upon all this and is the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor.<br />I expect \\"X-Men 2\\" to break some box office records, and unlike other films, I can honestly say that it deserves it.
B00005K3LW|4.0|\\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\\" is a full-blooded action vehicle; it is a smart one, too, because its filmmakers realize the ol' one-man-army-trapped-in-an-area routine can't last long. So they have changed the technique to a game of revenge: cat-and-mouse. Some could call it smarter than its predecessors; and on a level as a thriller I must admit it is more intense. It is a lot better than the 1990 Renny Harlin actioner \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder.\\" But on terms of fun, you can't beat the original.<br />John McTiernan, who brought us \\"Predator,\\" \\"The 13th Warrior\\" and \\"Die Hard,\\" returned to end this series on a high note. Of course, like all sagas, \\"Die Hard\\" is far from over, with another sequel due to be released summer 2004. But until then, we can look to \\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\\" as the end-all to the overall excellent John McClane trilogy.<br />The third film opens up where nothing left off; McClane (Bruce Willis) is on the streets of NYC when a man who calls himself \\"Simon\\" blows up a Manhattan department store, and then orders McClane to stand in Harlem with a sandwich board that says...well...something you wouldn't want to be wearing in Harlem. <br />After a convenience store owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) saves McClane, Simon orders both men to run around New York City and do Simon Says-type-games. It's all good fun, and a step away from the original film. Which can be good or bad.<br />Soon McClane finds out that \\"Simon\\" is really the brother of Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) from the first film, and that \\"Simon\\" is out for revenge against McClane (or is he?), and he will stop at nothing to kill McClane. But, of course, being a madman, he plays mind games with John McClane first. And the simon says mind games are tense and action-packed.<br />It's hard to compare something like this to the original for one major reason: It is nothing like the original. The original was about a lone man fighting off a million guys, Rambo-style. But what saved it from becoming another average action spectacular was the great dialogue, non-stop SMART action sequences, and engaging performences by all aboard the project. Fast-forward two years later and you've got a replicant copy of the first film set in Dulles airport in Washington, D.C. But in all respect, \\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\\" is not recycled. Its technique is new, and it almost seems as if it is not a sequel to the other \\"Die Hard\\" films. Which is probably not too odd, seeing that the script, originally titled \\"Simon Says\\" (no, not the Dennis Rodman one), was actually a sequel to \\"Lethal Weapon.\\" Of course, modifications were made after the \\"Die Hard\\" series bought out the script, but the character of Zeus was probably Danny Glover, and John McClane was probably Mel Gibson. Thinkabouddit.<br />Bruce Willis is still John McClane. This film takes his character into a bit of a darker realm. McClane now has an alcohol problem, and his wife has left him again. Man, you'd think after having your life saved TWICE by the same guy that MAYBE you should stick with him. In fact, we don't even see McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedalia) in this film at all. Although we are led to believe they will hook up again at the end.<br />Samuel L. Jackson adds some flair to the film, taking the movie into a more cop-buddy dimension (\\"Lethal Weapon\\"). Jackson's character is a racist, and it's a bit odd to see a black racist in a film. It's usually those nasty white fellas. :) <br />I liked Jackson's character, because it provides for dialogue outlet on McClane's behalf, and sets the film up for some very funny sequences. The character interaction is a lot stronger here than it was in \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder.\\"<br />\\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance\\" is hard to compare to the original because it is so very different. But the bottom line is that this sequel is much better than \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder,\\" but a step down from \\"Die Hard.\\" But seeing how different it is, you might think it is better than both the films.It really depends on your preferences.<br />I give this solid action film a solid rating of 4/5 stars - an all-around solid action sequel. Solid fun. <br />If you agreed with my review, please RECOMMEND IT.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The legend is a legend for a reason.  Insane talent, creativity, artistry, showmanship, beauty... You WILL be transported to another time & place with this DVD set.  Had to laugh when I read another reviewer's comments about getting with the 90s and buying a DVD player...right on target.  I'm pushin' 40 and began my Zep fascination at age 12.  This set is PURE GOLD to me.  I found myself watching dumbfounded, jaw hanging open, as Jimmy played what appears to be an extension of his own body in the form of a guitar.  Or Bonham, on Moby Dick (on the whole DVD, actually), hands flying faster than the eye can follow.  Or Plant, at his vocal peak, commanding that all bow down to their Celtic master.  Or the low-profile John Paul Jones, the steady, consumate musician, providing the necessary glue that brings the whole sound together.  The performances are like some addictive drug, filling a need, yet creating a strong desire for more.  It is so satisfying to hear the tunes we all know by heart, only refreshingly new and filled with improvisation.  THIS DVD SET IS ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC, revealing subtle nuances and exchanges between bandmates as they work together creatively.  Its a pure experience that is a wonderfully refreshing change from the overproduced MTV video-style we've been subjected to for the last few decades.  I could go on and on, but stop wasting your time reading this and just go buy the darn thing and be transported to the Church of Zeppelin.  THANK YOU JIMMY & CO.!
0380973650|5.0|T[...] With American Gods, Gaiman has accomplished more than I can put into words. [...] American Gods was a great book full of interesting, likeable characters that DID undergo stages of development--much to the contrary of what other reviewers have said. If you like dark fantasy...[...] if you like reading great books, do yourself a huge favor and read American Gods. End.
B0000009S3|4.0|That's right, I listen to this cd, and think \\"That's nice, where is Hot Rats?\\" This is because for ages I listened to the original vinyl version of this album, making cassettes for my car and just enjoying the heck out of it.<br />But, when this album was reissued on cd, Zappa decided to do a substantial remix of the album. There are some huge changes, missing instruments, different solos, all kinds of things that are distracting to people used to the original mix.<br />Not to say that the new mix is bad - it's very good, in fact. Clear, noise-free, and well balanced. It's just not how it used to be. <br />As far as the album itself goes, there are some mind-boggling jazz/rock compositions here, with only one vocal piece in the whole album. We get the fantastic \\"Peaches and Regalia\\", the slimy \\"Willie the Pimp\\", the satisfying \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\", and more.<br />There is some astounding violin work here, some great guitar playing, and an very strong album that seems to come from one musical viewpoint, unlike the eclectic approach that Zappa usually takes. <br />Very worthwhile - now, if they would just issue Hot Rats on cd...
B00005QDW1|2.0|No, this is not NO Doubt. This CD is one of the worst CDs I have. There are only 2 songs that I like, and even those songs get old after listening to them a couple times. All the songs sound like pure pop, not hard rock. Even Avril Laveign is closer to rock than these songs. What ever happened to the good songs like \\"Just a Girl\\" and \\"Excuse Me\\". I think this group needs to give up on the whole \\"pop\\" thing and go back to what they were good at. ROCK.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I reserve my five-star albums for true nearly-flawless classics, so Elephant gets a four, despite being my favorite album in the past 20 some odd years.  Yes, THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.  There hasn't been a whole ot of albums that really blow me away in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, so Elephant shocked me when I listened to it.  Its mighty good.  People sometimes criticize it for being deriative of many artists before.  I can't see how this is a criticism though because Jack white has enormously powerful idols and his music is superb.  It has more diverse material than any White Stripes album before it and the music is played intensely better.  Jack's guitar may not be heavy as some kids who are trying to be cool like it, but the licks are still quite powerful.  Jack brings back distortion and solos which nobody has seen in a while either.  As a songwriter, the pale frontman has improved greatly.  He still can't write excellent melodic hooks but his lyricism is dynamic and yet so precise.  His co-hort Meg White provides sufficient drumlines that are extremely simple.  I like the simplicity though because it allows Jack to go crazy on Ball and Biscuit and There's No Home For You Here.  And yet despite all of the White Stripes intensity as rockers, thier finest songs are the one about Pockets and Warming Your Mothers Heart.  The only noticable flaw is the lack of creativity in some of the ending tracks, especially Hypnotize which is a blatatn rip-off of Lets Shake Hands or Fell In Love With a Girl.  Still, Elephant provides the eager listener with more excitement and riff-driven fun thatn any other album I've heard in a decade.
0440224764|5.0|I bought the book when it was first released but never got around to reading it.  Finally, the dust was shaken off as I turned the pages wondering what would happen next.  Full of twists and surprises, I would say this book is  one of Grisham's best work.  It's a slow read in the beginning until Patrick starts to unveil morsels of truth about his rumored convictions of theft and murder.  I soon found myself frustrated with curiosity and ultimately impatient. Nevertheless, my frustration peaked when I read the last page.
B00005JLH3|4.0|Large chunks of this film are by-the-numbers, 1980s-vintage, becoming-a-man storytelling. But that's okay. The message is positive, often subtler than expected, and it comes in a refreshingly new package. Today's teens haven't seen all the old Rocky-esque pictures, and rarely have African-American kids been allowed to dominate such a constructive morality tale.<br />Nick Cannon's character is unlikable but certainly believable. And he reluctantly learns his lesson in teamwork.<br />The real star is music itself. Fans of marching bands and drum corps in particular will have a field day and non-fans will grudgingly admit the days of Sousa-by-rote are long, long gone.
B000002L7Y|5.0|When Aha arrived on the scene back in the mid 80's on the<br />wave of their animated hit maker \\"TAKE ON ME\\", many listens like myself<br />rode out the single and for the most part moved on, I had enough of it, but, there was<br />always something new to look forward to in the 80's. Music<br />was all over the place and thats what I loved about so much<br />of what came out then.  Every generation has its share of one hit wonders and it was hard to pick out true artistry through the<br />hair and makeup but Aha and their first collection after repeated listens just stood out to me. There was some really<br />great pop songs, different for the tastes of those here in the<br />USA but still excellent. I had always loved the Moody Blues<br />and Jethro Tull,Joni Mitchell, The Doors, Bonnie Raitt, Steely Dan to name some and knew that Aha's vocalist was<br />very gifted and he was working with a great band and they had<br />so much potential to be classic. I hadn't heard this first<br />collection in over 10 years when I noticed on Amazon.com that<br />they had a new comeback cd out in 2000 and I went back and found I had<br />saved their first two cds and began to listen to Aha again as<br />well as buy their lastest and I've been really impressed with<br />their style and songwriting as well as Morten Harkets beautiful<br />voice. This first collection has so many great musical moments, it really showed the potential this band could have, they've<br />since moved into their adult phase and they've just continued<br />to improve and impress even though they are being ignored by the music world, especially here in the states???<br />I just wish \\"HUNTING HIGH AND LOW\\"  would be remastered as it has to many great songs to be ignored and the upgraded sound<br />quality would only make these songs better.
B000063UR2|3.0|If you already love this movie, then you'll no doubt appreciate the extra dialogue in the uncut version. However, if, like me, you've had trouble deciding if you like this movie, I don't think the longer version is going to be of any help. <br />My problem is that it never quite knows what it wants to be: is it a kid's Saturday matinee, a horror film, or a sword and sorcery flick for adults? It has elements of all and succeeds as none. Every time you start to get scared, there's a cute joke. Every time you start to laugh, it gets gruesome.<br />I don't think there are any new scenes in the directors cut, just longer versions of the old scenes with more dialogue. There is NOT, as one reviewer said, a different ending. There's just a long unnecessary scene where Tom Cruise says goodbye (for now) to Mia Sara. None of the extra dialogue helps the scenes, and much of it seems redundant.<br />So if you aleady have the original release of this, and aren't crazy about it, I wouldn't spend the money on the deluxe edition.
B000031XCR|3.0|I just can't believe they only included 9 Greatest hits, and 6 mediocre new songs... Don't get me wrong \\"That's The Way It Is\\" \\"I Want You To Need Me\\" \\"First Time\\" are all great songs, but she could've done without the others.  Also the omission of \\"Where does My Heart Beat Now?\\" has definetly left this album feeling weak.<br />Other hits missing: Nothing Broken But My Heart, Misled, Think Twice, All By Myself, Falling Into You, The Reason, Tell Him, When I Fall In Love.<br />Highlights: That's The Way It Is, The Power Of Love, If You Asked Me To, To Love You More, My Heart Will Go On...
B00008S2VG|2.0|this is the worst record by Madonna,period. I tried to listened to this album and found myself pushing the skip button a lot. Ive always enjoyed her music because its danceable and fun,enjoyed most of her 80's records and found Bedtime Stories one of her best in the 90's. If you want a smart dance pop album with catchy tunes get Kyle Minogue's ''Fever'' or Lisa Stansfield's brilliant ''Biography'' and skip this new album by Madonna,save the dissapointment and your money.
B00005JLRT|2.0|There are two kinds of Star Trek Films...those that genuinely work as full length feature films (Wrath of Khan, First Contact) and those that spread a one hour episode's worth of plot over 100 minutes of time. Nemesis, despite excellent effects and cinematography, and fine performances by the cast, falls into the latter category. <br />Villain with special link to one major character endangers Enterprise. Romulans may or may not responsible. Villain almost triumphs. Enterprise in dire peril. Picard pulls a brilliant last minute strategy out of the hat. Villain perishes on the bridge of his exploding spaceship. (I hope I'm not giving away too much here). Does that sound familiar?
B0000009OP|5.0|I bought this one on a whim way back when it was first released (still don't remember exactly why...).  It slowly grew on me as I paraded around the country for a summer.  Seems everywhere I went, there was Morphine.      I actually got see them live while visiting Austin, Texas (stood next to Mark Sandman without even knowing it before the show...).  What a show.  A two-string bass, a saxophone and some drums jam beyond belief.  Considering I was living in Seattle at the peak of the whole grunge thing, this was a pleasant relief.  It was cool before the whole strung out, heroin chic, swingers thing became mainstream.  There's a swagger to this music and a moodiness that belongs in smoke-infested dives.    While this was not their first recording it was the one that hooked me in.  While in San Fran, there they were.  While in Seattle, there they were.  It was kinda bizarre.  Anyhow, I gathered a whole bunch of folks to see them in Seattle without them every having heard the album.  They were a bit skeptical but went anyhow.  They were hooked.    I can't really explain it but the music and the lyrics really draw you in.  At once dark and a bit wry, they are also quite witty and intelligent and catch the listener a bit off guard at times.  Put a little swing in your rock and roll.      Sad that Mark Sandman has since left us.  But as always there's still the music.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Love this CD. Love the old CD. His lyrics catch me off guard at times. I don't always listen to the lyrics, just groove along with the music. His lyrics make me think and smile. He is great dinner party music, chillin' on a Sunday morning music, house cleaning music.....whatever...I really enjoy this CD.
1580084621|5.0|I recommend this book only for serious enthusiasts who are truly passionate about authentic Thai cooking/food and are not looking for quick, adapted recipes!    Having enjoyed authentic Thai food during my trips to Thailand, I am repeatedly disappointed with the adapted versions found in most local restaurants here. Since I am an avid cook, I have been experimenting to replicate the dishes I had in Thailand.     After some research I found David Thompson's \\"Thai Food\\" to be a rare find. Most Thai cook books I have come across provide adapted recipes with shortcuts and suggested substitutes for ingredients! How dreadful! Undoubtedly, Thai food involves much effort and can even be tedious. But the taste is well worth it. More importantly, ingredients in Thai cooking CAN NOT be substituted if the REAL flavor and aroma are to be achieved. For example, if you are going to substitute regular ginger for galangal (Thai ginger), or lime zest for kaffir lime zest, as many books suggest - you may as well not cook Thai food!     This is what sets David's book apart from the rest - he sticks to the real stuff! He painstakingly explains all the details of real Thai cooking, discussing each ingredient and various techniques followed by the recipes. While some recipes are quite cumbersome or require ingredients which are not easily available, the book is worth the insight it provides into authentic Thai cuisine. Once you understand the basics, you can be creative by combing basic Thai ingredients with techniques and create your own recipes without straying from the flavors, tastes and aroma of REAL Thai cuisine!     One complaint however: where is the recipe for Yum Woon Sen??

B00000AOUD|5.0|Call it what you like, this album is progressive because Jethro Tull married multiple musical styles on one album.  The album is conceptual because the entire song is actually multiple songs married into one song by a variety of transitions and interludes.  There may be an occasional unevenness in the transitions, but in general the whole thing works, and is one of the most unique works of rock music.<br />Early progressive rock was born in fits and starts.  Tracing back, some of the earliest identifiable elements of progressive rock show up in some Beatles' songs.  The Moody Blues provided more definition to progressive rock, and created the first progressive rock albums, though their progressive rock was on the lighter side and was much less daring than King Crimson, who's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" established how cutting edge progressive rock could be.  By 1972, progressive rock had a better-defined face, and that face was readily identifiable on albums such as \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close to the Edge\\", by Yes, \\"Foxtrot\\" by Genesis, and \\"Thick as a Brick\\", by Jethro Tull.  There were quite a few other progressive albums released by 1972, and numerous other artists using progressive elements in their music, but these albums were among those that helped to define the limits, or lack thereof, of progressive rock.<br />As serious as some of us like to believe this album is, it is a satire.  This album pokes fun at issues contemporary to 1972, which somehow remain somewhat contemporary to now.  Some examples:  the drive to push society to cater to the needs of the \\"average\\" person rather than helping the above-average person develop their skills; the debate over war and the need for war; helping others to build their country and then having them go to war with you; people who live on the dole rather than being some useful part of society.  The list is quite extensive, and much of the tone is sarcastic, often caustic, if you can discern the meaning.<br />To match the extensive nature of the album lyrics are musical styles that range nearly as wide:  there are catchy pop-like tunes; there are folk-classical influenced portions; there is a dirge on side two; there are faster rock portions; even a bit of pomp and circumstance.  I haven't even covered half the range of styles.  At the very least, Jethro Tull wasn't afraid to commit their feelings of the moment musically to an album.  Artistically their vision on this album is as expansive as any other group I can recall.  Add to this broad range of styles sound effects and bizarre transitions, and you can tell that not only did Jethro Tull use everything, they also threw in the kitchen sink.<br />This album became a nearly instant classic in 1972.  It vaulted to number one, and for a while made Jethro Tull one of the biggest groups in rock, though their music was far broader than rock.  The album was also anti-establishment (a term that hasn't been spoken since at least the early 70s).  Though portions of the counter-culture lyrics are relatively plain, substantial other portions of the lyrics are subtle, nearly cryptic, and manage to poke fun at numerous institutions and philosophies.  Some messages are so cleverly phrased and subtle that you could call Jethro Tull progressive rock for intellectuals, though you need not delve that deeply into Tull's lyrics to enjoy them.<br />By the way, the phrase \\"thick as a brick\\" is slang for \\"stupid\\".  I think Ian Anderson was already poking fun at those that wouldn't have the foggiest idea at what he was attempting to do with this CD, and already having a big laugh in preparation for the reaction after the album was released.  The reaction was mixed.  Many critics hailed it for its \\"message\\"; others derided it for being counter-culture and musical garbage.  Likely many people ascribed deeper meanings to it where there were none, and missed the meaning where there was some.  At the end of it all was Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull, laughing, because they knew from the beginning that all of this was their art, which has to be interpreted by each person in their own way, and one person may see something that another doesn't, which ultimately means that while there are some clearly common elements, you don't want to make too much of the meanings.  They are what they are, and they may be different for you and me.  Isn't great music grand?<br />Five stars for one of the best progressive rock albums to ever be released, and for music to be intellectually stimulated by.use they knew from the beginning that all of this was their art, which has to be interpreted by each person in their own way, and one person may see something that another doesn't, which ultimately means that while there are some clearly common elements, you don't want to make too much of the meanings.

B000062YAZ|5.0|I'm not as big on Slayer as I was back in 8th grade, a mere 3 yrs ago, but REIGN IN BLOOD is still one of the few thrash metal albums I praise highly. It's not even a half hour long, but within that short amount of time, Slayer brings you 10 horrifying death-laden speedfests that leave you exhilerated and breathless. The subject matter is grotesque, and the songs may seem a bit monotonous and one-dimensional, but for some reason, it remains interesting. It's an intense listening experience... just don't give yourself a heart attack from thrashing around to this album! Buyer beware: if you're squeamish to songs or images about blood, Satanism, death, or the Holocaust, maybe you want to shy away from this album.
0385507755|4.0|I don't know much about literary styles so regarding the author's I will only say that I became annoyed by his constant repetition of the same words and phrases. Having said that however, I was riveted to his story. It's unflinching, painful, ugly, and ultimately very uplifting. There are moments of unbelievable cruelty, but plenty more that are filled with genuine compassion from other addicts and clinic staffers alike.<br />As for Frey's attitude about what it takes to remain clean, he is dead-on target. I applied the same basic principles of self-will to insure my own abstinence. And I too refuse to live in fear of the substances to which I once shackled myself, as do most former addicts. <br />A previous reviewer assumes the worst for Frey because of his efforts. And while I don't know the reviewer (nor Frey), the comments are typical of many people who buy the 12-Step party lines about &quot;self will running rampant&quot;, &quot;denial&quot;, and &quot;addiction-as-disease&quot;, and so forth. I believe that THESE ideas do far more to keep addicts hooked than does reliance on inner human strength and intelligence. Certainly the results of  medically and scientifically &quot;sound&quot; recovery methods as used by the Hazelden Clinic (where Frey dried out) support my belief. Perhaps the reviewer missed the comments made by Frey's addiction counselor; that Hazelden has the best recovery rate of any clinic in the world: a whopping 17%!  <br />Thats right... 17%. This is not an accident but rather an indictment against currently accepted &quot;treatment&quot; modalities.  The public as a whole has yet to catch on to the truth about self-recovery from addiction. Theres a lot at stake in remaining uninformed about this very issue.<br />It's also another reason why Frey's story is so important.
B000002HHB|5.0|Such a delicate recording that it is easy to overlook, but Tigerlily is an absolute masterpiece that makes art out of profound heartache. It deserves to be ranked among the best CDs of the 1990s.  Highly, highly recommended!

B00008OWZC|4.0|I want to love Led Zeppelin, but I find that I'm always selling the stuff  soon after I buy it.  This live 3-CD set from June 1972 just doesn't hold up next to Deep Purple's \\"Live in Japan\\" 3-CD set from August 1972.  The sound quality on the other hand is great and perhaps a hair better than DP`s set.  But the jam songs are weak (I guess you had to be there dude!) when you measure them up to the extended performances by Deep Purple where live on stage seems to be their strength.  Probably the LZ DVD is better because you won't just focus on the audio when you're being distracted by the visuals.   Now back to the CD's, the band is good shape, with Page being pretty tight and creative, Plant in pretty good voice (he hardly cracks), Bonham is, well, no Ian Paice, but perfect for this group and well recorded. John Paul Jones adds to the group's performance with some fine fluid bass work.   Highlights: Black Dog (Plant sings it just like the record for a change.) The Ocean I enjoyed more than the studio recording and Dancing Days also kick [...].  I must mention that these performances can not be found on the DVD.   Led Zeppelin always had clever marketing.  If you are a LZ fan, this 3 CD set is required. If you are on the fence, you might want to wait until it becomes used. There should be plenty of used copies soon enough. [...]
B00008PX8P|5.0|I watched the Zeppelin DVD on the weekend.  Absolutely amazing.  You MUST get it.  Of all the mind bending things on these discs, one of the most amazing has to be the Danish TV gig.  It opens as a group of maybe 40 teenagers are ushered into a bare hall with no chairs in sight.  The band is set up in a tight configuration in the middle of this empty room.  The kids sit cross legged on the floor -- like in a high school gym.  Imagine what must have gone through their minds.  Having no idea whatsoever about what to expect.  No frame of reference.  Nothing.  Here's this new band, been together for a few months...they are going to play you some songs from their new album.  Then it comes, in a cascade, no, an AVALANCHE --- Communication Breakdown, then Dazed and Confused, then Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, then How Many More Times.  At one point the guy on guitar whips out a violin bow and you start hearing sounds you've never heard in your life -- that you never thought were possible.  And the guy on drums, he's hitting his toms harder than you thought it possible to hit a drum...to hit ANYTHING.  And the bass player, lord god above, he's playing a melodic line in tandem with the guitarist which means that the guitarist can peal off at warp 9.99, no, let's just admit it, at Warp 10, into these solos where his left hand seems to do more playing than his right (&quot;Captain, she can't TAKE warp 10.  Yes, Scotty, she can -- it IS possible -- for we are in a universe where the normal rules of physics don't apply -- the &quot;Zepellinverse&quot;).  Any sane person would have sat there and cast a thankful eye heavenward thinking -- &quot;There IS a god after all...a benevolent god...a god who LOVES humanity...a god who has a little present for us..the greatest band EVER.&quot;  The rest of the DVD is as brilliant, but I thought this little vignette might be helpful.  BUY THIS DVD.
B00005JM03|4.0|Senseless plot twists, daring escapes, clever cinematography--these are staples of the heist movie, and \\"The Italian Job\\" makes the most of them. Now THIS is a caper movie! It has sparkling locations (Venice, anyone?), dead-on humor (mostly revealed in the patter of Mos Def [the best rapper-turned-actor in the business--I know that isn't saying much, but he is truly terrific]and Seth Green [who needs Buffy?]), those funny little Mini Cooper cars (a blatant advertisement, but who cares?), and action, action, action. Ed Norton, who couldn't hide his acting skills under a barrel, adds Stud Muffin to his repetoire, as he is strangely sexy in his Gary Oldman-lookalike getup, reprising the role as the Judas-like scoundrel from \\"The Score\\" and adopting his mustachioed, tall-haired look from \\"25th Hour.\\" The only odd note: Mark Wahlberg. He and Charlize Theron, who is wasted here, poor girl (remember \\"Reindeer Games\\"?), don't generate enough sparks to give Tom Hanks hope on his deserted island, but they just keep on rubbing and rubbing and rubbing. Further, Wahlberg's looks simply don't lend themselves to the quicksilver charm of the character; see \\"The Truth about Charlie\\" if you're still not convinced that he should NOT be cast in these kinds of parts. His looks are too pugnacious, and his acting is too obvious. Aside from those objections, though, this flick reminds you that movies can be fun and that they're not all intended to be \\"Gandhi,\\" \\"Adaptation,\\" or some Ingmar Bergman creation.

B00008NG5V|4.0|This is another great album by Jack Johnson, only receiving 4 stars because it sounds a lot like the first.  If you have heard the first, though, you know that its not a bad thing.  &quot;Cookie Jar&quot; is the best song on the album, but throughout it is good.  Worth picking up if you like Jack or The Dave Matthews Band, Pete Yorn or Ben Harper.
0380820846|5.0|I have been a fan of Julia Quinn ever since I read THE DUKE AND I, the first in the Bridgerton Family series. Her writing focuses not on complex plots or twisted situations, but on the hopes, dreams, and heartbreaks of her characters, people you grow to know and love. <br />Romancing Mr. Bridgerton is the story of Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington, both of whom appear in all the previous books. Penelope has loved Colin for years, but her self-confidence is virtually nil, and her family, as well as the rest of society, long ago gave up on her ever getting married. Colin is a man without a plan; he desperately wants a purpose in life instead of being known as just another charming Bridgerton. Each of them goes on a journey of personal change as they seek to improve themselves and find true love. Their story is touching and funny and left me feeling extremely glad that they finally found each other. <br />If you have followed this series and have wondered who Lady Whistledown is, you will find out in this book. I won't disappoint you by giving the answer away, but I will tell you that there is a good chance your suspicions are correct. Julia Quinn's writing is side-splitting and tear-jerking, and you can't miss with her latest book.

0790739909|4.0|City of Angels was released by Warner Studios in 1998.  Run time is 110 minutes.  Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are the principal actors.  Co-stars include Dennis Franz and Andre Braugher.  <BR>Directed by Brad Silberling<BR>Genre - Drama<br />Set in Los Angles, in the opening scene an angel, Seth (Nicholas Cage) escorts a dying girl from the emergency room where she just passed away.  Net, we cut to an unusual site:  two men, clothed entirely in black sitting comfortably atop a freeway exit sign over a busy interstate highway overlooking the city.  No matter how you look at it, City of Angels will make you think about how angels might exist with us in our world.  We soon see that angels are everywhere - walking on rooftops, standing on the \\"Hollywood\\" sign, even in an airport control tower.<br />Seth finds himself escorting a dying heart patient from a cardiac surgery suite.  He stares intently into the eyes of the young surgeon, Doctor Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) as she struggles to revive her dying patient.  We learn a little more about angels: they can see us, and each other, but only a dying and delirious human can see them unless the angel wants a person to see them.  <br />Later Seth follows Doctor Rice as she walks through a children's ward in the hospital. Rice seems to be walking aimlessly as she struggles to cope with the loss of her patient.  We see an angel in every room with the sick children.  Later that evening, Seth meets Doctor Rice in the hallway of the hospital after visiting hours as she is \\"making mounds.\\"  He talks about the death of her patient.  He tells her that her patient \\"... is living.  Just not the way you think.\\"<br />About this time, you may observe that the angels do not blink.  They look at our world and the people in it with a steady gaze, almost a stare.  As we watch Seth gaze intently at Doctor Rice, you understand he is falling in love.<br />During a night of fitful sleep, Doctor Rice awakens and opens a book on her nightstand.  We seethe title of the book: Hemingway's \\"A Moveable Feast.\\"  After reading the book, the next day she is in a good mood.  She thanks a boyfriend for the book.  He denies giving it to her, asking \\"where'd you get it?\\"<BR>Rice goes to the public library and asks if she can find out who checked the book out.  She again meets Seth and they leave together.   They visit a grocery store and stop to eat.  As Rice eats a pear, Seth asks her what a pear tastes like.  She asks him if he doesn't know already.  He answers, \\"I don't know what a pear tastes like to you.\\"<br />Seth soon meets a patient under Doctor Rice's care (Dennis Franz) who turns out to be a former angel.  He tells Seth how he can become human: you just choose to fall to earth.  We also learn that angels all gather at sunrise and sunset on a beach.  <br />Seth struggles, but finally chooses to become human so he can be with Doctor Rice.  It is a difficult transition and he suffers the indignities of a person new to the big city.  It is both a funny and sad commentary on humanity to watch him try to find Doctor Rice, and be beaten and robbed of his shoes on the street.<br />Seth and Doctor Rice do finally get together at her cabin on Lake Tahoe.  Their time together is very, very short.  I won't spoil the ending for you.  But the outcome is certain to bring a tear to your eye (or at least a lump to your throat).<br />City of Angles isn't just a \\"chick flick.\\"  The music is outstanding (In the Arms of An Angel, for one) and I really ended the movie in a thoughtful state of mind.  In my opinion, City of Angels is a well-acted, interesting story.  The ending may make you consider just how short life really is.
B00008OWZC|5.0|These live recordings from the days when Led Zeppelin were the unchallenged kings of Rock and Roll are amazing.<br />Today, bands who achieve a big sound in the studio - like Led Zep did in the 70's - regularly augment their live performances by adding musicians and/or sampling keyboard parts to no end. Well, these guys went up there and did it with only the band members - of which only three played instruments.<br />Still, Led Zep's sound was big without adding anything extra to their live shows. The thunder of John Bonham's drumming, the musical prowess of John Paul Jones on keyboard and bass, Robert Plant's high-pitched whails, and of course the six-string wizardry of Jimmy Page made for a formidable live experience.... as is evident in these recordings.<br />One of my favorite things about Led Zeppelin was their ability to rock hard and then unplug and kick back into a folky-bluesy band (Led Zeppelin III is my all-time fave Zep album). The acoustic set represented on disc 1 is just fabulous. John Paul Jones' mandolin has an almost steal-guitar quality to it on \\"Going To California\\"... and I still can't figure out who is doing back-up vocals on \\"Bron Yr-Aur Stomp\\". Many heavy metal bands, who followed in Led Zep's wake, have attempted to achieve this acoustical \\"gear change\\" , but never quite could do through effort what Led Zep did effortlessly.<br />After listening to these CD's, I regret even more than I thought I already did that I never got to see Led Zeppelin preform live. Born too late!<br />A must-have for all Led Zep fans... and those who want to see what the word \\"heavy\\" really means in musical terms.
0345350472|4.0|Most people will probably pick up this book with the mistaken impression that it is very similar to the &quot;famous&quot; movie starring Harrison Ford in the mid-80's. While the current printings of the book share the same title, Blade Runner was originally titled Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The title change came as the result of the movie studio liking the story, but not liking the title. Thus, the current title, which is a complete non sequitur from the plot, was born. The film, while entertaining, is not the Orwell-esque vision of a possible future that the book is.<br />In the book, Rick Deckard is faced with, not only the challenge of hunting and capturing illegal androids, but with overcoming his own android-like existence. The world he knows is a cold amalgam of mood-stimulants, fake pets, shallow relationships, and an underlying desire to be something other than what he is. At the center of this world is a meaningless quasi-religious leader named Mercer. All morality and ethical codes are teachings of Mercer, who appears to Deckard as some sort of refigured Sisyphus. It is the search for meaning in these teachings (or in spite of them) that drives Deckard to rebel against social norms and his assignment.<br />The quest for identity and objective meaning in Deckard's self discovery is a theme of all of Dick's work, and is on display best in this book. For any fan of Orwell, Sinclair or Orson Scott Card, this will certainly be a great read.
0385504209|5.0|I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of this fact based fiction book but it fast paced, exciting read.  The story is immediately grabbing and the chapters are short enough to pull you right through the book.<br />One intersting thought is that the story is so intriguining that the characters are secondary to the quest they are on.<br />I could not put it down and read this one in one day!

0805062971|3.0|What you want to say about this book is that it is great, it's groundbreaking, it's radical, and its voice captures and carries you through the seriously twisted plot.  And while you wouldn't be wrong if you said or thought these things, you'd probably be someone who hasn't read much of Palahniuk's other stuff or his literary forebear Bret Easton Ellis.  The fact that this is Palahniuk's first novel forgives a great deal of his device-reliant narrative voice.  It is, after all, a great story, very impressively written for a first novel.  Combined with the fact that it was parlayed into a full-on pop sensation with a blockbuster movie and a handy social scandal (fight clubs breaking out across the U.S.), the book was brought to the attention of many readers who would not have otherwise picked up a quasi-literary work of fiction that examines social acceptability and the expression of self.<br />All that said, Fight Club is highly entertaining, creatively imagined, and crisply executed.  You will want to read it in 3 days, and you will probably think that Palahniuk is possibly one of America's greatest living writers.  If you're happy with this thought, fine.  If you want to challenge it, read Choke and Survivor and email me with every variation in plot formula or narrative technique you find.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I have seen this band on &quot;MTV&quot; a couple of times with there music vidio &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; and loved it, then I heard it over at my friends house and desided I would reseach to find out basic band info. (yeah, I'm a geek I do stuff like that) and found out that they had a couple of CD's out. the next day I bought it and was greatful I did because there other music is great too. I normaly stick to American and Japanese music so getting Russian music was a little differant, but this is one of my favorite bands now.

0446530573|5.0|When I first saw this book I thought, \\"Here we go. A book based on the Soprano's full of complicated recipes with hard to get ingredients.\\" Being a true Soprano's fan I bought it and had a quick read of it. I enjoyed the articles, interviews and photography and then put it aside. A few months later on a whim or some sub-conscious impulse I bought a pasta machine plus attachments for making spagetti and ravioli. I got out the book again and started actually trying the recipes. First the ravioli, then the veal piccata. Yesterday the Scampi. Every recipe I have made has turned out just great and surprise...the ingredients are not that difficult to get. My supermarket even has the cheese types. I am now growing my own Basil and flat leafed parsley. Thanks to this book and the Sopranos I have discovered Italian cuisine.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown proves that a little bit of heresy, a little bit of history and some imagination make for a intriguing story. This book is a good, amazingly quick read for its size. While historians and theologians would quickly point out that some of the theories, history and theology Brown is drawing on wasn't quite represented precisely -- that's not necessarily the point. Brown is exploring themes that are amazingly contemporary yet inextricably linked to controversial history.He certainly adds a unique, challenging and maybe accurate account in some ways. For example, a group like the Templars, Opus Dei, or a topic such as the historical Jesus have all managed to stir up their fair share of controversy in recent times.<br />Unlike a more challenging title like &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ,&quot; the Da Vinci Code manages to build a fictitious world, and tackles these groups and issues in a less head-on way, making it less threatening to readers who may be uncomfortable with long, technical non-fiction books related to these topics and those who are unwilling to tackle Kazantztakis. Brown's world is decidely a work of fiction, making readers who are put off by his premises, comfortable enough to dismiss it as fiction.<br />This book is a fun read, if even at times predictable. Some of the characters are a bit formulaic at times, but the overall plot of the book advances quickly enough that those are momentary bumps.<br />The Da Vinci code also superbly manages to play with your mind along the way, challenging the reader to break codes and mysteries, most of which are not so complex to be frustrating or to be entirely implausible.
B00008J4P5|2.0|please, i could squeeze out 12 songs that were written twenty or thirty years ago in two days. am i a genius, too? the only reason this got two stars is because it wasn't quite as boring and uncreative as their others. quite.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Beautiful, an Honestly gorgeous album. I'm a hardcore listener, I look for an album with a backbone, a compilation of movements that can't be measured as anything less than stunning, and tasteful.<br /> I thought that finding such music in this day and age would be very improbable, but RAMMSTEIN delivers like Domino's. When I evaluate music, I look at what first appeals to me the very most, and then what is most polar of that.<br />First, Least appealing, \\"Rein Raus\\" (Meaning \\"In, Out\\"). As Far as Lyrical content, it's ardently sexual, but very pleasing to the imagination, with analogies. The only thing that was unappealing, was it's lack of melody, but THEN.. wouldn't you know? MELODY! A beautiful one \\"Tiefer! Tiefer! Sag Es! Sag es LOUT!\\" It was wonderful.<br />    One of the most exciting and edgy works of music I've ever witness, my most dear Track being \\"Spieluhr\\", it's definative, and tells a Haunting tale of a child, deciding he/she is dead, and some long while later, his/her music box is still playing, though the child has died- \\"Hoppe Hoppe Rieter, Eine Melodie Im Wind\\".<br />In summary, even searching for a flawed track, I still couldn't convince myself it was anything less than splendid. No Faults. Perfection, with this Raw, Passionate Elegance.<br /> Spieluhr alone is worth it, but is only a taste.Beauty flows and tears through Mein Herz Brennt, Sonne, Mutter, Adios, Nebel, Ich Will, Feuer Frei!, and Links 2,3,4. The only dissapointment here is that I couldn't give it 6 stars.<br /> If you can't find beauty in RAMMSTEIN, stop looking, because they're as good as it gets. Oh, and by the way, to anyone wondering, The Child's Vocals are those of Khira Li Lindemann, Richard Bernstein's Daughter (Not Till's).<br />-Andrew

0385504209|5.0|This book rips the mask off the church and the blinders off the congregation. It's the adult version of telling the children there is no Santa. It's provocative, it makes the reader think beyond the book for a change, as evidenced in some of the reviews here. It motivates them to question and conduct their own research, whether to prove or disprove. It is entertaining, it evokes excitment and holds the attention. Yes, it's fiction but, the sources it pulls much of its information from are not. If it moved you to active research, you may want to consider, &quot;The Jesus Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Jesus &amp; the Lost Goddess&quot; both by Frenke &amp; Gandy.

She got an education, climbed the corporate ladder in high heels, laden with child and discovered she was the man she always planned to marry.  Realizing her goals, she must face the debacle of her missing life.  I laughed, I cried, I'll be first in line when the movie comes out.  If you are a career woman, join the Kate fan club.

B00005RIKD|5.0|This has to be one of the best live albums that Sting has done if not the best, he had to sing to a crowd of fans on one of the worst day of everyone's life 2/9/01, and yet he still managed to pull it off and it sounds great. Definatly one for any die hard Sting fan out there, as it includes singles from the Police days with hits of theirs like the amazing 'Every Breath You Take' right up to the newest material like his massive solo hit 'Desert Rose' and 'If I Ever Lose My Faith In You.' A MUST for any fans out there.

B000003TAR|5.0|OK, this is a great album...In fact, one of the greatest of the early maybe considered the mid-90s or i consider it the best ever. Nirvana was revolutionary, some people don't think so cuz they heard such bands as Alice in Chains or Pearl Jam that came AFTER Nirvana. Nirvana came in 1988 with their single Love Buzz, it wasn't a hit but it was out b4 both of them.  Alice in Chains had their good moments, but ne1 who has ever listened 2 Pearl Jam and liked it is a complete idiot. They completly ripped off Nirvana with the Verse Chorus Verse formula and they tried playing a cover of SLTS and SUCKED HORRIBLY!!!!! Neways, if you want a great album to listen to, listen to this one. And if you like Pearl Jam, then you need 2 stay away cuz if you became a fan of Nirvana after liking Pearl Jam.....Then you're a discrase......
B000002H33|5.0|After the sonic wallop that was `Ride The Lightning', the metal world was waiting to see what the genre's top pace men would come up next. What was delivered was an album full of speed and fury but with a healthy injection of melody and an ongoing improvement in lyric quality. Metallica had produced a crunch fest with no filler and a platform for all the members to shine. PUPPETS marks the transformation from a hard rocking speed metal band to an institution. The death of bassist supremo Cliff Burton on the PUPPETS tour did deal the band a crushing blow that thankfully they recovered from although Some fans think it was all-downhill from there, and it is hard to argue with total perfection. For any new fans that want to hear Metallica at full power, this is the album to point them to first.<br />BATTERY - From a deceptively gentle opening, this onrushing juggernaut steamrolls over everything in its path. James Hetfield's vocals have improved since `Ride The Lightning' and Kirk Hammet's lightning lead solo threatens to send the track solar-bound. The lyrics mirror the band's attitude for the whole album: take no prisoners.<br />MASTER OF PUPPETS - This searing anti-drug epic has got to be placed in the top five of any `Best Of Metallica' lists. The lyrics state the sad truth: that drugs soon turn you into their slave and can kill. Everything is truly perfect on this track; from the many changing tempos to Hetfield's truly angered delivery, and finally to the mocking laughter that climaxes the song. Has become a sing along classic at any Metallica gig.<br />THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE - Based on a H.P. Lovecraft tale (like the previous album's instrumental opus, `The Call Of Ktulu') this slow behemoth actually sounds like an evil from the deep slowly rising up and squelching slowly towards you. Track proves that they could play slow and still pack a Metallic K.O.  <br />WELCOME HOME (SANITARIUM) - A ballad that turns into a thrash masterpiece is a tale of inmates takingover the asylum. Hefield's voice changes from a croon to a snarl to a scream, .Hammet's lead is quick fire and intensely melodic all at once. Lars Ulrich (the drummer) is a human energizer bunny on this track . . .he keeps going, and going and . . .. <br />DISPOSABLE HEROES - An intense anti-war statement played at a galloping pace. Shows how unquestioning loyalty and blind obedience can work against you with deadly results. Almost sounds like you're at the front of the battlelines.<br />LEPER MESSIAH - Slow, crunching diatribe against certain televangelists and hucksters, who sell heaven at a profit. Hetfield's anger is evident, especially at the climax: \\"Lie, Lie, Lie, LIE!!!\\" The rhythm guitar on this track shreds steel and bone.<br />ORION - What an underrated musical genius bassist Cliff Burton was. It's evident on this instrumental track that goes though many changes during its length. Sounds like a rocket blasting off and heading out into the cosmos. Kudos also for Kirk Hammet's stellar lead break in the middle.<br />DAMAGE INC - This decibel annihilator is the perfect way to end the album, with the boys delivering up a speed metal classic. Ulrich pounds the skins like he only has five minutes to live; and when James growls \\"Go!\\", they all do . . .with a vengeance! Lyrics are full of deadly metal attitude; \\"Living ain't for you and we're the cure!\\"

B00005JM03|4.0|The Italian Job is a breath of fresh air in a year that has been filled with many dissapointing action pictures and popcorn films. While the summer season has started off great, the winter and spring were filled with mediocre offerings like The Hunted, Basic, and Tears of the Sun. The Italian Job does what those films did not. It takes a plot we've seen many times before, the heist genre, and adds humor, good action scenes and characters that we actually care about to create a very entertaining film. The plot is simple enough: Six thieves complete an amazing heist in Italy, when one of the thieves double cross the rest of the team and takes off with the gold, killing the elder thief and leaving the rest of the tean for dead. The rest of the film revolves around the thieves, aided by the deceased thief's daughter, and their quest for revenge against their former colleague. The action scenes are fast paced and very crisped, and they do a better job of making mini coopers look fun and exciting than The Bourne Identity, another surprise summer hit from last year. The cast is quite good for the most part. Edward Norton was very good as the thief who betrayed the team. He seemed angry and slimy throughout the film. That might have been more about his disdain for having to make the film than his acting, as a contractual oblogation with Paramount forced him to do this film. Charlize Theron did a very good job as a safecracker, who is in the heist to avenge her father's death. Seth Green is very funny as the standard computer geek. Jason Stratham and Mos Def also provide comic relief as bickering partners who function as the driver and the explosives expert. Donald Sutherland puts in a nice performance as the elder thief, as we truly believe his experineces and knowledge. The only actor that I was not pleased with was the film's star, Mark Wahlberg. He comes off as extremely stiff, and his character is the only one without a personality. He's likable because he's the leaderand we know he is a good guy, but he had no chemistry with Theron and he is the least memorable character in the film. With that being said, he doesn't ruin the film and the film provides enough action, humor, twists and turns to make it an incredible thrill ride from beginning to end. This film should do well in the weeks ahead as it does pleaseIt is definitely worth your time if you want to see a fun movie.

B00008YLV2|5.0|this film is amazing;i wish more movies like this would be made more often.  this film had a profound effect on me and still does every time i watch it (i have watcched it god knows how many times).  this story of survivaly against all odds is riveting and jarringly powerful.  everything in this movie is perfect; kudos to Ridley Scott, who is easily one of the greatest working directors today, for crafting a film of horrific  yet beautiful proportions at the same time.  rather than go for a cheap blockbuster action film approach, scott creates this film in the vein of an art masterpiece. we dont kjnow a lot of the characters but we carea bou them every step of the way through the chaotic war. everything in this film is simply unique, at all levels, whetehr they are technical or not.  acting, cinematography, powerful dialogue, are all amazing.  the music by hans zimmer is great beyond words.  with this, he has made a powerful and moving score that adds to the greatness of this film and his own resume.  this is one of his best scores, way up there with thin red line, etc.  this is one of the best war filsm  every committed to celluloid and one of the greatest films i have seen in a long time.  i am overjoyed that a 3-disc special edition is out' my dreams have come true.  i will have to buy multiple copies because i will wear this special edition out the second i get it.

0156027321|5.0|This book is one of the most interesting I have read in a long time.  The premise made me stop what I was doing and buy it on the spot.<br />A man and a tiger are stranded together on a lifeboat.  How do they survive?<br />I won't present the reader with plot details or a synopsis of the story here. Many other reviewers have already done a fine job of that.  I will say that after having finished this book in a very short time, it was impossible to put down, I can report that it was everything I wanted it to be and more.  The writing is smart, deep and even surprising at times...<br /><br />Get this book and read it.  as the author says in the beginning... it's a story that will make you believe in God.<br />I already believe in God, but now I believe in a new author as well.  Can't wait until I read his next book.

B00005JLRT|3.0|A lot of action for a Star Trek movie, but not much of a plot. I for one found the Romulans to be too friendly. Last time I watched Star Trek (and granted, that's been awhile) the Romulans were vicious bloodthirsty warriors who took no prisoners. Instead we get Picard offering to buy a female Romulan a drink as they come to the aid of the battered Enterprise? (Hope that little nugget of info didn't ruin anything for anybody) Sorry, just not buying the story.<br />While we're at it, let's throw in a new data android, a vicious new starship which doesn't get used to it's full potential and takes 11 minutes to warm up it's big gun, and a new villain leader of the Romulans ...... who's not even Romulan. He's a humanoid clone? Sorry, too much reaching for a plot here took away from the the fantastic special effects sequence.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is fantastic, surpassing &quot;Parachutes&quot;.  Without a doubt the best album of 2002.  They truly are the next U2, and I'm glad there's a band out there that can assume that mantle the way they have.
B000063UR2|1.0|I purchased this DVD based on the reviews for it here on Amazon - and must admit to being perplexed as to how this movie could possibly have gotten the kind of reviews it did...for either version! It moves at a glacial pace, plot line is poor, and many of the scenes are so dark and poorly lit, that much is lost.  If you haven't seen this movie, think twice before purchasing it unseen.
068484267X|4.0|Having read this book for school, I realize that i would haver never picked it up to read out of my own free will. But I am glad i have read it. It opened my eyes to how different lifestyles can be between culture. The irish have suffered for so long, and I have had it so good and didnt even know the difference. I have a warm home, clothes on my body, food in my belly, and then some. During this time period in Ireland, children at the age of 5 or 6 could be working to help support their families. American children at the age of 5 or 6 would just be strting school. I think this is a great book for students at Walla Walla High School read as part of the Literature curriculum. This book takes human emotion by  the core and opens peoples eyes to all the different aspects of life. It make people realize how much we take for granted and makes us appreciate what we are fortunate enough to have.
630514415X|4.0|Although it's not my favourite Spike Lee Joint, \\"He Got Game\\" is easily one of his best films, and it sure helps when you've got as many fine performances/cameos as this film does.<br />Denzel Washington (who's incapable of giving a lousy performance) and Ray Allen as Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth respectively, give the film it's anchors, allowing Lee to project his soapboxes and political rants more effectively than in earlier efforts such \\"Malcolm X\\".<br />It also helps to have Public Enemy back on board with a boomin' soundtrack (their best album in years), and other Spike Lee regulars Lonette McKee, Bill Nunn, and John Turturro--his cameo as a zealot college basketball coach is great.<br />The story moves along briskly enough, isn't overdone, and the editing is as good as anything Oliver Stone chooses to claim as his own.  A number of great quotes, and more than enough humour to lighten up the proceedings before they get too dark.  Definitely worth owning.
B00005MKA3|5.0|In the few short years of his Island records career Marley produced a string of astonishingly good studio albums as well as two great live albums. These included Exodus, rated by Time magazine as the greatest album of the century, and Kaya, which is my personal favorite. So where does this leave the rest of the Marley canon.<br />It seems to me that the Marley albums fall into only two categories, the five star and the four star albums, (see my ratings below). Though I am very stingy with the five star rating, Survival easily makes five stars, and it may even be the best Marley album, and quite possibly the greatest album of all time.<br />How can this be? Well, every song on the album is just irresistible, with great lyrices, impassioned performance, superb orchestration, catchy hooks... just a superb package. I honestly do not believe that anyone who listens to this album will not find it a life changing experience. Well, to be honest, there are probably lots of people who would fall into that category, but my remarks apply to those with discriminating taste and well developed sensibilities.<br />OK, I am running on, but this is just a great, great album. 'Nuff said.<br />* A really worthless CD<br />** A CD that has some good stuff, but some major defects.<br />*** An OK CD that will please fans of the artist in question.<br />**** An excellent CD that represents the best work of the artist in question and can be bought with confidence.<br />***** An absolute classic that is the best, or among the best, of its genre.

B00003CY6M|3.0|Yeah, I used that phrase, and more women use that than men, I'm sure.  Serendipity, for all its considerable charm (many props to the casting director), belongs in the same boat as any Meg Ryan film, any Sandra Bullock film, or anything written by Nora Ephron, etc.<br />In other words, when you wanna stun 'em with your sensitivity, guys, you rent this.<br />It's got Eugene Levy (never better), Jeremy Piven, and Molly Shannon as its secondary characters, but with all due respect to John Cusack and Kate Beckinsdale (who are adequate), the main characters aren't the main attraction.  Something of a problem when we're asked to care specifically about the main couple of the piece!<br />It's routine romance fare; nothing strikingly original, and an ending that's way too quick for the amount of time you have to put into the whole film, but you won't go wrong by it.
B000001EXR|5.0|Not since 1981's brilliant \\"(Music From) The Elder\\" album did KISS dig this deep inside themselves to create a compelling, musically complex, and lyrically insightful record as \\"Carnival Of Souls\\".<br />Stand-out Tracks:<br />Master & Slave<BR>In My Head<BR>Childhood's End<BR>I Will Be There<BR>I Confess<BR>and<BR>Seduction Of The Innocent<br />A truly amazing album.....<br />BUY IT!!
B000002KBU|5.0|Some recommended albums by the critics aren't worth the paper they're printed on nor the plastic they're pressed with.  But this one truly is a keeper in every sense of the word.<br />Please bear in mind I cannot stand 'folk' music for very long.  I don't care how talented a singer/songwriter is; the more limited the medium, the less attention they will be garnered in the long run.  Since the release of \\"Blue\\", the 'girl w/guitar' has been done to death.  So do yourselves a favour and buy this just to see how it's done.<br />\\"A Case Of You\\", \\"Carey\\", \\"All I Want\\", \\"My Old Man\\" don't lend themselves to headbanging, but their simplicity and serenity lack peers.  Whether it's lyrics or delivery, they are classics of the genre, and should not be casually ignored.<br />Later Joni albums such as \\"Hejira\\", \\"Hissing of Summer Lawns\\", and \\"Court and Spark\\" are at times, equally good, but none had the cohesiveness of this album.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This movie is awesome.  In the theaters it &quot;got no respect&quot;, but it really deserved it.  Upon watching it a few times it really shows that you can watch it again and again, and not be bored and feel compelled to turn it off.<br />The movie's greatness is shown by its selling over a million copies its first week out.  It is a great movie with plenty of twists and turns and excellant cinemaography.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I would rate this film somewhere between three and four stars, funnier than the Austin Powers films but not as zany as \\"There's Something About Mary\\" or \\"Blame it on Rio.\\" This is Ben Stiller's \\"Citizen Kane\\"--he starred, directed, co-wrote, and co-produced this film--and it is his manic energy which makes everything work so well. In fact, Stiller is in almost every frame of the movie (as befits a legend of supermodeling) as the delightfully dim \\"Derek Zoolander.\\" Derek is commandeered to be the murderous automaton of the evil designer Mugatu (Will Ferrel, in a crazy, poodle-topped performance), since Fabio is dismissed as \\"too smart\\" to be brainwashed. Stiller is perfect as the vacuous \\"Zoolander,\\" and Owen Wilson's \\"Hansel\\" (what a genius of casting, Wilson looks completely UN-supermodel!) is a perfect comic foil. The gay sensibilities (perhaps courtesy of co-producer Scott Rudin) are delicately woven through the film, but of course ALL male models are ultimately straight, like all major Hollywood stars [wink]. Christine Taylor as \\"Matilda\\" has the difficult role of straight man to all the goofiness around her, and she is beautiful and stolid. Milla Jovovich sneers and snarls through her vampy role, Jon Voight is just bizarre as Papa Zoolander, and the brisk, 89-minute film is crowded with cameos. Stiller's vision is like a happier, less toxic, less filthy version of John Waters' universe. It is a credit to the sparkle and spontaneity of the film that the deleted scenes and outtakes are no funnier than what was left in the film. Sure, Stiller has taken on an easy target, but he has done it with tremendous wit and irreverence. Work the runway, sweetie! Give us Blue Steel.
B00008PX8P|5.0|All serious Zep fans no longer have to rely on the old problematic movie *The Song Remains the Same* for a convincing video document of the band.  Whereas the old movie was a forced project near the end of a tiring world tour, this DVD set is made up of prime video footage shot at various times throughout the band's career, when they were definitely hungry for greatness and performing full-out for their army.<br />The best portion of the set is the inclusion of a nearly-whole concert at Royal Albert Hall in 1970. (The liner notes state that a performance of \\"Heartbreaker\\" had to be omitted due to damaged videotape.) Here we can see a band that is still on the upswing and intent on world domination. Robert Plant is still intent on proving himself (and succeeding), and Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones are performing relentlessly without their later theatrics and forced virtuosity, clearly letting the music do the talking. The biggest revelation is John Bonham, only 21 years old and playing with a heaviness and power that no other drummer came close to at the time, but which everyone is doing now.  The highlight is his god-like soloing in \\"Moby Dick\\" which is continuously mindboggling despite the double-digit length in minutes. Here we can see a true emerging genius.<br />The footage from 1973 and 1975 show the band in their prime, when they were on top of the world but getting a little showoffish. Except for the heartfelt and beautiful acoustic mini-set in '75, featuring John Paul Jones on very elegant mandolin. Then we see a tired but still powerful band in 1979, when Jimmy Page looks like he's about to drop dead. At least he could still play his heart out. Most of the \\"extras\\" that come with the set are also fascinating, especially TV show tapings from 1969-70 when Zep completely blew away square audiences and unprepared studios. No true Zep fan should be without this incredible package. Go buy your first DVD player if you have to.
B00008NRI8|3.0|While Sandra Bullock shines in every role she plays, including this one, it is not difficult to do so in this mediocre film. She seems to lack the infectious energy and enthusiasm that is typical Sandra Bullock. In &quot;2 Weeks Notice&quot;, Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, who goes to work for Hugh Grant's &quot;playboy&quot; attorney George Wade. She initially takes the job because she wants to gain influence into a cause he is involved with that is near and dear to her heart. While she thinks she is hired to be his &quot;paralegal&quot; for lack of a better term, she really ends up becoming a secretary/gopher. She helps him pick out ties and things along those lines. She also knows his reputation as a &quot;womanizer&quot; might not bode well for her, but she signs on anyway. The &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; part comes in when she gives just that to Wade. She stays on for the two weeks to assist in the search and training of her replacement (played by the bland Alicia Witt), who, bingo, Wade also puts the moves on. It's a role that is not good enough for Bullock, and working with the overrated Hugh Grant is not something she needed to do.
