B004GJDQT8|3.0|Does a great job of presenting and integrating the app store as well as installation. The other marketplaces could learn a lot from the Amazon Appstore App. There is just one frustrating failing that really needs to be addressed soon. If you delete an app and REALLY don't want it any more there is NO WAY to remove it from your list of Apps in the Appstore App. It just sits there forever, cluttering up the interface. Huge over sight that quickly devalues the interface and usability for anyone that (un)installs more than a few apps.

0307477479|4.0|I have to admit that I was a bit afraid to start this book.  Some of the reviews made me think it would be too stylistic and a bit of a challenge to read.  Luckily, this wasn't the case.    The book follows a number of related characters, with different chapters focusing on a tangential character already present in the story.  They might be able to stand on their own, but the stories are definitely intertwined.  I did occassionally feel the need to leaf back through prior chapters to identify the new protagonist, but the general flow was very solid.  There are themes weaved throughout the book with a focus on how the passage of time impacts individuals and their stories.  There is a musical undertone as well but it didn't overpower the story...I'm not a music person and didn't feel excluded from the flow.  The chapters range from the past to the future and Egan shows how people evolve and yet stay the same too.    Overall, very much enjoyed the \\"visit\\" with the book's world.  The characters were compelling and the style allowed for them to be fleshed out in a really unique way.  It isn't \\"scary,\\" despite my own trepidation it isn't a difficult read, but you do have to be up for a non-traditional narrative.  Giving in to the flow of the book will be rewarded.

B004QSQML8|5.0|I got this on Blu-ray from Amazon today. They both look much better then dvd versions, but I think the theatrical wins hands down for video quality. The sharpness is so much better in the TC. The picture detail is better in both, but the TC cut seems about a 4.5 out of 5 and the DC is a 3.5, it just isn't as sharp as the TC.<br /><br />I compared 2 scenes, at the beginning, where Darkness points his finger in blix's face, the TC is much sharper then the DC. They are both huge upgrades from the DVD editions. There is detail in things in both I have never seen before. The back of Darkness's thrown has shimmering jewels in it that can now be seen in the Blu-ray version. Grain is intact on both. They both sound great in DTS.<br /><br />This is what is shown before the TC:<br />The final theatrical version of LEGEND was transferred by Universal in 2006 directly from the inter-negatives. It displays a much more detailed and refined image than the Director's Cut. Considering the significantly different source elements and transfer processes involded, it is safe to say that each version of LEGEND has it's own strengths and I leave it to you to decide which one you think is best.  - Ridley Scott<br /><br />This is what is shown before the DC:<br />For years before it's release on DVD release, the LEGEND Director's Cut was thought to be lost forever. However in 2000, it was miraculously located in the form of a pristine answer print, which was later transferred to DVD. Answer print by their nature offer limited latitude in the transfer process, commonly resulting in lees-then-optimal picture quality.Such is the case with LEGEND Director's Cut.Newly re-transferred in 2011 for this Blu-ray release, the limitations of the answer print are now even more apparent in high definition. However, given it's one-and-only source element, the Director's Cut looks as good as it possibly can and I am pleased to include it on this Blu-ray release as both an archival curiosity for fans and a digital preservation of my original vision for the film.<br /><br />- RidleyScott<br /><br />I've always preferred the Theatrical cut since it is the one I've seen 30+ times on VHS and DVD for 25 years. Just like I prefer the TC of Blade Runner, but now I can watch the DC after so  many viewings of the TC that I hear the voice overs in my head when I watch it now.<br /><br />No new special features, the same as the DVD from 2002.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book The Lone Survivor is a very compelling book that continually keeps you concentrated and interested as you read. The book is not too long and is very comprehendible, making it an easy read as you go along. There are tons of interesting anecdotes throughout the novel, giving you a fresh taste of something every time you read. It gives a good background an interesting detail about the life and training of a navy seal. It shows the life of a man with a great life from start to now, giving compelling stories of childhood and growing up. You are side by side with Marcus Luttrel in this book as he takes on hell week in Coronado and goes into Afghanistan in search of Bin Laden's right hand man. The amount of respect that you can have for this man is immense after being just 50 into this book. It never lets you down from start to end. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an interesting read that will not bore you, or is interested in military ops or navy seals. Read this novel and experience Marcus Luttrels journey through BUD/S, and Afghanistan.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was thoroughly engaging from beginning to end. The story takes place in a country called Panem which is divided into 12 districts and a Capitol. An uprising in the 13th district forced the Capitol to destroy the district to quell any future uprisings. Another way the Capitol flexes its muscles, is through the annual Hunger Games. Through a lottery, 2 young people are chosen from each district to compete against each other in an arena that is environmental controlled by the powers-that-be. The 24 contestants are to battle for provisions and for their lives. Only 1 child is allowed to win/survive the competition. This is the ultimate game of Survivor and is televised to all of the districts. Watching is mandatory.

B0013GTNIA|1.0|Back in the late 1920s, a tango pioneer by the name of Julio De Caro turned what was a simple, provincial folkloric rhythm into a sophisticated, classical rooted musical style. After him, many more followed with their own talent.    I guess it's a good thing that De Caro died 30 years ago, so he didn't get to hear this crap.    \\"World music\\" audiences will consume anything with an electronic bass & drums base track. Add a didgeridoo, and it's Australian. Add a bandoneon instead, and it's Argentinean. Needless to mention, talent is not required.

Angus worked the crowd well as well at Brian Johnson, god only knows how they do it performing for over 35 years.The rhythm section of Malcolm Young, Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd was solid as ever.  Fans would love the bonus features on the DVD as it takes you back stage as the band gave brief inteviews about their 9 day stay in Argentina.  I think it's fair to say that this DVD is a Tribute to the Fans!!!

B003K16P3M|5.0|This book was a great read. I am a thirteen year old girl, slightly below the target audience, but Cashore still had me on the edge of my seat. Katsa is a really strong character, but still original. She is not the stereotypical female lead. In the beginning of the book, she is trying to defeat the animal that her uncle King Randa has created within her. Later in the book, however, Katsa welcomes it back to help her care for and protect Bitterblue. Cashore's plot is filled with twists and loaded with secrets. The characters are all unique. The character I really connected with is Bitterblue. She is tough, but still a little scared. This is what give her that extra dimension of reality, a quality which Cashore lends to most of the characters in the novel. Then there is the element of romance and uncertainty that Po brings to the novel. This book is a great book and I recommend it to all teens.

0062060554|4.0|It's a safe bet that there have been more fictional amnesia sufferers in history than real ones.  Most of the time it's a delaying tactic in melodrama or a source of cheap humor in comedy.  In those cases, it's a temporary total amnesia, loss of all memory up to the point of an injury, usually a stereotypical bump on the head.  S.J. Watson's debut thriller uses a different form of the illness.  Every night when Christine Lucas goes to sleep, she loses her memory of the past two decades.  Expecting a college student or even a teenager in the mirror, she's shocked to discover a woman in her mid-forties.  A woman, she discovers, who has a husband.  At first it seems that Ben is the only person in her life, but after he leaves on the day the story begins, she gets a call from someone claiming to be a doctor who's been treating her... without Ben's knowledge.  He gives her a journal she's been keeping, allowing her to build on each day's discoveries.  What she uncovers will leave this uniquely vulnerable woman with no idea who she can trust.<br /><br />This is, of course, a fine premise for a thriller, and the novel generally makes good use of it, although the plot revolves too much around a single question, going back and forth in a way that threatens to become tiresome and makes the (implausible, but let that go) ultimate revelation slightly underwhelming and predictable.  Some of the other narrative twists aren't difficult to work out either, but others are, and Watson delivers enough revelations that things don't bog down.  The prose is simple and easy to read.  Its major drawback is that, despite being in the first person, it offers no distinctive voice.  This might seem appropriate for an amnesiac, but no matter how much she does or doesn't remember, Christine fails to emerge as anything other than a tragic blank.  She's also remarkably incurious about how the wider world has changed in the decades she can no longer remember.  This isn't a major problem for the thriller aspects of the novel, but it does put a damper on the thematic ambitions.<br /><br />The novel wants to address issues of memory and identity, but without a well-defined central character its attempts feel like flat, disconnected psychological meditations without any meaningful confusions.  Its optimistic resolution renders these concerns irrelevant, and while welcome on a level of basic human sympathy, it's too pat for a book with a deeper purpose.  But the thematic asides are brief, and don't detract much from the pace.  Before I Go to Sleep is an engaging, readable entertainment, a good way to pass a few hours if you can suspend disbelief and enjoy a slow but satisfying storyline with numerous reversals and extremes of joy, fear, pain, and hope.pects of the novel, but it does put a damper on the thematic ambitions.

0143038419|2.0|After being recommended this book by two different friends, I thought I would give the book a try.  I saw the movie, and thought the movie didn't do the book justice! The movie was not deep and the characters were not connected. The book was indeed slightly better.  I hardly read any fiction or travel memoir, but I decided to indulge on a lazy  cold Sunday afternoon and curled up on my sofa with this book.  I feel that I can relate to Gilbert on many levels: her worries, her guilt, her self-doubt as a member of the society, and her determination to pursue love and happiness.   I also laugh at her self-deprecating jokes.  The part about Italy was absolutely funny, but I start to lose focus in the later parts.  I can see some reviewers would be annoyed by the long-windedness...afterall, not bad for a quick entertaining read!

0425242099|5.0|My first thought was: Compakt. Almost to compakt.  The secondary story about Walker and Lara fits very well into the main story without losing the focus of Hawke`s and Sienna`s story. However, their story could have also be told in another book/novella. Anyhow: Walker, the calm Psy defector, was great!     Kiss of Snow is not only Hawke and Sienna`s story, but also a book about the Lauren family and about the Snow Dancer wolves. It allowed a deep insight in the pack hierarchy and shows, how important Hawke - as alpha - is for his pack; and vice versa. It gives a lot insight in the pack and Lauren family past.    The story is shadowed with the upcoming attack of Pure Psy and of Sienna`s X-power, which get more and more out of control. Both is a deadly threat for the Snow Dancer wolves and the last one especial for Sienna.     Sienna and Hawke. Like Hawke had mentioned in a former book: Nothing is and was ever easy when it comes to Sienna Lauren. Vice versa Sienna would probably say exactly the same when it comes to Hawke. - Stubborn Hawke! Instead of acommodate in the compelling attraction, he solidify his opinion that Sienna is far to young to handle man and wolf. Having lost his defined mate as a young boy, he is also unable to give Sienna \\"all\\" of him. To spare Sienna, he deny her every possibility to form a relationship with him.   Nevertheless he`s unable to ignore totally his attraction to her, which leads to the impression he demand a claim on Sienna. Whereas he keeps her on distance.   He goes even so far to turn to another women to still his held back need for her. Sienna, heartstricken to his actions, decides to turn away from him. She tries to start a new beginning; without Hawke. - Poor Hawke! Sienna`s decision brings man and wolf into an serious discrepancy. His little Psy knows exactly which button she has to press to push him *g*.  Piece for piece she breaks the wall arround his heart. And alas.. in the end their relationship is beautiful. Very beautiful *sigh*.

B002Q1YDLI|2.0|I am very surprised at the great reviews that this book has received.  The entire book seems to be told from the perspective of Rachel is she were to put herself in Darcy's shoes.  The character is not believable as an actual person, and definitely did not garner any sympathy from me.  Part of the reason the character is not believable is because she seems to have a lot of insight into her actions even at the very beginning.  She knows what actions of hers will be unacceptable to the majority of her friends and family.  In addition, it was disappointing to read the second chapter, which was pretty much verbatim one of the last chapters in Something Borrowed.  Knowing that memory is not something that we can just rewind and play, this part was especially unrealistic and disappointing.  I would save your money and instead pick up a book by Sophie Kinsella.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|It goes without saying that the \\"best\\" Terminator film was the first, simply because it *was* the first! There is something to be said for originality, after all. Still I am far more impressed with \\"Terminator Salvation\\" for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />First, the theme of the other Terminator films is worn out. How many times can we watch a film about one terminator chasing some people all over the country before it gets old? I always found the brief war scenes in those films far more intriguing, and I often wondered why the script writers did not include a lot more of them. At last, they have! The whole film is about the war, and Skynet is no longer some distant, mostly unseen enemy but a true adversary who is visibly present in every scene. That is what I have wanted to see-- the WAR against the machines!-- not a single terminator chasing people a few people around in circles again.<br /><br />Second, the special effects of this film were awesome. Whatever might be lacking in terms of acting skills (which Terminator film had good acting anyway?), it made up for it with special effects. The Terminators are so realistic that I have literally had a few nightmares about them-- just the kind of scare I love from a movie! The only aspect that lacked realism is that the Terminators seem to be incompetent marksmen for being such advanced machines. How many rounds does it take to hit a target, after all? \\"Spray and Pray\\" seems to be how Terminators shoot, which results in far more misses than hits, and that makes little sense to me when our contemporary computer-guided missiles can strike with pinpoint accuracy. It also seems like an awful waste of ammunition to me. Nevertheless, I can see why it is a necessary part of the show. We could not have Terminators who shoot with pinpoint accuracy without blowing away all hope for human victory now, could we? Ah, such unrealistic elements are a necessary evil. This is science *fiction,* after all!<br /><br />All in all, this is my personal favorite of all the Terminator films. It may not have the originality of the first, but it is certainly the most impressive in terms of war scenes and special effects. This is why I am giving it a five-star rating.of all the Terminator films.

B004H0N4PC|2.0|I have been an Elbow fan since Asleep In The Back, but I can not call myself a fan of this album.<br /><br />With each album Elbow seemed to become more pop accessible and less experimental.  But they always managed to do it in ways that made you overlook that fact. The amount of genre straddling on The Seldom Seen Kid is just one example. As long as their music remained interesting and intriguing, it was easy to overlook the lack of edginess on the releases that followed Asleep In The Back.<br /><br />But this album?  I just don't know what to say about this album. I can't really call it terrible, but I certainly can't call it good.  The best way to sum it up, in my opinion, is boring.<br /><br />The good moments are too far and few between and the build to reach them is most often completely uninteresting. There was not a reason in the world that The Birds, despite being my favorite track on the album, should have run for eight full minutes.  You have to wait nearly 5 minutes for it to even really go anywhere.  The album is sparse and minimal, but also dull and bland.<br /><br />As the title stated, there's a first time for everything...such as a bad Elbow album.  And I guess every band will eventually have a bad album...

0307473708|2.0|You have to give the creators, writers, and cast of the Showtime series \\"Dexter\\" a lot of credit for taking elements and characters from a weak book and turning it into an immensely entertaining show. If I hadn't seen the TV show then I would've hated this book. The author's style frequently alternates between bad poetry and abundantly annoying alliterations (see what I mean?!), the characters are flat, and the storyline goes in different (just stupid) directions than the series. If you've already seen the series then you may want to read \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" just so you can imagine the actors acting out the scenes in the book and by comparison you'll have a better appreciation of how good the show really is.

It is almost impossible to get a nice clean edge with this sharpener. All the blades I tried with this multiple times have rough edges after.

B002ZG997C|5.0|The initial shot puts the viewer in the middle of the survivalist world Eli lives in.  The four major combat scenes Eli dominates are stark enough with visceral violence to be riveting and you won't want to miss one second of them. They are bloody but tastefully done.  This is an excellent good guy-bad guy confrontation that lasts till the end. Denzel Washington's command of the character's determination to fulfill his mission is truly believeable.  The supporting cast makes you enjoy how well they work together in this powerful movie.  You won't go for popcorn watching it.

B000056H24|5.0|Let me say right up front that I am not a particularly religious person. Even with that being the case, I have to admit to being touched by this film. I cannot imagine a better portrayal of Christ than that by von Sydow. The portrayal of Mary Magdalene by Joanna Dunham, though limited to only a few minutes on the screen, made me understand why the men of that time would have been tempted by her.    The production values are superb. I have yet to bite the bullet by buying a widescreen TV so the letterboxing proved a nuisance. The cinematogpraphy simply blew me away. The lighting director deserved an Oscar (he might have won one but I haven't checked) just for the scenes involving the cruxificion. I played that portion over and over again and couldn't help but think that this is how a great painter would have interpreted that event.    It's a rather long film but I didn't find one scene that I would have wanted cut.    The icing on the cake is the great soundtrack. The transfer to 5.1 is excellent although, at times, it was a bit difficult to hear the dialog over the score.    Anyone with the slightest interest about the origins of Christianity should at least watch the film and it belongs in the library of anyone interested in the cinema in general.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I found the story gripping and all too possible. It generally takes me a week or so to get through as novel of a similar size, what with my adult onset ADD and all. I was through Zero day in about 24 hours including a little break for nourishment and a few winks.
0312600844|5.0|Very surprised at how low the rating is for this book.  Really, really enjoyed it.  In the vein of Don DeLillo's Underworld.  Thought it was easier to emotionally stomach than The Corrections.  Found myself laughing out loud at times.  Some parts so rawly honest, some parts so painfully cynical.  Have to remember it is fiction - and that at times Franzen probably meant to paint a caricature of some of the characters...
0345529057|5.0|Take the political intrigue and warfare of medieval England, throw in a little magic and dragons, and spice with excellent characters. That is the dish served here.    The story jumps from character to character to get their individual points of view. Just don't get too attached to any particular character, for the game of thrones is a dangerous game indeed.    There are a few small things that bothered me, such as seasons that seem to last a random number of years, but these were fairly insignificant compared to the larger tapestry.  This series is definitely worth your time.
159240488X|5.0|I know, I'm as shocked as anyone (even as a fellow stickler).  Truss' take on grammar and the way it's deteriorating is entertaining and warrants an LOL.  (Oh, wait, that's text talk.  Sorry.)
B0028KGD8I|5.0|This is an awesome show.  I suggest purchasing the entire season instead of each episode one at a time because you'll end up buying the next one and the next one and the next one....yeah it's that good.
B004H4XLRE|4.0|We've had this since it came out. My kid abuses this and it's held up well for the past month. It's plastic so not sure it's good for the long haul but it's built well. It doesn't launch small cars well but works well with most hot wheels, CARS and Tomica cars.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|Comment: I will be the first to admit that this movie made it into my house because I am a film collector and especially these days... Blu-ray 3D. I saw that the ratings were all over the place for all kinds of reasons. It makes sense if you are a \\"church/religious\\" person... you don't even know it exists or at best you will give it a one star rating. If you are a \\"wild and crazy guy\\" (person)... you will give it a five star rating. OK, so your taking the time to read my rating. When I critique a movie on Amazon, I do so by looking at the big picture. After watching this film I saw that it was a \\"shock and awe\\" movie... held together with 3D. I am no prude, neither am I a blood and guts for blood and guts sake type of guy. I am somewhere in the middle. Although the movie came close at times to overdoing it, it had some \\"smart\\" shocking scenes. If I had seen this movie in 2D I would have said sure whatever. I watched it in 3D and expected it to be shoddily done. But no! I have new state of the art Samsung 3D equipment and low and behold the 3D was the \\"icing on the cake\\" for me. It was just what this \\"done before\\" film needed. The cleverly done 3D made this campy also ran \\"B\\" rated movie a first rate Amazon five star \\"B\\" rated movie. If you are an open minded person and have decent 3D equipment, this may be a good change of pace where you can slip into the somewhat ridiculous lost worlds of \\"B\\" (C,D,E and F...) rated movies... now in the \\"new state of the art\\" 3D.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I read this story in it's entirety as posted on Fan Fiction, and the later updates on the author's blog.  This story is nothing like the \\"original story\\" that it was \\"based on\\".  In fact, the only way the reader knew it was based on that other series was because of the names of the characters.  THIS story is captivating and addictive. The product reviewer got it right when they wrote that this story will \\"obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.\\"  It was so easy to get lost in the story, to become Ana as she endured this budding relationship with uncertainty.  I was not thrilled with where it was cut, but in thinking of the original story, and without giving anything away, this marks a significant turning point in the story, as cliffhangers usually do.  And we know it is a cliffhanger because we know there are two more books to come...  I, for one, can't wait.  And I will gladly spend my money to re-read this story.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|I've been using this for almost two years with all manner of external Firewire 400 devices and MacBook Pros and it's been a real champ. Alas, last week I \\"lost\\" it so I've ordered two more--one to keep at my workstation and one for my travel bag.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have an LG Optimus V so this -should- work. Instead, it takes forever to open and when it does it runs so glitchy you can't play it. Would be really upset if I had paid for it but it was the free app of the day.
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|Just a very quick review. I think this is the best live band that Steve has taken out on the road. The standouts for are the new tracks from his latest CD. Every Day is is super as well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am not a gamer when it comes to mobile devices, just PS3 and Xbox are my gaming consoles. After seeing this for free on Amazon I figured I'd give it a shot, well I am not at all disappointed and now I am addicted to playing this game.  I'm actually on my lunch break from work and playing it as I type.  Though I got this game for free, I definitely see it worth the $1.50 price tag. Get it you wont regret it, trust me.  I'm currently using it on my Xoom and the picture isn't perfect but it's good enough to enjoy thoroughly.
B004YSDRC2|5.0|The two parter The Impossible Astronaut and Day of the Moon are entertaining on more levels than any show on TV.      The performances are flawless. Alex Kingston swings effortlessly from flirty to soulful to ruthless. Matt Smith's hyperactive hummingbird of a Doctor can be terrifying when he slows down, and becomes cold as ice.  He's a brilliant comedic performer too.  Just about everything he does has a bit of humor in it.  Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvil have the thankless job of playing 'Watsons' to The Doctor's 'Sherlock', and make sure the audience is caught up, but they both manage some well defined character moments, and they sell the moments of excitement and fear perfectly.    The plot is very complicated for a family show, so pay attention.  This, like Lost, demands you listen to dialog, watch what's going on, and think about what you've seen.  Also like Lost, the negative reviews almost always contain misunderstandings about what's actually happened in the show.    It's funny. Very funny.  It's funnier than most comedies on television.  I laughed more in these two episodes than I did watching The Office or Outsourced.    My only complaint is almost not a complaint.  Head Writer Steven Moffat has packed so much cool stuff into these two episodes, that the ideas of the show have very little room to develop.  A little less action would have freed time to explain why The Doctor's extreme behavior was justified, and could have fleshed out the themes of memory, paranoia, and motivation the villain of the piece was so perfectly suited to explore.  It's not enough to lower my rating to four stars because these episodes towered so high above most everything else on television.         It might be a bit silly for some viewers, but if you have enjoyed any genre television at all, you should try out Doctor Who.
B00005RHGK|4.0|The item didn't come in the expected condition, but I was given a full refund. I raised the star rating for that. Thanks.
B000002I2I|4.0|'Morrison Hotel' is one of the Doors' more underrated efforts. Released in early 1970, The Doors were already one of the biggest bands in the world by this point. Led by the poetic lyrics and sultry baritone of Jim Morrison, The Doors were on their way to becoming one of the biggest bands perhaps in the world when Morrison died in Paris in 1971. The Doors' remaining three surviving members carried on, but it was never the same again, and by 1974, The Doors were finished.    Now back to this record. This album features tracks that were recorded as far back as 1966 ('Indian Summer,' which was completed before their 1967 self-titled debut masterpiece was released) and also features some leftovers from previous albums ('Waiting for the Sun,' which was recorded for inclusion on -- you guessed it -- 'Waiting for the Sun' in 1968), plus nine other new songs. Thus, this album is a compilation album/studio album hybrid. It's not the odds and sods collection, but it's not your run-of-the-mill studio album, either.    The tracks here are all marvelous. 'Peace Frog' and 'Blue Sunday' rank among my favorite Doors songs, 'Roadhouse Blues' is as pure blues as any rock and roller will ever get (John Lee Hooker even covered this track -- and that says something!), and 'Queen of the Highway' and 'Land Ho!' show a different side of The Doors. Morrison's voice is as smooth as its probably ever been on 'Queen of the Highway,' and Ray Manzarek's keyboards grace 'Land Ho!' perfectly, and give it textures and layers that truly make it out of this world.    The two \\"old\\" songs are great as well. 'Indian Summer' is a great tune -- but it definitely would have been out of place on the '67 debut. It is nearly four years older (two years in the case of 'Waiting for the Sun') than everything else here, and yet it fits perfectly. In fact, I can't imagine it on any other album besides 'Morrison Hotel.' This is good old early Doors, and gives a glimpse of what else was created during the pre-1967 Doors days.    'Waiting for the Sun,' in contrast, would have fit perfectly on the album of the same name. It was it's title track, for God's sake! This is a great tune, featuring some great Manzarek synthesizer and organ riffs and some good Morrison vocals, but why The Doors left it off the 1968 album is anyone's guess. This is one of my favorite Doors songs (always have loved the keyboards), but it does feel out of place on this record (just my opinion).    Overall, this is an interesting album. If you like The Doors, this is an essential album to own, as it shows many different sides of the band and offers many different perspectives. Is it a compilation album? Is it a studio album? That's for you to decide. Whatever you call it, you'll find 11 great songs here as only The Doors could perform them. Buy this album and hear why The Doors' legacy has lived on, nearly 40 years after Jim Morrison's untimely death at the age of 27.    I recommend 'Morrison Hotel.' It's not their best album (I think that honor goes to the debut), and personally, it's not my favorite Doors album ('Waiting for the Sun' is, although 'The Soft Parade' comes close), but there's not a bad song in the bunch here. There's no filler -- it's just good music and great poetry throughout. If you like The Doors, I'm willing to bet you'll like 'Morrison Hotel.'    Recommended. Give it a listen and see what you think.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This has been well worth the wait. Graphics are awsome on the droid x. I own this game on the pc and the ps3. I love being able to use the touch screen. Pop cap has a way with games.
B000028U0Y|4.0|It is a really good Cash album that shows some of his fun side which studio albums cannot catch. Great to listen to highly recommend.
B003AO1SVS|2.0|Thickfreakness and Rubber Fsctory were awesome w/ the lo-fi thing. This cd sounds like they are reaching for the almighty radio single. Very straightforward and uninspired in my opinion. Gone is the fuzzy amp w/ the Hendrix-like vox delivery. Going through the motions with this one.
B004X2M3SI|5.0|This season, from the few episodes already available, has the making for a brilliant season, possibly the best yet. Karen Gillian says that THIS is the season to watch, and never were truer words spoken about Doctor Who! The cast is turning in awesome performances, the writing both takes itself more seriously and remains endearingly light-hearted, and the cgi and visual effects are stunning. By far, the best product with the brand name on it.<br /><br />Well done!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's absolutely the best game I've ever owned on android since the g1 release.(first android phone). I recommend it to anyone wuuu a smart phone that can handle it.
B0053EZXRS|1.0|Well, I think the 5 star review must have been from Mr. Cage.  Calling this movie awful is an insult to awful movies.    Poor effects (like when they're in their cars and green screened), coupled with the same emoticons produced by Cage in all of his movies... well let's just say it may be a good thing his movies aren't in the theaters for more than a day.    I really wish he'd return to \\"The Rock\\" Cage instead of the \\"Wow, I really got weird\\" Cage.    All-in-all, if you're looking for a movie that sucks 2 hours of your life away that you'll never get back - then this is a must see for you.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this game looks great and I'm aware of it's popularity, however that's all I know. the developer has stated it runs on most tablets although it's not optimized for it. the details also is either vague about locating compatible device listing or assuming it is visible. maybe it is and i missed it? My device, an Archos 70it (250 gb storage, 1000mhz cpu, 256mb ram running froyo will not get beyond the popcap games logo.<br /><br />I'd personally enjoy minimum system requirements in every app description on the market or Amazon appstore. I think it should be mandatory. I don't know if it's a RAM issue or what exactly the problem is but I'd be very interested to know the system requirements and more interested in an update that will let me play it.,
B000002ULO|4.0|Paul has had a brilliant music career with lots of wings, Beatles, solo, and live albums. This album is a pretty good album to listen to ,but seems to lack some energy. Its full of sentimental and somewhat mushy songs. Not that thats bad, but Paul could have thrown one or two really rockin songs in. I own many of Pauls albums and this is by far not his best work. I still recommend for any Paul fan or anyone in general. The biggest problem i had  with it is it seems to lack his usual high energy.

EXCELLENT PRICE! go out and shop around... i checked Target.. 50% cheaper thru AMAZON!!  thank you thank you!    noris kadum
B004WJV6OY|5.0|A few years ago Pearl Jam put out by far their best DVD with [[ASIN:B000UNYK76 Immagine in Cornice - Live In Italy]]. I like how this solo DVD is similar to that one in the way that it doesn't just film the concert itself. The film makers have put some effort into showing Eddie performing out in nature scences. It keeps things interesting.

B004G600A4|5.0|My whole family LOVES this movie.  That includes my princess-loving 4 year old and my all-boy 6 year old...and even my husband and I.  The story is great with plenty of action for boys and princessy fun for girls, the songs are great (we even bought the soundtrack), and it isn't too scary or upsetting for kids.  I get sick of \\"kids\\" movies that are scary or inappropriate and this one is neither (though there are some tense/loud moments...but nothing that was upsetting for my kids).  It's a GREAT movie...get it!
1582701709|2.0|The Secret is not a secret. It is a compilation of \\"wisdom\\" readily attainable elsewhere in numerous other books or my attending a liberal \\"positive thinking\\" Christian churches.   She simply has copied traditional \\"common sense\\" material and put it in a book - I call that cheating, but I guess it is an easy way to make money. Since none of the material is young enough to be copyrighted she gets away with it. However there are dozens of books basically saying the same thing. There is nothing different here except a nice looking cover and a decent presentation of the basic thoughts.  I suggest you find an indepth class elsewhere with a cohesive philosopy behind it.  If you are really curious because someone recommended it, buy it used so you won't be too disappointed. That is what I did and I am passing the book on to someone else who wants to be bored.
B002YOKVU4|2.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent.  I give it a 10.0 out of 10.  I did not see any grain at all.  Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, which was okay, not outstanding.  There just wasn't much sound out of the surrounds.<br /><br />This has to be one of the worst, and most boring movies I have ever seen.  I was just not into it, but finished watching it anyway.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Dave Kerpen is helping to bring the golden rule to social media.  He calls it being likeable, but we already know it as treating others as you would like to be treated: It's so simple but often so hard to execute in real life, let alone online.  Even with a limited budget, any brand, person, or idea can be shared with the right people - people who are eager to embrace positive messages and who want to like you back.  There are the plenty of stories, statistics, and case studies, but I was most impressed by Dave's clear, concise, and actionable steps.  This is a super-useful read for any brand looking to use Facebook to build better relationships with current and potential customers, employees, and the Facebook universe in general.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The plant vs zombie theme is decent, but the gameplay is 100 percent worth the download.  No complaints here from this review!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game is great fun. One of the best on the market however it has some big bugs. It has made my phone force close apps and even sometimes requires battery removal to restore phone to normal. The same thing happens on Chuzzle. Please fix.
030745455X|4.0|This whole crime/thriller thing usually isn't my bag so for me to say that I like...maybe even really like this series maybe means something?<br />Really a 3.5 star review for this, the 2nd in the late Stieg Larsson's saga, as it was a fun read but one that dragged early after leaving few real mysteries to be solved for the duration of the book. What carries The Girl Who Played With Fire however is the same that carries the entire Millennium series, strong well rounded lead characters with cardboard cutout stereotypes where needed (usually in the form of the police). Although not as gripping or page turning as the opening salvo in the trio, 'The Girl' offers a servicable bridge to the final chapter of the saga.<br />Perfect for a summery beach read.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I have 2 other cases for my iPhone 4 and both are the hard plastic variety with the same overall design.  Like those cases, this one has cut-outs in all the places it should have them.  Unlike them, however, the material of this case (TPU) is very flexible.  This is important because it's a tight fit.  The hard plastic varieties I've had have either stretched out too much and fall off or have had pieces actually break off the plastic.  Because it is so flexible, this case isn't going to fall apart or fall off the phone.  The edges are pronounced so they form a sort of bumper around the face of the screen so that the screen doesn't come into contact with flat surfaces.  It's a huge improvement over the hard case varieties of similar design.<br /><br />Amazon includes a very high quality clear screen protector and polishing cloth making this a great one-stop-purchase and a phenomenal vale as these screen protectors can be expensive all on their own. We have yet to be disappointed with any of the products we've tried from the AmazonBasics line.
1400095204|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. It's an engaging, heart-felt, eye-opening story about the Nigerian Civil War. The author sets up and weaves through all the characters very eloquently. I will read this again and again. Her other novel, Purple Hibiscus, is great as well.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love this DVD and CD because, besides being really good music, it shows how music can bring people of diverse cultures together in harmony.

With so much negativity in the world it's wonderful to see and hear something so positive.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|If you are a fan of The Shield, this is a must have.  It is one of the coolest series I have seen as far as the DVD packaging.  It looks and feels like a coffee table book and easily could be.  The show itself is one of a kind and sad that it ended. But all great things come to an end eventually!  You will not be sorry you bought this
0316098329|3.0|The premise is certainly very interesting but I didn't feel there was enough depth or insight.   Due in part to the author making the narrator a five year old.   His questions and outlook became predictable.   Very ambitious but lacked any real tension.     I felt the adults needed to be heard in their own right at times.   The little boys queries and observations were interesting at times but not enough to hold the whole story.     I was really looking forward to reading it but finished it quickly and without much satisfaction.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|awesome game.. I've wasted so many hours playing this game and i haven't done my homework because it's so addicting!
0553386794|5.0|I am not a rabid fantasy genre fan. I came by this book because of the HBO series and I am glad I did. I never Heard of George R.R. Martin before. I have heard people compare this series to tolkien's work and I agree it is as masterful but I find GRRM's writing much more interesting. I started reading this book on my Kindle blissfully unaware of how many actual pages there are in this novel, 858 by my kindles count. I am a fairly slow reader and I finished this book in a little over three weeks. I have never even read a non fiction work this long in my life. I could not put the book down. I became so enamoured with the characters that I didn't even notice how long it was. I found myself spending as much of my free time reading this as I could.<br /><br />I am astounded by the sheer complexity of the world GRRM has built and the characters within it. I thoroughly enjoy the way the narrative changes in each chapter. I am also watching the series on TV and it doesn't do the book justice. The book is so filled with vivid descriptions and internal thoughts of the characters that the series can only imply. I am already reading A Clash of Kings. I started yesterday only 12 hours after I finished Game of Thrones. Some people may not like the narrative switching but I think it adds depth and complexity to the characters and to the overall story. I will be buying and reading the entire series and when I am done with that I will be seeking out other books written by George R.R Martin.<br /><br />This is the first novel I have read in a long time that had such interesting characters. Like another review said the characters aren't the black and white, good and bad medieval characters of normal fantasy novels. They are like real people, a mix of all that is good and bad, intelligent and ignorant and sometimes all at the same time. The story itself is full of little twists and turns and things don't happen as expected in most circumstances yet for me the story is very enjoyable.
193413712X|3.0|Three stars because I found much of the writing to be beautifully crafted, lyrical and poetic. I thought the characters were interesting too, when I was able to ferret out information from the many, many words (mostly about nature) in which the characters were totally immersed.<br /><br />There was George, a former high school guidance counselor in Massachusetts who died in 1995. There was Howard, the father of George, who sold household items from a mule-driven wagon in sparsely settled Canada when he was a young man and worked as the produce of manager of A&P in North Philly during middle age. Howard died after 1953. And there was Howard's father who was a preacher.<br /><br />Both George and his grandfather suffered from dementia in their later years. Howard had \\"spells\\" that caused him to sit in water-logged fields or streams for hours on end and he also had epileptic seizures.<br /><br />After retirement, George tinkered with clocks, became an expert clock repairer and a hoarder of cash. (Was there ever a time within the past fifty years when two keys were not required to open a safety deposit box? If not, there is a glaring bit of inauthentic writing about George handing a bank teller $300 in cash and asking her to stash it his gray metal box in the back. Then again, maybe some very small banks actually conducted transactions this way. But I doubt it.)<br /><br />Before he absconded to Philadelphia, Howard tinkered with pots and pans and bits of metal. He once pulled the tooth of a hermit who paid him by leaving a signed first edition of The Scarlet Letter on his porch step. (To me, Howard was by far the strangest and most interesting character.)<br /><br />Howard's father tinkered with his sermons.<br /><br />The reader harvests information about the wives of these three men from the many words and gathers that they were all strong, capable, caring women who were able to field any challenges their husbands forged.<br /><br />Aside from the characters, there is a sense that time and generations of people will go on and on and on; as will the continuum of nature.<br /><br />Overall, I found this novel a real challenge to read and I could not wait to finish it. (A large portion of this novel reads like one long epileptic spell.) Would love to see the rubric that members of the Pulitzer Committee use to select first prize.and on and on; as will the continuum of nature.

B001PJRAUS|1.0|I read all the glowing reviews and looked forward to this DVD.  I was never so disappointed. The girl, Amanda, is dropped into the late 1700's in leggings & Black leather jacket with a modern hairdo, and no one notices. Her presence changes everything about the story.  Amanda doesn't even try to act like she belongs in that time.<br />I thought she would get everything back on track before she went back to her time, but no.<br />Spoiler Alert.<br />Wickham is a good guy!<br />Jane marries Mr. Collins!!!!!<br />Bingly runs off with Lydia!!!!<br />Elizabeth stays in the future!!!!<br />And Amanda stays with Darcy!!!!!!!<br />The only thing that is corrected is Jane and Mr. Collins never consumate the marriage so she gets out of it, and is able to marry Bingly (who didn't seduce Lydia).<br /><br />If you truly love Jane Austen, don't waste your time on this movie the story is terrible.
1592402038|3.0|I fell asleep five times while reading this book. No joke. It's not that the book is absolutely terrible or anything; it's just that the topic--punctuation--is a difficult one to make appealing, no matter how knowledgeable and/or humorous you are (unless you are June Casagrande--sorry, Ms. Truss).    Granted, the snarky comments that Truss throws in the direction of Americans and grammar-ignorant people in general are sometimes funny; however, they are, more often than not, grimace-inducing. But if you are a proud, self-proclaimed grammar snob, this book is absolutely for you! If you are not, but do have a sincere interest in bettering your grammar skills (and you've already read Grammar Snobs are Great Big Meanies), then this book will provide a lot of insight into correct usage. However, British style is different than American style, which may throw some readers off if they are not already aware.    The book also comes with a \\"Punctuation Repair Kit,\\" a few pages of punctuation stickers inserted after the front cover and before the back. Truss encourages people to use the stickers to insert correct punctuation on grammatically incorrect signs. She also tells her readers that they need to protest incorrect grammar in droves in order to start a revolution in grammar. And she's not kidding.    Last word of advice: Read this book if you are having trouble sleeping at night or wish for a great nap. It's better than prescription meds.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a good little backup sharpener that I carry in my back pack for emergencies. It sharpens straight or serrated but a good tone still does much better. Not sure if it can handle a thick blade like the Becker BK2. Overall it was worth the money to have a back up sharpener.

B004UIOUHC|4.0|I'm running on a [[ASIN:B004PGMFG2 Le Pan TC 970 9.7-Inch Multi-Touch LCD Google Android Tablet PC]] using Froyo (Android 2.2) and Adobe Flash 10.1. and had some problems accessing certain databases in our library with the original browser. Specifically, the Ebsco based databases didn't allow data input (which is a bad thing if you're using databases). Installing Opera Mobile Web Browser ver. 11.0 seems to have solved all of those problems.<br /><br />We also run a pretty basic flash application on our home page, with scrolling pictures and announcements, and it's working fine also, with one caveat: if you want to have a flash application run automatically you have to go into the browser's settings to enable automatic initiation of flash. If you don't, the default appears to be \\"click to play\\" which means you get a big triangle icon you have to touch to activate the flash application.<br /><br />One of the features I really like is that when you're touching links that are very close together on the screen, you automatically zoom in  to select from the two (now larger) options. Given that this is a tablet with a 9.7 inch screen, accessing non-mobile web sites is a lot easier, and this feature makes things even spiffier.<br /><br />Opera Mobile is definitely a step up from the default Android web browser under Froyo (Android 2.2). I give 3 stars for something that is acceptable (such as the default browser), but with the integration of flash (at least for me), the fact that I can search databases I couldn't use before, and the auto-zoom to disambiguate links, I bump it up another star. It would get 5 stars for me if it integrated viewing .pdf files in the browser, but it still allows me to download them and open them, just not inside a browser window.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Pros: -Art and design are beautiful.  -Gameplay is engrossing and strategy based. -Plenty of plants to use; tons of zombies to kill.   Cons: -Battery intensive. After a few hours of play WHILE PLUGGED IN, my battery was drained such that the phone turned off.  -Minor lag during loading and pause screens. Whenever the 15%, 10%, 5% batter notifications appeared, the game would momentarily freeze, pause itself, show me the message, unpause itself. Process takes about 30 seconds. Does not affect game progress.   My phone: HTC Evo 4G.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I usually don't like playing games on my Nexus S except for this one! I love it so much that I also downloaded on my Ipod! It's so freakin' addicting! I got it for free, but I would have paid $3 for it!

B00328G4Y8|5.0|`Axis Bold as Love' with its bright and distinctive Hindu cosmology-themed gatefold-cover art was the second album from the `Experience', recorded later the same year as their debut album `Are You Experienced?' in 1967. `Axis' is musically more polished than its immediate predecessor, full of new material written since the AYE sessions and has first class production values which still sound crisp and professional even 44 years later.<br /><br />The album opens with a mock-radio interview during which Jimi plays `Mr Paul Caruso', a man just arrived in a flying saucer, a comedic moment of sci-fi spacyness which sets the tone of the album in a manner absolutely fitting for 1967.<br /><br />So, what of the music on `Axis'? Here the focus is on songwriting and the mood gentler, more ambient and melodic than Hendrix's first creative outpouring captured on AYE, though some rocking numbers like `Spanish Castle Magic' and `Ain't no Telling' stand out. Many of the songs are short, coming in around the 2-minute mark and displaying an admirable discipline in contrast to the self-indulgent extended improvisations of many 1967 contemporaries. The most enduring numbers from `Axis' are probably the poignant and prolifically-covered `Little Wing' with its distinctive intro and beautifully restrained wailing guitar; and `If Six was Nine' with its rebellious be-true-to-yourself-and-don't-follow-the-crowd theme, used in the soundtrack of the famous Cannes-prize-winning 1969 film `Easy Rider' starring Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper (who also directed) and Jack Nicholson in early film roles.<br /><br />`Axis' is often regarded as Hendrix's most mellow and delightful album, with his impressive vocal range on display through some first-class material. Though best remembered as a composer, an electric guitar innovator and pioneer of new sounds in rock music, Hendrix was in fact a very good pitch-perfect melodic singer with vocal power, good range and excellent expressive phrasing. The raunchy guitar takes a background seat here, to emerge again in 1968's milestone `Electric Ladyland' album. On `Axis', with popular and commercial success finally in his grasp after years of struggle, Jimi seems to be really enjoying himself and, through these varied and high-quality numbers, his delightful humour and optimistic good nature shine through.<br /><br />If you're interested in Hendrix's musical legacy and in understanding how he helped shape the form of pop/rock music which endures even into the C21, then `Axis' is indispensable to your collection. There's a lot of Hendrix material out there in various packages and re-issues, but in addition to `Axis' the essential studio albums are the debut `Are You Experienced', the quintessential and important `Electric Ladyland' from 1968 and the posthumously released `First Rays of the New Rising Sun' showcasing to perfection his later material. There's plenty of live stage material released in various packages too; best of the bunch are probably `Concerts' and the admittedly uneven performance at the 1969 Woodstock festival containing the epic rendition of `Star Spangled Banner.' The `Blues' album is good, too.uitar takes a background seat here, to emerge again in 1968's milestone `Electric Ladyland' album.

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Males are often caught up in image when it comes to media consumption. They will only watch, or confess to watch, action movies, masculine TV shows and the like. This is dumb. There is a lot of entertainment to be had with movies and in this case, a TV show, that is marketed towards females.<br /><br />Pretty Little Liars is an intriguing, well-written show that blew my mind. I confess I have only watched the five free episodes available on Hulu (I watched them all back-to-back because I was so addicted), but am looking forward to the marathon on June 14th to get caught up. I don't understand how watching half-naked men man-handle each other with choreographed wrestling moves is manly, while watching strong, beautiful women dealing with complex issues is not. Men, just like women, are insecure about themselves. Don't be fooled by the stereotypically arrogant display of machismo you see from some guys. This is simply a demonstration of insecurity.<br /><br />For the potential heterosexual male watchers out there: Pretty Little Liars is a thrilling mystery with beautiful women in it. Unless you don't like thrillers, mysteries, or beautiful women, you will like this show; forgive my bluntness.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|When I first heard this album, I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Lady Gaga's others, but after listening to it for a while, it has really grown on me. Some of the songs are different and interesting, including Bloody Mary, Amen Fashion and Government Hooker. Some of the songs have horn in them, giving them a strange 70s sound that I didn't really like, but where Lady Gaga stayed true to her art, the songs are great. Lady Gaga is very inspirational and a lot of fun. I highly recommend the album (I paid full price for the CD).

B004RQVVGU|5.0|Although I don't enjoy Diary of a Madman as much as Blizzard of Ozz, this release would be worth buying just to get the restored original performances in all their remastered glory.

The second disc of live material includes favorites from Ozzy's first two solo albums, plus Sabbath hits \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Paranoid\\", and \\"Children of the Grave\\". Recommended!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|overall the great classic game is now on the android. The only thing that's bothering me are the load times, needing to reload after the screen is off, and graphics quality.<br /><br />The graphics are blurry on my nexus s. There needs to be an adjustment for higher quality screens.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Pop cap again proves they do not know how to adapt their games to work on different phones. Again a pop cap game does not run on the samsung intercept running 2.2. This is quite dissappointing because they are such a big development company and they should be capable of adapting their games for different devices. Many inde developers are capable of this feat it is a shame that pop cap cannot. Do not waste your time or money on a company that does not know what they are doing!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|It has a somewhat homebrew quality, but it gets all the gameplay details right, and it's very nostalgic. Feels like playing some unreleased PC-FX title, with high-res art. The music is great, and battles are fun. I really like it, basically.

He absolutely loves it! Such a little thing made him so happy, he was showing his cousin how it works with a steak knife. What he loves best about it is the key ring hole that lets him have a sharpener anywhere he goes. I definitely recommend this (especially as an additional gift) to any knife lover!

I heard about the way it was laggy but somewhat playable - Which I thought I could look past because it also has room for your control configurations, however, what they forget to tell  you about those configs.. is that it BARELY effects how badly it lags.     This product will NEVER be able to come even slightly close to the smooth, controllability that PC has. Period. What a waste of 50 bucks.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|Lady Gaga's second or third outing (depending on how you're counting) is very much a different outing than her first two releases, which seems to have caused no end of angst that this wasn't The Fame, Part III. Given how many middling songs I felt were used as filler on the Fame (virtually all the non-singles), this wasn't a bad move. Overall, she tries her hand at a wider array of genres and pulls most of them off fairly well. The diversity of musical styles left me scratching my head at a lot of the criticism that all the songs sounded the same on this album, which is almost impossible to believe. Songs like Bloody Mary and Hair sound the same? Really? I will say that nearly all of the songs were meant to be danced to and have club-style beats to match it. If you love long, slow, piano-driven songs, this album is not for you. She promised a very danceable album, and delivered. I love 80's-style songs too, sax solos and all. Sue me.    As much as I have enjoyed the singles released thus far, especially Judas, the high points for me involve (as yet) non-singles:    Marry the Night is a great album opener.  Scheiße is absolutely a hoot and is probably the funnest song on the album, especially as she's apparently convinced a not insignificant number of people that she can speak German, when the song itself tells you quite plainly that she can't.  Bloody Mary is brooding and excellent.  Heavy Metal Lover is a song I dismissed as uninteresting at first but grew on me immensely to the point it's almost my favorite - smooth and methodical with an excellent bridge.    The only song that truly faceplants on the album, I feel, is Yoü And I. No one has managed to get me to enjoy pop country ballads, and that includes Lady Gaga (Speechless made me similarly cringe). Americano also is a bit all over the map, but still is fun to listen to.    5 Stars, if only to counteract the complaints about Amazon's service, which don't belong here.
0783240236|5.0|It was the summer of 1963, I was 13 years old, and Alfred Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\" came to my home town. I went to see it the first night it opened. I have never forgotten the experience. It had me mezmorized. Yes, even back then, some of the special effects seemed fake. (Especially the scene where the birds are chasing the children down the road.) But other scenes such as the attack on the town after the gas station blows up are amazing, seeing as how all of the effects had to be done by hand. I still think that one of the most horrifying scenes in movie history is when Hedren is up in the attic being attacked. When you think that she actually had angry birds hurled at her for a week and was injured..........it isn't fake terror that you see on her face. Anyway, I am sure all of us have special films in our life that have had an impact. Why \\"The Birds\\"? Not sure. Maybe it is because the very next day, as I was walking down Main Street towards my parents restaurant, I was chased by a magpie for one block. A very scary magpie. At that moment, the movie became real. I still view it from time to time and like it just as much as I did back in 1963. It is truly a classic and I am glad of this.

B004RKXN44|5.0|The highly anticipated love story of Hawke and Sienna was truly beautiful.  I love Sienna's history, the mystery surrounding her unveils little by little resulting in her being a true heroine.  And Hawke, the man whose wolf is so close to the surface that his pelt matches his hair and his eyes are the same, both human and wolf...he's been a favorite of mine since the beginning of the series.  I'm so glad his book surpasses all expectations.    The secondary love story of Lara and Walker was an unexpected welcome.  And the birth of Lucas and Sascha's child was wonderful. And Kit's relationship with Sienna plays out awesomely.  Excellent read.  I'm looking forward to reading more of the Psy-Changeling conflict...and who will be the next love match?  p.s. LOVE Hawke's last name!!

B004SBQAN8|3.0|Baby boomers will \\"get\\" the reference in the title -- couldn't resist it. Ah, if only I Am Number One were even close to the original series, The Prisoner. Alas, it's not to be, but that's not to say that this film is a total loss if you're looking for a date movie or a Saturday afternoon popcorn-cruncher.<br /><br />In a blend of the displaced but hunky alien of Starman with the telekinetic oomph of the Witch Mountain movies on steroids and the prerequisite serious teenage heaviness of Twilight and certain Life with Archie comics, I Am Number Four strives to launch a series by setting up a teen magazine contender as a haunted yet stalwart hero searching for truth, justice and a lovely young lady. Sound derivative? If you saw Disturbia and Rear Window, the similarity cannot be denied, though Shia LeBeouf's performance often transcends the material in the earlier film helmed by the same director, D.J. Caruso.<br /><br />Alex Pettyfer will no doubt flutter many a teeny bopper's heart but he tends to speak in a brooding monotone without much facial expression. Understated would be a kind way to describe his performance. He was being directed, so we can't be sure if these were all his choices, since he seems so have more personality in the bloopers.<br /><br />Teresa Palmer plays the Lara Croft-type super catsuit lady -- a modern-day movie and TV action icon, by the way, that was really created in 1962 by Honor Blackman on TV's The Avengers and perfected by Diana Rigg, who replaced her on the same series in 1965. Dianna Agron is earnest as the object of Pettyfer's affection, but resembles Palmer to the point where you're not sure who's doing what until you sort out the characters (and hear Palmer's Aussie accent).<br /><br />Best aspects: Timothy Olyphant's standout performance, bringing depth to his character, excellent special effects and some really creepy, easy-to-loathe villains (whose sadistic cruelty makes this a little too strong for younger viewers).<br /><br />No commentary on the bonus features, but there is a set of bloopers and a short feature focusing on the lovely Ms. Palmer.t there is a set of bloopers and a short feature focusing on the lovely Ms. Palmer.

030745455X|3.0|Disappointed in the repetition of the story over and over.  Half of the book brings the reader up to date from the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />The second half held my interest more.  Too many characters, places in Sweden, difficult to follow story.<br /><br />Must say the ending sounds like a horror movie in the making.
0345522478|5.0|I loved this book.  Loved. It.  And while I realize that there are other urban fantasy books with male protagonists and using Celtic gods and mythology certainly isn't new to the genre, there's something about Hounded that struck me as refreshingly new.  Hounded was a wonderful mix of action, mythology, and humor with great characters throughout.  And I loved the Star Wars references.<br /><br />Hearne's world was well developed and very colorful.  All manner of gods, myths, and creatures walk the world.  There are vampires, werewolves, witches, trolls, elves, deities, and more.  I also love the fact that everyone thinks Thor is an \\"asshat\\".  It may seem random, but it's little things like that that give character to the world of the Iron Druid Chronicles.  There are good guys and bad guys and guys in between - all well written with believable motivations.<br /><br />The plot moves quickly but is not confusing.  Hearne tells the reader about Atticus' past and his world at a nice pace.  You aren't overwhelmed with information nor are you ready to strangle the author in order to get answers.  He also efficiently introduces and explains the different Celtic deities so I wasn't subjected to pages and pages of description and background for each character.  In fact I can't think of anything that tripped this story up.  It was a roller coaster ride of action and fun and I pre-ordered Hexed and Hammered as soon as I finished Hounded.

0345444051|4.0|Touted by some as Clarke's best novel, CHILDHOOD'S END is a stunning picture of first contact and the repercussions of what might happen if we were to meet an alien race. Clarke who is the embodiment of what a science fiction author should be created a tale that was so ridiculously real that it's underlying message will resonate through you. His thought process and the conveyance of his ideas are so precise, logical and scientific that you will believe that this is a truthful narrative instead of a work of fiction. There is no denying that Arthur C. Clarke is a genius and his works should be enjoyed by the masses. Yet, while I really do this book is a work of genius - the message that it delivers saddens me, so it is not my favorite from Clarke. I want to read science fiction and believe man can touch the stars...not have our ignorance shoved in my face.<br /><br />Above every major city a ship appears, Earth has made first contact. They are called the Overlords and in hours they rule our planet, able to outmaneuver any hostile or benign rebellion. Earth quietly acquiesces and accepts the Overlords rule - they are a lenient dictator, they only ask for a few things. Because of the Overlords Earth enters into a time of peace, a veritable Utopia. War, disease, famine, all gone, yet in it's wake the human race stagnates. Creativity is lost and there is an underlying fear that the Overlords have their own road map and are not sharing it with the human race.<br /><br />I do believe that while I enjoyed this work, this is probably my least favorite Clarke novel. An earlier piece, I think he learned a bit more mastery in later novels that were not implemented in this one. The novel did drone a bit and was more like a historical narrative than his other novels. You find no character interaction - but again this is typical in similar broad reaching scifi narrations. Don't take this the wrong way, I recommend this book for everyone but I might push you towards the RAMA series, which I believe is Clarke's best series work.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />Definitely partake if you are a fan of Clarke, also for fans of Henlien's and Asimov's work you should definitely try out Clarke.is Clarke's best series work.    Recommendations:  Definitely partake if you are a fan of Clarke, also for fans of Henlien's and Asimov's work you should definitely try out Clarke.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|It has been 10 days since I made my purchase.  AMAZON has still not allowed me to download the music.  There have now been 2 unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue with out success.  I have wasted far too much of my time for a 99 cent album.  Had I just gone to iTunes I would have it now, not be wasting my time writing this review, or wasted 30-45 minutes of my life trying to solve AMAZON TECHNICAL ISSUES.
0316098337|5.0|I avoided this book because I have a 5 year old and LOVED it because it made him so more clear to me.  The character Jack is my son in so many ways.  If my son could spend his life trapped in a room where it was just him and me playing crazy games together, he would be thrilled.  **SPOILER ALERT **I totally get that Room was Jack's heaven and his mom's hell. This book will not only stay with me for a long time, but helped me appreciate the bond I have with my son even more.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Angry birds can step down. I love this game. Could not put it down until I beat it. Highly, highly suggest it. Worked great on my droid x. Hope to see more from them.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was a little worried, the game seemed to take a long time to download & install. Once done, it was so worth the wait! I have the Samsung Captivate on AT&T & it works great! No freezing or issues. The game is fun, addicting & gets harder as levels go up. Basic goal is to keep zombies from getting to your house using a variety of plants that have different skills or powers. I am finding few negatives and so glad I decided to get this!
159420229X|4.0|This is an interesting look at everything to do with memory.  The author uses memory competitors to navigate his way through the science of memory and anecdotes about great and poor memories.  As he got involved with the study, he was persuaded to enter the U.S. national memory championship - an olympics of memory feats.      Mr. Foer includes insightful looks at memory past and present.  To the ancients, memorization was a sign of intellect and the methods used today by the world's memory competitors were developed a few thousand years ago and left for forgotten until recent times.  Balancing that history is how we are needing our memories less and less everyday with the growing use of memory aids.  For instance, how many phone numbers do we learn these days when we can just program them into our phones?  From the ancients memorizing thousands of lines of poetry, we now learn to program electronics to do the remembering for us.        This is not a how-to book and never pretends to be one.  The author does relate some of the methods that the memory champs use and some may be useful in life.  I have used one of the tricks to memorize lists and another to help with names.  But that is not the purpose of this book.  The purpose is to explore memory, what it is and how it is used.    This book is highly recommended.  Were it about 40 pages shorter it would ahve earned five stars.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|This book is unexpectedly brilliant. It took me through a roller coaster ride of emotions, one that keeps you lightheaded and dizzy, in an exhilarating way, long after you put down the book.<br /><br />The story kicked off on a gut-wrenching start when Zoe Baxter lost her baby boy, conceived by in vitro, at 28 weeks. From then on, everything just started to fall apart, including her marriage of nine years, until she met Vanessa. The couple got married (not in Rhode Island, where they lived, as same sex marriage is not recognized there), while Zoe's alcoholic ex husband Max reforms and embraces a new faith, and everything seemed to be going well for both, until both decided to battle out in court to obtain custody rights over three frozen embryos that are still in a safekeeping the fertility clinic. Zoe wants her last chance at a biological child, that is to be carried by Vanessa, whereas Max does not want his child to be raised by a lesbian couple and instead chooses to give the embryos to his brother Reid and his wife Liddy, who are longtime members of his new church. This when things started to take an ugly turn and all skeletons came out of the closet.<br /><br />This book just overwhelms you with all sorts of emotions. The writing is unpretentious and flows with ease. The story can be a little corny in some parts, but as a whole the twists and turn the plot took shows that Picoult is a gutsy writer that tackles controversial subjects head on. I liked that the story was told from multiple point of views, that gave great insight into the characters and helped me as a reader to understand the different shades of grey in the story. I also loved the fact that, in the end, as a reader, I wasn't led to choose my side in the debate, instead I was given the space to understand and felt empathy for either side. Highly recommended.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I didn't think I would like this book just reading the back; however, it was picked by my book club so I read it.  After reading it I was recommending it to everyone I knew.  What a sad yet awsome book!  There are parts of this book that I would question as a parent, but it also was a book that really made you think about things in your own life and descisions you would make.  Definatley worth reading!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This is a very nice combination of the modern style and the old school blues style. 'Something's got a hold on me' and 'Guy what takes his time' are especially this type of mix. Beautiful voice, as usual! :D
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Good show, it was canceled while the #1 show on Space channel in Canada(take that syfy - see what happens when you don't $#^$% around with a shows time slot?).    If MGM is making the profit from the dvd buy it, if Syfy is making a penny from it, DON'T buy it.
B004D9FLJE|1.0|A number of things bothered me about this series.  First is the unbearably weak writing and stereotypical characters.   Nothing here can be believed.  We see, in the first episode,  the initial group assemble and manage to perform a totally professional sounding number.  I know from personal experience the difficulty and time involved for a group of people to even begin to sing acceptably in harmony.  Of course they are all dancing while they are singing.  But that's no problem because the singing was obviously prerecorded and lip-synced by the cast (poorly) at the time of filming.  My guess is that the actors used in the story do not actually do the singing.  The musical numbers themselves are of generally trashy material.      Most of the characterizations and situations have no relation whatever to reality.  The actor playing the gay male is speaking in a vocal register an octave above the normal range for a boy his age and he camps his character unbearably.  And he is supposed to be still in the closet!  Until, that is, he confides to another member in the glee club: \\"I\\"m gay.\\"  My reaction was, \\"No kidding!\\"  He was using everything short of neon signs to advertise it.  The scene at the football game of the home team dancing like a chorus line was simply embarrassing.  Subtlety is, apparently, not the long suit of this series.        I had thought that the program was going to more or less genuinely portray the attempts of high school students overcoming their difficulties and gradually form an unusually capable choral group.  No such luck.  And I had hoped that at least some of the musical numbers would have been actually sung before the cameras.  Not a chance.  As is typical for a commercial television program dealing with music as its subject, the music ends up being of secondary importance.  It also irritated me that in a program produced  by Twentieth Century-Fox Television, the Fox name would have been stated twice in the dialogue of the first episode.I gave up after the fourth episode of the first season.  To use the words of the critic, John Simon: \\"When you have tasted the first spoonful of rotten soup, it's a pretty safe bet that the rest of the soup will be just as rotten.\\"
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I fell in love witht he first book but this was a great end to the story.  I feel like Adam may have been in a dark place but was well written and leaves you feeling all the emotions he is going through and gives you a sense of why and how he ended up where he is at in this book.  The book a great ending and didn't leave you wondering about anyting.  Loved it!
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|The series is a major departure from that of the other two series, SG1 and Atlantis. It has its own charm and style and does a good job of storytelling. I enjoyed the series, even though I'll admit at first I hated it because it wasn't more of the same Stargate story telling. That's the beauty of SGU; it's different.<br /><br />Well, just a few things about the show disturbed me, like lesbians making out and what not (how does that have anything to do with the Stargate!)... but anyway, where was I? Oh yes, the show is great once you get into it and season two is by far and away better than season one simply because the writers pick up the pace. Season one was rather slow (but still enjoyable - that ship is amazingly awesome!). Season two however takes us to many new places and starts to cover a lot of ground. In fact, they even start to unlock the mysteries of the ship and actually use the Stargate more. We find our characters facing much more and we finally begin to fall in love with them.<br /><br />Just when everything is good and you start to count down the days to when the next show airs, SyFy comes a long and kills it. To be honest, I believe that's really because the show doesn't follow SyFy's slogan, \\"Imagine Greater\\". You see, SyFy can only imagine greater numbers and ratings... for shows like wrestling and anything NOT Sci-Fi (ghost hunting... seriously.. uggg?) related. This review is more about my rant with SyFy than one about SGU. SGU is great and I highly recommend it. SyFy, on the other hand, is terrible. I actually stopped watching the SyFy channel after they canceled SGU as I've lost all hope in SyFy.<br /><br />Please, buy this DVD and enjoy and if we're lucky, MGM might throw us a bone and finish the series with a movie or mini-series. Do your part and stop watching the SyFy channel. If only the Science Channel or someone else would pick up the rights then all of this would be over. WE MISS STARGATE!
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|We have an IPOD2CAR unit in our car and wanted an easy way to switch it over to a 3.5mm headphone jack for use on our smartphones and MP3 player.  This cable worked perfectly for that!    (Note, this didn't work on an older Alpine head unit (CDE-9852) that had an IPod cable but this didn't affect my rating since it wasn't mine so it didn't matter to me)

B000UJ48O0|5.0|I'll start out by saying that having lived in Orange County, CA for about 8 years, the show isn't \\"true\\" to the area - heck, the show wasn't even filmed in OC but rather Manhattan Beach which is near LA..  Having said this, I still LOVED this show.  While the first few episodes left a lot to be desired, if you can get past these, you will come to find a show with incredible character development, wonderful acting, terrific story arcs and more...  I wish it was more than 4 seasons, but with all that was in the show, it felt to be more.      I watch many TV shows in their entire, and this is one of my favorites.,,
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I'm not sure how a company can sell 5 batteries for the same price I've been paying for 1, but I took a chance and ordered them. SUCH A DEAL!  I've used 2 batteries and they work perfectly.  FYI, I don't see any expiration date on the packaging, which could be a problem down the road, but the price, VERY quick shipping and no tax, how could you go wrong???  I'm ordering from them again and again.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|This modern day venture into the well trodden 'zombie' genre is worth a go, it does play lip service to the usual suspects of 21st century societal concerns; race, science vs faith, notions of self and community values but they very much play second fiddle to the more visceral shocks on offer. The prosthetics are outstanding looking convincing enough to make one queasy. On the whole though the balance is well handled, it is after all a prime time thriller and it does deliver.<br /><br />The CGI post FX are reasonable,  cinematography is polished and they managed to wring plenty of production design value from clever location choices. The acting is creditable and all the cast turn in solid screen performances. Stand out's are from Andrew Lincoln (Stetson's off for nailing the accent), Laurie Holden,  Jeffrey DeMunn and Steve Yeun,  also Andrew Rothenberg 'Jim' and Norman Reedus 'Daryl\\" deserve honourable mentions.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I have read all the books in the series and have loved Kurt Wallander throughout.  This book is true to his nature.  I won't talk about how it ends other than to say it is fitting.  There is a part late in the book where Wallander wonders, as he writes his notes about the case, whether he is writing the story of the participants in the events of the crimes - or his own story.  The mirror extends further and one wonders if this is Mr. Mankell's story - at least in terms of how Wallander deals with life.  The procedures and suspense are outstanding as always and the moody introspection goes all the previous books one better.  If you are a fan and you can get your head around the lack of neat and tidy Hollywood endings, you will love this book.  (And yes, I love Lisbeth too.)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Freezes my evo 4g when I try to play, can only fix it with a battery pull. Very annoying. Needs to be fixed.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could give this game a low score.  I've played alot of Android games and this is in a different league.  I've never played it before, so can't compare it to other versions.  It's a lot of fun and quite deep.    Who cares that you have to use wifi. It installs right to the sd card and only takes up 720kb on the phone itself.     I got it for free during amazon's free app of the day (thanks!!) but would have gladly paid for it.
B004RKC4PI|1.0|AEROSMITH-TOUGH LOVE/BEST OF THE BALLADS:<br /><br />Just shoot me now. As YARDBIRDS/STONES purveyors of lean, mean RNB-laced hard rock, AEROSMITH unleashed a fine 'n funky series of albums in the 70s that stood hair and shoulders above most of the competition. They birthed the \\"power ballad\\" boom in 1973 with the sublime classic DREAM ON, which unfortunately became the band's schlock-in-trade during their streamlined second coming. Song-doctored hits ANGEL, AMAZING, and CRYIN' were annoyingly indistinguishable slabs of sacharrine slop, boosted by endless ALICIA SILVERSTONE videos on \\"EMPTY-V\\". Non-ballads LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR and RAG DOLL, while a step down from blooze-vibe oldies SAME OLD SONG & DANCE and LAST CHILD, inexplicably appear here, perhaps to break up the snoozer pace. Lest you doubt the term \\"cash-in\\", consider that AEROSMITH has vomited forth at least half a dozen compilations in the past decade, but no new music. Maybe it's just as well...they'll never come up with another DREAM ON, no matter how hard they try.<br /><br />RATING: ONE HANKY
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Many others have already provided outstanding, highly detailed reviews of the Beatles' \\"Love\\" CD, with most generally regarding it as being very good to excellent.  And, I can wholeheartedly agree.  Listeners should remember these tracks were selected and remixed in support of Cirque Du Soleil's outstanding production.  It is, in effect, a soundtrack -- and not merely intended to be a compilation of great songs or remixes of them.  The sound quality is unsurpassed.  The remixes and blended tracks range from the very good to simply outstanding recording production and engineering.   You may hear, for the first time, instruments that previously escaped you.  You will be struck by the beauty of the Beatles' vocals, especially George Harrison's work (in my opinion).  I recently saw the \\"Love\\" performance in Las Vegas, which undoubtedly enhanced my appreciation for this CD and caused me to purchase it.  (I commend the show for your viewing and listening pleasure.  The sound system was nothing short of incredible.)  But, whether you have seen the show or not, please place this CD in the tray, crank the volume up, and enjoy this music as the sound track from the show and, for many, a sound track overview of your lives.
B00314VYNE|2.0|MY GRANDAUGHTER IS SIX YEARS OLD.  SHE WANTED A JESSE DOLL FOR A VERY LONG TIME.  WE LOOKED AT THE JESSE DOLLS TOGETHER ON LINE AND I PROMISED HER THAT I WOULD ORDER IT.  SHE ANXIOUSLY AWAITED JESSE'S ARRIVAL.  THIS JESSE DOLL WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I WAS REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER PURCHASES MADE AT AMAZON.  WE DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS AS SMALL AS IT WAS.  ALSO THE HEAD IS WOBBLY AND HER HAT WILL NOT STAY ON AT ALL.  I WAS NOT THRILLED WITH HER HAIR EITHER.  MY GRANDAUGHTER WAS TOO POLITE TO SAY SHE DID NOT LIKE THE DOLL BUT SHE DID ASK IF MAYBE WE COULD GET A \\"BETTER ONE\\"  SHE NEVER BRINGS IT WITH HER WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT. I FELT THAT MY MONEY WAS WASTED ON THIS DOLL.  WILL BUY AT STORE NEXT TIME SO I CAN REALLY SEE WHAT I AM GETTING.

074322454X|4.0|With all that has been written about Band of Brothers, it seems difficult to add anything new. Nonetheless, I offer a short review.    While over 16 million Americans served in the military during World War II, a much-smaller number filled front-line positions. Easy Company - an all-volunteer unit - was in the heart of battle from D-Day through the Battle of the Bulge and on to V-E Day. Ambrose tells the story of these men.    Two things set Band of Brothers apart from other accounts of WWII: first, Ambrose's skill as a storyteller brings the story to life. Second, Ambrose tells not just the story of which side won each battle, he tells the individual stories of many of Easy Company's men; the reader cares about these men and cheers for them to succeed. Also, the end of the book (one of my favorite sections) tells what became of the men after WWII.    One thing that I like about the book is that Ambrose does not glorify warfare. While he  respects the men, his descriptions of combat - and its costs - are both realistic and graphic. Ambrose conveys the insanity of war. Also, Ambrose mentions that almost all of the men in Easy stole items from the German civilians; I felt a little disappointed in this behavior, but Ambrose tells the true story - warts and all.    In short, Band of Brothers deserves all of its accolades. Find a copy and read it.
0345529057|5.0|One can argue with the overall physical quality of the paperbacks but cannot argue with the content. \\"A song of Ice and Fire\\" is, in my opinion, the best-written epic fantasy series of (so far) the past two decades, having overtaken \\"Wheel of Time\\" in my estimation.  I bought these as gifts, and have been very pleased with the response.
B004LWZW42|5.0|The X-Men films are kind of a huge letdown as a whole, aren't they? The first two are pretty good, but everything good they had going for them was completely destroyed once The Last Stand came to fruition. Thank you, Brett Ratner. And X-Men Origins: Wolverine just drove the franchise even further into the ground; kudos, Gavin Hood. So there probably isn't any reason to get excited over a new X-Men film even if it is a prequel to the X-Men films people actually enjoy. Why would we want to see another comic book movie with limitless potential only to drop the ball yet again? Not only does X-Men: First Class take that ball and run with it but it uses it in all the right ways and reminds you why you loved the X-Men in the first place.<br /><br />The cast is way better than it has any right to be. Everyone fits their character incredibly well and works fantastically as a cohesive unit. Kevin Bacon seems like a bit of an odd choice for Sebastian Shaw at first, but any doubt you may have is washed away once you finally see him absorb energy. His role as the main villain may be significantly smaller than you may imagine, but his more than qualified acting chops make nearly every scene he's a part of memorable (nothing really tops his first scene with young Magneto though). James McAvoy does an excellent job handling Charles Xavier. He's gentle, kind, and really seems to care about helping his fellow mutants. Michael Fassbender as Magneto manages to have the strongest on-screen presence. He's intense, powerful, and emotional; the best-rounded character of the film.<br /><br />It was gratifying to see McAvoy and Fassbender make the roles of Professor X and Magneto their own without completely rehashing what Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan established the first time around. That is often a problem when it comes to prequels; these younger actors wind up focusing on mimicking the older version of who they're meant to portray without putting their own spin on it. Luckily, that wasn't an issue here.<br /><br />No expense was made when it comes to the special effects either; Azazel is a perfect example. By the end of the film, you still won't know anything about the character other than the fact that he can teleport like Nightcrawler and is a master swordsman. His teleporting ability is just as fun to watch as Nightcrawler's was in X2 and his fight sequences (especially the one with a particular blue mutant) are always quite engaging. Most of Magneto's scenes involve some pretty hefty CG and it's pulled off rather well. The metal fillings scene is a personal favorite along with the Argentina bar scene (pay particular attention to the slow building yet unnerving music used during that scene along with the weapon used at the table). Then there's the obvious scene of Magneto reversing the missles that's being shown in nearly every advertisement these days. Beast is probably a high point of the special effects. Nicholas Hoult portrays Hank McCoy rather flawlessly (other than one scene that I won't spoil); brainy, shy, not sure of himself, and ashamed of his mutation. Beast's transformation is one of the best scenes in the film though. It gave me flashes of An American Werewolf in London. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of him as Beast because the one good long scene we see of him is really impressive.<br /><br />One of the things that make X-Men: First Class so good is that we get to see how these characters grow into the superheroes and super villains that we know and love today. And again, while the film loosely follows the comics it still manages to blossom and mature into something exceptional on its own while also planting the appropriate seeds to line up with the Bryan Singer X-Men films.<br /><br />So by now you have an idea of how good the film is, but is there anything bad about it? Some characters feel really underdeveloped; Riptide, Darwin, and Angel come to mind, but the biggest disappointment is Havok. There are no connections that he's actually the brother of Cyclops and many will be upset about that. Plus his character doesn't really feel very useful in comparison to both Beast and Banshee who at least put their powers to good use on several occasions throughout the film. Other than a few minor gripes about certain characters, which could surely be rectified in future installments; there really isn't much to complain about with X-Men: First Class.<br /><br />Do not let other 20th Century Fox comic book related films put you off, X-Men: First Class deserves to be held in the highest regard right next to Marvel's best. The cast is practically overflowing with talent, the storyline is both sharp and absorbing, the special effects are probably the best they've ever been in any X-Men film, and the appropriate connections are made to the best parts of the original films. X-Men: First Class should be the standard for all X-Men films from here on out. It's intelligent, engrossing, and spectacular. It's easily the best X-Men film yet.ops and many will be upset about that.

0425242099|5.0|Well, I hope no reader of this story found this book lacking. I had been so dissappointed in the last few years of the Head Alphas stories...Starting with Sherrilyn Kenyons Acheron  and last with Lora Leigh and Jonas Wyatt..<br /><br />This author nailed this book with first a wonderful story line and one of the most sensual/ breath taking wolf / mans seduction of Sienna....The council story had you on edge worrying about the Packs the Tks and the X's<br /><br />The author wove into this story information of the other family of the pack, and we saw many of our happily mated pairs. We had another story of  their healer Lara and her own happy ending with Walker a member of Siennas family.We  shared in the moment that a beautiful baby girl was born.<br /><br />But from the moment I opened the book, woven through Page one thru Page 400 was the heat of Sienna and Hawke. It was one of the most formidable undertakings that this Alpha male and his wolf could be so gentle with this young girl yet a virgin and just 'know' how to wait, have patience, and let her find her way.<br /><br />I will not talk much more about story as by now those who came before me will have discussed this. I just want you to know that I find this author to be special, her words more, and I am always reluctant for the story to end: I always want more and isn't that what an author wants to hear....

B002N5N5M0|3.0|Dexter is right up there at the top with any series in my opinion.  But the DVDs are a disappointment.  I've ordered two seasons, including this one, and there is no option for captions, always a convenience.  In addition, there are no extras.  Well, that isn't completely true.  There are preview episodes of other Showtime series--but that's pretty much it!  And I find that a little frustrating.  The point was driven home to me when I received \\"The Good Wife.\\"  In that there were included numerous interviews, commentaries, as well as deleted scenes--with commentaries about them!  Personally, I think that Dexter is on a par as a quality show--but the DVDs don't measure up!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|First of all if you have found this item then you might as well buy this product. The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus 120mm Sleeve CPU Cooler is worth every penny and not overpriced like other air coolers that really doesn't \\"cool\\" as well. With that being said the Hyper 212 Plus ranks higher than most air coolers. Installation is easy, but I admit that my little clamp broke on me, but I eventually fixed it.<br /><br />I kinda dropped it so that was all my doing. If you are using stock and don't plan on overclocking this you probably won't need this. If you plan on doing some overclock then I would suggest buying this product. Make sure your case is large enough for the Hyper 212+. This thing looks like a radiator! It's huge and universal, however it gets the job done. If you have a good case setup then this bad boy will keep your CPU cool. The part is that you have the option to put any 180mm fans on the Hyper 212+ and you can put 2 fans on it for a push/pull set up. Also it's flexible so you can actually turn turn it anyway you want. For an example: Some people like there CPU heat to blow upwards towards the Power supply.

If you are using this on a stock CPU then you can definitely count on your CPU to stay cool and run just as fast since heat won't be a option while using this great product. I'm actually thinking about buying other CPU cooling products to compare to the hyper 212+.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-IT WORKS! keeps the CPU cool<br />-The price!<br />-It's universal for AMD + Intel CPUs<br />-It comes with a 180mm fan, but you can replace the fan if you choose or add a extra fan<br />-Comes with thermal paste [However I use Arctic Silver 5]<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Instructions/Installation guide could be a lot better out of the box<br />-Might be to \\"large\\" for some cases.<br />-Takes a lot of strength to remove the screws and add screw through the fan-to-heatsink plastic attachment. Don't be shy to add some strength, but do not crack the plastic fat-to-heatsink plastic attachment<br /><br />Well I can't think of anything else negative about this product. If you are going with air cooling for overclocking then this will definitely be your best pick. Good luck shopping!<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I will be comparing this product to the Antec Kuler 620 using Arctic Silver 5 and using IC Diamond so check back soon for a link to the update.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've played plenty of tower defense type games in the past but this one really shines from the rest. It is very original compared to the generic tower defense games out there that are all similar to each other one way or another. Plants vs. Zombies just doesn't compare to anything else I've played. Taking advantage of the free WiFi download was such an awesome opportunity. I really recommend this game to any kind of gamers out there, casual to hardcore. It will really test your tower defense skills and make you laugh at some of the different kinds of zombies there are. There is a lot of variety in the towers you can build as well, and the levels change to a different location as you progress farther along.    I currently use PrizeRebel to get games that I want when I can't afford them. It's really reliable and takes little to no effort on your part. They have games from all different consoles and game cards for online games if you are interested in them. Can't wait to get my next online game card! Here is a link for those who are interested:    [...]
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend I was a little concern that the DVD's would not work even though the seller stated it was never opend.My friend said she loved it and she OD on watching them. I really like the price because in the store this same set was $193 and got it a bargin on Amazon!
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|I've read the Jules Verne classic book and watched the 1959 movie version as well as the lamentable 2008 made for TV version and it occurred to me that the best movie interpretation would be one that doesn't take itself seriously. The Jules Verne book really is quite silly and totally unbelievable and it hardly seems possible to make a movie interpretation that is both true to the book and serious. It was with this in mind that I had hopes for the Brendan Frasier version, not HIGH hopes but hopes. The film starts off well enough with Brendan playing a school teacher whose brother Max was lost 10 years ago while searching for the center of the Earth following Jules Verne's novel (a bit of meta fiction). I won't go into the details but Frasier and Max's 13 year old son end up traveling to Iceland to find Max in the legendary Mt. Sneffels with the help of a beautiful Icelandic guide.<br /><br />I was totally expecting brainless silliness and man did this film deliver. Rather than have our heroes hike for weeks or months into the Earth it's all one big Alice in Wonderland type drop that deposits them I guess hundreds of miles into the Earth. I won't spoil how they survive such an absurd fall. The movie is all one big roller coaster ride that occasionally descends into a LITERAL roller coaster. It really reminded me of one of those 80's summer blockbusters where you buy a big box of popcorn and power down your brain. There's no tension because the characters are all as indestructible as Wile-e Coyote and the whole world seems designed to keep them safe from harm with walls of rock that can be smashed through for easy escape. It's sort of like an MGM back lot adventure show with about as much depth and dignity. This is not to say that it's not enjoyable but it's basically a cartoon with human actors.<br /><br />What I didn't expect from this film was the terrible special effects (I did not watch this in 3D). The CGI dinosaurs were better in Jurassic Park back in 1993 and the blue screening is so bad you never feel like the actors are anywhere but a sound stage. Many of the action scenes looked like bad video game graphics and REALLY pulled me out of the film. The films 60 million dollar budget is modest by today's standards but it isn't THAT modest. Tron: Legacy had a 170 million dollar budget and you see every penny of it and the CGI world is totally believable. Here it's just laughable. This is DEFINETELY my biggest issue with the film.<br /><br />The pacing of the story here is a complete departure from the book which was an underground journey of many months. I would estimate that in this film the group was underground for MAYBE a couple of days. You never see them eat or sleep or for that matter show any exhaustion. Despite the fact that Max had gone lost a decade earlier it's only NOW that the heat starts to spike in a lame attempt to increase tension. The temperature rises well above 110 degrees F but you never see anyone show fatigue or sweat. After some adventures with prehistoric piranha's, man eating plants and a T-Rex the group shoots out of the Earth just as swiftly as they descended, out the top of a volcano (sadly that bit of silliness actually is true to the book).<br /><br />This film is really dumb. Max's son gets a phone call on his cell phone from deep within the Earth despite cell phone's propensity to lose connection even in an elevator or stairwell. Brendan Frasier punches out a plant and they discover what appears to be a hyper intelligent bird who helps guide the group to safety. I wouldn't say that I completely wasted 93 minutes of my life but I probably wouldn't bother watching this film again if for nothing else than the special effects are so bad. The film is far better than the 2008 TV version that leached off this one but the best is still probably the 1959 version.the blue screening is so bad you never feel like the actors are anywhere but a sound stage.

1597801585|4.0|Sometimes a novel comes along that lives up to all the hype, one that astounds the reader with its freshness of vision and execution. Paolo Bacigalupi's Nebula- and Hugo-winning The Windup Girl is just such a novel. Set in a world where oil production has bottomed out and global warming has swept away coastal metropolises with rising sea levels, once-grand nations have contracted into provincial powers. Most have replaced fossil fuels with kinetic power, storing joules in specialized kink springs wound by specially engineered elephantine precursors called megadonts. But few countries can easily replace another equally scarce resource -- food. Agricultural monopolies bolster the marketing of their sterile crops by releasing blights tailored to kill natural growths and any who eat them. However, mutations to these designer diseases have put even the so-called calorie companies on the defensive, and their operatives scour the globe for any genetic material that can help put their herbicidal Pandora back in its box. Thailand has resisted the conglomerates at every step, which is why AgriGen's Anderson Lake is in the drowned city of Bangkok, posing as a factory operator. His right-hand man, Hock Seng, has a more mundane goal, namely to build a new life for himself after Malaysian jihadists murdered his family. Meanwhile, Environment Ministry enforcer Jaidee Rojjanasukchai seeks to keep Thai soil free of calorie company crops, as well as the genetically engineered servants known as wind ups. This terrifies one such wind up named Emiko who was abandoned by her master and now survives by selling her body in a brothel. Unbeknownst to this divergent group, circumstances are conspiring to bring them together in a violent confrontation that will rock Bangkok to its very foundations.    If William Gibson and Timothy Hallinan decided to collaborate, The Windup Girl might be the result -- and that's intended as high praise. Bacigalupi keeps his characters well-rounded and ethically conflicted, his plotting always unexpected and never forced, his setting ... Well, as you can probably tell from that overlong intro, the setting is a thing of pure beauty, jaw-droppingly complex and well-realized. I could pile on superlatives, but suffice it to say that while reading one almost feels the jungle heat, smells the salt spray of a rising ocean kept at bay only by ingenuity and good fortune, sees the saffron-robed Buddhist monks and the white-shirted Environment Ministry police threading through rickshaw-choked streets. Windup is the sort of book that can twist you into knots with sheer admiration and envy.    And yet ...    Typical, I avoid critiquing a novel's thematic content. After all, that's really more of a reader's job than a reviewer's. But a pair of controversial topics so thoroughly inform Windup's action that they deserve mention. The first is Bacigalupi's advocacy of economic isolationism, the populist notion that nations only survive when cut off front international trade. One bureaucrat tells Anderson that specializing to make use of its comparative advantages nearly brought Thailand to the brink of ruin, a notion that would raise eyebrows on most economists. Ditto for the concepts of economic assassins and coup-instigating corporations with their own standing armies. However, the novel's second big idea, that of genetic determinism, proves more problematic. Not only does Emiko suffer all sorts of degradations (some of which recall the awful ending of Requiem for a Dream), but Bacigalupi also implies that she submits to them somewhat willingly and that because of the content of her genome. A rogue scientist implies she owes her sexual subservience to having her helix spliced with that of Labrador retriever. Such a biological obliteration of free will surely goes too far and certainly ignores recent research into how quantum entanglement fits with the mind-brain dichotomy. The Windup Girl is an amazing read, one that every fan of speculative fiction should pick up, but it ultimate proves just as frustrating as it is fascinating.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|In spite of having mediumish quality graphics this game is very fun to play. It's a full-fledged game, not some halfassed thing like some others.<br /><br />Sadly I had to uninstall it. It randomly locked up on me which makes it very hard to play and very frustrating.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />I gave it another try, same things happened except now it's starting to lock the whole device instead of just hanging itself. I understand it's more difficult to develop for multiple devices but I really expected more from this app. They could have tested on more devices and the problems would have become readily apparent.<br /><br />Downgraded to one star because it's virtually unplayable in its current state, if it gets fixed I'll happily change that.<br /><br />Another edit: Well it's been quite some time and NO update from PopCap, NO word on if they're going to fix this quick-and-dirty port from iOS that they're calling 1.0, absolutely nothing. If I hadn't got this during the promo I'd be thoroughly pissed off right about now. From my understanding their other ported games suffer similar problems too and they just don't care. Well PopCap, unless you come out with an update to address the problems people have had since day one then you're just showing your colors and I will never EVER purchase one of your games and I will direct everyone I know to do the same. I recommend everyone reading this review do the same.<br /><br />That this game has 4 stars is a joke.<br /><br />edit: Their latest update seems to have identified where the hang was happening and includes a bypass of it, which shows as a visible video glitch. Better than the game locking up but still pretty poor quality programming. Band-aids aren't what's needed here, PopCap, good design is.
0756405890|4.0|FOUR-AND-A-HALF STARS    I consider finishing a book a point of honor. Even if a volume is packed with peccadillos, something delightful may lurk in an unexpected corner. But I must confess to a less that spotless record when it comes to a particular sort of book -- really long ones. An abortive attempt at The Lord of the Rings in middle school made me to set aside Tolkien's opus for a decade. One weekend in my early twenties saw me through half of The Eye of the World before realizing I lacked the stamina to slog through Robert Jordan's never-ending series (a decision that I don't regret, considering that it has outlived its creator). Weighty tomes need a light touch, one that keeps the narrative coherent across a vast compositional expanse and audiences entertained in the reading of it. A challenging task, but it's one that Patrick Rothfuss achieves with ease in The Name of the Wind, the first installment in his The Kingkiller Chronicle.    \\"No, listen to me, that man behind the bar is Kvothe. Yes, the Kvothe. No, I'm not kidding. Yes, Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe who called lightning down upon his enemies when he was just a child, Kvothe Kingkiller. How do I know? Well, look at that hair! Red as a flame, and there's something in his eyes behind the laughter and the courteousness. Chills me right to my marrow, almost as much as those children singing about the Chandrian. How did marauders that appear in a flash of blue fire and cause everything to crumble at their arrival become a song for youngsters? Maybe Kvothe would know. Hey, remember that story of how he smote the fire demon with a great circle of iron? What, you still don't think it's him, don't know why the legendary Kvothe would own some inn in the middle of nowhere? Then why don't we just go ask him ...\\"    How do you make a big book small? The same way television writers break an overarching story into weekly chunks: You turn it into episodes. That's exactly the technique Rothfuss employs in The Name ofthe Wind, and he does so with one of the most elegant framing devices I've ever seen. The novel opens with the legendary Kvothe (about whom we know squat at the outset) hiding in the hinterlands from his enemies, isolated and miserable. Then a man called Chronicler finds him and compels him to tell his story. The action alternates between first-person remembrances and third-person intimations of a gathering storm on the world's horizon. And what action it is. We learn about an invasion of spidery horrors with razored limbs; legends of a deity who was burnt alive to save humanity; a magic system that shares quite a bit in common with modern physics; fae races that seem to dwell in a different dimension; a broad smattering of languages and cultures; numerous stage plays performed a band of thespians; and the Chandrian themselves, a group simultaneously so fearful and unknown they've become a tale with which to terrify youngsters. It would all be bewildering if Rothfuss dumped it on you from the get go. Thankfully he parcels everything out in easily digestible chunks. This is an entertaining epic that one can read in fifteen minute snippets. The only downside is a seeming disconnect between the protangist's actions and his maturity level. (Kvothe is supposed to be twelve at the narrative's onset and fifteen for much of its duration, although he rarely acts younger than an exceedingly competent twenty-five.) A minor flaw. No matter how busy you are, sound out The Name of the Wind.
0817439390|5.0|This is a really great book, very informative and gives some good ideas for little projects to try. I think every photographer should have this and ' Understanding Shutter Speed' in their collection.
0399536108|4.0|This was really a good book, but not the first one I would recommend to others wanting to strike out on their own. The author has put together a well-written account of his own life and some principles that will help anyone follow in his footsteps. There is some great information here, and its a pretty easy read. Would be a great book for anyone, especially those who are about to make big life decisions and are open to thinking about different opportunities.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />* Great travel information. If you want to travel around the world on the cheap, Chapter 10 of this book will be a huge help.<br /><br />* Honest focus on others is refreshing in a book like this. Author genuinely pushes for the reader to find ways to serve.<br /><br />* Inspiring. The goals laid out in this book are very realistic, within reach of any person with a little determination.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />* Too short, too diverse. Felt like three different books whittled down into one.<br /><br />* I would say about 80% of the information has already been put out in more popular books. Not much new here.<br /><br />* Online resources are the best thing about the book - they are great. Unfortunately, they also make the book expendable.<br /><br />I loved the idea for an alternative education, thought the critique of college was right on, and will use some of the travel hacking advice from the author. The largest problem with this book is that most people will only read one in the genre of business-career-self-help, and [[ASIN:B002WE46UW The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated: Expanded and Updated, With Over 100 New Pages of Cutting-Edge Content.]] has more information and more practical advice.<br /><br />For another great book on traveling, check out [[ASIN:0812992180 Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel]].

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's phenomenal and groundbreaking. The series is brilliantly written and thought provoking to the hilt. It touches on the lost of innocence, the rage of violence, the fight for justice, self preservation, betrayal, loss, acceptance, faith, society, greed, vanity, humanity, courage, hunger, gluttony, fear, ego, arrogance, politics, corruption, vengeance, evil, good, community, trust, friendship, family, love hope and all kinds of human emotion, condition, and conflict. You can relate to her character in every aspects imaginable and actually shed light to some struggles of everyday life. The genius is that Collins was able to take the dark context and make it engaging. She has created a character of one with such revealing complexity that is hard to come by. By adding a lot of contrast and she was able to paint a story that reflects the core elements of human struggle. She brings it all to the table. A merge of classic literary themes and street smarts wit packed in a book you actually want to read. Yes! You really have to read it.

The German, the British and the American intelligence agencies all decide that Issa is a Muslim terrorist who wants to claim the money for terrorist purposes.Issa, Tommy and Annabel become the objects of the various investigations and each country's agency representative claims the right to carry out the mission to capture this \\"dangerous\\" person.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Its been a long time since I felt the need to actually buy a CD.  After listening to a couple of songs from the album, namely Patience, I knew I had to buy this.  This reminds me of the black conscious movement that took place back in the late 80's- mid 90's.  Black folks NEED to get back to this thought.  Now before people on here start talking about racism let me just say that I mean pride not supremacy.  Black people are probably the most lost group of people on this earth-there should be no argument there if one is honest.  One group goes one way and one goes the other.  There is never \\"OUR\\" way it has been \\"MY\\" way.  Since us black folks love music so much, lets use it to our advantage.  Lets get back to that intellectual, soulful music again.  The youth needs it.

B001EC3JME|5.0|I purchased this identical flashlight holder (Nite Ize LHS-03) from the BX (military store). I almost did not purchase it because I had read the reviews on Amazon.com prior to seeing it on the shelf in the BX. After using it, I felt compelled to write this review because there are not many reviews on its compatibility with D cell flashlights. I used this flashlight holder for the first time last night during a fishing trip. For me, it performed flawlessly. I used it to hold my Mag-Lite 3-D cell (batteries), smooth cylinder (no indents or bulges) flashlight. After securing the holder to my belt, I had no problem inserting or removing my Mag-Lite. The most effort was used inserting it. Yes it takes two hands, and yes it is a snug fit, but for me the two hands was not a problem (I had one of each available) and the snuggness was perfect for application during fishing. I had no problem sliding the light up and down the holder (with one hand) to get a good balance in a rotated position. The combination of the rotating clip and the snug fit balancing, allowed me to keep the light pointed in the desired direction, with no hand on the flashlight (excellent). I am very glad I bought this flashlight holder and recommend it to owners' of smooth cylinder Mag-Lite D cell flashlights.

0525422943|5.0|Gayle Forman is amazing. Her books are some of the best I've ever read, Where She Went included. When I read the description and found out that Adam was the POV character of this one, instead of Mia, I was nervous because I LOVE MIA SO MUCH.     But.     Um.     Then I read it.     And there may never be another fictional boy whom I fall so hard for, so fast. Adam jerked my heart around with all of his pain, and even more with his hidden hope. I won't spoil it, but there's a scene with a guitar that might be the best scene ever written. It will stay with me for a long, long time. Just like both of the books in this series.

As a field biologist (botany specifically) for twenty plus years, I haven't found any of his books engaging, and in many cases they are off the mark scientifically.  He really just states the obvious to anyone in America who isn't sleeping their way through life.

B00004YA66|5.0|\\"Frequency\\" is the coolest movie I've bought from Amazon so far! Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel really bring you to the edge of your seat! This movie is about a police officer named John Sullivan who finds an old ham radio that used to belong to his dad, and tries to communicate with it. When he does, he eventually finds out he's talking to his father--who's been dead for 30 years! After John manages to save his dad's life, the two must work together to stop a dangerous murderer--who might kill them both! This movie is very suspenseful and perfect for anyone who loves action-packed movies.

B0053EZXRS|5.0|Wow - The story is fantastic, the acting is good overall, and phenomenal by Nicolas Cage. Amber Heard plays a fabulous tough girl with a heart - and she's a really good badass chick, IMO. There's a couple of scenes that definitely entitle this to its R rating, along with the language. The action just keeps on going, with a few short moments of back story. There's enough twists to keep strong interest, and enough predictability to make you right in your anticipation, enough craziness to last all night long. While I don't know how to write reviews, I really love the movie and strongly recommend it to people who like action and some darkness, nonsense and wonder.
0300169787|5.0|Not many words need to be said..it is excellent, beautiful, tragic, lovely, a work of art. If you can afford it get this book! I am so glad I got it when it was in stock on Amazon for 27.00 plus free shipping. This price is crazy high now...but something tells me it will never go down for this first edition. If you love McQueen's artistry, get this book!
0810997827|5.0|I bought the 2 sets for both of my nephews and I never saw them smile as big as they did when opening and seeing what was in their package. I had to pry them from the books and usually they want to play video games but they havent picked up the controllers to the video games since they got their set. They laugh with each other and share their thoughts and comments with each other about their books and before it was a constant arguement on who got to play the game or be first player but their interest is no longer there but on reading and writing in their new set of books. I believe that it is good for kids to read books and am so happy that they enjoy their books! I believe it was the best way to spend my money on them instead of more video games!!!
B003L0V758|5.0|I've been listening to a lot of different types of music, and have collected many gbs worth of albums but until now i have not written a single review. This album deserves my rating, its really one of those rare albums that you can put on repeat over and over again. not only are the songs amazing (listen to 57821, sir greendown, locked inside, oh maker), but the whole album story (this is 2 and 3 of a 4 series work) is great. i cannot wait to hear part 4 when it comes out. this is in my top 10. some other cds that I think are really worth listening to deeply are (not genre specific, or in order):    fleet foxes - fleet foxes  XX - xx  nujabes - modal soul   bestcoast - any of their ep's    with all these albums you can really feel something.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|exactly the post it notes app you want . no problems on my Droid incredible.  always updating is the only thing i don't like which  is minor
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love Plants vs. Zombies. I have the game for my computer along with my xbox and also even play it on Facebook. I was soo excited to see it was FINALLY available on the Droid! The program runs very good, but like any other game, if you play it too long your battery will start to run dead. Recommend this app!
0060763280|4.0|This book is very eye opening and you will certainly learn something new. I re-read this book every now and then to refresh myself on the principles. It's a quick read and covers a lot of information.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|If i could give this album zero stars, i would. This album is sooooooo uninspired and directionless. The whole album has a 1980's vibe about it and her lyrics are so literal. There isn't any mystery in the songs, or the message of the songs. An 80's flare is cool, but she doesn't seem to be able to deliver on the majority of the tracks. If her old fans are looking for theatrical over the top pop songs, this album doesn't offer that. What her fans have become accustom to is nowhere to be found on this CD. I guess that's why she delayed the release.<br /><br />She was a normal artist on her first CD and then she let her own 'fabulosity' get to her. She fell into her own 'hype' and just tries to hard to shock people. The Fame Monster was a coomplete departure, image wise, from her first release. For 'Born This Way', she has literally flown off the handle. The girl has run out of steam. On top of that, she doesn't have any 'charisma'. She is not aesthetically pleasing to look at. Her Italian Catholic-Edie Falco-nose looks cute on Stanley Tucci, but not her. She has as much charm as a plastic mannequin. Her semi-tomboyish lesbian allure doesn't do a thing for me and most of her songs on this album are just a major disappointment. Not cohesive at all. On top of that, she tries to sell the audience her bizzare sex appeal (Which once again, is as interesting as a plastic mannequin).<br /><br />I hope she can deliver on her fourth album.<br /><br />Don't be a drag just be a queen. Don't be a drag just be a queen. **I cringe every time she sings those lines**

0446195529|3.0|I have read all of Baldacci's books, save for his newest, which include the Camel Club books. I have enjoyed them previously but this one is very slow, not exciting and you kind of miss the camel club since they are really in the background and not part of the major story line.
1593083246|5.0|Please note that this review is on the hard cover edition offered here via Barns and Noble.  Amazon, for reasons known only to themselves, have chosen to lump every review of the classic piece of literature together no matter the format.  As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.<br /><br />Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible.  This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above.  I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books.  She, like me, is a big Austen fan.<br /><br />Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost.  It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.<br /><br />Now so with this printed hard back version.  The book is well made.  The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough.  The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere.  The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost  you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.<br /><br />If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider.  I personally bought mine, along with a number of the `classics' in this series directly at a B&N store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.<br /><br />For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.<br /><br />As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so.  You are in for a true reading treat.  If you have read it before, then read it again!  If you are one of those that simply do no like Austen's work...well, don't read it at all!<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks/><br />As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|Got the game for free with Amazon's deal of the day. At first I couldn't get it to open. Uninstalled and reinstalled and got it to work great. Beat the game in 36 hours. Then went back to play again to get all the plant items available and received a phone call in the middle of a level. Normally it would pause but it restarted my level so I closed the game and started it again and then it reset the entire game as if I've never played it. So I closed it again and now it won't let me open it at all like when I first downloaded it. Glad I didn't pay money for this. Droid - Incredible.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|I overall like the sound of the CD much like their first CD but there just isnt anything on this CD that grabs yoiu and says man thats a great song.  Overall its a good CD with a bunch of Good songs. Nothing great though.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This game is a blast (literally) BUT there have been numerous times that the game play slows down to a crawl and in the background it causes my launcher, and eventually my phone, to crash.  I'll either get a frozen screen that makes me have to pop the battery or it will do it's own reset where it reboots my phone. Happens about one out of every four or five games.  Never had this issue before installing the game but it is fun when it works...that's why I haven't uninstalled it yet.  Samsung Epic 4G
0307279189|3.0|Maybe I am paranoid, but for the latter half of this book, I got the impression that the author was trying to sell me a bunch of things. He drops brand names about as often as your average black eyed peas song: vibram five fingers, nike flat shoes, men's health magazine, so on and so forth. For a book that is ostensibly an anthropological study, this book was surprisingly laconic on science. Instead, the greatness of barefoot running and eating corn slush is repeated again and again through various anecdotes, most of which have the same basic structure:  \\"___ is sad/depressed/sort of a bum until ___ starts running all the time. Then ____ becomes happy and successful.\\"    As a self help book, this book is much much better than most. There's sort of a story, and sort of scientific backing. But like a self help book, there's too much repetitive and unimaginative writing.
0441013597|5.0|Dune is, to me, an amazing book.  It' well written, the characters are extremely believable (be it good or bad) and the story is incredibly gripping.  The level of detail of the history, planets and faith is well told and the author succeed to create something that felt so real it felt like I stood on the planet myself.    Love it.
0425242099|2.0|I have found Singh's books to be hit-or-miss.  Her strongest books have been the ones where there is a strong understandable impediment to the characters' relationship, and she allows the plot to work out those differences.  The three that come to mind are Branded by Fire, Caressed by Ice, and Play of Passion.  In fact, I consider Play the strongest of all her books.  The story Mine to Possess was one of the \\"miss\\" books.  In fact, I haven't read several of the books based on the reviews because I don't want to read another \\"miss\\".    I was looking forward to Kiss of Snow based on the buildup in the previous books of the relationship between Hawk and Sienna.  But apparently she used all her ideas for tension in the relationship in previous books, because this had none of the give-or-take, will she/he or won't she/he storyline.  The question gets resolved pretty early, but the culmination of the relationship, as other reviewers point out, happens wwwway toward the end of the book (70% in according to my Kindle).  This is not good suspense; this is just delay.      And Singh uses another writing technique that I found strange.  She has the two main characters together, alone, tension building, and then ends the scene, picking up the next day.  What?  The first time it happened, I even flipped back to see if I skipped a page, but no, I didn't.  The chapter ends in the middle of the scene, and the next one picks up with Sienna or Hawk thinking about how the previous night was unexpectedly ended for some reason or another.      If you are a fan and still want to see Hawk and Sienna together, I recommend waiting on the paperback; I wish I had.

1563890410|4.0|Morpheus of the Endless has had many trials throughout the ages... but none quite as strange as the one he must face in \\"The Sandman, Volume Four: Season of Mists.\\" The fourth collection of Neil Gaiman's classic Sandman series centers on sudden changes in the world of Hell, and the terrifying choice that the Lord of Dreams must make -- who does it go to?<br /><br />After a disastrous meeting with the other Endless, Morpheus goes to Hell to set free his onetime lover, Nada. But when he gets there, he finds that Lucifer is tired of being the lord of Hell, and is shutting the whole place down -- and he gives ownership of it to Morpheus. In the meantime, the souls of the damned are roaming Earth, and the anguished demons have nowhere to go.<br /><br />Morpheus isn't interested in ruling Hell, so soon various powers appear to claim Hell -- Norse, Japanese and Egyptian gods, a trio of powerful demons, Order, Chaos, a Faerie diplomat, and a pair of angels are sent to watch the proceedings. Threats, bribes and tricks ensue, leaving Morpheus with a seemingly-impossible choice to make.<br /><br />Just a warning: This comic book, despite its brilliant storytelling, left me with a sort of squirmy feeling, because it bases itself on Christian theology that many people actually believe in (heaven, hell, Satan, angels, God, etc). But it isn't in line with those beliefs, so some parts of it come across as...  uncomfortable.<br /><br />However, you should always keep in mind that it is merely fiction. \\"Season of Mists\\" is epic in scope -- it encompasses different worlds, dimensions and lands in a seeemingly endless, wondrously terrifying universe. Gaiman is absolutely brilliant at conjuring the exquisite and the grotesque, the eerie and the strange -- and he manages all of those here.<br /><br />And the art really helps here -- the bleak, raw wastes of Hell, the snowflake beauty of the angels, the visceral grotesqueness of the demons (one is a lumpen creature with a melting eyeless head and toothy mouths for nipples), and the twilit, mildly unnerving realm of Dreaming.<br /><br />As for Morpheus himself, this story is a surprisingly personal one. He's given a realm he doesn't want, but doesn't seem to have any good way of ridding himself of it (at least, not at first). And the Lord of Dream has to face up to his own misdeeds -- namely, he FINALLY figures out that he was horrible to Nada, and that his punishment of her was cruel. The way their story is wrapped up is painful, but still very touching.<br /><br />\\"The Sandman Volume Four: Season of Mists\\" made me uncomfortable with some of its handling of Christian theology, but there is no denying that it is a richly-imagined, powerful story by a master storyteller.the twilit, mildly unnerving realm of Dreaming.

0143034901|5.0|This is one of the greatest books that I have read in quite some time and it far surpasses a rating of 5 stars. This is the first book that I have read by this author, but I assure you, it won't be the last. It is impossible to explain just how beautifully written it is. The characters, the settings, it all comes to life right before your eyes.<br /><br />The book is so many things. At times it is terribly tragic, yet it is very, very funny. It is a story of hate and envy, but is also the most beautiful love story. It is mysterious and full of surprises. The characters are so wonderfully developed and are so believable and real, you feel that you know them, love them and care about them, deeply. At least the \\"good\\" ones. As for the others, well, those feelings will go deep as well.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that is quite unlike anything else that you've read, do yourself a favor. Pick up a copy of this book and read it. You will have trouble putting it down before it's finished.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I love this album, it really stands out from the R&B and Pop albums of today.  The lyrics are thought provoking and unique, and the melodies have a way of staying in your head.  My favorite tracks are Cold War, Tightrope, Wondaland, Dance or Die, Faster, and Oh Maker.  I think the track that I like the least is Make the Bus, simply because it seems like it throws off the flow of the whole album, it just doesn't match with the theme of the album, in my humble opinion.  I love the orchestral arrangements of the suites that are at two separate points in the album.  All of the music sounds like it would be a theme to a movie.  Each song sounds great and has a message.  What more could you ask for?  I hope she keeps 'em coming because I thoroughly enjoy her music and her wonderful voice.
B003TKYAVI|5.0|I've played HALO for years, I remember playing Halo CE on my friend's PC when it came out, and playing Halo 2 & 3 multiplayer and campaign. And it wasn't just the games that were awesome, Marty worked his magic on the score just as much as Bungie did creating the game. You don't have to play the games to appreciate the soundtracks of these games (although it helps). That all being said, I LOVE this soundtrack, I listen to it at work and on the go and it feels like I'm playing the game, remembering the ending tribute to the Chief, and fighting brutes along the way. How one simple monk chorus has evolved into so many amazing suites of music, is simply awe-inspiring. If you're a Halo fan or even just appreciate good music, I'd recommend this soundtrack to anyone. To give it any less than five stars just isn't enough.

B0039V8NJC|5.0|I enjoy the writting style a lot.  But more than this I really appreciated the parallel between his love for the girl and his love for America. Both the girl and his first vision of America as a great place of equality and opportunity fade away and then disappear completely. As someone who loves history I find it very unsettling the extent to which most people in the US have no idea why anyone in the rest of the world would dislike our foreign policy... because most Americans have so little idea what it is or what it does to other human beings. I don't like the way the US media and politicians make anyone in the world who disagrees with our self-interest a \\"dangerous and bad person.\\" I love the ability shown here to gently flesh-out someone who disagrees with US policy and show him as nothing more than a kindred human being who shares exactly our own concern for our family and our loved ones.

1400052181|5.0|I read this book a few months ago but have put off writing it up until I could tame my enthusiasm into a review that's more useful than a basic list of superlatives.  I just can't tame that enthusiasm.  If all of America could sit down and read one book together, I nominate The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.  It travels into our national psyche and pulls up lessons in American history, scientific research, microbiology, disease, medical and legal ethics, journalism, economics, racism, poverty, sociology and the overall human condition. It manages to do all that in a lucid, candid narrative that holds attention from the first to the last pages.      The story is essentially this:  for 60 years the international scientific world has relied on the HeLa strain of human cells for research that has had an impact on every life in one way or another.  An offhand remark about the origin of the cells by a science teacher remained in journalist's Rebecca Skloot's mind for years, and when she began following that scrap of information, she entered a historical realm that reaches back to slavery, Jim Crow America and the Cold War era of science.  It took years of working at nights and weekends on the book, and put Skloot in places that others would not tread, but she got the story down and it is remarkable.    Not the least of the story is the contemporary portrait of an inner city Baltimore family at risk, a large African American family descended from slaves.  Their matriarch, Henrietta Lacks, was a cancer patient in 1951 at Johns Hopkins when her cervical cells were routinely biopsied.  Recognizing their unusual viability, the doctor kept the cells and shared them freely and without remuneration with the greater research world.  In the decades since, the world has benefitted from the research they have made possible, and the pharmaceutical industry has profited greatly.  Meanwhile, the children Henrietta left behind grew up in grinding poverty without health insurance and have been taken advantage of by researchers.  Skloot tracks them down and together they find out what happened to Henrietta's cells over the years and probe the changing ethics of privacy, control over one's own cells and DNA, and other complex issues.    There are no easy answers or one big happy ending that fixes the Lacks family's problems.  But the wonder of endurance and the human condition resound throughout the book.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have a theory about albums-they are like a dozen eggs.     If a typical album were a dozen eggs, when you opened the carton, you would find 2 stunning, Grade AA, Jumbo-size, perfectly shaped white eggs. Next to them would be a few gleaming Grade A large eggs. The rest of the eggs in the box would be small, odd-shapped, dirty eggs, and one or two of them might even be a little smelly. In other words, most albums contain a pair of great songs, a couple of OK songs, and then the fillers needed to complete the album.    Compared to a 'typical' album, The Fame Monster contained eight Grade AA Jumbo perfect eggs, and four of Grade A Large eggs. The Fame Monster was as good as an album can get, period.    Born this Way is not quite another Fame Monster. but it is MUCH better than a typical album. The more I have listened to this album, the more it grows on me. There are many superb songs on this album (Born this Way, Judas, Marry the Night, Hair, Government Hooker, Fashion of His Love, and You and I) and in particular, the Edge of Glory is an amazing and awe-inspiring song-the number of covers that have appeared on YouTube in a week is proof that it touches a lot of people. Unfortunately, there are a couple weaker songs on the album.    Let me put it in baseball terms: The Fame Monster was a Grand Slam, while Born this way is a three-run homer, and thus still better than 99% of all albums written these days.    Every fan of pop music should own a copy.    PS I am not a typical Lady Gaga fan-I am 57, no nothing about music, and pay little attention to music in general. But I love her music, and have attended two of her concerts.
1439148953|3.0|Can one write a novel the way, let's say, Katherine Mansfield wrote a short story?  Focus on the character who lives in the series of quotidian discoveries and then push to one final epiphanic moment that substantially greater than the previous pages?  It's a lot like playing dice on a Brooklyn street corner: one may win or one may lose.  While Toibin may be a skilled writer, the book just comes off as labored.  I'd think twice before recommending this book to anyone.

0307887960|5.0|This diet is amazing. I've been on it for a little over 30 days now and I can't believe how amazing I look.  I wasn't fat to start with, but just wanted to lose ten pounds I've never been able to lose my whole life.  Well I can say that not only did I lose the ten pounds, but I never had such confidence in the way I look.  Dr. Dukan really spells out for you exactly what you can and cannot eat, so there is no guessing whether or not you might be breaking a rule.  I've had a few days where I felt like giving up, but the real key with this diet is to always have Dukan approved foods in your kitchen (don't ever run out!) and to eat different kinds of proteins everyday. If you eat the same things, you will get bored and quit.  Mix it up!  Definitely would recommend this to anyone who couldn't lose that last stubborn five pounds. Perfect just in time for beach season.  Oh, and I also learned a lot about nutrition reading this book.  It really guides you in making healthier choices.
B001EO2UJK|4.0|If you're an early Genesis fan, this set is fantastic - they've really cleaned up the sound... BUT - the DVDs are regular video DVDs with surround sound, NOT the DVD-Audio format which is much higher resolution and quality (and is not supported by most DVD players). It's a bit misleading because on the discs themselves under the title it says \\"DVD:Audio\\" but this is just a subheading for the track listing.    So by all means get this set - it still sounds great and some of the visuals are a treat as well. Just be aware of the format. I'm not sure why I expected it to be - perhaps I read a misinformed review somewhere.

I've read and own just about if not all of his books and this one is by far my favorite.  He really draws you in and you can feel the characters and the pain that the main character is going through.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|I absolutely loved this movie except for one thing.... It opened to a beautiful wintery scene and I soon found myself wrapped up in the life of red riding hood and trying to figure out the mystery of the wolf- all while pulling for true love to somehow find a way to make it through impossible circumstances.... that is until in the middle of this otherwise wonderful movie someone is tortured. And that is what ruined it for me. Unfortunately that one part was horrible enough for me not to purchase this movie or ever watch it again.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|I love Taylor Swift. I am a huge fan, and I am openly admitting that this is not her best work. It's sorely mislabeled as 'country'. Perhaps the only songs that sound slightly country are Mean and Never Grow Up. I do like a lot of the songs, but the rest are pretty lame compared to Fearless. If you just want to download a few of them, here's my opinion on the specific songs.    Mine-I love this song. I think it's a fun, cutesy love song.    Sparks Fly-This song has a killer chorus. Love it.    Back To December-Taylor seems to be taking the blame for a relationship gone wrong for once. I love the lyrics. (Seriously, in most of her break-up songs, it's the guy's fault. Picture To Burn, Tell Me Why, White Horse...)    Speak Now-The first time I heard it, I couldn't stop laughing. The lyrics are so pathetic they simply BEG to be taunted. Don't get it.    Dear John-I didn't care for it, but I've never liked slower songs as much. It's not terrible.    Mean-It's okay. A little unoriginal. I've heard the same message so many times, it's getting annoying.    The Story Of Us-I like it. Has a nice beat, though it's a little long.    Never Grow Up-This is supposed to be the emotional song. The first time I heard it, I cried. The second time, it sounded a little redundant. The third time, it annoyed me. Now I just laugh at it. It's pretty boring.    Enchanted-I love it. Though I might be biased because I love Owl City too, and I first heard his version. Then I was permanently attached to this song.    Better Than Revenge-I hate this song. I have never hated a song by her before. Picture To Burn border-lined there, but I kinda like it now. I can't pinpoint why I hate this song. It just doesn't sound like Taylor. She's always been the cutesy country girl. Not trying to get a guy who's obviously NOT worth it if a slut can steal him away. And she doesn't even say WHAT her revenge is. If you're gonna write a revenge song, at least SAY what you're gonna do. Like Before He Cheats by Carrie Underwood.    Innocent-This song is supposed to be for Kanye West, for when he stole her mike to tell the world how much better Beyonce was than her. I don't hear it. I love the song, but it's almost ruined because I can't help but think of Corny Kanye whenever it comes on.    Haunted-From the first moment I heard this, I couldn't get enough. This song is amazing.    Last Kiss-Same as Dear John. It's not terrible, but it's not my type.    Long Live-This song is supposed to be for her band. I really like this song. I think the lyrics are deep and the message is good.    Overall, Taylor's lyrics are decent. I will point out that, out of the 14 tracks, 9 of those exceed 4 minutes by a considerable margin.    I do hope she veers back to 'country', though, and not stay in pop like this album is.    First review, how bad was it?
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game is the same old fantastic Plants vs Zombies.. except that it keeps on reloading the level in the middle of gameplay.  Fortunately it saves the game before it reloads.. but it is extremely annoying.  Each reload takes about 15 seconds.. and asks me to resume the game. I'm not gonna play anymore untill they come up with an update fix.    my phone: T-Mobile Samsung Vibrant
B002P93VGO|4.0|Buy the blu ray plus digital copy at Amazon for $7.99 June 5 or right now at Bestbuy for $7.99.  The dvd version is $3.99 at Bestbuy right now as well.  $11.98 plus tax at Bestbuy for both until June 11, 2011 if a store is in your area.  Get a better deal than this price at Amazon.<br /><br />The movie is good, though a little different from the previous Xmen stories.  It's more about Wolverine if this is one of your favorite characters. Alot more growling, and fighting.  I don't like the fighting between he and his brother though. It has some other cool characters with special powers that have good action scenes. I gave it a four star, because I like the Xmen franchise as well as the cartoon versions.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Okay, so I've seen some of the other reviews left on here in regards to the origins of the writers start for this story.  All I have to say is that it's obviously not a plagerism issue, so why even bring up the fanfiction portion.  Yes, I moved from fanfiction to original work, so perhaps I'm biased.  However, I feel the review should be based on the work, not where it got started.    Having said that, I LOVED this story.  Yes, I started it on fanfiction, but never finished it.  The characters are charming and wonderfully developed.  The staging for the story is brilliantly set up and executed.  The emotions involved in the character relationships are endearing and wonderful to get lost in.    While reading this book, I honestly lost myself in the main character - sort of putting myself in her shoes.  For me, it's important to be able to do that - be the main character - especially in first person POV.  And I could do it with this book! Almost Perfect!    Yes, I said almost. Trust me when I say that an Almost Perfect is as close to perfect as I get - so it's pretty darn high on my scale.    In every review I like to keep it honest.  You get my real feelings and reaction to the book. So, you got my love, now my cons.    The cons for this one are minimal. Like really, really minimal.  My only concern were the mispelling errors toward the end.  It was as if toward the end of the book, editing mattered less or something happened during the formatting process.  These were minor 'oops it said she instead of he, or hey instead of they'.  It was things like leadersL at the begining of a sentence, etc.  After a while it got annoying enough to make me roll my eyes ('Stow the Twitchy Palm'), but it was never enough to hinder or make me not want to continue.    Over all, I give this book 5 'yes sirs'.    Now when is part 2 coming?  MUST KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!!!    <...>
B003XKDEX4|3.0|This set isn't up to the same standards as the Mozart, Bach, Haydn, Or Beethoven Complete Edition sets that Brilliant Classics has been having recent success with.  Let me divide the set into three sections and rate according to performance and sound.<br /><br />The Concertos.  Performances:  4 star (on the average), Sound: 4 star on the average.  The first 25 of the 40 discs in the set are various concertos and families of concertos by what appears to be every ensemble in Italy that even serious classical music collectors have never heard of.  Don't let that put you off.  Most of these performances are quite good, and the sound engineering is intimate, but with the perfect amount of echo, reverb, and presence.  Detailed, warm in some cases, and others seem to be missing a little on the low end.  Nothing you can't fix with the treble and bass controls on your stereo.  My only complaint, and it is pretty consistent with Brilliant Classics 40 disc collections...allegro doesn't seem to ever really be allegro.  It's nursing home allegro.  For best performances of these works go to the Naive label, or pick up the Fabio Biondi recordings.  You'll pay the big bucks, but those recordings have energy, which this set lacks - hence, four vs. five stars.<br /><br />The Sonatas:  Performances: 3 stars.  Sound: 5 stars.  These are OK performances, but they don't pack enough energy to really get these pieces across.  The engineering is quite good though.  Intimate and close, but not claustraphobic.  I do appreciate the smaller ensemble take on these pieces, and for their lack of energy, these recordings have a charming air about them that is pleasing to the ear.  If they could have sped the tempos up about 4 to 8 beats per measure these would have been perfect.<br /><br />The Choral Works:  Performances: 1 star.  Sound:  Doesn't matter.  These performances are so bad it is embarrassing.  Cantatas by women that sound old enough to bury.  Men that have been chasing ponies from Rome to Denmark.  Choirs and orchestras that sound like they've been around since Vivaldi wrote these pieces.  What may have worked on the Bach Complete Edition doesn't work well here.  The Netherland Bach Collegium and the Holland Boys Choirs aren't so bad as far as original instrument groups go, but the no vibrato, no vocal blend, unsteady intonation - all the fault of the director and record producer - make for an unpleasant listening experience.  The up side is you want to find better versions of these and add them to your collection.  They butcher the Gloria (and not the famous one we hear at Christmas), the Stabat Matter, the Dixit and the Nisi Dominus, and a few other minor pieces that you wouldn't want to hear if they were recorded by Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir.  Am I being a little hard on them?  Yes, I suppose so, but this is a product and I am consumer.  If the steam iron isn't perfect, I can return it.  With CDs and DVDs, all we have is \\"caveat emptor.\\"  Buyer beware.<br /><br />And if you think that isn't bad enough, there is that recorder genius, Erik Bosgraaf.  Playing so bad it will make you laugh out loud.  The Recorder Concertos are by far the worst CD in this set.<br /><br />If they hadn't dropped the ball on the choral CDs in this set, I could recommend it whole heartedly, despite the Bosgraaf recordings.  But for the asking price, you can pick up some great recordings,used, on Amazon that are top notch.  The Viktoria Mullova/Il Giardino Armonico Violin Concertos [[ASIN:B0009IFF08 Vivaldi: Violin Concertos]] are to die for, and anything by Fabio Biondi is worth sampling.  Again, the Naive label has dedicated itself to getting 5 star recordings of Vivaldi's whole catalog, and expensive as they are, they are well worth collecting.  If you are thinking about purchasing this set, divide the current price by 25, and ask yourself if you think it is worth it.  I commend Brilliant Classics for what they are attempting to do, which is make discovering classical music affordable.  These sets are works in progress.  The Beethoven Complete Edition and the Mozart and Haydn Complete Editions are excellent investments.  The Handel Portrait set I purchased last week was a complete waste of money.  I would sincerely love to see Jed Wentz and his Musica ad Rhenum, a BC regular, pull in his Amsterdam Conservatory resources, re-record the choral selections and replace some of the yawns with more exciting pieces and have Brilliant Classics commision new recordings of these pieces.  In fact, they should let him supervise all of the Baroque sets from now on.<br /><br />PS.  And one last recommendation.  Naïve Classics has a three-for-the-price of one boxed set of highlights from three Vivaldi operas from their highly lauded Vivaldi Edition releases.  [[ASIN:B0040HPKFO Opera Highlights: Vivaldi Edition]]  Warning:  This will forever change your expectation of what Baroque music should sound like.  Euphoria and addiction sure to follow.are works in progress.  The Beethoven Complete Edition and the Mozart and Haydn Complete Editions are excellent investments.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This is the first review I have ever written.  While I enjoyed this book, I found it upsetting that new characters were created in the last few chapters.  I find it a cheat when authors need to add characters or important information to bring their book to a climate.  The book was light, easy to read and pure fantasy which is what I expected when I bought the book and what I needed from it.  Too bad the author was unable to create a satisfying ending.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This is a fun game but every time I play it the game gets stuck and I am forced to power off the phone. The same thing happened on my rooted Samsung Vibrant, as well as another stock Vibrant running 2.2. A coworker also had the same problem on an Evo 4G. Until the game is fixed I won't be playing it.
006112429X|4.0|I read this book as a straight-up horror novel. It doesn't work any other way. If you take it on as serious social commentary, an examination of school shooters, serial killers, nature vs. nurture, marriage and parenthood, the book turns silly and repellent. Approaching it as a horror novel featuring one of my favorite plot devices -- the unreliable narrator -- allowed me to truly inhabit Eva's point of view and to relish the tale's shocking (and campy) ending.
0143117009|4.0|Collapse by Jared Diamond is an excellent book. I found the book to be extremely engrossing and interesting and it was packed full of detail. Jared Diamond covers many different time periods, places and people. He also points out specific details to why each society failed or thrived and uses evidence to back up that claim. He thoroughly covers each subject and leaves no detail out. I also liked how he was able to bring in modern day examples in addition to the older ones.  While reading Collapse, I learned many new things that I had never even thought about before. The book is a little slow at first but soon starts to pick up. I recommend this book to anyone who has a serious interest in this topic because for others it might be a little too long and boring. Although Collapse might take you a while to read, it's definitely worth it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Words cannot describe the talent this girl has.  I love this album from start to finish.  She is incredible.  She is also incredible live-  buy this!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Game play is great at first but then begins ti slow and eventually stops responding. Fun while it works. Vibrant.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|it was amazing. it was supposed to be at my house in 8-10 days. it ended up being there in 3. i was very pleased. i bought it used and it played like new. i love this soundtrack with a passion. it is fantastic!
1932100385|1.0|This book is responsible for shortening my father's life.    December 27, 2007: Dad was diagnosed with stage 4 inoperable pancreatic cancer.    We hunted high and low for information. Not much is out there. However, soon we discovered this horrible book.    Dad started following the recommended diet. His cancer kept growing, but he lost all the \\"extra\\" weight he had (which wasn't much). It was hard for Dad to accept that \\"alternative medicine\\" had failed him.    Dad died on May 26, 2008 essentially from starvation caused by the cancer. Near the end, it is almost impossible to eat. The cancer patient lives only on stored fat. The book's recommended diet removed the stored fat so that Dad had nothing left to live on, dying early.    The China Study authors should be class-action sued for the fraud they perpetrate. They should be incarcerated for medical fraud, advising something which is known to shorten people's lives.    One star is too good of a review for this fraudulent book.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was able to jump in on the special of getting the app for free and must say that it's addictive and fun. Had this been only a paid app I would have just pass on it but now that I have played it its worth the couple of bucks They are asking for it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My first review...I don't use my evo for games, til now! Hours of entertainment.  Be careful, it's addicting. worth the money if you have to pay, friends.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Simply put, this is an amazing and beautiful collection of songs that feels like a journey through the heart and soul of Eddie Vedder. It's not Pearl jam, and that's a good thing: there's something vastly different about writing, composing, and performing songs with a band as opposed to a solo effort. It's not the \\"Into the Wild\\" soundtrack, either; although that collection of songs was beautiful in its own right, for the most part the songs that Eddie wrote for it were meant to be told from the perspective of Christopher McCandless. Instead, this is a truly unique effort that gives the reader a starkly personal view of Eddie on a level heretofore unseen in his vast collection of work.    The covers here are lovely, particularly the lighthearted \\"Tonight You Belong to Me\\" and the wistful \\"Sleepless Nights.\\" On both, Eddie's voice works perfectly with the guest vocalists, avoiding the feeling of forced-collaboration that often afflicts these type of duets. \\"Dream a Little Dream\\" is a nice way to finish the album, a minute-and-a-half rendition of the timeless classic that features Eddie channeling his inner Tom Waits.    But the real treasures here are Eddie's original songs. These are songs of love and loss, and for anyone who has ever gone through either, they are simply heartbreaking. On \\"Once in a While,\\" he laments: \\"Once in a while will you try to give one little thought to me? / Though someone else may be nearer to your heart, / Will you dream of the moments I shared with you / Before we drifted apart?\\". Anyone who has ever lost love too soon can certainly identify. On \\"Without You,\\" the sentiments are just as painful: \\"I'll keep on healing all the scars that we've collected from the start. / I'd rather this than live without you.\\"     This album certainly isn't for everyone, but for those who have a longing for intimate, stripped down, breathtaking music, it doesn't get much better than this.
0060751967|3.0|I am a big vampire love story kind of girl and I really did enjoy the book but it was missing something.  I really didn't like the ending because it felt like it was missing something.  I needed more than what I got.  The story is funny and did remind me of other books but nothing to special not too far fetched.  It was a good book I had a really hard time putting down. I was in between books but it is a good pass time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i thought that this gane plants vs. zombies is very unique and a lot of fun to play. it is a long game with many levels with increasing difficulty but you also get to use better upgrades for weapons etc as well. quite addictive.
B001GKPXSM|5.0|It's currently my favorite CD for the car during the crazy rush hours. Nothing and nobody can make me angry with this CD on. I love it.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|This case is so perfect for protecting the bluetooth, weather in a purse, clipped on a belt or on a cars visor.
B004LFO0ME|4.0|Each song has its own individual theme and fun, and all the songs have something that grabs you. This album is worth it, but the songs aren't as fun or as fast as the earlier ones. This is for the mellow, chill out, kind of listeners. Good, but not perfect.
B00447G29S|5.0|Right now this is one of the gold standard 3D movies.      The story is great, if a little heavy on the syrup.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|thor is a awesome movie a modern classic the best of the best buy this movie if your a huge marvel film fan you wont be sorry
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|You may imagine you're getting a 3D exploration of the grand canyon; what you are really getting is \\"Rich People Do Cool Stuff While Giving Lip Service To The Environment\\".  There is the Kennedy family in it, and it smacks heavily of marketing for them.  The \\"producer\\" constantly puts his daughter in the shots, the guides and locals looked embarrassed to be there, and the technical quality is mediocre at best.      The focus of the narrative is the health of the Colorado river rather than the canyon.      The title and cover image were clearly intended to deceive.  Now I carefully check each 3D DVD I buy to make sure it doesn't have, in tiny letters, a subtitle that will totally change my desire to see or buy it.      3D:  Ok  Location:  The few shots of the canyon, nice  Production:  Poor, amateurish  Narrative:  Intolerable
B0052UZIFA|5.0|perfect operation on thunderbolt. never fc. y is there a 20 word minimum. I think I may never review again since I have to write a paper each time.
0553106635|5.0|I just re-read all of these, and if you're looking for the best book in the series, this one wins by a nose.    Most series lose steam after the first book or two, but this one is going strong. The last 200 pages have enough revelations and surprises to fill 10 fantasy series.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|the game works great on my Droid incredible. it runs great and is tons of fun however since I installed it I keep getting a phony low space warning which I know is bogus since I have 10gb of free space.... didnt start till I loaded this app either...   :(
B0041KKYEW|3.0|Although Natalie Portman gives an Oscar-worthy performance, Vincent Price has to be laughing in his grave:  at the pretentiousness of Aronofsky; the sickishness of Portman's character, but, mostly, at the inaneness of the Academy Awards' best picture and best director nominations for this film.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this app is so fun it works fantastically on my droid x good thing i got it for free ha ha ha
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I got this app while it was free and it won't even open! I am on an incredible.   very frustrating.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|lots of translations, lots of features. looks awesome on my xoom. the bible studies are great. i use it at church to bookmark the readings for later.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I purchased this about 3 weeks or so ago and have to say the first week I was really liking this DVD.  I felt stronger and was looking forward to the changes in my body...However, after 8 days I began to feel some pain in my knee.  I thought it was just the exertion (was aching all over the first week of this video so thought this knee pain was just me getting used to it).  Well, I am just today returning from the Dr. with a cast up my leg and cruthces as I have a broken tibia - (3 inch fracture from one side of the knee to the other).  Mind you I was doing the \\"beginner\\" exercises following the girl with modified versions and concentrated on my form the entire time. Also, I only did Level 1.  8 days of Level 1 and now I am in a cast!  Watch out!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Simply put, buy this game! This game is very addictive and fun. It also has lots of replay value and does not get old quickly due to varied gameplay.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was super excited when I downloaded this app because I have wanted the game on my phone for AGES. But, Amazon AppStore didn't tell me prior to downloading it that it was not compatible with my Samsung Intercept. Very disappointed! :(
0330423622|5.0|This is bar none, one of the best reads ever....basic humanity at it's best and worst.....beautiful prose....philosphical..poetic...heartfelt and worthy of the top prize in literature....usually I would find it daunting to read such a lengthy book....but I don't want it to end....so glad that it is long....envelops all of humanity...suffering, joy, happiness and love.  Usually don't bother to write a review....but broke my complacency with this one.
B002SR3T10|5.0|Nice collection of X-mas songs and related stuff JT did. This new edition brings a 2nd CD with a JT concert, excellent recording, which was recorded in a church, in X-mas days recently.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|great app when working properly. unfortunatly due to the many action graphics on the screen the game starts to lag and ends up crashing. wont run on my sd card either. (personal experience on my galaxy tab w/froyo.)
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|Where's Teddy, where's Teddy?  You know, I just don't care about finding Teddy.  The jokes are so mediocre.  Completely boring until halfway through the movie, when the money transfer plot begins.  I again lost interest, however, near the end of the film.  Most of the antics the characters get into are cheesy and just plain dumb; i.e. started a bar fight, went to a strip club, did drugs and stuffed someone in an ice box, etc.<br /><br />The overall plot, aside from finding Teddy, was actually interesting, but the lame jokes and acting brought down the fun factor a lot.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Shows a lot of creativity, fun. Very polished. Great gameplay, music, effects. Plays great on my droid x. Only wish was that free play was unlocked earlier. Bravo!
0307341577|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted thriller, with an immensely believable and sympathetic heroine at its center.   I loved this book from beginning to end, and was riveted every step of the way.  If you love psychological suspense, it's a must!
193413712X|2.0|I like Beckett, so it wasn't the lack of plot in Tinkers that bothered me; many of my favorite books have little or no plot.  I grew up in the woods and love going back whenever I can, so it wasn't the extensive, long-winded descriptions of nature that bugged me.  I like Helprin and Nabokov and even David Foster Wallace just fine, so the sometimes far-fetched, whimsical prose isn't what got to me.    To be honest, I don't know what it is that got to me, but judging from the lackluster reviews on here, I'm guessing it ate at alot of other people too.  The story just doesn't seem to go anywhere or do anything.    You know those scenes in books that serve almost no purpose except to create a certain impression, cast off a certain glow?  They get boring after awhile, but you don't mind too much because they only show up every couple hundred pages, and hey, some of the imagery and word-choice is pretty cool?  Those scenes that you sort of drift off with at first, but after the first 10 pages or so, you start sighing and counting the page numbers?  This book is the longest of those scenes I've ever read, clocking in at 190 pages.    It's not horrible or painful or anything, just very very boring.  Every few pages, you realize that your mind drifted off 5 paragraphs ago and you have no idea what's happening, but get the feeling that it doesn't particularly matter, because the last time a character was mentioned was 10 pages ago, and everything since then has been description.  I first opened this up and found it really outdated and cliche; an entire book of a man reviewing scenes from his life as he lays on his deathbed?  Oh, and scenes of his father's life also interspersed?  I thought it sounded really cliche, but hey, it won the Pulitzer, so I figured he did something original with it, or at least brought some vigor back to the form.  He didn't.  Nothing in this book is vigorous or gripping in any way.  Not even interesting.  There are a handful of scenes that tug the heartstrings, but definitely not worth reading the whole thing.  It reads like some 200 year old book you had to read in high school, forging through page after page to find, at the end, that you don't know what happened... and didn't care.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is a very fun, addicting game. I would give it 5 stars, but it has a few small bugs.  The biggest one is that the volume levels are not saved between gaming sessions. I have disable sound every time I play.
B004SEVPWQ|3.0|I played this game all the time and was excited to see an update, but the quality went way down.  Menus are broken a little, was able to corrupt graphics by hitting back button, somehow managed to launch multiple instances. Suggest waiting to update, confident it will be fixed soon.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|My son and I watch this and were surprised at how well they made this movie. It was new to my son and he loved it. I was around when the ninja turtles came out. cough cough.....getting old
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This program came instalked by default on my evo 4g with no way to remove it.   At least give us a way to remove it so the people who don't want it can take it off.  What is the point in not giving us a remove option?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is definitley my new addiction. great graphic and useability. huge down load though. be sure to move to your sd card. love this game!
B0021L8V0M|1.0|At this point questioning whether I make any further purchases on Amazon, because of Moral Hazard!    The DVD Salt was sent to me, it was blank, there was nothing on the DVD.     Sent numerous email's, I have not received a reply! Nor a Refund! Nor a new movie!    So, at this point questioning whether this system actually has any purpose!     At the point I will no longer put my information on the site and considering withdrawing all together!
B004RQVVGU|5.0|Wow, this is spectacular. This is THE release of Diary of a Madman the fans having waited nearly 16 years for. Starting of, this is indeed the one and only original recordings of Ozzy Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake and Johnny Cook(keyboards for the inclined). The sound on this release is breath-takingly crisp, clear and amazing! This is indeed THE definitive version of this album. Never has Randy's screeching, blazing solos been so upfront, Bob's bass thumping amazingly on 'Tonight' and Lee's pounding drums on 'Little Dolls'. And if this wasn't enough, we get a brand 'new'(official) live album from the Blizzard of Ozz tour! This is exactly how to do the fans right! Ozzy, I and many of your fans thank you for this, thank you for getting it right and redeeming your best recording and the legacy that is Randy Rhoads!
0374531269|5.0|(MINOR SPOILER ALERT)    This book is a memoir of Ishmael Beah's life, who, as a child, was used as a tool of warfare. He describes an interesting story of how one day, his life is torn apart by warring factions. He recalls how he runs and runs, only to find himself eventually becoming part of this fight. He finds that the best way to vent his anger is to fight against the very people who killed his loved ones.     As for the writing style of this book, I am quite impressed. As a child that grew up with limited schooling in Sierra Leone, to have such emotional shocks, I consider him a gifted writer. To accurately describe this, I would say it is written as though he is telling his children, or a story at a campfire, focused on the story, not the writing style. He describes the entire process in great emotional depth. He describes the first time he kills, his nightmares and headaches. He tells a believable story of his recovery, and most importantly, of a very real issue going on in this world.     If you are looking for a book on personal struggles, and real world problems, and even if you just want a regular book to read, I highly recommend this book.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|If you are like me, and sick of the horrible metal coming out year after year by the same lame bands, Surtur Rising will put a smile on your face. This band is a kick in the face to the wannabe new metal bands and the old school hacks alike. It is True Metal. Period. Well Written, Well Recorded, with intelligent riffs and solid drumming. I have no clue why Liquid Metal does not play more Amon Amarth. Every time I try the channel I end up angry. Crap New Metal. Crap Old Metal. It is time for Amon Amarth to take the Throne...
0470876417|4.0|Business Model is an overused, but generally not a well-understood concept. A business model defines how a company would bring its resources to bear in profitably serving its customers with its products and services. A common understanding of a company's business model is critical in devising any strategy that has an enterprise impact. This book provides a visual language to define, capture, evaluate, and innovate business models. The book provides a handy template (called Business Model Canvas) to structure the discussion around the business model and is a very useful tool for anyone interested in providing a framework for business model discussions. It also describes structured design techniques that have visual appeals and can be used to design, explore, and innovate business models.The focus is on the essence of the business and its core building blocks (the book describes the nine building blocks of a business model). A good and easy read for anyone who is interested in learning the business model concepts and adding some practical tools to their toolbox.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth has to be one of the best movies ever made. You watch this movie with a smile glued to your face and then pair the movie with the book and you have a wonderful way to spend a weekend.  I can watch this movie and read the book over and over and still see/read something that I had missed the previous time. This is a classic in the first sense.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|First let me say that I'm not a fan of death metal, especially the vocals, but Amon Amarth is unlike any other metal band I have heard. I had listened to a couple of their songs online awhile back, but never got the guts to make a purchase. Seeing that Sultur Rising came with a three hour concert DVD with the CD for only $10, I had to give them a shot. So I bought their two most recent albums, Twilight of the Thunder God (which also comes with a concert DVD) and Sultur Rising, so I'll comment on the two of them and leave this review for both.<br /><br />What makes this band great is their melodic nature. How often do you find a really heavy band that you can hum to? The twin guitars and drumming are excellent on both albums. Now to the singing. This guy is the only harsh sounding singer I can take for more than one song. He has enough variation and \\"range\\" that fits perfectly with the guitar harmonies. Plus it helps that the guy looks like and sings about Vikings, so you can picture a war party on the march. I have to admit that it took me a couple of listens to fully appreciate his delivery, but once you get used to it you really can't picture it any other way.<br /><br />Of the two, I prefer Twilight of the Thunder God a little more because it's just so catchy. I also love the epic feel on just about every song. I've read some reviews claiming that the newest album, Sultur Rising, is more mellow, but I found it more harsh and heavy than Twilight, though it still retains many memorable pieces of melody. I mean \\"Destroyer of the Universe\\" and \\"A Beast Am I\\" are two of the fastest metal songs I have ever heard.<br /><br />The cover art is sweet on both, looking like something straight out of Conan the Barbarian. It just completes the whole package.<br /><br />The only tiny criticism would be that the 20 songs over these two albums have no real change in pace. Okay, you do have your mid-tempo, fast and really fast, but because the singer doesn't ever have a normal sounding singing voice there is no ability to sing in a different style. But this is minor because every song is still unique enough and I have yet to get bored.<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to report that Amon Amarth is definitely worth checking out and has now become one of my favorite metal bands. Oh, a special thanks to the reviewers on here that let me know what I was missing long before I finally listened to them.o ability to sing in a different style.

0140277447|5.0|Iris wrote this book in 1997 to remember the victims and survivors in this Japanese WW II atrocity.  It was a well written and researched book with multiple resources including documents from Tokyo Trial  to verify this massacre in the then Chinese capital.    However this atrocity was undercovered in the West and Iris shocked the moral conscience with this book to confront whitewash, distortion and denial by Japanese right wing politicians.    Germany made apology and paid compensation for Nazi looting and killing and moved on.    However, Japan still do not have the moral and courage to follow his war time axis friend but from time to time make remarks to stir up anger from Asian neighbors.    Should Japan be trusted with the seat of United Nation Security Council with un-repent war crimes?

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was written for me.. It must have been. No way could he capture all elements of my fantasy world so perfectly.  It's fast paced with a wonderful loose romantic element.  I love romance but I hate romance books.  This kept you on the edge of your seat NEEDING to know what would happen next and it didn't disappoint.  This book is compelling.. A must read for any fantasy lover out there

1579126235|5.0|Murder on the Orient Express (alternatively titled Murder in the Calais Coach) is one of Agatha Christie's best mysteries featuring Hercule Poirot, the detective with the egg-shaped head and the little gray cells (along with a big ego in a diminutive body). I find it difficult to rank books, but it is certainly one of Christie's top five Poirot mysteries. Murder on the Orient Express has everything a good mystery should have: a great plot, excellent characterization, a surprising d&eacute;nouement, and an interesting (albeit immodest!) detective.<br /><br />When it was first published, some critics grumbled that the solution wasn't fair. That wasn't the first time that critics complained about the d&eacute;nouement in a Christie mystery. Her earlier book, [[ASIN:1579126278 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)]], had many critics (and some readers) up in arms complaining that her solution was unfair. As far as I'm concerned, Dame Agatha always played fair; she just came up with unique and innovative solutions (and that's really what the critics and readers were objecting to).<br /><br />Murder on the Orient Express is an unusual Poirot mystery in other ways. It is told in third person narrative mode, while most other Poirot stories are narrated by Captain Hastings, Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Hastings invariably provides some comic relief as well. Never fear: there are a number of humorous moments to be found, even without Hastings.<br /><br />One of the marks of a good book is that it stands up to re-reading. This is particularly difficult with mysteries, since you usually will have remembered the solution. One of my pleasures is re-reading Christie's better works from time to time. Even knowing the solution, there remain nuances to be discovered.<br /><br />For my permanent collection, I have the Black Dog & Leventhal low-priced hardcover 2006 edition ([[ASIN:1579126235 Murder on the Orient Express: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)]]), which I recommend without reservation.<br /><br />I also highly recommend Sidney Lumet's marvelous 1974 screen adaptation, [[ASIN:B0002I832C Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express]]. Lumet and the all-star cast do justice to Dame Agatha's book. Just make sure you avoid the horrible 2005 made-for-TV remake ([[ASIN:B000BO0LLI Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express]]).

B0049OSQ18|5.0|I cannot say enough things about the hypnotic and melodic quality of this album.  There is not a throwaway track on \\"The King is Dead\\" and several songs are pure genius.  I've been listening to this album since January and each and every time it feels fresh and inspired.  In fact, I often find myself listening to it multiple times a day given its infectious quality.  \\"June Hymn\\" grabbed me from the first listen and my wife and I play hit the repeat button and listen to it 5-10 times at a clip.  Other standouts include \\"This is Why We Fight\\", \\"Don't Carry it All\\", \\"All Arise\\" and \\"Calamity Song\\".  Along with the Fleet Foxes, the Decemberists are one of my favorite bands and this album showcases them at their absolute best.

B0051QIGP4|2.0|What a disappointing follow-up album to the Fame and the Fame Monster.  There is nothing on this album that is original, unique or catchy like on the Fame.  Reasons why I think it chokes:  1. Write some lyrics rather than repeating the same words over and over  2. Stop ripping off other people's songs.  One sounds like Britney's \\"Gimme More\\" and another sounds like the chorus of \\"Shout at the Devil\\" by Motley Crue.  \\"You and I\\" sounds like a rehash of the Carrie Underwood hit, \\"Before He Cheats\\" crossed with Anna Nallick's, \\"Breath\\".  Let's not forget \\"Born this Way\\" being a huge Madonna rip-off.  There is nothing original or innovative on this CD.  3. Can you spell P-r-o-d-u-c-e-r?  It sounds like they spent an hour or less mixing and producing this CD.  It is sloppy at best.  4. Stop repeating your own name!  5. Is she trying to gain a country following?    TRY AGAIN!

B004X0Y5GI|5.0|the first time i listened to this album i thought 'wow, i waited 10 years for this?' i mean, i liked it. there were definately stand-out tracks. but there were also some i could care less to hear again. it seemed too simple and not 'big' enough. but after a a few listens, i got to the point (like any album by stevie nicks) were each and every song was a gem and i absolutely LOVED it. the album grew on me and looking back, i realized that EVERY stevie nicks album had to grow on me. including 'trouble in shangri-la,' which i still believe is her masterpiece. i love 'in your dreams' A LOT but it still isn't quite as good as 'shangri-la.'   anyway, my whole point is- stevie nicks' music is so unlike any other recording artist and so unique and sometimes downright weird (in a good way) that u need to hear it more than once to 'get' it, to understand it.      'EVERYBODY LOVES YOU' is a perfect example of that where in the first 30 seconds you get this awesome almost techno-ey laser sound, and then the song becomes a slow tempo love song with an electric guitar breakdown. that may sound a little too scattered, but it comes together beautifully in that weird 'stevie nicks' sort of way! it is definitely one of those songs i thought i'd not listen to again, but now i can't get enough of it. one of the best tracks on the cd.    the very best song on this album and in my opinion, one of stevie nicks' best songs ever (right up there with thrown down, gypsy. stand back, and fall from grace and illume- my faves) is the amazing song...    'MOONLIGHT (A VAMPIRE'S DREAM)' omg i have listened to this one song on repeat for weeks. i love it so much. this one song made the 10 years of waiting worth it. it starts off as the piano version of lady from the mountain, which most hardcore fans know. and the chorus is even better. it will suck you right in musically, lyrically, etc. you WILL be singing it to yourself aloud. ALL my coworkers know this song word for word and most of them have never actually heard it. this song has EVERYTHING that i love about stevie nicks in it. the last 2 minutes of it she does that 'thing' that only she can do. just going at it, unscripted, not 'trying' to sound a certain way. just 'doing it.'    'FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH-' another one that take me a few listens to 'get.' it's the second best track on the album. she does that thing where she harmonizes with herself via voice-over. god, i love it!!    'IN YOUR DREAMS,' the title track is next. at first i thought it was too predictable and had a 'heard-it-before' quality to it, but after a few listens, it's another one that you MUST sing along to. very reminiscent of 80's stevie nicks.    'MY HEART' i HATED the 'shangri-la' demo version of this song, but damn this finished version is catchy. so glad she saved it for this album. it would not have fit in on 'shangri-la' but it fits in BEAUTIFULLY to this one....love it, love it, LOVE IT!    'CHEAPER THAN FREE' is about as sweet as it gets. 'SOLDIER'S ANGEL' is about as dark as it gets. the chorus to 'NEW ORLEANS' is about as catchy as it gets.  'WIDE SARGASSO SEA' is one of those build-up songs where it starts kinda slow and the last 30 seconds of it are very powerful. and of course, 'SECRET LOVE' is exactly what i wanted to hear from stevie nicks. one of her perfect songs that has that cool, summery, mid-tempo feel. kinda like 'if you ever did believe' i guess. 'ITALIAN SUMMER' is about as cheesy romantic as it guess, and i do NOT mean that in a bad way. i love it. 'YOU MAY BE THE ONE' is something different. it took me a while, but now i can't hear it without singing along. 'ANNABEL LEE' drags on a little too long and it's not one of my faves, but it really is classic stevie nicks. nobody love stevie nicks more than i do but i gotta say i HATE the song 'GHOSTS ARE GONE!' omg it sounds like a bad zz top outtake. ugh! i dont wanna say anything bad about this album at all, but damn i hate this song! LOL sorry!  anyone who gave this album a low score, i BEG you to listen to it some more and really 'get' it. i'm not gonna say this is stevie nicks' best album ever but it is VERY good. it has been a month now and i still can't listen to anything else. it seems that every day there is a different song from this album stuck in my head. i just hope to GOD that she doesn't wait another 10 years........

0425242099|5.0|As a longtime fan of the Psy/Changeling series and Hawke and Sienna in particular, I was in heaven when this book hit the shelves.  Though I will say that readers MUST read the previous 9 books in this series to be able to truly appreciate this one.  Hawke was every bit as intense and sexy as I expected him to be and the loves scenes were *HOT* when they finally arrived toward the end of the book.  The action was intense, and catching up with previous characters was a lot of fun.  I would agree with readers who call this book Singh's 'love letter to her fans.'  My favorite parts include - when Hawke referred to Kit as \\"that baby cat alpha\\" and Sienna and Hawke together at the cabin.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone was had read and enjoyed the previous Psy/Changeling novels.

B004X2M3SI|4.0|Sci-Fi is an acquired taste and in general fails to live up to its possibilities. Doctor Who is aimed at children (of all ages) and yet manages to rise a little above the usual standard, with touches of pathos and occasional moments of real pain. Since the reboot, the series has selected excellent actors and the script writers have been equally above-par. Series 5 and 6 are especially interesting because they insert a young actor into the role of a 900+ year old time lord. Matt Smith does an excellent job of seeming to have very old eyes in a very young face, which makes his version of the Doctor particularly compelling. Now if only the BBC and Amazon could get their act together so that the view-on-demand version was released within a day or so of the BBC screening, we could all enjoy the episodes in a timely manner. As it is, at the time of writing this review, 5 days have passed since the most recent episode was screened on TV and still there's no sign of it on Amazon.

I'm so very glad that I bought this set as a 'Gold Box Deal of The Day' because otherwise I'd return them immediately for a refund.

B004KDO2G6|4.0|I purchased this Blue Ray partly on the existing review that gave it 5 stars.  Artistically he is right.  It is and amazing performence.  The problem is that the source video is not done to todays standards.  This concert was recorded in 2002.  The blue ray seems to be a conversion from a lower definintion recording.  Also the audio is not up to speed when compared to more recent recordings.  It just isn't up to the quality of the following Blue Ray Concerts.    1.    Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, Achucarro, London Symphony  2.    Beethoven Piano Concertos, Barenboim, Staatskapelle Berlin  3.    Herbert von Karajan Memorial Concert, Ozawa, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Berliner Philharmoniker    I would definately recommend this recording.  It is an amazing performance.    However, I will only give it 4 stars due to the less than superior video and audio quality.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|First and foremost, let me say that this review is nothing against Danny McBride and co.  McBride is one of my favorite comedic actors, I'm just disappointed this turned out the way it did.<br /><br />Because I'm sorry, but let's face it; this movie was NOT funny.<br /><br />I recall when I went to the theater to see this movie.  I was really stoked, I figured that two of the guys and the director from Pineapple Express--set in medieval times--would be a riot!  I was wrong, though.  I can't recall a single person in the screening that laughed even once... except for two people in the back.  During one scene.  That was in the trailer.  It was actually painful to sit through.<br /><br />I can't think of anything redeeming about this crapfest comedy revolving around some lazy prince and his brother (McBride and James Franco, respectively) going on a journey to kill some sorcerer or something.  And Natalie Portman's in there somewhere.  She even had an attitude in her performance that screamed \\"where's my damn paycheck already?\\"  So's that Zooey Deschanel chick.  Pretty to look at, but by the end of the movie no one cares about her, not even the writers.<br /><br />It's an awful, awful movie.  Please avoid it at all costs.<br /><br />EDIT:  By the way, I really don't get why this review received so many unhelpful votes--when quite frankly every one-star review after mine basically said the same thing.

1410427188|3.0|On the heels of her early days as a trend-setting shopaholic, Becky Bloomwood Brandon is back as a wife and young mother of a toddler, Minnie.<br /><br />Still living with her mum and dad after the financial difficulties from the past, Becky hopes that she and Luke can finally own their own home.  And she longs to convince him to try for a sibling for Minnie.<br /><br />But meanwhile, she wants to throw a big, splashy surprise party for Luke in April, on his birthday.<br /><br />Most of the fun of this book is watching Becky clamor about, trying to pull off the party of the century without spending much money--while acknowledging environmental issues--and still bringing something fabulous to the event.<br /><br />Otherwise, the story shows us the same superficial Becky who blunders along, displaying no signs of maturity or growth.  And even though Luke often seems annoyed by her addictive ways, he is more like a benevolent and amused accomplice.  Even a bit oblivious and condescending.  Then again, there may be some signs that Becky has learned one or two things from her mistakes, but any insight or growth are not in evidence when she deals with her two-year-old.  The child screams \\"miiine\\" at every turn, in what has to be a rather grating fashion for anyone standing nearby.  Any attempts on Becky's part to rein her in fall flat.<br /><br />At one point, a Nanny Consultant spends time with Becky and Minnie,(at Luke's request), and most assuredly should have concluded that Minnie is a brat.  Instead, her remarks sum Minnie up as \\"bright\\" and \\"feisty.\\"  In what universe?<br /><br />Luckily, most of [[ASIN:0385342055 Mini Shopaholic: A Novel (Shopaholic Series)]] focuses in on the party planning efforts and near-misses, which are quite hilarious.  And I thought that the part Luke's very stiff and haughty birth mother played in pulling things off was a nice glimpse beneath one woman's cold façade.<br /><br />So, yes, fans of the Shopaholic series may enjoy this one, just as I did.  But if anyone is expecting Becky to have \\"bloomed\\" into a mature person, you'll be disappointed.  Three stars.t as I did.

0439023513|3.0|I'm slightly disappointed that Collins didn't sustain the momentum she generated in the first two Hunger Games books (for me, at least; I realize that my opinion isn't shared by everyone, and that's fine). Something about the structure of the store (so brilliant in the first book) seemed a bit sloppy this time. Mysteries that could have been stretched out a little longer for better suspense were revealed too quickly; and ones that should have been revealed earlier so we could appreciate some new revelation were held too long. I don't know if that's what caused me to be less invested in the characters than I was in the first books or if the characters just weren't clicking with me, but I didn't get into them as much.    All that said, I still did enjoy the read. Collins has a wonderful imagination and it's cool to just sort of wonder through it, taking in the sights. I've read some reviews that said the writing was bad. Except for the structure and maybe the characters (biggies, I know), I didn't find that. On a sentence-to-sentence level, she's a talented writer (and as evidenced on the first two books, on every level she is). Bottom line: If you enjoyed the first two books as I did, how could you NOT read this one, even if it's not quite as spectacular as its predecessors?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Is it a 100% perfect port? No. Is it fun and affictive? Yes. I recommend it highly. Especially while it is half off.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Played and to.fished this on the PC but still love this on my phone.  Great sound, cute graphics and a great, deep time killer.
B004RKXN44|4.0|I love the author, Nalini Singh, and the entire Psy/Changeling Series so far.  I have read all the books to date (and actually love the Guild Hunter series as well).  I think Nalini Singh brings a lot of depth and complexity and wonderful heartfelt (serious tearjerker) moments to her series.  I've been waiting for this book to come out and it did deliver.  With the build-up in the series between the SnowDancer Alpha, Hawke, and the X-Psy, Sienna, I definitely expected to read about how the numerous relationship challenges along with the continued build-up of tensions between the Changelings and the Psy would be addressed.  And, the book definitely delivered on both in a way that strengthens both the Hawke and Sienna characters.  I do think though that given how long we've waited for the story to unfold, I was probably expecting maybe a little too much.  While nothing in the book disappointed me, it was more that I think I just expected more simply because I have enjoyed the series to date, and there were some that definitely stood out more than this particular story.  I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series.
1591843790|4.0|[[VIDEOID:moYQDYCG2Q85IN]]What this reviewer got out of Guy Kawasaki's \\"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions\\" was an unmistakable sense of deja vu -- I've read this before, and it was by a guy named Dr. Robert Cialdini. To the prolific Kawasaki's credit, he gives due credit to inspirations such as Cialdini and \\"Made to Stick\\" authors Chip Heath and Dan Heath.<br /><br />Fans of this genre, and perhaps anyone who's only read Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, may wonder what the big deal is with this book, besides the fact it was written by Guy Kawasaki (his name even gets more prominent billing than the title).<br /><br />I'd answer that it benefits from Kawasaki's positioning as a technology expert, author, and venture capitalist. Many of the technologies that a person can use to vastly magnify his or her influence weren't even around when the other authors' books were written. Kawasaki, on the other hand, lives and breathes social media/Web 2.0, and therefore provides a helpful modern twist -- especially if books on influence and persuasion typically \\"aren't your thing.\\"<br /><br />So, should you get it? Watch the video and decide for yourself!
1932100660|5.0|An Amazing book.  Some I knew about, but a lot I didn't know.  I only learned about this study and the book recently while watching Dr. Oz show, which I rarely miss.  There is so much that is kept from the public.  Our media either doesn't know or won't talk about all these things regarding our health, the role that the big pharmaceutical companies play in our healthcare and politics, which is behind a lot of it.  It's time for some compassion and honesty in this country and big corporate greed to die a much needed death, instead of us dying so that they can get rich.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I used this both to program a HAM radio (under Windows XP and 7), and also to control an old UPS (under Mac OS X and Linux), and it worked flawlessly every time. I now keep an extra one in my laptop case or whenever I happen to run into something that needs to be programmed via serial. The cable is reliable, durable, and inexpensive- a perfect combination!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun game for the cheap price in my opinion. I haven't ran into any adverse effects of running this app. Runs perfectly on my samsung epic 4g.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I just got this today and tested it out with my crappy Hesh headphones. They made a small improvement in the sound on the flat. On bass boost they made the Heshes  great  for cheap headphones.    I really got this for the AKG K240 MkII headphones, I also got Which are Awesome.   They are my First real headphones and I am very happy with them. They are heavier on bass than the K701 and I like that. The amp works just right for them. It is wonderful because it's small. Other amps are much better but are a pain to carry around and I wanted to listen in the car and on airplanes not just when making music.
B004R0WKNE|4.0|I originally decided to watch this movie because of Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford but didn't really expect much.  I was happily surprised at how much I liked it - sweet, uplifting and funny enough that some bits had me laughing out loud.  I've never seen Rachel McAdams before, but her enthusiasm in the movie was convincing enough to pull me along and make me smile throughout the whole thing.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It took how many years to port this from iOS?!? Come on Popcap, get your act together and re-code this for a multitasking OS! The game doesn't need to pause every 10-30 seconds just because my phone received notifications in the background.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game plays great.  The graphics could be higher res but they are ok, however after playing the game for about 30min the game starts to slow down eventually causing the phone to lock up causing you to have to pull the battery.  I think the game has a memory leak.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Flawless on EVO 4G. Seriously needs move to SD tho. 80mb! odd that amazon requires a long review.....Hrm almost there..
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game...it works really well on the Samsung Epic, have had no problems with it slowing down or anything...love it!
142311339X|5.0|I was a bit worried when I first picked this book up. How could Riordan top Percy and the Olympians? However, he definitely lives up to the quality of the books he has written before. The Lost Hero is certainly a different style (no more first person perspective from Percy for one), but Riordan maintains his humor and how extremely engaging every book he writes is. I both couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what was going to happen, but I also never wanted it to end because it was so extremely entertaining and fun to read.    It's different from the first series, but at LEAST as good. I really cannot wait for the next book! If you enjoyed Percy Jackson and the Olympians, read this one. It's well worth it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|As far as the game goes, it's one of the best balanced with an amazing atmosphere. the graphics could be a little better being in 2011 with it now.  I wish it had a resume feature when the game is removed from memory though. I'm using a Nexus S (2.3.4) with 512mb of RAM. I receive a call in the middle,l and pick it up. when I try going to back to PvZ, it erases all the progress I just made. this has happened every time.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|Nice to have a digital copy of how it all began.  I remember seeing the LP version as a young teenager and thinking who are these guys?  Little did I know what would transpire!  They defined a generation.  Now if I could only find the orginal LP.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I did this video for 3 weeks solid, along with adjusting my diet and walking more during the day. I definitely felt healthier from doing it and was able to do better as I went along. However, I definitely did not shred the \\"pounds\\" that I wanted to. I am going to keep doing it but think I need to mix up my exercise routines in order to loose weight. I do like that it's only 20 minutes (about 25 with warm-up and cool-down). That's better than doing nothing! Though, it'd be nice if the video had a longer routine as an option so that you could get some extra exercise in when you have the time.
B004LUS390|5.0|This is an excellent app for drawing and being creative.  There are plenty of tools to choose from and the editing controls are very intuitive.  Works great on my HTC Thunderbolt.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|this is my new favorite book. i was reading all day everyday wanting the book to go the right way. its a sad yet thrilling novel.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This version seems to run smoother (on my Evo) than it did on iOS. I now own this game on PC, iPod DS and Android, it's great and I recommended it to anyone not just &quot;casual gamers&quot;! Even if you've never played a tower defense game you will be hooked!
B000000JO3|5.0|This is an album every punk fan needs to own.  This album is pure, unadulterated fury.  Minor Threat realesed most of their music on 7 Inches and this is their entire recorded output on one album.  Minor threat created a lifestyle, and in my eyes( heh,heh ) helped define a genre.  This album is to hardcore as what Reign In Blood was to thrash. To some people ,the lyrics may seem \\"adolescent\\" but they are as honest and sincere as you can get.  You can tell Ian wasn't putting up any fronts.  He means everything he is singing about and he does so with a ferocity that is hard to come by.  The Straight Edge lifestyle is something I stand for even after that moron CM Punk almost ruined it for everyone.  I can relate to everything Ian says in \\"Guilty Of Being White\\",\\"In My Eyes\\",\\"Seeing Red\\",and \\"I Don't Wanna Hear It\\" especially.  The cover of The Monkees \\"I'm Not Your Steppin Stone\\" is the best cover of that song and that song has been covered by everyone, including the Sex Pistols.  People who say that Minor Threat were a politcal band are wrong: Minor Threat adressed issues in society and life in general. This is an amazing collection by an amazing band.  And for those of you that don't like it...<br /><br />\\"Pay No Mind To Us, We're Just A Minor Threat!!!

0756404738|2.0|Let's get something out of the way.  Patrick Rothfuss is a good writer, but he isn't half as good as he is made out to be.  The name of the Wind was one of my favorite books of the last ten years,so it is really too bad that Rothfuss has fallen in love with his own prose to this extent.  This is a good (flirting with great) story that is too often interupted with horrible 'grandiose' tales and stories in which Rothfuss rambles on with cliche after cliche.  IF you don't understand what that means, you will understand my feeling after finishing ten pages of a mind-numbing legend told from an omnipotent point of view, that doesn't really contribute anything to teh story.  It is obvious that Rothfuss has trouble working under a normal deadline.  This is a disapointment after such a wait!  He is really just coasting on an incredible story he generated in the first book.  Still required reading for fans of the first novel, but I hope to hell he turns this trainwreck around for book three.....
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I knew absolutely nothing about this game before downloading it, but now I can't put it down! The attention to detail is amazing, and some of the dialogue literally made me laugh out loud :-)
B004KD5TQI|5.0|I loved loved this movie, and part of the reason I enjoyed it so much was the incredible soundtrack.  Emily Browning (Babydoll) sings on several songs and I enjoyed everyone of them.  If you liked this movie, you should get this soundtrack.
0316098329|1.0|Not only was Room a slow-moving book, with a jumpy plot and an unclear problem/resolution set as well as no real excitement or action, but it was also inappropriate and, for lack of a better word, at times disgusting.  Unnecessary descriptions of genitalia, like \\"silly penis\\" and, more disturbingly, Bronwyn, were unnerving.  The descriptive breast feeding was also disturbing.  There is little to no emotion in the book, surprising for a story on what seems like a highly emotional subject.  I also kept finding myself waiting for that moment where the story climaxes, but it never came.  All in all, Room drug on from the very first sentence to the very last, and I'm no better a person for having read it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs Zombies is a very addictive arcade game.     The objective is to put plants which will defend you against Zombies in your yard. After 3 days of playing in the free time, I'm about 3/4s through, but then there are extra achievements.  The game has funny elements built in, such as the help menu - click it if you haven't yet.     It works very well on the Nexus S, but seeing that it slows down a bit when you put a lot of plants and sunflowers, which might hint that it needs a quite powerful phone to work well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am NOT an arcade game player, but games like this could easily make me one. Awesome! You never quite know what is coming next in this game and the creativity never stops.
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|American Beauty sits in my top ten movies of all time box. I'm not a movie critic, just an ordinary American movie-goer. There are certain things that I look at about a movie in order to rate it. Did it make me think? Do I remember it long after I've seen it? Does it evoke a strong emotion (happy, sad, fear, etc.) Do I want to see it again and again and when doing so, do I tire of it? Is it visually stimulating? American Beauty is off the charts in each of those categories. It resonates with you long after it's over. It just simply is an absolute must-see movie. Kevin Spacey is such an incredibly gifted actor, as is Annette Benning. Kevin Spacey has the distinction of being in 2 of my top ten movies of all time box, the other being Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. If you have not had the pleasure of seeing American Beauty yet, it is well worth your time.
1601251505|1.0|I expected more from a game that's even jokingly referred to as 3.75 and yet got the barest upgrade to an open license and had to actually pay for it. A couple of the problems:<br /><br />Caster supremacy remains completely unchanged. Oh, sure, a couple Save Or Die spells were toned down, but that in no way actually solved the problem. As a quote, \\"The traditional adventuring party has four people, filling the roles of Meat-Shield, Skill-Monkey, Heal-Bitch, and Batman.  You're--as Frank Miller put--the goddamn Batman.\\" In a game revolving around party-based combat and social interactions this is absolutely terrible.<br /><br />The Fighter actually got a downgrade in the form of many feats being split up into several feats to get the same effect. And they're still no more useful without  Grappling is one of the best ways to fight, but without a caster to increase your size you will be completely unable to grapple a huge portion of mid-to-high level creatures.<br /><br />If you want to pay a company for an open license game that they haven't improved at all, well, that's your money. I'll pass.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally they put this game on Android the game runs greatnesses the graphic's are good and best of all got it for free thanks Amazon runs perfect on my DROID X. with gingerbread thanks to the ota update
B0052UZIFA|5.0|So happy to see this game come to Android. The game is entertaining and well worth getting. Only complaint I have is that the animation of the new seed you get after a level seems a tad jittery/slow (experienced it on both my phone and tablet) - not enough to dock any stars though
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is just as addictive as angry birds. I hope that levels keep getting add frequently. Now bring us peggle.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best games for the android phone. I am fully addicted to it, it plays just like the pc version and really transitions well to the mobile device.
0374525153|4.0|\\"Reunion\\" is beautifully written, with some passages reading almost like poetry. That may seem strange for a novella focused on the events of World War II and its impact on two particular friends. In some ways, it reminded me of [[ASIN:0743253973 A Separate Peace]]. The story involves two boys at a school for boys. They become friends despite their differences and then there is an act of betrayal. All of this occurs on the eve of World War II. In the case of \\"Reunion,\\" it was particularly nice, for a change, to get a feel for the German countryside and way of life in the years before Hitler's rise.<br /><br />Still, I wish the author had chosen to lengthen the story, for the last third of the novella seemed to be a too-quick summary and it brought me up short. After dawdling in the description of pre-war Germany and particularly the lengthy build-up to the friendship between the sixteen-year-old Jewish boy, Hans, and the similarly aged Konradin, a Protestant son of a prominent Swabian family, I wasn't prepared for the quick shifts that followed.<br /><br />In any case, for a story that gets at the heart of the tragedy of World War II without making the reader wallow in its evils, Reunion is well worth the short time required to read it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This apps works geat on my galaxy tab. The game is great and helps to kill time while you wait or lose a lot if time if you just keep playing, I got it when it was free, but even at the introduction or regular price it is worth it.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|A third of the way through this book I was ready to put it down.  I couldn't imagine the plot ever developing and I wondered why the author was going into such detail about Jack and Ma's daily life in Room.  Then when they escape and begin their \\"fresh start\\" I was totally hooked.  Seeing the world through the eyes of a five-year old who has no understanding of the world and how it operates was mesmerizing.  I didn't want the book to end.  A sequel to this would be extraordinary - seeing Jack's life later and looking back at how he developed and how he and Ma's relationship changed as he \\"grew up\\" in the world.
B003UESJHE|5.0|The last time I saw a movie that won an Oscar for best picture was Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. I haven't taken the Oscars seriously since then. However, The King's Speech truly deserves its Oscar. The acting - not just Colin Firth's but the entire cast's - represents the epitome of good acting. The actors play their characters just right, with an appropriate amount of subtlety and emotion. The cinematography is also unique and makes excellent use of close-up shots. It's also an absolutely superb story, made all the more fascinating by the fact that it is based on historical events. It just proves yet again that the most interesting stories are often those that have actually happened. In short, this is perhaps the best movie I've seen since Lord of the Rings, and certainly worth the Oscar hype.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|Becky always finds problems. Always. As frustrating as she can be, I always find myself coming back to the next book. It's no different here.

B001AGHC1I|5.0|I've been a fan of the indie melodies of Sigur Ros for many years now. I don't think I've ever been disappointed in a single album. This album, while continuing in the tradition of hauntingly beautiful melodies, driving build-ups and complex orchestral layering, moves stronger than any of their past albums as wholes.    To sum it all up, gosh, I love this album.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|the game is fun but for the second time it deleted all my progress.  went to continue from the roof and it started me back from the first level.  also, this game still allows the screen to timeout if not touched.  it is annoying have to watch the load animation over and over again.  please fix these two problems and make your game awesome
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This drama, starring Clint Eastwood, and directed, produced, and partially written by him, is properly advertised as \\"the performance of a lifetime.\\" It is undoubtedly one of the best films. The story is about an elderly man, an award winning veteran of the Korean War, an atheist, who has never been found contentment in life, whose wife just died, and who, knowing her husband's problems, asks a young parish priest to look after him. He lives in a neighborhood that has changed, surrounded by Orientals who he calls gooks, whom he doesn't understand and dislikes intensely. He is very possessive of what he has and wants to be left alone. He becomes involved with his neighbors when they are attacked by a gang. Everything about the film is great, the story, plot development, acting, pacing, suspense, scenery.<br /><br /> Viewers can be stimulated to ask lots of questions about the many issues raised in the film. These include: the problems of growing old, death of a spouse, illness among the aged, getting along with children, grandchildren, and neighbors, handling neighborhood gangs, prejudice, bad and belittling language, finding meaning in life, the existence of life after death, the impact of wars and killing, revenge, are clergy equipped to address problems they never faced. Most significantly is the issue of change: can an irascible discontented elderly man, who has no ability to interact with his own family, find meaning and love from strangers?

There are only 2 songs that are even worth a mention, Lotus Flower and Give Up The Ghost. it is the only 2 that are even semi similar to Kid A or OK Computer.

0439882826|2.0|I read the 1 star reviews about the batteries not working and the light sabres not lighting up, but I decided to take my chances since there were more good reviews than bad. I was wrong. One of the batteries was corroded. I want to know what happens when people send the books back...do they just re-wrap it and send it off to yet another unsuspecting parent and hope that they just keep the book despite not working properly? I have ordered a replacement and I hope they open it and make sure it is working before they send it, otherwise the next time I will want my money back. Glad I checked it before giving it to my grandson. He sure would have been very disappointed.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I am very glad I decided to buy the Garmin 405CX.  The HRM function works great- no issues and the GPS feature works really well too.  I usually only have to wait about 20-40 seconds for the satellites to become located....sometimes if I am indoors it doesn't located very well (like in my apartment or in the gym I go to) although the GPS function isn't as important to me if I am just indoors on an elliptical machine so that is not really a big deal.  When I go running outdoors or go bicycling- the GPS fuction works great!  I also love how the Garmin 405CX imports the information onto my computer on the Garmin website- i can look back at all my workouts, it tells how many calories I burned, average HR, average Speed, and it google maps my whole route!  It is a great tool for keeping track of my workouts!!    I am a petite women and I find the size/weight of the watch is good.  It is not too heavy or too big on my wrist.  Just perfect!  My only complaint is that the bezzel feature isn't the best.  It is pretty sensitive so sometimes it changes displays when I don't want it too.  The bezzel isn't a reason to not buy this product though- I just want to point out that it isn't as \\"up-to-date\\" in technology with my ipod or iphone....Just wanted to mention this to \\"technology guru's\\" though so that you aren't overly critical if you purchase.      Overall- great product and very, very glad I bought it!

Jo Nesbo is a master in this aspect of the genre and Don Bartlett is an exceptionally talented translator who makes The Snowman seem like a novel originally written in English.<br /><br />The Snowman is the fifth Harry Hole novel to be translated into English, and fans of the series are in for a treat. The book opens with one perspective on how a criminal mind was shaped . . . and then fills in the consequences through a series of crimes and the police investigations.<br /><br />While the book primarily takes the form of a police procedural, there is enough threat, risk, and exposure to also enjoy the book as a thriller where no one is truly safe.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book's finest quality is in its careful character developments that leave you with quite a complete sense of the book's major and many of the minor characters. The result is to bring the reader into the story in ways that make the action more gripping.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of longer police procedurals, this one didn't drag. Mr. Nesbo has a great talent for keeping his story line spare. Even what appear at first to be red herrings serve deeper story needs.<br /><br />If you haven't read the other Harry Hole books, I don't advise you to start with this one. There's some history involving a few of the characters that's best appreciated by having read the books in the order of their publications (The Redbreast, Nemesis, The Devil's Star, The Redeemer, and The Snowman).<br /><br />If you have read the four earlier Harry Hole novels, but not this one, I recommend The Snowman as a great choice for your vacation reading this summer. You may sleep better, however, if you read it during the daytime.have read the four earlier Harry Hole novels, but not this one, I recommend The Snowman as a great choice for your vacation reading this summer.

B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I just finished catching up with Doctor Who. I hadn't seen a complete season of David Tennant's run. More or less, about the first half of season 2 and 3. I think I had seen one or two of the early episode's of season 4. I still think seasons 2 and 3 are kinda so/so. But with season 4 the writing really improved, and so did David Tennant's performance as a result. Previously, I really hadn't liked it. But he acquit himself admirably in season 4. And Catherine Tate made for a great comedic foil for him, but also one with a surprising amount of pathos as well. Thing about season 4 though is, (especially towards the 2nd half) so much of it depends on prior knowledge of seasons 2 and 3. The lore established really comes into play, and for those in the know, they are richly rewarded. Whether it could stand on it's own apart from that or not, well, I kinda doubt. I would hesitate to recommend it on it's own, but the prior seasons really don't hold a candle to it. It's an investment. One in which, eventually, you'll be richly rewarded.

B0000ADY9I|5.0|Don't be fooled by the other versions, this is THE ONE to get. The Fillmore Concerts is interesting if you want to hear alternative versions, mixes and such but you really can't beat the original and this is the original with some nice additional songs recorded around the same time at the same place making for one nice long two disc set. As far as the performances, they're all top notch and as close to \\"definitive\\" as you can get while the Eat A Peach and Anthology songs fit in well on here.
0385342039|5.0|I have read all books written by Sophie Kinsella, this one did not disappoint. I read it in one day. Its a fun story, unlike any I have read from this author or another recently. The character's are fun, smart, witty and a joy to read. This is a great summer read. Enjoy.
B003VSVWA0|3.0|As a long time, and deeply religious fan that worships the words this man has put together over his lifetime, I feel worthy of critiquing [[ASIN:B003VSVWA0 Songs From The Road (CD/DVD)]]. (It could be part of a collection worth millions someday.) But our friend Mr. Cohen sounds tired. There is an occasional tweet to his voice (meaning a songbird tweet). The songs are our favorites, always have been, always will be, no matter how it gets mixed. Some chords just never escape you. And the words and chords of this man's life have more than fulfilled us all with hope, with logic, with religion, even with deep, deep sorrow. He is a poet of our time, not as great as old Bill Yeats maybe, but time will tell...    I was happy to have purchased this CD because I want to support the artists I love, but when I first listened to it, the fire, the passion, was just not there. I thought it would be a shame if someone new to Leonard Cohen first experienced this rendition. They would not be pulled into the world, the life, the experiences Leonard Cohen experienced, and more importantly, the visions he shared with us all in song. His greatest \\"later years\\" work is [[ASIN:B001RTP3YQ Live In London]]. He shined with that collection, and in person (no doubt), and on the DVD, CD and even YouTube. (Would've liked to have been at that concert!)    But, you know, the man is a singing machine. He deserves to sit some dances out. And once again, I'm happy to have this CD, I'm happy to have lived in the age of Leonard Cohen. He told/tells our story better than just about anyone. He tells it with music, the magical turnkey to our souls. He has always been on the pulse of what was truly going on in the world, not every body DOES know. Leonard is here to remind us.     What inspired me most to buy this CD were titles that I did not recognize (imagine), which is all the more reason to have them to add to my collection from the golden voiced bard singing from the tower of song.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|I used this arm to mount a 23\\" LCD monitor to my desk.  Despite the fact that I have a fairly deep desk, I was able to use the clamp bracket, because of the generous 20\\" reach.  The interchangable grommet mount is a nice option to have if I ever need it.  The arm is very solid and sturdy and allows a full range of motion and adjustment.  While the movement feels a bit stiff, this is understandable when considering that the arm will hold a large monither with little or no movement or vibration--where you set it is where it stays.  I've noticed a few complaints about having to push the release button on the arm to move it up or down, but this is a very small drawback given the practically endless adustments you can make by tilting the monitor side to side, up and down, swivel left and right, move in and out, and rotate the monitor in either direction, all by simply grabbing the monitor an moving it where you want it.  This feature, along with the very solid feel of all of the hardware, and overall styling and good looks, make this a bargain compared to other arms costing $100+.  I love everything about this arm and it exceeded my expectations in every aspect.
0307474275|3.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this work.  I don't care much about the debates over accuracy or religious viewpoints.  In the end, I found the story to be thrilling and the plot to be compelling.  That is enough for me, for now.

1586487981|5.0|The state of the professional debate in development cooperation - a form of social engineering ultimately aimed at the eradication of extreme poverty - shows some resemblance to the situation in medicine in the early 19th century. Increasingly it is possible to rely on objective data on how things work, but that type of knowledge finds it hard to be on the forefront of a debate that is still highly ideological and political. This does not mean that in development cooperation anything goes. It simply means that the profession has yet to gain the upper hand on charlatans and quakes that sometimes seem to dominate the debate. The profession in other words lacks a comprehensive system for the collection of hard data and conclusions and the identification of what works and what does not work. It thus also does not yet have a system to weed out ideological statements based on journalistic `evidence'.  Worse, the little scientifically tested information  that is available has a tendency to remain or disappears in unnoticed corners.<br /><br />Less than ten years ago Abhijit  Bannerjee and Esther Duflo created the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab which is dedicated to a type of testing that is one of the bedrocks of modern medicine: randomized testing.  That in itself is a small revolution in an area where regression analysis and testing of single interventions still rule. Regression analysis can flesh out general tendencies, but often times the secret is in the structure and the historical path and by aggregating you lose that. Single interventions or case studies suffer from the fact that they provide empirical evidence of initial assumptions that may or may not be relevant. Furthermore they are only one story or a group of similar stories that may or may not be externally consistent. Finally, and most damning, these case studies are being often presented and/or researched by parties that have a vested interest in them.  Randomized testing is more trustworthy that case-studies since it challenges prior assumptions, but is also suffers from a similar weakness: the findings may be internally consistent, but translating the results to other areas and times is a challenge. That however is no argument not to undertake those studies, the more so since over time the accumulation of these studies, perhaps with the help of regression analysis, may provide sufficient data to establish external consistency.<br /><br />And sufficient and hard data already are available as witnessed in this book. The book is full of findings that provide insights that transcend  the current debate on poverty.  Combining micro-economics with randomized experiments the writers approach to the issue of poverty is refreshing. In the process they provide insight and meaning to the many perplexing and contradictory phenomena even a casual observer of poverty is confronted with.  They show why poor people that get more income actually eat less, why they do not use the many services provided for them, why they are reluctant entrepreneurs, why life is so much more challenging for poor people than rich people, etc. etc. Just to survive poor people need to have a resilience that almost seems super-human. Anyone interested in poverty in general and/or specifically in issues pertaining to hunger, health, education, family planning, micro-credits, saving, entrepreneurship and institutional development should not miss this book.<br /><br />To summarize, a groundbreaking book that could lift the debate on development and development to a higher professional level and a must read for anyone truly interested in the actual nature of being poor and the challenges poverty poses to the poor.

B002ZG997C|5.0|This is a movie that just makes you think and wonder in a good way.  I haven't seen a Denzel Washington movie in a long time that was not well acted.  This is a story about a man after some sort of holocaust that has a book he believes he is \\"destined\\" to deliver to the right place.  Not my typical interpretation of man with a \\"mission from God\\"; but, if you believe He's spoken directly to you how do you not deliver?  The movie does not preach, or I didn't perceive it to.  Only part I didn't like is that the first 10 or 20 minutes of film is so dark (as in night with no lights) that I had difficulty understanding what was actually happening.  I'm glad I bought it and can watch it several times to make sure I got all of the message it is trying to send.

B004LWZW42|5.0|Well I just got home from the midnight showing of this movie and I have to unequivocally state that this movie definitely re-boots the entire X-Men franchise especially after the extremely poor showings of [[ASIN:B000HCO83Q X-Men: The Last Stand]] and [[ASIN:B002CMLIJ6 X-Men Origins: Wolverine]], which by the way are responsible for almost destroying the franchise. However, this movie here does an outstanding job of introducing us loyal fans to a lot of the early characters in the X-Men universe. Most notably of course, Professor X and Magneto who are both portrayed very well by the respective actors who portrayed them, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. We also get introduced to Emma Frost, The Beast, Havoc, Banshee, Azazel, Riptide, Mystique, Angel, and Darwin. Also be on the lookout for an awesome cameo from everyone's favorite Canucklehead.<br /><br />Now I am not big into posting spoilers, so I will try to be as vague as I can yet still give you a good overview of this film.<br /><br />The movie takes place during two different time periods, during World War II and during the Cuban Missile Crises of the early 60's. Both time periods are used extremely well in the telling of the story, although they don't truly jive with the comics. Kevin Bacon does a pretty good job of playing Sebastian Shaw, leader of the Hellfire Club, although I was a bit disappointed in that since it could have been done a lot better in showcasing the other members of the club and their purpose, and it would have only added perhaps a couple of minutes to the movie.<br /><br />Sebastian Shaw already has some mutants siding with him as he intends to create a situation where mutants will take over the Earth. Meanwhile, Charles and Eric team up together with several other mutants in hopes of thwarting Shaw's attempts and world domination. There are a lot of great scenes which help to develop some of the characters, most notably Magneto, Mystique, and Professor X, but other characters don't get very much development of their characters, so non-X Men fans might tend to be a bit lost as far as some of the characters go. But this is merely a minor annoyance.<br /><br />Were there any bad parts to this movie? Yes, there were a couple, most notably the character of the Beast could have been done a bit better as I thought he was to much of a whiner and I don't remember him being as such from the comics. Also I had a bit of a problem with Angel, which I always thought was a man by the name of Warren Worthington III, not some stripper. But hey, I haven't read the comics in awhile (I know, shame on me) so maybe I am missing something.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves the X-Men and I certainly hope that a follow-up film is in the making.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVDs.ir characters, so non-X Men fans might tend to be a bit lost as far as some of the characters go.

It was not believable and the characters lacked depth. I was bored and certainly didn't really care about Walter, Patty, Eliza, or anyone else in the story. But I'm not a quitter, so on I went. The whole time I was thinking, \\"WHERE did I get this recommendation??\\" and \\"I could write better than this!\\" So really, find something else to do with a week's spare time. It's time I can't get back.
0143117009|5.0|In Collapse, Jared Diamond successfully examined the thousands of year of human history, by evaluating many of the great civilizations that went extinct due to their inability to recognize the limits of their resources and the strength of the forces of nature. The failures of those ancient and modern societies especially in Africa and Asia, as well the Easter Island and Greenland stemmed from the fact that they were compromised by their environment through disasters that were either natural or induced.     In this well-researched book, Diamond wrote of eco-disasters and the depletion of environmental resources through unsustainable measures as the principal causes of the demise of those societies. Not only that, he mentioned some societies that that have solved their ecological problems and succeeded. Nevertheless, the overriding point Diamond made is that in this age of globalization, societies must take collective actions to avoid the collapse of the world's highly interdependent global economy, since it is fast approaching its unsustainable level. This book is a wake up call for the world to develop sustainable sources of energy that does not compromise the environment. Hydrogen cars, solar energy etc should be things for the immediate tomorrow.     The lesson is clear. Those societies that can adapt their ways of life to be in line with the potentials of their environment last while those societies that abuse their resources ultimate commit suicide and become part of history. It is a phenomenon I read in the Union Muzhik, a book on the fallout of the Soviet Union.  Now, for the first time in human history, modern technology, global interdependence and international cooperation have provided us with the means and opportunity to judiciously use our resource and prevent their depletion not only from a small scale, but from a global scale as well. It is only by harnessing this new knowledge to sustain our planet, that we shall avoid the fate of self-destruction, like several great societies before us. I like reading deep and moving books.
B00466H3DG|4.0|If you have ever been in a crappy relationship or had a bad break-up, you are aware of the recovery time and the sadness that may accompany it. What if there was the possibility to map the memory areas of the brain that relate specifically to these relationships and that you could wipe them clean like a new hard drive? On first thought, if my health insurance covered it, I'd have no memory of those breakups and life would be grand. But what about my second thought? Would I truly be better off if I had no memory of the past, doomed to repeat the same mistakes without any new insights? Failing to remember the wonderful moments, not just the icky ones? What an interesting idea for a movie.     It should be noted that I enjoy the comedic side of Jim Carey as do many, but was apprehensive towards seeing his 'serious side' (referring to my lack of enjoyment for Man on the Moon, and The Majestic; I enjoyed the Truman Show, but not nearly as much as his comedy). He did not disappoint me in this feature, even though he comes off as completely human and a little sad. Following his character (Joel Barish) through out the movie you may be able to relate, if not, feel sorry for the guy only to remember that so many people go through what he did.    Bonus points for not even having me think of the ridiculous Ace Ventura or In Living Color characters once, which I love. Good movie, good cast, and an overall thumbs up.

Following the \\"I AM\\", energies within me woke up and worked to bring about the awakening and led me to Mooji (living awakened master in the likes of Nisargadatta).   This book shines with such clarity, directness and authority that it's hard to doubt anything this man has to say - it just makes sense.    If you dare to read this with an open heart it will blow the identity to shreds - the Absolute will reveal itself to you.     Are you ready for this? I hope you are!    If you follow the instructions earnestly, this is the most direct and simple means to self-realization, awakening to the inner stillness and peace.    This is a 6-star book as it can shift your consciousness and awaken you to the eternity within you.    I also highly recommend watching Mooji videos on Youtube as a clarification of what Nisargadatta has to say.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|A fun, interesting and unlikely story from the son of Mel Brooks, presented as an oral history written 10 years after the end of a decade-long zombie war fought across every inch of the earth. The first half is can't-put-it-down riveting. The second half slows down but is no less fascinating. Even within his invented world, Brooks has cast a wide net to \\"interview\\" the widest imaginable range of characters. He summons everyone from a former U.S. President and the holy father of a new Russian theocracy to war profiteers, resistance militiamen, country doctors, marine biologists and shady mercenaries. He criss-crosses the globe, probing the financial, cultural, environmental, military and social implications of a global war that, by turns, isolates and unites mankind. Told, like all good oral histories, in roughly chronological order, we move from the first outbreaks through waves of national panics and the near extinction of humanity. Unlike many science fiction stories that square off against our near future, Brooks avoids heavy-handed preaching and lives in his story. You won't be nominating it for awards, but you will be recommending it to your friends... and you will not forget it.
B001J20ZIA|4.0|My Daughter tried this during a sleepover with kids of various levels of maturity for age 10.  They laughed hard at some of the scenes and were entertained.  Good kids movie.  Not epic funny like Shreck or some of the others, but like I rated 4 of 5.    I must have had some network issues with it being Saturday night as the streaming part on my LG DVD w/wifi did not work well, we had about 10 freeze ups where it had to spool the data back up to start.  I would think since I paused it for 10 min in beginning to make sure everyone had popcorn and stuff that it would have spooled to the HD on the DVD player (which is 400 gig) but for some reason it did not do much of that and seemed to rely on data flow.  Not sure that is part of this review but since its listed as a Prime video stream thought I'd mention it.    I just started trying this service and my other movie it streamed just fine 100% no issues, but was not Sat night.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I heard \\"The Cave\\" on radio and decided to look up the group and the album. Halfway through sampling the songs on YouTube, my mind was made up, I went to Amazon and downloaded entire album. I feel some guilt that the album download cost only $5.00.     Folk music may not be your taste, but for anyone who appreciates music, there's no denying that this album is absolutely beautiful. Every one of the twelve songs is absolutely addictive. The sweet slow melody builds up, taking you to a crescendo and descending at an exhilarating pace, leaving you very satisfied but yearning for more. It's just phenomenal. It's rare to have every song in an album this good. If this music was made by Dylan, he would be proclaimed (once again) as god incarnate.

0143034901|3.0|The key element in a gothic novel is the Terrible Secret. The TS must be so awful it will destroy careers, honour, loves, even lives if revealed. The action in a gothic novel therefore revolves around the hero or heroine attempting to uncover the TS, and another individual (not always a villain) trying to keep the TS a secret. Jane Eyre was one of the first in the genre, and The Shadow of the Wind, set in post-WW II Spain, attempts to resurrect it. I'll give Zafon full marks for trying.<br /><br />The story clips along at a good pace, it's very well-written, and the characterization is more than competent. What's not to like then? Well, the problem is that there's always something fairly ridiculous about gothic novels, specifically, the terribleness of the TS. In this case the TS scores fairly high on the awful-o-meter, but, at the end of the day, the TS seems improbably unfortunate rather than terrible. It's also possible to see the TS and its consequences as a metaphor for the Spanish Civil War, but that's a subject that would only resonate with Spanish readers.<br /><br />There are two other problems with the novel. The first is that our hero, Daniel, has to unravel a great many personal histories in order to learn the truth of the TS, and, while this journey is usually entertaining, after a while I found I was getting impatient. Also, it's not a wise idea to hand the story over to a different narrator in the final fifth of the story. The second problem is that the action of the novel is precipitated by a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books in a spooky, labyrinthine building in Barcelona. Now, that sounds cool, but it belongs more in a fantasy novel than a gothic novel, and it starts the novel off with the wrong tone.<br /><br />I was mostly entertained by Shadow, but in the end it wore out its welcome.

B004NO03E2|5.0|This is my first review of an album in a long time. I just felt it to be my duty to write one on this album. First off I'm a 40 year old metalhead. Metal music entered my soul at the age of 13 years old. And has been in me ever since then. Metal is the only music i listen to besides soom rock. I'm just getting into the new wave of thrash metal. I discovered HAVOK about a month ago and had to buy both their albums here, I'm sure glad i did. This group is awesome! I can tell they have the talent to make it in the metal world. They have an amazing thrash sound and are very tight. From what i've been hearing from my new thrash researching this group has to be one of the best up and coming thrash bands anywhere. This group to me is great! I can only hope they stay together for a long time to come. Both albums are just awesome. But i guess if i really had to pick one i would have to pick TIME IS UP. Great work guys keep it real. If your a fan of THRASH METAL old or new you should just get into HAVOK they are the future of the new wave. And are leading the way. THE TROOPER METAL RULES FOREVER!

B001ECQ4AS|5.0|I went into this show expecting to hate it seeing as I'm not into creatures and monsters and therefore avoid most things about them (I find them stupid, not scary).  However, when my friends introduced me to Supernatural I decided to give it a try (mostly to understand all their inside jokes when the quoted the show).<br />The first few episodes didn't grab my attention.  In fact, the first episode flat out left me bored.  Despite that I gave the rest of the season a try and it wasn't long before it became one of my favorite shows.<br />The characters are dynamic and deep.  The storyline, though it at first seems quite simple, turns complicated and intelligent.  It's not a soap opera/chick flick and it's nothing like the Twilight-esque shows we're being bombarded with lately (Vampire Diaries, True Blood, etc.).  It's dark, deep and surprisingly hilarious.  It explores a vast array of myths and lore from every culture while taking its own spin on the ideas.  I truly enjoy this show and am still watching it to this day all the way up to season 6.
0345529057|5.0|I'm one of those people who watched 2 episodes of the HBO series 'Game of Thrones' and decided that a week was too long to wait between installments. I ordered the series on amazon and pretty much stopped watching the show after I got the books because I could read them faster than the show was being released. It really is that good. I've heard people say that the story is a little slow, or that Martin's prose is somewhat dry, but I don't think so. Yes the story takes time to unfold, but this is a series of 7 planned books. I think the pacing is great and very engaging. This is also one of the fantasy series that really lives up to the hype. I've bought into the hype surrounding certain books before (for example Arthur C. Clarke's Rama series; the first one was great, but the rest were meh) and been disappointed. Not so with 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. Perhaps it's because I had never heard of it till the show came out. Whatever the reason, this was a great purchase and totally worth it.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|We just watched Quo Vadis.  It is outstanding.  The production quality, acting, plot, and photography are far beyond any current movies being made.  The story of a Roman general who falls in love with a quiet and beautiful Christian woman, who interacts with Paul and Peter, and who finally becomes a Christian himself, and the inclusion of the actual words from the Bible make it a \\"must have\\" for any Christian family, and likewise a movie that has been \\"blacklisted\\" by secular and anti-Christian networks and television stations.  If you want your family to see this, you have to buy it on your own, just like the other classic Christian films, \\"Ben-Hur,\\" \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" \\"El-Cid,\\" and others.  The portrayal of the evil Emperor Nero is the best I have seen.  What a pleasure to see this versus the absolute stinking trash many of the broadcasters are putting on now! I give this my highest rating for a movie.

La surprise est agréable car j'avais trouvé que dans la version 5, paradoxalement, les exemples de code étaient un peu trop longs et avec trop de complexité pour qu'on en tire rapidement la \\"substantifique moelle\\".    Cette version 6 est une merveille. Tout est abordé de façon détaillée, aussi bien les arcanes du langage que les liaisons avec l'environnement du navigateur. David Flanagan a très bien réussi la tâche difficile de décrire ES3 et ES5 dans ce moment de transition et d'évolution importante du langage. De même les nouvelles API HTML5 sont clairement présentées, même si personnellement j'aurais préféré qu'elles soient plus développées, à la place du chapitre sur jQuery pour lequel il existe déjà une bibliographie importante (et qui n'est le seul framework JavaScript).    Seul petit bémol : on doit parfois faire des aller-retours dans le texte car l'auteur décrit des éléments dont il précise qu'ils seront abordés plus en détail dans un chapitre suivant et dans le chapitre en question on trouve des \\"comme déja vu précédemment\\". A la première lecture on peut donc avoir du mal à faire la part des choses entre ce qui est vraiment important et les détails secondaires. Je pense que c'est plus gênant pour les personnes qui découvriraient le langage que pour celles qui ne sont pas dans ce cas.    Encore une fois, et comme d'habitude, JavaScript ze Definitive Guide de David Flanagan est le livre à avoir dans sa bibliothéque (façon de parler, puisque il sera plus souvent près de votre clavier que sur un rayonnage).
1589949811|3.0|First off, if you are not a 'board or card game' old hand, you will find this game challenging. Children, use to consol computer games, will usually find this game boring and difficult due to the required use of imagination and the complicated rule set. My personal complaint is the foggy manual on many game points and a lack of details on how to play the game solo as advertised. However with study time and some assumptions, an adult can get into the game and have fun winning the various scenarios. Also be aware that the purchase of two sets are required if you want to have more than two players.
160059672X|5.0|Beuatifully illustrated easy to follow intructions. Worth mpre than twice what I paid for it. I am a huge fan of Sheri Serafini's works of art.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Please add more levels and maybe something that shoots underwater. I added this game for my kids but I have yet to let them play it! I love this game! Works perfect on my Samsung Mesmerize.
0439023513|5.0|This book was completely amazing, from cover to cover each book in this trilogy kept me desperate to keep going. I will read these again and again, for sure. Thank goodness that an author is writing something different and wonderful after all the Twilight-esque books that have popped up. MUST READ.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a wonderful, positively addicting game. I wasn't sure I would like it but it had really sucked me in. And people need to stop complaining about the WiFi restriction. Some of us appreciate the warning of a massive file.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|I never have  tired of watching/listening to PFC the original. Neither will I tire of PFC 2.  Do not hesitate to purchase this DVD/CD...it is awesome! Thanks to the PFC foundation for the beautiful and moving music.<br /><br />Support PFC by buying this CD a portion of this goes to help build music and art schools in countries across the world. Run to buy this  before it is on back order and you will  have to wait. While you are there, buy PFC the original too. Best money you will ever spend.
0920668364|5.0|I love this book.  My son had it when he was small.  I bought this one for my new grandson.  I hope that he and his mommy love it as much as my son and I did.  We used to spend hours reading it.  We used to recite \\"the verse\\" and still remember it.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|it was a very very bad copy a burned disc of beauty and the beast!!!!  the quality was not good at all.
160094048X|5.0|As a vegetarian my husband and I have been obsessed with Alternative Baking Company Cookies (vegan). I love to bake so now I can go vegan as well as save us from going broke! The ingredients are easy to find which is huge for me and I love the pictures. I am very visual and like to see what the end product is supposed to look like. (So I lack creativity and must color inside the lines at all times! So what, who cares?! That is what the recipes are for!)I actually ordered the cupcake book by the same authors and love it as well however I like this book better but that could be because I am better at baking cookies... Get this book. Deliciously cruelty free!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|So addictive. I cannot put this game down. It's also very hilarious. the sounds and game is smooth on my HTC Thunderbolt.
160094048X|5.0|Seriously, cowgirl cookies are too good for adjectives. So are the peanut butter blondies, the deluxe cocoa brownies, the blondies, the oatmeal raisin cookies, and my god the basic chocolate chip cookies are so easy to mix by hand yet so rich you'd think you busted out the stand mixer and the tub of earth balance. I could go on, but really, everything I've made from here has been great.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|the game work the first day then just stopped. it goes to the load screen and then it quits out the game needs a up date.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|One day, not long ago, I had my HDTV tuned to one of the digital music channels -- METAL -- with my Koss headphones plugged in.  I had my back turned, surfing on my computer, and the music was this background thing, giving me a lift, but not consuming me completely.  Then all hell broke loose.  A song came on with a woman on lead vocals, achieving notes like a banshee, driving hard and tearing through my consciousness as if she were a Tartar and my skull was a peasant village.  The drums were a battering ram, making way for a ripsaw guitar.  It was an amazing rock song, and I turned around to see who it was.  The band was Within Temptation; the song was \\"Faster.\\"  I am partial to music like this, that is needle-slick and relentless.  Taken up by it as if I'd been kidnapped, when the song was over, I set out to find out more about this band.  I went to YouTube and watched lots of videos of them.  This is some astonishing stuff.  Sharon den Adel is what Sarah Brightman (I'm a loyal Sarah Brightman fan) would have been had she not just FLIRTED with rock music before giving into her classical impulses.<br /><br />During my scouring of YouTube, I recognized one of the older videos as something my son, who was an early fan of Within Temptation, had introduced me to.  For some reason, what he showed me didn't strike me the way \\"Faster\\" did.  When I told him about this new song that just freaking blew me away, and by a band he liked, he said he'd heard a new album was coming out but he hadn't heard any of it yet.  His birthday was in May, and I bought him [[ASIN:B004E2XAHK The Unforgiving]].  He loved it, and and uses some of the songs to workout to.  He also ripped it to my computer, and I've since listened to the whole album a lot of times, and I like it more than he does (or so it seems to me).  The album is an ultra-modern construction of precise production values, delivering a tidal wave of sound, with enough subtle musical effects and flourishes to make new discoveries possible even after you think you've heard it all.  I can't see what's not to like, but from the reviews here at Amazon, it's clear that some of the fans of Within Temptation's earlier albums don't share my enthusiasm.  They're saying it's a bit too pop-like.  That's fair enough, I guess, but I admit to enjoying pop music sometimes, and therefore don't see that as a bad thing.  The criticism should be more specific, making a distinction between TYPES of pop music and what exactly makes THIS pop music. Well, it's got a pop smoothness to it, with a big quick beat, but its metal roots are still very, very obvious.  So, for those who like mountainous symphonic rock -- or whatever it's called; symphonic metal, or whatever -- and you don't mind a twist of mainstream slickness added to the mix, this is a phenomenal album, and it's been my REAL introduction to WITHIN TEMPTATION.<br /><br />On this album, the songs are ordered in such a way that once you become familiar with them all, you're tantalized during one song by a taste for more, so you listen to the next one, too; then the next one, and -- oh, yeah -- and THAT one, and on and on, so that I find myself listening to the whole album from start to finish when I intended to select just a couple of the harder favorites.  They're arranged such that, just as you've had enough of getting your head kicked in and in the mood for something less aurally tsunamic, you'll be deceived by a softer melodic opening, such as in \\"Lost,\\" which soon expands to an epic scope, achieving those dramatic altitudes, then to come crashing down again, before executing a soft landing.  In the course of playing the whole album, it's perfectly placed, and when I finally get to it, it delivers the perfect emotional pitch.  In my admittedly fresh and inexperienced opinion, there is not a bad song on this CD.<br /><br />Fans sometimes expect artists to do the same thing over and over, and that might be the case of some of the hardcore fans here.  I'm simply not familiar with enough of Within Temptation's catalog to make a real comparative analysis and argue against your criticism.  While not a die-hard fan, I did in fact like the previous stuff I've heard, though it did not drive me to seek out more of their material.  This was different.  As a fan of rock music going back to the 60s (I'm that old), and of progressive rock in particular (King Crimson, for instance), I was overwhelmed by this.  I'm surprised Within Temptation isn't better known in the United States.<br />____________________________________________________liar with enough of Within Temptation's catalog to make a real comparative analysis and argue against your criticism.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a really good app and is extremely fun to play on the htc evo 4g. The graphics are also very crisp
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Have thoroughly played the PC version and wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very pleased with the Android version. It's basically the full game, minus the Zen Garden and a couple extra mini games. I got it when it was free but would easily have spent $4.99 to acquire. I play on the Evo 4G and it may load a touch slowly, but not anymore than any of the other games I've played on my phone, especially Angry Birds. I think it's a high quality application. Kudos to Pop Cap for finally getting it out to Android.
B0030Y11XS|3.0|Same kind of populism and stunts that I've seen in all Michael Moore movies.  It's incongruent that he's a wealthy film maker.  He taps into the mistrust and hurt feelings that a large group of Americans feel when they fall behind on their mortgages or lose their jobs.  Moore never criticizes a borrower for borrowing more than they can afford or not knowing the terms of a mortgage.  Still, I agree the lenders were at fault too, with some glaring examples in sub prime lending.    He doesn't report that the TARP program actually made money for the government (this probably wasn't clear at the time this movie was made).  I thought the part about pilots being underpaid was common knowledge.  Who's to blame for this, Mr Moore?  Capitalism, I guess, but it doesn't seem realistic that this will change.  Simple supply and demand.  It's not like airlines are making tons of money.  They are constantly in and out of bankruptcy.  Moore seems to long for the days when the top tax rate was 90%.  If this were the case today, the rich would flee the nation in droves.    Moore idealizes unions, yet benefit-hungry unions and compliant management ground GM into the ground as health plans for workers became too rich.    It seemed exploitive to film a family mourning the loss of their mother/wife under the pretence that Walmart profited from her death by taking life insurance out on her.  The children miss their mom, yet it was portrayed as though they were stricken by Walmart's profiteering.  Still, that was an enlightening issue, that employers sometimes take life insurance on their employees.  Seems callous to me.    All-in-all a decent movie, but the real issues are nuanced, and Moore's arguments are not.  He's a populist and a propagandist, and that's fine, that's his shtick.  I think I learned a few things from the movie, and I was alternatively entertained and infuriated by Moore's antics.  Provocative.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Runs great on Epic4G.  Somehow lost my saved game however after almost completely clearing all achievements when I went to home screen without closing the game.
B003L77GRO|2.0|I too feel this was the worst season.  I LOVE Dexter--from the first time I saw it, I was addicted.  As soon as I finished one episode, I would have to check with Showtime for a sneak preview of the next. I have my family and friends Dexter followers as well but this season I cannot really recommend.  I will buy the season because I have all the others but if the 6th season is not any better, I probably will stop viewing and purchasing.      Around the 3rd episode of the 5th season, I thought 'maybe, it is going to pick up and get better' and it did for a couple of episodes but the character of Lumen, I just never got.  To me, she just did not seem to fit into the scheme of things.  Dexter was no longer the center attraction it seemed, so my interest dropped.  I've heard many comments about the chemistry between the two actors/characters but all I could keep thinking was his was just brutally murdered and she was raped and beaten repeatedly so who's in the mood for sex or love for that matter.      I can relate to Dexter as he feels differently than he acts/reacts in the presence of others--only his thoughts give you a clue into his true character and nature.  And while, yes, he is a serial killer; he can be so sweet, caring in his way, and inadequate--just seem so normal and that's what makes you captive to Dexter; a fan.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This app is a classic example of taking a great game and doing an absolutely terrible job porting it.  Follows no UI standards (blank popups, empty text boxes, etc.).  Game crashes and falls apart often.    What a disaster!
6300181278|4.0|Classic Dracula with Bela Lugosi. Nothing like the original. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and going to bed with a cross around my neck and the covers pulled up tight around my neck so I wouldn't attrac an attack.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|I played this PC awhile back but didn't enjoy it much. I feel like it's made for touch screens! So much more fun now. Sweet on the Xoom but won't open on my Incredible.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Wonderful movie in every way!!!  I would say it's on my top 5 lifetime movies and I'm 70 years old.  Made in 1949 you can easily see the parallels of subject matter as compared to today.    I highly recommend this movie to everyone of any age.
0307593495|5.0|Stieg Larrsson intended his Lisbeth Salander books originally as a 10 book series, but of course as we all know shortly after completing the first three and turning them in to be published he died suddenly. Now before I read them I saw a short posts on Sarah Weinman's old blog about how popular Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander series was (and how she was unable to get into them). Now I was really getting into mysteries and was always on the look out for a new writer to try so Sarah's opinion aside I checked out one from my local library. That is where my love of all things Nordic Noir was born and I have enjoyed the ride ever since.  I hope people sampling this style of mystery will expand their horizons after exhausting the three Lisbeth books, because they will me missing out if they don't.    The Troubled Man is the tenth and final Kurt Wallander book, the story of a small town Swedish police investigator and the crimes of opportunity/passion that haunt his life. The action is very real, as opposed the over the top criminals found in a lot of mainstream American crime novels. Typically someone is just looking to cover up their stupidity and get entangled in the web of lies needed to maintain the cover-up. Wallander methodically keeps digging into the crime to eventually piece the fragments of truth he uncovers, slowly bringing the case to light.  As Wallander reaches the end of his career his policewoman daughter is having a baby and he gets to meet the other grandparents. His opposite is a retired submarine commander who seems very troubled (not just a clever title). On an afternoon walk he just disappears into thin air and Wallander decides to look into it as a favor for his daughter. Struggling with memory loss and old age Wallander manages to dig out a series of lies and cover-ups to eventually uncover a conspiracy on a grand scale.    This book could be read by itself, but the emotional reward that comes from reading the capstone of a magnificent series without any of the foundation would be missed; and that would be a real tragedy. If you want to try Mankell then I highly recommend his latest stand-alone mystery The Man from Beijing.  These books have been made into three different TV series, 2 in Sweden and the third was done by the BBC with Kenneth Branagh in the lead.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Wow, hard to believe Les Mis is 25.  All in all, this was an event worthy of one of the most successful musicals of all time.  It's my absolute favorite musical.    Okay, first let's start with the good stuff.  Some folks will disagree, but I thought Alfie Boe was actually a better Jean Valjean than Colm Wilkinson.  Even though Colm will always been identified with the role, I felt Bowe had a stronger voice, especially during the songs that really required it (Who am I, Bring Him Home).  Enjolras was an amazing improvement over Michael Maguire from the 10th anniversary cast. As much criticism that has been heaped on Nick Jonas for this concert (we'll get to that later), Maguire appeared to be the amateur back in 1995. But Ramin Karimloo was amazing here - strong, powerful voice and hit all the important notes. Once again Lea Salonga was fantastic, this time as Fantine. I enjoyed Norm Lewis' interpretation as Javert, but as others have said, that role will always belong to Philip Quast.      Okay, Nick Jonas as Marius. Really?! Was Justin Bieber not available?  I know Nick is actually a Broadway veteran, but that was as a young child. He has a very soft, weak voice that became very obvious when compared to the other seasoned veterans on stage. He could not project his voice loudly enough when it really counted, and that really detracted from the show.  I understand why they could not cast Michael Ball this time around, since he's in his mid-50s, but surely there would have been someone, ANYONE, who could have done a better job. It's \\"Les Miserables\\" - you don't need a \\"name\\" to make it work.     I just loved the encore when they brought out the original 1985 cast (led by the aforementioned Mr. Ball) and they sang \\"One Day More\\" together, along with the current Jean Valjeans in London (the great Simon Bowman!).  That was really wonderful. I did wonder where were Patti LuPone (Fantine) and David Burt (Enjolras)? It's too bad they weren't there.     Overall this concerthad a lot of good things that they improved upon from the 10th anniversary concert. But the 10th anniversary concert was great too. It's really hard to compare the two as I feel they each stand on their own merits.
1558908374|5.0|I was very thrilled with our product.  It did arrive without the cover page, but it was easy to print one out on the computer.  The condition was excellent, and at the cheapest price available for this movie.  I was very happy with our item, thank you.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|What would be a classic without it's presentation?! This digipack special edition brigs a few cards within with pictures of the stars and movie scenes. The art is incredible! So as the picture and the soud DTS-HD-MA.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great addition to the android phones. Was very excited to see it arrive. Got it for free on the daily apps. Music has some static. DroidX
B004SRWW0C|5.0|this app does EXACTLY ehat it is suppose to. even when i rooted and flashed CM7 with a built in file explorer i still prefer root explorer.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the most fun games I've played in a while. with a lot if original thought put into it. feels like im playing a romero movie with plants. deffinetly worth every penny you will be playing for hours
B000VNMMQG|4.0|The story of William Wilberforce is inspiring and amazing.  He is the type of person that people should look up to and admire.  He left an imprint on how we think about the worth of each individual and on the treatment of animals.  Excellent movie, and great acting.  I thought Albert Finney should have won an Oscar for his performance.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is great on the xoom. I got tired if playing the same o same types of games so this was a nice change of pace
0312430000|5.0|Loved this book! It was required reading by our supervisor and the whole team read it and found it to be a quick read.  Great ideas - thought provoking.  Makes you stop and think before you start a project for sure!
0345441184|1.0|I burned it. This book took me four years to finish and after I finished it I burned it. This book alone has ruined the King Arthur story for me. The entire book is about religion, sex, babies, and menstrual cycles. If you want a deep book to discuss to make yourself sound highbrow this is the one for you. If you just want something to read and enjoy, find something else.
B004N44SOI|5.0|This album is incredible and an amazing follow up to Heroin Diaries.  You won't be disappointed if you decide to purchase it!
0441018866|4.0|Alastair Reynolds has been both one of my favorite, and most hated authors. I tend to enjoy his one-shots more than his series, maybe because he doesn't have time to write himself into a corner. So too with House of Suns, a book I neglected reading for over a year because I was so put off by Absolution Gap's meandering nonsense.    Gladly, House of Suns returns to what I love about Reynolds' writing. It's told from one of three perspectives throughout, and while it's a bit jarring between the transitions because it's all written in the first person, it's also an interesting technique. Abigail Gentian's family owns and operates one of the most extensive cloning facilities available, and to follow a pressing sense of responsibility to explore, she clones herself one thousand times, hops on one thousand ships, and sets off. No matter where these ships go, they congregate after every trip around the galaxy to share what they've discovered. And like pretty much every single Novel by Reynolds, there is no superluminal transit; it's all done at sub-light speed, even six *million* years after Abigail's departure.    The reason provided is that the universe strives to preserve causality, as light can transmit information, and traveling faster than that, even through utilizing wormholes, would violate that fundamental law. Because Abigail's offspring are effectively immortal, this doesn't really present a problem, but it's still irritating to imagine a future constrained to such relatively slow transportation. Yet partially because of time dilation and frequent bouts of stasis, the Gentian line has outlived effectively every other human civilization, which garners a certain amount of respect.    And at least this time, that's not enough to save them. They're under attack, and the tale of their bare survival in the aftermath is what this novel is really about. Purslane and Campion, the two other perspectives that convey the story, spend the first third of the book just gettingto their reunion, but afterwards, it's up to them to discover the source of the attack, and possibly prevent something even worse. All in all, it's very straight-forward. What's interesting is that even though I complained incessantly about how pointless Consider Phlebas was, the sense of discovery here disarms a very similar problem.    Presented on a canvas that covers literally millions of years, where one chapter alone advances the clock by sixty-two thousand years, I still didn't get a sense of how tiny this event was. It was significant because all life in the galaxy was theoretically at risk, but insignificant thanks to the time-scale and the lack of lasting impact by all the transient blooms of human civilization. This tells me Iain M. Banks does *something* in his novels that Alastair Reynolds does not, and while I can't quite put my finger on it, the disparity is quite stark.    Perhaps it's because a narrative actually exists here. The way Hesperus was indispensable and yet incapacitated throughout, was a unique touch. The back-story for Valmik, a man who transformed his merely human existence into something much greater over his six-million years of tweaks. The only thing that really frustrated me was that Reynolds expects us to believe such a being can barely overcome a single Machine Person. It's also transparent that while Reynolds writes hard sci-fi, he simultaneously disregards technology, treating it as a mere afterthought.    An example of this is the final approach of the Silver Wings, Purslane's ship. Whether through accumulation of vast technologies or sheer momentum, it callously swats away attempts to stop its advance, obliterating entire fleets. The Gentian line is apparently only susceptible to nebulously foreboding Homunculus weapons---another creation he never justifies. Reynolds is all about mass, energy, speed, time dilation, and basically anything involving known physics, and tends to gloss over his own magical devices. It's somewhatdisappointing, but understandable considering his chosen genre.    In any case, I consider this novel a vindication of my faith in his work. It's not much, but I like this kind of quiet, *feasible* storytelling on occasion.
B0009UC810|5.0|Had not watched this movie in years. It is a must to have in the DVD collection! Quick delivery. Love the movie!
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Pretty good follow up. The story is really compacted and deep. Animation is beautiful, as good as the first movie, and the English dub is surprisingly good (though I watched it subbed anyway). Evangelion fans will want it, no doubt, but if you're just an anime fan or need a good watch, it's still a great movie.
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|I am a big fan of Science Fiction. I loved SG1 and Atlantis. So when Universe came out, I thought I'd give it a try. The first season had way too many adult situations for me to let my kids watch with me. I never could get past the total acceptance of the changing body thing by family members. The whining by suposed adults was way annoying too. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but even the excting things were somehow boring. I'm not sure how they managed that. The brooding commander had way too much agnst to be believable as a leader. If I want to watch a bunch of whiny, agnst ridden complainers with a bit of drama thrown in on ocassion, I'd just put a camera on my kids and watch that instead. At least then I'd care about what happens to the characters.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|Great selection of songs taken from the movie. It was a wonderful CD, I highly suggest it to anyone who enjoyed the movie.
B002NPY7E0|3.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray disc, not the movie.  Compared to the Special Edition DVD released a few years back, this Blu-ray release is disappointing.  I don't notice virtually any difference in video quality, the audio quality is noticeably improved, but not a deal-maker, and some significant extra features found on the DVD are not here on the Blu-ray, specifically a 5-part documentary on the subject of voodoo.  There's no excuse for this, as the DVD was a single disc release and therefore there is plenty of room on Blu-ray to hold the same stuff.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I must say, this movie is now one of my top favorites.  I look for comedy mostly in these kind of films, and this was better then I expected.  I have no kids, but I love animations.  I would recommend this to any child, but also to adults.  Very cute and I laughed quite a lot.  Brilliant entertainment.  Short and sweet.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is now my number one time killer. Game works great. Would be nice to see the resolution bumped up.
0425242099|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the Psy-Changeling world and this is now my favorite book in the series--which is astonishing since I thought nothing could top Memory (I cry every time I read it.) But wow oh wow! The chemistry between Sienna and Hawke is off the charts--I thought the book would ignite in my hands. Sienna, probably the most powerful Psy in or out of the net is more than a match for her alpha while, in a wonderful side story Walker falls sweetly in love with Lara. And in a scene that brought tears to my eyes Sasha and Luc had their baby!     Spoilers ahead     The tone of this story is different than the others. The war that has been building since Sasha dropped out of the net starts-an explosion that shakes their world forever. Henry Scott has military help from Ming--who it appears is (at first) trying to play both sides of the council against each other. Sienna who had been at Ming's side since she'd turned five recognizes his strategy and helps turn it back on the Psy. People are injured, some critically. Hawke as an alpha is torn between the needs of his pack and Sienna and fights desperately to keep them both alive. Sienna's X powers-the power to literally become an explosive fire-is the difference between pack survival and death--but her power is so strong it could turn on the pack, her family and eventually burn her to death.     My only complaint is that I can not imagine where Nalini Singh goes from here
B0052UZIFA|5.0|So far this game looks great and plays smoothly. I would recommend this game to everyone. I'm sure I will get hours of enjoyment from this game. *Samsung Fascinate*
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|Okay, I won't go into details for the plot, other reviews have covered that pretty well. What I will say is that I really, really enjoyed these characters and the story development. The heroine is smart, funny and has a backbone without being a man-hating witch. Plus, she has a secret that even readers, much less an inquisitive dragon, are eager to find out. The hero is about as alpha as you can get but even without being able to express every new feeling he experiences, when the chips are down at critical moments, the author comes through with just the right tender scene between the heroine and her dragon. I also enjoyed the secondary characters, they promise to be interesting for the upcoming books. The book has it all; there are public relations problems with the humans, tense moments between the dragons and another \\"Elder Race,\\" a bad guy and his creepy thugs that you love to hate, back-stabbing exes and witches and all while the dragon Dragos and his heroine, Pia, try to figure out what they feel for each other and if an HEA is in their future. Whew! I read a lot so I'm picky, picky but Ms. Harrison is now on my short list of \\"must read\\" authors and I can't wait for the next installment to her new series. I highly recommend you grab this book!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is yet another case where the TV network cut a FANTASTIC series short due to poor ratings on a poor night for broadcast! Joss Whedan (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, etc.) created a great show with this one!  I literally can watch it over and over again within weeks of each viewing--this series along with the movie Serenity (which happens to be the clincher in this series since the show was canceled so early during the first season.) Buy them BOTH!    I highly recommend this series! Well worth the money! The plot, storyline, and dialog are ALL great as is mostly ALL of Joss Whedan's creations. These type shows need time to develop a strong following and it most certainly did after the cancellation. Hence, the movie Serenity. The network didn't see it that way and cut it short. Too bad--I would have loved to seen where Joss and the other writers would have taken it!    This is a new concept in TV terms and the viewer following would have grown if the network would have kept it around for another season. The cult following is strong!    On a side note: Amazon.com performed greatly with this order. I received TWO different sets of this series that had bad discs in them upon arrival.  Kudos to Amazon.com for kindly, graciously, and in a timely fashion replacing the full set TWICE without charge to me. This final set is clean! For this, I am grateful and highly recommend Amazon.com as well!    Enjoy the series! Enjoy Serenity! I'm satisfied all around and I hope you will be too!    Marcopolo777

0451169514|5.0|\\"It\\" is Stephen King's attempt to write the ultimate horror story, to create a villain more evil and disturbing than any other in literature or film. So how does he do that? By creating a monster capable of making you think that it is your deepest, most terrifying fear, and that it is about to eat you alive.  If you're terrorized by movie monsters like the Wolf Man, the Mummy, or the Creature from the Black Lagoon (as kids in the 1950's would have been), it can be any of those.  If your fear is disease, it can be a crawling, predatory leper.  If spiders horrify you, it can appear as a trance-inducing, 30-foot spider.  And all of these forms are underscored by the one all of its victims can see...Pennywise, the murderous, lunatic clown and self-described \\"eternal giant, eater of worlds.\\"  Psychic, shape-shifting, carnivorous for human flesh, of otherworldly origins...I don't know what It could be missing in terms of monster qualifications.  Add in the Lovecraftian feeding cycle, and you have what I think of as Stephen King's scariest horror novel.<br /><br />As usual, King's strengths, despite his success on a horror genre level, are in writing characters and story.  It's impossible not to get close to each character, or not to be compelled by their heartbreak and heroism as both children and adults.  Even though it's King's longest novel, it doesn't present the epic journey and quest of The Stand; it's a very personal and private tale of seven different individuals who must conquer separate fears and find inner strength in their own ways. But, they must also strive for unity to accomplish a sanity-threatening feat as a group. Offering the reader both an incredible plot and pure, gut-wrenching horror, It remains one of King's outstanding achievements. Not many horror novels can stand up to it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Runs well on my G2X.  It is a strategy game where you pick the plants and use them to defend your home from various types of zombies. Cute and fun, a good combination of strategy and action for folks like me who are too old to play first person shooters!

B001N3OCV6|4.0|I had a hard time finding this CD anywhere but on Amazon.  I had purchased it when it first came out and my son took it from me.  I guess he liked it too.  When I got it back he had scratched it up.  So I had to buy it again.  I couldn't find it in any store so I finally decided to get serious about finding it and looked on Amazon.  I have a very eclectic sense of taste in music and this covers it all.

B000CNFC76|3.0|The Greatest Game Ever Played is certainly not the greatest movie ever made. It lacks a little in sense of purpose and in character development. We were also disappointed by gratuitous foul language. But overall we were delighted in the charm of the true story it portrays. It is quite clever in its use of special effects to enhance the otherwise boring experience of \\"watching golf.\\" We were able to use it to talk with our children about the power of pursuing your dreams. In all of these comments, we'd say The Greatest Game is quite similar to the movie Secretariat.
B000002C25|5.0|Is it a grandiose, self-indulgent, ambitious, sneering, loud anthemic fireball of crunchy, slightly bent hook-laden British guitar rock?  YES!  Oasis was still very young, very crazy, and totally unafraid to amp it up, ramp it up and like a 16-ton weight in a Monty Python episode, drop this massive monolith on top of whatever happened to be standing in its way.    I recently bought the album in part based on the positive reviews, and have to admit that on first listen I was blown away by the sheer length and loudness of the songs. I found it disappointing and didn't \\"get\\" the hooks at all -- the songs seemed disjointed and contrived besides being just plain loud and long.    On that first listen I was only really impressed with about three tunes, \\"D'You Know What I Mean\\", \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"Don't Go Away.\\"  Some tunes just didn't seem to make any sense. So I decided to then listen in the car and just let the music sink so I wouldn't feel impatient about the beefy running time of the songs.    However, on second listen, everything \\"clicked.\\"  The riff in \\"My Big Mouth\\" is catchy, a solid wall of electric jangle with lots of phase shifting, like it was run through a jet engine.  \\"Magic Pie\\" literally came together in my brain and seemed to work brilliantly.  The three (wow) key changes in \\"All Around the World\\" drive the anthem home and the sheer length and breadth of \\"D'You Know What I Mean\\" now seems necessary for a band that was on top of the bloody world and knew it! Liam's voice is ballsy as ever throughout, yet simultaneously soars with possibilities even on a plaintive chorus of \\"Don't Go Away.\\"  All the singles sound like they should have been massive radio hits, but you know radio would rather play the same song repeatedly especially when the new stuff doesn't sound EXACTLY like a perfect little sequel, so at least in the US this kind of landed with a thud at the time.    No matter. Almost 14 years on, the record is taking on a life of its own via the sheer brute force that was packed into its grooves.  The album is like a time bomb that is going off now mainly because the band is officially over as a unit. After all, the \\"Time Flies\\" singles collection is out there, and the only thing for fans to do is to listen with fresh ears to existing material. Yes, there are no doubt hidden treasures lying amongst the unreleased material, such as mystery b-sides, lost songs and alternate takes.    But that's the future. For now, we can and should re-examine the past. And one thing I think it's fair to say is that despite the the endless bleating of critics, Oasis stayed with it and created numerous killer songs throughout its career.  In this case, what we have is a snapshot of what was happening when the band was first blowing up everywhere.    It's big, bold, brash, and loud as hell. This disc doesn't play, it explodes out of your speakers with vocal and instrumental hooks that attach themselves to the side of your brain and refuse to let go. And to make sure they don't, they're repeated several more times!  So not only is this at volume level eleven, the songs all go to \\"length level eleven!\\"  And there are eleven separate songs -- not including the reprise of \\"All Around the World\\" which is the wholly unnecessary finish to this demented escapade -- and therefore, the perfect ending to it all.  Five stars for a rock and roll album that singlehandedly launched (and won) the loudness war.  In fact, my impression was that with this album, Oasis in fact became \\"England's Loudest Band.\\"  You are either along for the ride of your life, or you can stay home and whine because they didn't make the same album again and again.    Fortunately the record is being rediscovered. Only a bunch of rich, brilliant, egomaniacal skeezed-up punks could have made this album and I'm glad they did!
B003NX76BM|5.0|I Love Love Love this book!   Kept me absolutely hooked from the start.   Being a dog lover and always learning new tips I loved the dog training parts.   Love Nora Roberts suspense.   Kept me on the edge start to finish.

1400052181|5.0|Unquestionably the best book I've read so far this year, Skloot makes this science-laden story entirely approachable.  Even the most abstract concepts are easily outlined for any reader to appreciate regardless of scientific knowledge.  What makes this particularly accessible is the engaging human interest aspect of Henrietta Lacks and her descendants.  In 1951, suffering from cancer, Henrietta is treated at Johns Hopkins and during her stay, doctors take some of her cancerous cells without her knowledge.  Previously, scientists had been unable to culture human cells to survive indefinitely, but due to the curious properties of Henrietta's cancer cells, they become immortal, dividing and thriving perpetually.  The nature of these cells, called HeLa, enables the cure for polio, genetics, cloning, and myriad breakthroughs in medicine.  HeLa has been in space, has been used in nuclear testing, and has been bought and sold by the billions.  Her family, however, never sees a dime for the use of this product which has become so abundant and commercialized.  Nor have they received any recognition for this significant contribution to science.<br /><br />The Lacks children don't even learn of Henrietta's unknowing involvement until twenty years after the fact.  They are uneducated and poor and do not understand the concept of what happened in 1951.  They assume their mother was taken advantage of by the doctors who treated Henrietta to no avail.  They become extremely paranoid, thinking that since they are relation, scientists will want to experiment on them.  Understandably, they also want compensation for Henrietta's involuntary role in what has become a multimillion dollar industry. During the next few decades they encounter reporters, doctors and con artists with less than good intentions, which increase their mistrust in anyone outside their own sphere.<br /><br />What makes this book exceptional is Skloot's ability to seamlessly integrate the story of the Lacks' with the scientific significance of HeLa, and to shift from different time periods without impeding the flow of narrative.  Her involvement with Henrietta's daughter Deborah adds an essential personal touch and paints an emotional portrait of a woman trying to understand her mother's legacy. There are so many other intriguing issues that the book addresses, like patient consent and the ethical ambiguity of certain practices involving tissue donation, especially since so much has changed since Henrietta's time. Overall, I found the concept of what HeLa has helped to achieve amazing and I felt that everything about this book was brilliant.  Now I understand why so many people have been recommending it.ic significance of HeLa, and to shift from different time periods without impeding the flow of narrative.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|I'm a big fan of the game and was very excited to see it come to Android. However, I'm disappointed by a few issues:<br /><br />1. Sound settings don't persist. This is very surprising from Pop Cap and really unacceptable.<br /><br />2. Reloading every time we leave the app. Annoying, but more understandable.<br /><br />3. Graphics quality. The plants generally look great, but almost all other textures look stretched or blurry. This is pretty disappointing, but not a deal breaker. This is particularly noticeable in the animation the end of a level when you get a new plant or something.<br /><br />But, these are ultimately just minor complaints in the face of a great game. Gameplay itself is buttery smooth,  addictive, and fun.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Very nice to finally watch this again..I have a VHS tape, but the VCR is long gone (due to a toddler 'feeding' it rocks, money, and miscellaneous other items)...
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It's an entertaining game which never takes itself seriously that always provide distraction in idle moments.  pro: crazy dave's elocution con: addictive
B00275EHJG|5.0|I didn't get to see this in the theatre...I was afraid it was going to be a disappointment...But, happily, Disney put out another really entertaining movie!
B004ODLUF8|5.0|This movie is so good I saw it twice at the IMAX. I can't wait to get it on DVD.    The footage of the astronauts and the trip to repair the Hubble telescope was cool. But what's really special about this movie is footage from the Hubble itself, which takes you deep inside nebulae and galaxies to see incredible views of our universe.     I had to keep pinching myself to remember that it was not CGI... all of that amazing stuff really exists out there.     HIGHLY recommended.
B004XWLI4I|1.0|This was a waste of film, marketing and talent.  It was stupid.  The lead actress was a mess.  This is a total rip-off of single white female.  Don't waste your time.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love thus game.. have it for my iPad. but it never loads just doesn't with would give it 5 stars if it worked :(
B004TF3HZ2|4.0|Well, what can I add to all the other enthusiastic reviews in front of me?  Steve Hackett is one of the best guitarists ever and this double live CD is still witnessing his old grandeur (\\"Firth Of Fifth\\", \\"Los Endos\\" and \\"Spectral Mornings\\", regardless \\"Ace Of Wands\\" and Blood On The Rooftops\\", whose execution is perfect as usual, represent the best tunes here in my opinion, but in general the music quality is always high!!).    Nevertheless, in the same time, I think that the distance between the old tracks with Genesis or his early band of the eighties and the recent albums is quite evident, but nevermind!!    His music is still shining nowadays and I'm so sorry that until now I couldn't see him sharing the same stage with some exceptional artists like Maurizio Colonna (such a fantastic guitarist of classical music, who performed some music projects with him) or once again my favourite guitarist of the melodic prog scene, Andy Latimer from Camel...anyway, coming back to the present live cd dated 2010, it's essential- being one of the best live performances from this creative artist and- by considering his long magnificent career- that's enough, after all!
B004K4AUZW|3.0|Is there an unedited version of this CD out there somewhere??  The one I bought (2 CD special edition)has bleeps in a few songs (e.g., Government Hooker)and even the booklet has black bars over the offending words?  Why would somebody do this on their own album unless it was for the edited version (Walmart??) although I see no mention of an unedited version being available.  Maybe that will be released after everybody buys this version first!
0545123283|5.0|Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. ([...])<br /><br />Oh. My. Gosh. I don't even know what to say! And how many times have you seen me say that on this blog? Ha ha. I just finished Linger about ten minutes ago. I cannot believe the ending! I want to scream! My mind cannot wrap around all of this. I really wish I had Forever in my hands right now. This is going to bug me until I finally do get to read it.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has done it again. Linger was amazing. Not as good as Shiver, but almost! Still five stars. The writing in this sequel was beautiful and lyrical just like the first, but has a little bit more of a darker edge.<br /><br />And just like the first novel you are able to get in the heads of Sam and Grace, but they aren't the only ones this time around! You are able to get into Isabel's head and a new character, Cole. I enjoyed reading Isabel's point of view and Cole's, as well! I have loved Isabel from the beginning, she's among my favorite characters. At first I didn't like Cole very much, but I definitely do now! I was able to get to know him a lot throughout the book.<br /><br />I can't wait for Forever! The ending left with a huge cliffhanger! VERY huge! I NEED to know what happens. I cried at the end for Sam and Grace. Fate is against them, but they aren't ready to give up! It's so tragic and beautiful and it leaves you breathless.

B000UD08HW|5.0|Seeing how David's aged, like the rest of us from that era, he certainly hasn't lagged in his performance and reproduction of the old Pink Floyd genre.  This is not only a well recorded audio and video delight, it is an absolutely stunning performance.  Hearing some of his new music is very enjoyable and insightful of his continued interest in music still to this day.  He is one of the few performers today, from the 60's and 70's, that puts on a good concert with out trying to act like he's a teenager still....no jumping around, just a good well produced concert.<br /><br />What an absolutely wonderful and enjoyable experience....only thing better would be to see it in person.  Hope he decides to do a concert in Los Angeles some time soon!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I've noted a few comments regarding some perceived poor video quality.  My own personal observation is this is in part due to the constant fog effect produced through most of the concert.  I didn't find it distracting in any way.
B003YHO6XI|5.0|My pick for album of the year - so far - every track on Agnes Obel's Philharmonics is like a soothing balm to my ears; melodious, relaxing, almost ethereal.      Her style falls somewhere between the whimsical charm of Australian singer-songwriter Julia Stone (of Angus and Julia Stone) and godmother of the genre, Kate Bush - albeit with very little of the latter's kookiness.    Next to her wondrous piano playing skills, the most captivating part of this album for me is Agnes Obel's subtle, multi-layered vocal harmonies.  If I have one criticism however, it would probably be that the album doesn't really stretch any musical boundaries, being extremely mellow to a point where it just narrowly avoids the dreaded label \\"easy listening\\".      At times I almost wish Agnes would break out into the kind of off-beat vocal gymnastics employed by someone like Bjork or the aforementioned Ms Bush, yet, as she obviously wasn't aiming for that kind of sound I refuse to knock off a star just because I personally would've have liked to see how far she could take this material.
0142418471|3.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is one book that is very enlightening and touches upon subjects that most authors don't dare bring up. You get to know each character individually from the outside view and inside. They way the book is written is perfect when trying to understand each character. The overall story of the book could have been a little better, but I still enjoyed reading this novel.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|Incredibly naïve young Californian would-be novelist, implausibly engaged to be married to rich man's dumb daughter, goes on trip to Paris with her and her snobbish but boorish  tea-party parents. He finds the perfect escape from his dreadful daily life by diving into Parisian nightlife after midnight, and of a special kind: by some miraculous time machine trick he gets to meet Scott Fitzgerald with Zelda, and Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein, and Picasso, and Cole Porter, and many more. He is attracted to Picasso's current girl friend, an art world groupie who had also been with Modigliani and others. Together with her he goes even deeper into the past and meets Toulouse Lautrec, Gauguin, Degas...<br /><br />Charmingest fun from Woody Allen since ages. Only the fianc&eacute;e and her parents and friends get exposed to the usual Allensian sarcasm. As tea-partiers they fully deserve it.<br />Best supporting actor: Adrian Brody as Dali.<br />Honorable mentioning for Carla Bruni Sarkozy as museum guide.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have loved PvZ ever since I saw it sitting on the shelf at my local Target. Now I can play it wherever I go, which is fantastic!  It runs good on my Droid2, except when my battery is low (30% or less). Then it can get laggy, but if I exit &amp; reenter, it fixes itself.
0061537969|4.0|Didn't know what to expect as I'm not much of a mainstream book lover but this was a very heartwarming novel that I had a hard time putting down.  I read it while recovering from surgery with my dog at my side and I was happy she was with me so I could hug her & scratch her head every now and then.  I have to say it makes you look at your pets differently & not feel so silly for having full on conversations with them:)   Very thought provoking and not the typical tear jerker ending but rather ended on a light and hopeful note. Bravo!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|It has subtle European sensibilities so your so your mainstream crowd isn't going to like this at all. Which is why people don't say they didn't like it and move on but actually get angry. Just look at all the one star posts. It's definitely enjoyable if you like the old Bond movies or movies like North by Northwest. Those are definitely the genre. Great dialogue, fun plot, good acting. Espionage with comedic undertones.
B003Y5H542|1.0|Language is over the top and the movie drags in some spots.  Had a lot of potential but I think they just went a bit too far.  This is one animated feature that my daughter will not get repeat views of.    Edit:  I love the fact also, that the Company men, ...er, avid reviewers are on here mocking the people for pointing out that this is not a suitable movie for children.  Many Many movies are PG, but they do not need to include the brash language in this film.  Parents would be wise to ignore the bot reviews to this movie.  It's Long, unimaginative in it's story line, and has crude language for a feature that is marketed toward children.  The graphics while good, are overshadowed by the rest of the nonsense in this movie.

1579128149|5.0|This is a beautiful book with great surface level information about the elements. It's perfect for browsing and getting a feel for where the elements can be found.  If you are looking for deeper information about the elements look at \\"The Disappearing Spoon\\" by Sam Kean.
B001RNO7D0|5.0|Okay...the bad first: these shoes are sized slightly small. But luckily there's an easy solution: Buy one size larger! It's not a big deal people! Other than that, these shoes fit like a glove, are comfortable every time you slip them on, and will take you over any terrain imaginable with nary a scratch. The sole in particular is INDESTRUCTABLE. I've hiked on some very sharp rocks and treacherous terrain. Nothing can upset the vibram soles. The grip of the sole is also second to none.    Another amazing thing is that these shoes are easily adaptable for casual walking as well as hiking. They look great no matter what. If you want a fabulous hiking shoe that will last and can double as a casual shoe easily, you've come to the right place.
031261246X|4.0|I am self-professed computer nerd and fan of \\"Tom Clancy\\"-esque thriller novels and this novel brought those two worlds together in a great way! The book was well-written, had well-developed characters and included just the right amount of nerd jargon to really perk up ears. On top of all that, it explored scenarios that are getting more and more real every day! A great read and something I recommend to anyone with hankering for a good thriller!
B00338QENI|4.0|Someone recommended this book to me and I am glad they did.  The story was fascinating, and yet upsetting at the same time.  I just couldn't believe how she and her family were treated.  I have not read any kind of science or medical books before so I didn't know what I was getting into, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Some of the details were just too much for me and I just wanted to get back to the story of Henrietta and her family, what the cells were being used on, etc.  Not the processes of what are done with cells, and not the side stories about other lawsuits and the laws about tissue ownership.  While I feel those are very important and were very enlightening, I felt they could have been condensed into fewer pages than they were given.  The book really dragged in those spots.
B004ZP37HE|5.0|Without spoiling, all I have to say is this episode was stunning and heartbreaking on many counts. Peter's use of the machine led to the events depicted in this episode, set 15 years in the future. All characters are affected. It continues the ongoing themes of choice, destiny, fate and hope.     Questions are answered. New ones arise. The ending will have fans questioning all summer: \\"Where does Fringe go from here?\\" At this point, I really don't know, and can't wait for Season Four to find out!
B00005214X|4.0|I'm a huge fan of George Harrison since I first heard his guitar work on 'Nowhere Man' way back in 1966 - which still blows my mind. In fact, my whole family loves George and his music, and we are grateful for the wonderful tribute paid to George by Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Ravi Shankar, et al in 'The Concert for George' (highly recommended). At a young age, Beatle George recorded some of the most original, and dynamic rock-and-roll guitar solos ever, 'Slow Down', 'Long Tall Sally', 'You Can't Do That', 'I Saw Her Standing There', etc.,  - the list is long. George's music has influenced my personal life and its direction. (I am a rock guitarist, but listen mostly to classical music.)    I own all of the publicly released musical recordings of George Harrison. 'All Things Must Pass' is one of his 'better' albums. I would recommend this album for its numerous original compositions, exposure of the artist's spiritual dimension, and his unique and transformed slide-guitar style in its infancy. 'Beware of Darkness,' 'Whah Whah', 'The Art of Dying' are but a few of the great album cuts. Thumbs down to Phil Spector's \\"Wall of Sound\\" on this album. Although I love 'All Things Must Pass', the albums 'Cloud Nine', 'Gone Troppo', and 'Wonderwall' contain many superior tracks. I would also recommend 'Brainwashed' for those unafraid of the 'BIG D' - Death. Most of George's other albums contain one or two songs of high quality. I'll give you my 'definitive' list at a later date.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Without a doubt one of the top movies of not just racing but of the total package never to be created again. One of the reason why I had to give in to Blue Ray since they no longer make HD DVD, too bad they did not get out the non-Blue version in HD DVD...which I have many of. Excellent views of the LeMans experience for it is not just a race but an adventure. Hard to believe that this movie is near 40 years old!! And what they did to \\"make it more safe\\" and lower the speeds as it is now has taken alot of the drama out of the race. The day of the Porsches and the Ford GT40s which were not featured. A remarkable movie which should not be missed in this version.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best game on Android, by far. Unfortunately, it doesn't run too good on my Galaxy S Vibrant. It's made my phone crash a few times already, and it once bogged down really bad when the screen got full.
B00538MG6A|4.0|Get Shorty is a great movie as we all know. I'm not going to get into specifics on the movie itself. The Blu-Ray conversion is pretty good. The detail is very nice and I did not detect any artifacts caused by filtering or other forms of noise reduction. Get Shorty was filmed by Don Peterman and his flicks were typically distinguished by a clean, low-grain elegance, with precise lighting and solid blacks; and the Blu-ray has accurately reproduced this look for Get Shorty. The Blu-ray captures the just-too-bright, slightly artificial look of the L.A. and Florida locales (the latter also shot in L.A.) where most of the action occurs. The DTS loss-less sound contains appropriate background noises but nothing that will make you turn your head. The menu structure for the disc is pretty bare-bones, but has some great bonus features and deleted scenes. Overall this Blu-ray is solid and I recommend it!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I have enjoyed Joe Bonamassa for many years. JB has kicked it up to the next level of great blues and it is awesome! His best ever CD. I Played it twice the first day it arrived.  And then I asked my wife if she wanted to hear it.   Richard
B0041KKYEM|5.0|It's obvious that this is not going to be a happy story.  There are no surprises, there is no sugar-coating, just the relentless tension of watching an uptight woman-child lose what little mental stability she has.  This is a trip into the lacuna of obsession that will speak to you if you've ever been there or have watched someone you love lose themselves in their myopic pursuit of perfection.  But you don't need to have been there to empathize with Nina, you just have to be willing to accept that some people go cuckoo when their self-worth has been built upon something as precarious as the approval required to succeed as a professional artist.      What I love is that this movie doesn't glorify Nina's self-destruction, it just shows you in \\"full-frontal\\" style brutality what it's like to be in her (toe)shoes.  At least that's what I got from watching it three times.      Don't write Black Swan off because it's one of those \\"arty\\" movies.  You don't need to be \\"highbrow\\" or able to deconstruct every scene to enjoy how beautifully done it was either.  Think of it as Fear & Loathing with ballerinas and no attorneys.  FYI, If you're one of those \\"practical\\" people that has a hard time understanding situations that are foreign to you, you might want to move along as this probably won't seem realistic to you.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I like this girl's voice.  Had never heard of her until watching American Idol so after one of the contestants sang a song from this album I decided to buy it and give it a listen.  I enjoyed it.
0066620996|5.0|This book by Jim Collins was written after [[ASIN:B001W6RRNY Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies (Harper Business Essentials)]] but really should be read first. Good to Great sets up the foundation for building lasting great companies. Through five years of research, Jim and his team analyze selected companies to see what made them great companies. The book starts off by explaining how the companies were chosen and how the great companies that were chosen for the study not only outperformed their competitors but the general market as well.    Great companies didn't become great companies overnight. It was a process change that took months, even years. But these companies eventually broke out of the good cycle and distinguished themselves. In this book Jim and his team identifies six steps necessary to take a team from good to great: Level 5 Leadership; First Who, then What; Confront the Brutal Facts; The Hedgehog Concept; A Culture of Discipline; and Technology Accelerators.    In each of the six steps Jim explains the concepts and the reasons why the step is necessary. He then proceeds to give an example of why the step works and how it helped great companies become great. After that he explains how the competitors of great companies did something different and did not see the same level of success.     All in all this was a great book to read as it provided new insight into why companies such as Walgreens performs so well and why Circuit City (during the period of study) experience tremendous growth. It also helped explain how Kimberly-Clark was able to take on the Proctor & Gamble giant and still succeed. The book really emphasized how getting the right people on board in the right place is really important through the Wells Fargo and Bank of America example.    If you're looking for ways to take your company to the next level or if you're just interested in learning why some companies continue to beat their competitors, this is a great book to read.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|As other reviewers noted, the magnet on the carrying case is weak and the flap will pop open if you're not careful.  Wearing it on your belt would probably result in the flap opening inadvertantly (but I haven't tried this so I can't say for sure this would happen).  I simply use this as a carrying case so it does the job of keeping the headset protected.

0670022411|1.0|I snatched this book from the library table so quick I nearly dropped it! I had been waiting for months to read it- witches and vampires and history, OH MY!!   3 days later which included a power outage and 90* heat I threw it across  the couch in disgust. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I saw the page count and knew there would be some build up--even expected some slow spots since the heroine ( term used loosely) is a bit of an unrealistic brainiac. I was even expecting the brooding vampire! What really ruined the whole book for me what Diana-- what a flake. The only decent parts of this book were when miraculously her SPINE makes an appearance and when she isn't crying/leaking/eating/sleeping/consuming ungodly amounts of tea/or doing yoga.   These parts in total: 20pages.  One bright note: If this rambling pile of dry ridiculousness can get published, there is hope for mine yet!
0439023513|2.0|I will start this review by saying that I absolutely LOVED reading the first installment \\"Hunger Games\\". It was different, new and thrilling. The story kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time. However, my excitment somewhat vanished while reading \\"Catching Fire\\" where I had to painsakingly get through at least half of hte book before anything happaned in the story. Still, I didn't conclude on anything.I attributed this to the \\"Middle Book Syndrome\\" where the middle book of a trilogy is always inferior to the first and last book. So I marched on to the last book \\"Mockingjay\\", I wasn't optimistic but I gave it a shot regardless. I was disappointed.     First, there is the problem with the pacing of story. Nothing happens for the longest time except for some interesting bits here and there about Peeta. I literally felt like was walking in a boring hot dessert with nothing in sight and when I finally found a fountain, there is only one drop of water left. And this drop of water is supposed to last me until next time a fountain comes along. If you like reading that kind of book where the writer holds the readers as hostages, then this is the book for you. Given the genre and the story, I definitely don't think this is the direction this book should take.     Secondly, there is the problem with Katniss. I already felt uneasy about this in \\"Catching Fire\\", but the problem became even more obvious in \\"Mockingjay\\"-- What Does Katniss Do? I mean, she survived the hunger game in the first book. She saved her sister by voluntering to become a tribute. She fought. She killed. She struggled with physical pain as well as emotional, and she loved. She was a heroine and she was ALIVE. But by the time \\"Mockingjay\\" comes out, her sole activity in the book has been reduced putting on the mockingjay suit, going into \\"pretend\\" combats and making speeches. I wanted so much to see Katniss in action. I wanted to see her use her bow and arrow with skill that no one could match. I wanted to see her climb trees as fast as a cat. Instead, she gets hurt repetitively and is always in a hosptial bed. I end up having read excusiating details about her recovery process. Katiniss has become weak and distraught. She completely vanished from the tough and courageous girl she used to be in \\"Hunger Games\\".     Lastly, there is the problem with the ending.    **********************************Spoiler Alert******************************Spoiler Alert**********************    There are major flops with the ending, in my opinion. Katniss's one and only goal is to kill Snow herself in this book, which she obviously did not accomplish. Snow died on his own. His death was so anticlimactic that I couldn't believe I plodded through so much just to get to this mellow and disappointing sight. Okay, I understand if the writer intended Katniss to remain innocent without having too much blood on her hand but come on, this girl was in Hunger Games where she had to kill to survive. A little late with the innocent talk, dontyathink?     Finally, let's talk about the love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. While I was happy that Katniss got together with Peeta (I was secretely rooting for him), I am still shocked that the writer did not offer any type of closure between Katniss and Gale. It seems like Gale went off somewhere, and Katniss chose Peeta. Well, did she choose him out of convenience? Did she say goodbye to Gale? Is Gale still in love with Katniss? There are so many questions that went unanswered in the end.     I closed the book feeling very unsatisfied. I didn't particularly liked any character more. I feel like the story just got dragged on for too long and it was unnecessary. It should have ended at \\"Hunger Games\\".
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is a great time killer. i play it at work because it requires only one hand to play. so i can work and play at the same time. graphics are awsome. great game.
0066620996|4.0|I was assigned to read this book for an Industrial Engineering class at my university. I was pleasantly surprised at how much of an easy read it was. I was expecting a technical book about how to improve efficiency and productivity in companies and instead was inspired by the great examples and the humbling yet still ambitious philosophy presented. This book turned out to be an enjoyable read rather than a chore.    This book examines eleven companies that were good companies, and then over time turned into great companies. Collins and his team spent five years researching the similarities between all these companies and why these similarities are factors of success. They concluded that there were a few major things that turned these companies from good companies into great companies. These factors, without going into too much detail, include a certain brand of leadership, application of technology, an optimistic yet realistic attitude and a talented group of people who are picked before anything is done. Collins covers all these factors in detail while providing real life examples of their success.    Overall I thought this book was a very good read. I was quite surprised by some of the findings, especially the type of leadership that usually results in great companies. To me, this book was inspiring because it shows that a little hard work, humility and a positive attitude are much better for enduring success than the cut throat, egotistical attitude that we are often led to believe is the recipe for success. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to transform any type of organization into a great organization; it doesn't even need to be a business.
B004I1AGTM|5.0|I purchased part 1 and 2 together.  I was able to watch both movies back to back.  Donnie Yen and other characters had the same likeness as Part 1.  Hands down great movies.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I can understand when someone likes a film for reasons others may hate it, and sometimes acting, mood, lighting, sound, and direction all make a huge effect on someone's opinion of something. I believe anything could be better than this 'film', even cutting myself to pieces and filming it would be more fun than this crap!<br /><br />Danny Glover stars in this. I had to check the main Amazon page to verify that sense I don't own this crap. Isn't that a shock in the rubber parts??!! To think at one time he was doing such GREAT work in classics like \\"The Color Purple\\" to sink to doing this. Wow, what a downfall!! I think Danny Glover needed the money. I was embarrassed for him! And, I thought he was embarrassing in \\"Gone Fishin\\", but this is the bottom of the barrel. This is unwatchable garbage.<br /><br />Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.<br /><br />This isn't 'horror', nor is it a 'film', but disgusting pieces of footage combined together to whet a poor filmmaker's egotistical fetishes and air them in public for all to see; and, what vile carnal garbage this is, at that. Bilge like this should be flushed down the toilet, along with the people who made it. I couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes of this crap. It isn't merely disgusting, it's PRETENTIOUS JUNK that's pretending to be \\"art\\", when in reality it has NOTHING to say or add to the world...except maybe provide viewing pleasure for people who get off on watching torture. And THAT'S scary. We've sunk pretty low. These are some sorry individuals who made this!<br /><br />The scariest thing is indeed the fact that so many people love this crap. Some are starting to call it \\"torture porn\\", meaning that it's pornography for people who love violence, not sex. I think that's an apt description.<br /><br />These movies are inhuman. People, mostly kids and young adults, are paying good money to enjoy watching inhuman acts. Society is becoming like \\"Lord of the Flies\\". And the people who are the sickest are the least likely to see it in themselves, apparently.<br /><br />I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.<br /><br />I read someone reviewing \\"Hostel part 2\\" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and considered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society???<br /><br />If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plumber working, that would be more entertaining than this trash any day.<br /><br />And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there. Thank you.lm goer out there. Thank you.
B001IF277K|3.0|The product does not come in box (I doubt it gives original).   Came in an envelope with a plastic bag to cover.   I am trying and so far have had no problems.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I've seen this once and I'll see it again for sure.  This lays out the financial crises and the problem with housing loans in a perfect way that anyone can understand.  You'll understand EXACTLY what happened and the likelihood that it could happen again in this documentary.
0425241505|4.0|In my brief skimming of GoogleReader (which was apparently smarter than me and would only let me go back a month), I came across this book at least twice and it sounded not only like something I would love, but perfect type of book for my life at the moment. It was everything I hoped it would be. Don't let the cover or even the summary fool you, this was not merely an overly, cheesy girl falls in love with being a love slave kind of story. It was action-packed, laugh out loud funny, mysterious and surprisingly romantic.<br /><br />I didn't categorize this as erotica, but I did include the Mature Moments warning due to some (well done) graphic sex scenes.<br /><br />Full review at 25hourbooks.com.
1400052181|5.0|I was totally fascinated with this book.  It was amazing to me to read about the health care system in the 1950's and later.  I found the information to be interesting, well written and kept me turning each page until I finished.
B004SBB0LU|3.0|As a big fan of Queen, I was incredibly diappointed to see that these highly boasted 40th Anniversary discs were nothing to get excited about.  While great, the bonus content doesn't justify a second disc (length wise).  There is so much more that could have been included that would have made these sets even better.    While the live tracks are a great inclusion, I would have prefered a full concert live album be released as opposed to five to six random tracks from various concerts featuring songs from that particular album.  In fact that said, I really would like to see more live albums from Queen.  Surely they have a catalog of them tucked away somewhere.    Sadly with the way it's all laid out and presented, it comes across as randomly thrown together.  It's not the 40th Anniversary I was expecting for such a wonderful band.  In fact, it's kind of a slap in the face.    Since I don't really have an ear for \\"remastered\\" music, I can't say as to whether or not the albums themselves present a richer sound or not.  As I played \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" for the first time, I found myself saying, \\"Yep.  It's the first track on the first Queen album.\\"  In other words, it didn't impress or disappoint me.    For $80.00 it just could have been better.  If you're simply looking for the Queen albums, there are cheaper alternatives on the same CD format.  This set is not one to jump at.  As I said, I'm a big Queen fan, but this set wasn't worth dropping $80.00 for, and just think, there are two more sets coming out at probably the same price each.    You could probably pick up older copies of every Queen album on CD for the price of one of these box sets if you really wanted them all.
1932100660|5.0|This book is incredible. Authority doesn't get more persuasive than this. I became a vegan that very week. Suddenly I feel much better and have purchased this book for my parents and sister. The Kindle edition is so quick to read and I love being able to highlight specific parts that speak to me.  I give this my highest recommendation. Truly remarkable in every way.
0385611072|4.0|One of my favorite things about Terry Pratchett's novels is that he takes the most unpromising characters--in the case of \\"I Shall Wear Midnight, it is a pregnant-out-of-wedlock 14-year-old--and gives them dignity, originality, and sometimes even a dose of that sacred fire, magic.<br /><br />Unfortunately in this fourth Tiffany Aching adventure, Pratchett also scrags a character and a relationship that he had been carefully building through the previous three novels, then blames the resulting casualties on witchcraft.<br /><br />Tiffany survives this book intact, and even stronger than ever.  Much of her energy is directed toward tasks that in our nonmagical world, would be palmed off on social workers.  Even so, people are turning against witches, again.  There is even talk of burning them.<br /><br />\\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" doesn't really have much of a plot to glue together the separate stories, and although the villain gets a tremendous build-up, he really didn't seem to live up to his bad PR, so the story's end seemed anticlimactic.  This is a book with lots of talk but little action.  Even the Feegles, who tend to act without much preliminary discussion, reveal a tendency toward wordiness, especially after their showdown with Wee Mad Arthur.<br /><br />However, we Discworld fanatics get to meet lots of our favorite characters, even if most of them are in cameo roles, and the Feegle unleash mayhem where ever they tread (their mayhem is on a very short leash).<br /><br />I enjoyed this further adventure of Tiffany Aching, although 'Midnight' is the least of the four books about this young witch and her little blue 'helpers.'  Her character isn't so much further developed as it is hardened along lines suggested in previous novels.  However, I'll still look forward to a fifth installation in this Discworld subseries.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|So addictive!! I have been waiting for this app to hit Android for awhile now and I love it!! No problems with the app itself or the graphics. Get it now, while it's half price. No problems on the T-Mobile Sidekick 4G.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to see, but I figured with Verbinski and Depp involved it couldn't be too bad. Boy, did I underestimate them!  This movie was hysterical from the opening moments (Mariachi owls, anyone?).  I agree with all the reviewers who said it wasn't a kids' film - too dark, and the amount of references and in-jokes lifted it way out of the Saturday morning/Disney category into the realm of inspired parody, but without losing a certain sweetness.  The animation and production were outstanding as well, and I'm hoping the boys team up with ILM again soon!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Zombies are my favorite sub genre of films out there, though it is a rather shallow pool when you talk about the really good ones, and I'm not saying that there haven't been really good ones made since the 70's, because there definately have.  From Faluci, to 28 days later, to the over the top Dawn remake, to even some of Romero's new projects, but there just seems to be a gap between how good I think it can be with how good it ends up being.  This movie juggles a very fine line and manages to be one of if not the best shows currently on tv, and I hear that from all kinds of people, not just zombie fans.  The source material for this is a graphic novel, and though I have to say that I am not a fan of comic books, the writing really takes center stage.  Romero once said that the real bad guy of his films was not the zombies, but that they acted as a catalyst for humans to be their base selves as society depreciates, and that is at the cornerstone of what makes this series so great, but not from a cynical point of view, but from the heartfelt perspective of someone who believes they can change society for the better, and show that life is worth living to his son.  I don't want to give away the finer points to the show.  I can tell you that it is not a zombie attack of the week, which makes when the zombies do show up in mass all that much more exciting of a surprise, because of the lulling of feeling you are safe from all the human interest pieces.  There just happens to be zombies about.  This has more in common with High Noon than your average zombie fair, not to say that there is not some desensitized gore in there, but series lead Frank Darabont of Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile is a master of blending human and horror elements.  This is a adult zombie story that everyone I know who has seen it raves about it.  I can't wait for the next season.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this and a few other peripherals recently to see how well they worked for Mac. This came first, and I'm very happy with it.     First, the build quality is very solid. It feels good, and is designed well. The palm rest in particular is great, made of dense, textured rubber.    it's comfortable for me, but I could see how someone with small hands could have some problems--nothing you couldn't get used to though.     Most importantly, all of its features are compatible with Mac OS X. The display installs a preference pane you can manage it with, and the key profiler works seamlessly with Snow Leopard. I gave it four stars on ease of use just because there's some set up involved.    EDIT: I've returned after a few days to reiterate my satisfaction with the G13. Logitech has wholly won me over with their G-series peripherals. It only took me about three or four hours of playing (which is nothing for most gamers) to get used to the new bindings, and I can't play without it now. I literally made the rest a pick-up-group wait at the beginning of Throne of the Tides wait for me to connect it before moving on earlier this I week, because I wouldn't be able to play without it.     I described the profiler application on my G510 review, which, I must add is not only another fine product that meshes extremely well with Mac OS X, but a competitive addition to your G13, but i'll re-cap here.     I owned a game pad a long time ago, and the individual keys were already bound to the system as certain letters. Though the layout was atypical, any given key might be a J, or an L, that would respond like a normal keyboard in, for example, a word processor. To set up that old gamepad, I had to go into WoW, and rebind all the macros to these odd unintuitive keystrokes. It took forever, and was really annoying. The G13 has changed that. First of all, the application works perfectly on Mac, like it was actually designed for it. Anyone who's spent a lot of time on a mac knows we'replagued by poorly executed ports, especially with drivers. The application presents you with a layout of the keys on the G13, which you can click to assign text blocks (I set up a profile for using inDesign, and bound one key to paste in lorem ipsum), macros, launch apps, or individual or combinations of keystrokes, as you'd expect. When the profiler app sees a game on your computer for which is has a set of macros it allows you to assign the buttons not to the corresponding keys that you'd press on the keyboard, but the command itself. What I mean is regardless of what you have autorun, for example, bound to in the game, the G13 lets you just bind the key to auto-run, without any intermediate key-presses. Furthermore, the LCD manager app works like a dream. It installs itself as a preference pane, whereas the profiler is standalone.    I'm currently working with the G13 and the G510, and it's a great combo. Certainly more keys than I think I need right now, but damn does it look cool. You can specify RGB values (within the mac color picker) for the backlight color, and match the two, and it looks really sleek.

Silently dealing with his demons, his child self provides too adult voiceover.    Some think this film is brilliant. Really, they want to seem smart, by 'liking' this 'Tree'.  Unnatural sound and feel to what little dialogue there is.  Cannes gave it the Palm D'or. Their most prestigious.  Kind of reinforces bad stereotypes about 'independent' film for many.  Such a waste of time, Terence Malick's \\"The Tree of Life\\".
0670022411|5.0|I honestly don't know where to begin with \\"A Discovery of Witches.\\" I finished it two days ago and I'm still reeling. Returning it to the library was a serious wrench. I want to go out and buy a copy, but as I know I'm going to want to own all the books in this trilogy, I'm trying very hard to counsel myself to wait until it comes out in paperback.    In short, I adored it.    The novel opens with Diana Bishop, a historian and a witch, doing research at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. She manages to call up the elusive Ashmole 782, a heavily enchanted manuscript that has been missing for hundreds of years and that has been coveted by witches, demons, and vampires for as long. But, after the traumatic loss of her extremely powerful witch parents at a very young age, Diana has spent her entire life suppressing her magic, and she decides that she wants nothing to do with the manuscript and sends it back to the stacks. Word spreads quickly among the supernatural community, and Diana soon finds herself stalked by various people who want her to recall the manuscript so that they can learn the secrets that it holds, including a 1500 year old vampire named Matthew Clairmont.     Matthew's motive for approaching Diana is the same as the other witches, demons, and vampires at first: as a geneticist, Matthew has been studying the origins of all creatures, and Ashmole 782 promises to explain all of that and more. Soon enough, though, Matthew finds himself inexplicably drawn to Diana and takes it upon himself to protect her. When the threats from the other creatures get too strong, Matthew and Diana flee Oxford. During her stays at Matthew's family home in France and then her aunt's house in upstate New York, Diana comes to terms with her power and her love for Matthew. When all of this causes an all out war with the powerful Congregation of creatures, however, Diana has to quickly learn how to use her power to fight for those she holds dear.    I think what drew me to \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" right away was how much it reminded me of \\"Practical Magic\\" and \\"Being Human\\"-eccentric witches, a witch who refuses to acknowledge her power, supernatural creatures blending with society and living together, prejudice among these creatures, etc. The fact that I had all this context made it extremely easy for me to step into the world of the novel. The added historical elements and the settings really made it a winner.     And then there are Diana and Matthew. I don't know if I've entirely warmed to Diana just yet, but I have a feeling I will when she can stand more on her own. Matthew, however...I'm not into the whole vampire thing, but I found him extremely sexy. And his past gives him a lot of layers that I enjoyed seeing in this book and that I can't wait to see in books to come.    I'm sure a lot of people are going to be calling \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" a \\"Twilight\\" for grown-ups, but I heartily disagree. Aside from the higher calibre of writing and research, I think the whole series has the potential of being a great fantasy/historical fiction/romance trilogy very similar to Susan Carroll's bride or Fair Isle books. And I think I've found my new \\"Harry Potter.\\"
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you consider most new/popular Kindle books are $9-$12 and this is a box set of 4 books for $36, it makes perfect sense. It's not price-gouging at all. It's not that they raised the price of the Kindle version, it's that they lowered the price of the paperbacks. The publisher is trying to encourage you to buy the paperback box set, because the publishing industry is hurting, just like the music industry. Publishers should have learned something from the music industry. It may be too late now.
B004UXUSPA|5.0|Woody Allen's charm is here in full effect. Watching Owen Wilson walking down the beautiful streets of Paris and transport back in time is very \\"Allen-esque.\\"    Owen Wilson plays Gil, who is soon to be married. He wants to stay in Paris, but his fiance, Inez, doesn't which causes Gil to wander the streets at midnight, where he is taken to the 1920's, where he always wanted to live. It is a simple plot, with a simple, and can I say cute, message. Owen Wilson is on the top of his game here, and he contributes to the funny moments of the movie. The rest of the cast was fine, playing the roles to predictable. The characters that Gil are introduced to us are each unique, and interesting. Especially Brody's cameo, which was done very well.     The best part apart this movie is the cinematography. Every shot is beautiful and Woody picks some perfect locations, and there are a lot of famous landmarks. A lot of the shots contain a lit up Eiffel Tower.
B00004YC2F|5.0|Holy cow, this recording is amazing!  Volodos live recording is as exciting as Argerich's but a) he doesn't make mistakes, b) has fabulously good sound engineering, c) has the enthusistic & virtuoso support of Levine & the Berlin Philharmonic.  Volodos has steel fingers yet also plays with deep subtlety.  This recording also surpasses my previous favorite - another live recording with Feltsman with Metha conducting.  I also much prefer this recording to Kissin's live recording with Ozawa conducting.
030726999X|3.0|This is the third and final book in Larsson's Millenium series. All open issues remaining from the previous two volumes are neatly closed down and explained. Looking back at the review of the previous book, I see that I was harsh on Lisbeth Salander, our intrepid heroine, although I must admit that it was nice to become reacquainted with the cast once more. As this book begins, we find Lisbeth hovering between life and death, having been shot by her father and half-brother in the previous book. But, not to worry --- she survives and indeed, thrives, although the analytic and logical part of her brain appears to have suffered since she cannot concentrate on solving Fermat's Last Theorem anymore. The nefarious plot of protecting a Russian defector in the height of the Cold War, hatched by a few men working under the radar of the Swedish political system is exposed as the main cause for Ms. Salander's childhood problems. For those who have ploughed through the first two books, finishing this volume seems fitting.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Let me say up front that I am not a huge fan of tribal fusion style. I like watching it, but I prefer the more Egyptian/Cabaret style for my dancing. HOWEVER, whether you like tribal fusion or not you can get a lot out of this DVD. There is a ridiculous amount of content here for the price. The yoga sections- one for strengthening and preparing the body (particularly the spine) for belly dance, one for backbending, and a closing sequence- are excellent. I have done Ashtanga and Hatha yoga before and her adaptations of asanas are really interesting and unique (to me). Rachel's instruction is very clear and concise, and I find her voice very soothing (a major plus for yoga!). I really like how they taped her and then had her voiceover her instructions- I have not found that very often in bellydance dvds. The technique sections are great, as are the practice loops in the choreography sections. I agree about the music being somewhat different, but hey, to each her own. I will continue to use this DVD, especially the yoga sections, every week. Bellydancing can be hard on your body, and it is so vitally important to make sure that our abdominals, arms, shoulders, knees, and back are strong and flexible enough to support the kinds of moves we are doing. The yoga sessions DVD really address this important aspect of practice. I'm so grateful to have found this DVD!

0977326403|5.0|After reading the book \\"Good To Great\\" by Jim Collins, I gained a better understanding of how companies become greater than other companies.  Before I always thought it was due to luck or they achieved an overnight breakthrough will a homerun of an idea or product.  Collins explains that this was not the case.  He goes into detail about how each of the great companies were able to find what they were great at and stick to it no matter how bad things became they stuck to what they were great at and used that to produce results and achieve success over the long haul.  All the great companies he discussed such as Walgreens, Phillip Morris, Wells Fargo, and Kroger to name a few all had level 5 great leaders with personal humility and professional will, they wanted nothing but the best for their company and would do what was right and necessary to achieve it.  He noted that with the comparison companies, the leaders were not level 5 levels, most were more interested in themselves not the company.<br /> I do suggest this book to anyone that is currently in business, going school, or is looking to start their own business due to how great the content and examples that the book goes over.  The book is an easy read that transitions well into how the companies went from good to great.  Collins even shows plenty of graphs on the companies and how they performed in the market and to their comparison companies.  I personally found chapter 8 to be one of the better chapters since it uses analogies of two different types of routes that companies can go, with the use of a flywheel, and the use of a doom loop.  Great companies follow the flywheel effect and build their momentum, while the companies that aren't great don't build momentum and follow the doom loop.  Other great examples are in the book, so I suggest going out and reading it.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter film adaptations. That being said, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I, takes the cake in all respects as compared to previous Potter movies. As you may be aware, this is split after Malfoy Manor, therefore, you will not get a resolution with this film. However, the movie does end at a fitting point, setting a clear stage for the culmination in the next film, to be released in July 2011. What sets this film apart, however, is that it completes the transformation begun in the film adaptation of the Half-Blood Prince. This film is very DARK and emotional. This was the intention, as the Harry Potter sequel matured along with its originally intended audience. I would recommend this film for all ages, as there are no particularly troublesome scenes, yet, on the whole, this is an adult film, filled with angst, struggle, and believable character interaction. Acting has consistently improved over the course of the films: this is no exception. Definitely recommended, and you will not be able to refrain from watching this movie over and over if you are a Harry Potter fan. Also, this is consistent with the books: with minimal add-ons occurring only to improve the overall quality of the film. The highlight, for me, however, was the segment portraying the \\"Tale of the Three Brothers,\\" done in an animated storybook style. Yes, these films have developed into successful accompaniments to the books.

We have all their CD's and enjoy them everywhere we go on our mobile devices. Sharon Corr's DREAM OF YOU CD is the best of what we like about the Corrs. The CD is a beautiful mix of old and new but mostly it's the heart and soul that went into making this music that comes through loud and clear. Sharon Corr has sincerely exposed her individuality through her choice of songs and arrangements, but there is no mistaking that beautiful melodic Corrs sound!! Our favorite Corrs CD is \\"Home\\", but after a few listens, DREAM OF YOU is fast becoming our new favorite...
0765365278|5.0|\\"The Way of Kings,\\" by Brandon Sanderson, is groundbreaking in that it represents a huge foray into a different fantasy world by the author. This series is expected to be long, and Sanderson is expecting to work on an individual book in the Stormlight Archive approximately every TWO years after he completes all necessary details for Robert Jordan's WOT series. So, be forewarned, if you don't like to wait, don't pick this book up quite yet.    That warning aside, the book was excellent. Having read all of Sanderson's previous works, I had high hopes for this one as well: he exceeded my expectations. The storyline revolves around three primary plots, which, towards the end of the book, still have a myriad of opportunity for change and the same thrill present as when beginning the book. All in all, the character development is great, if resembling somewhat characters in earlier Sanderson books. What brings this book to the forefront, however, is not only its scope but, as always with Sanderson, the degree to which he establishes a new, groundbreaking form of magic that is believable, intriguing, and entertaining on the whole.     As a final note, I read the Kindle version of this book. There were no problems with the version, maps and pictures (another Sanderson benefit) are present and readable.
0345529057|1.0|I'm embarressed to confess that I slogged my way through books #1, #2, and 30% of #3 on my Kindle  before I  became so disgusted that I deleted forever every single one of them.  At that point, thousands of pages later, and out of dozens and dozens of characters there wasn't one about whom I cared at all.  They (with maybe the exception to Tyrion) are wooden, one dimensional, and trite.  As is their dialogue. Mr. Martin creates a dark fantasy with every page containing descriptions of pointless war,murder, genocide, rape, incest, torture, sadism, terrorism, arson, psychological cruelity, imprisionment, subjugation, exploitation, fuedalistic barbarism, insults, plots and schemes, revenge, rage, envy, jealousy, hunger for power, greed, racism, prejudice and lots blood.  Maybe he should be congratulated for his thoroughness because I cannot think of one negative human action or emotion that he has ommitted.  Sadly even the akward sex scenes could be written better by any average 18 y.o. with access to a computer. To balance this nastiness almost nothing of human decency, kindness or empathy appears in any character anywhere.  As you plod your weary but horrified way along through the pages you begin to realize that plotwise very little actually ever happens!  The characters wander here and there, generally in a state of suffering (which suffering is of course described in great detail), savaging one other. Once a book there is a war. Every course of every feast is described in agonizing detail.  You are treated to microscopic descriptions of every knights armor and weaponry ad nauseum. You are \\"Ser-ed\\", my lord-ed\\" and \\"your grac-ed and toadyed to death.  You lose track of all the lords, kings, great houses, titles,banners, symbols, etc. which I must admit Mr. Martin ingeniously is able to organize  but beyond which are a distraction and who really cares anyway. He must have written these books with reams of charts covering every wall in his home.  His fantastic inventions of gods,direwolves, dragons, shapeshifters, giants, shadowcats, etc. may be fanciful but they are not imaginative.  Most of the fantasy in these books is worn out reworked King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table on meth.  If you are looking for creative literature that reveals something interesting about our humanity and is at the same time entertaining, look elsewhere.  A Tolkien he is definitely not.

B001HADE00|5.0|Ratt's debut album Out of the Cellar is often referred to as Glam and Hair Metal but truth is, Out of the Cellar was very much what would be considered a metal album during the 1980's, and at that point in 1984 it certainly was metal. Ratt is in fact a little edgier than many of the other glam bands and had more in common with Motley Crue than Poison.  The band is one of the better Glam bands, one of those that really are worth listening to as they had a certain attitude that made them interesting and less of a \\"soft\\" band than other Glam bands. Out of the Cellar is very much a masterpiece of Glam Metal just like Led Zeppelin IV is an essential Hard-rock album, just like British Steel is an iconic Metal album, just like Master of Puppets is a masterpiece of Thrash Metal. OOTC is one of the best of its kind is what I mean, it's one of the best Glam AND 1980's rock albums.<br /><br />When people think of Ratt the first song that usually comes to mind is Round and Round and it's definitely the band's signature song. The band had the right timing with this song and its video which MTV aired quite a lot back then.  However, there is a lot more to Ratt than this great song. Opening track Wanted Man is an excellent opener, very edgy and heavy, one of the album's best songs. You're In Trouble is very enjoyable, a good catchy song that has all the right elements which makes OOTC a strong album. I quite like Lack of Communication, Pearcy sounds very energetic and angry on this one, lots of attitude. Back For More is an amazing rocking ballad, it rocks and it's not a power ballad, it just has a soft chorus and it's one of the album's strongest tracks. Morning After and I'm Insane are good rockers.  I'm not a huge fan of She Wants Money but those 10 tracks rock and together make a very good album. Point is, although I have not gone through all the album's songs, that there is more to Ratt and Out of the Cellar than Round and Round.<br /><br />Stephen Pearcy's vocals are effective, he has a good strong voice with a certain uniqueness to it. His vocals are different in that they're not as high pitched or soft as many of the Glam band frontmans. Robbin Crosby and Warren Demartini are excellent guitarist providing great riffs and neat solos. I like the tight and dirty rhythm section of Juan Croucier and Bobby Blotzer (Blotzer especially is an underrated drummer, just listen to the time changes he makes and his constant, solid drumming).  I just love the overall feeling, there's a certain youthful innocence to Out of the Cellar that was captured on record and that's very representative of the scene at time in L.A.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Ratt it doesn't get any better than this. They could never outdo their debut album although they have released some good albums afterwards such as Invasion of Your Privacy and Dancing Undercover. With respect to the bands other albums (I really like IOYP and the more recent Infestation), Out of the Cellar remains the best Ratt album and the only one that would be considered essential for a hard rock/metal collection. I know I've spent more than my share of time spinning this album \\"Round and Round\\"! If you're a fan of 1980's metal and Glam then this one is not to be missed.  Not perfect but then again, Ratt never aimed to be. 4.5/5 stars for this one, very recommended.d strong voice with a certain uniqueness to it.

B004UXUXGE|4.0|It has become impossible to separate the persona of Warner Herzog from his films. This is perhaps most evident in his documentaries where his distinct accented voiceover never for a second allows us to forget we are being guided through one of Herzog's obsessive inquiries into what makes us human. Simultaneously donning the guise of all controlling deity and subversive trickster--Zeus and Hermes both--Herzog carefully leads us through his world even as he befuddles us with dizzyingly obtuse, impossible to answer questions.    In many ways Herzog seems like the perfect companion to travel down the winding path between stalactites and stalagmites to uncover pictoral images so old they've been lost to human memory for tens of thousands of years. The Cave of Forgotten Dreams mostly takes place in the Chauvet Cave in France, which has housed the oldest known instance of human drawings in existence. These images were first etched into the cave wall nearly 32,000 years ago and were preserved from the ravages of wind, rain, and outside air thanks to the improbable fortunes of an avalanche that sealed the cave opening. The cave was rediscovered in 1994 by Eliette Brunel-Deschamps, Christian Hillaire, and Jean-Marie Chauvet, and since then access to the cave has been strictly regulated by the French government, granting access only to a handful of scientists. Even Herzog and his team have had their access curtailed. They are allowed only three filmmakers at a time, meaning each member of Herzog's trio must take on multiple filmmaking duties, including Herzog himself; they must never step from the manmade platform; and they are limited to no more than a couple of hours of time for each visit.    The Chauvet Cave provides Herzog with a quixotic starting point for him to pose questions about who were these humans who drew these images of ancient horses and rhinoceroses and do they bear any resemblance to who we are in the contemporary world. Does a constant of human nature bridge the yawning gap of 32,000 years between art of prehistory and art of today, or have we transformed so radically over the millennia that the function of art from 30,000 B.C.E. bears little resemblance to the function of art of the 21st century? Of course, it is likely that the viewer is no closer to answering these questions before watching the film than after, but just because a question has no answer does not mean we can't profit from posing it.    Naturally, Herzog presents variations of these inquiries to the scientists who work on the Chauvet Cave. Perhaps one of the most interesting responses comes in the form of an anecdote regarding Aboriginal painting in Australia. There several Aboriginal drawings have religious significance and over the years, as the elements strip these images of their luster, the local Aborigines touch them up from time to time. An anthropologist once asked one of those restoring the paintings why he continues to repaint the art. He replied that he is not the one doing the painting. The aborigine's answer may seem quixotic to the ears of an outsider, but it does suggest that there is a larger force at work in an artist, something transcendent that forces us to create. And yet, the disconnect between how the Aborigine and the Westerner sees art makes us question whether we can really connect the art of the Chauvet Cave to the paintings hanging at your local institute of contemporary art. After all, the assumption of a singular author that underlines the Westerners question is a relatively modern phenomenon. As much as this answer illuminates it also obfuscates.    There may or may not be a transcendence that connects the art of prehistoric man with art of today, but that does not mean that Herzog is not going to look for it. Herzog notes that the cramped quarters of the cave make it impossible for them to film without also unveiling the process of filmmaking itself. Cameras and boom mikes are visible throughout the film. Our ability tosee the man behind the curtain allows us to realize that as we sit in a darkened theater we may in fact be participating in the same ritual as those who first scrawled those images on the cave wall. Several times during the film Herzog allows his camera to slowly linger on the images themselves, allowing us to bend time and to experience as closely as is possible the viewpoint of those who first saw these images so long ago. As Herzog's camera forces us to stare intently on the cave paintings, I couldn't help but remember a similar scene at the end of the Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's movie on medieval icon painter Andrei Rublev. Andrei Rublev is a deliberately paced film composed almost entirely in black and white. But at the end of the film the frame blooms into color as we finally see images of Rublev's work. Tarkovsky's slow pan over images of religious icons struck me as strangely reminiscent of Herzog's similar technique in Cave of Forgotten Dreams, suggesting that each work of art, despite its separation of unthinkable eons, shares a spiritual purpose, even if the term \\"spiritual\\" might be too much of a burden for any single word to carry.    If you are lucky enough to see Cave of Forgotten Dreams in theaters then there is a good chance you saw it in 3D. The idea of filming a documentary about cave paintings created with the primitive tools of the time in state of the art 3D is so daffy that it could only come from the mind of Warner Herzog. But unlike most 3D films in the Cineplex, this isn't a quick scheme to charge higher ticket prices. In some ways 3D is necessary to truly appreciate the artistry of the cave paintings because the artists utilized the uneven surface to suggest movement and texture. The film is also taking us into a place that is so restricted that less than a dozen people have access to the cave at any given time. A film in 3D is the closest any of us will get to actually standing in front of this artwork.    If The Cave of Forgotten Dreams has any downfalls it is that Herzog poses his unanswerable questions to people who are perhaps not the best suited for engaging them. Most of Herzog's subjects are culled from the field of science and bring great insight into the mechanics of the cave and the art. But when it comes to the larger questions of human nature, culture, and meaning, they seem somewhat flummoxed. It would have perhaps helped Herzog if he had spoken to religion, cultural, and art scholars in addition to scientists. My guess is that these scholars could have not only complicated Herzog's question but also asked a few of their own.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|A four-year old girl sets sail from 1913 London for Australia without supervision. Where is \\"the Authoress,\\" the one whom the girl was told would return? In this compelling mystery, Norton sets the stage for several main characters, telling the tale from their unique perspective(s). This narrative switch is one of the things that made the novel exciting to read. The reader gets to know all the important characters in the book in a way that is not possible with a single narrative voice.<br /><br />A novelist of fairy tales,  \\"the Authoress,\\" or, Eliza Makepeace, is central in a story where hardship, family and circumstance combine to weave together an intricate story of heartache that ultimately leads to an ending we can live with. Told in three different eras: 1913, 1975 and 2005; the different generations of women are remarkably similar. Nell, the four-year old now grown up, discovers that the Australian family that  took her in upon finding her at the wharf is not her biological family.  Feeling disillusioned and without an anchor, Nell changes her life's path and  in her later years, determines to discover who she really is. After her adoptive father's death, an inherited suitcase sparks the clues she  needs to solve the lifelong mystery of her identity.<br /><br />Alas, Nell will never culminate this circle of knowledge. A life circumstance beyond her control arrests her progress and she sacrifices her goal for something she feels is more important. After her death, she leaves a tantalizing clue to her only granddaughter, a kindred spirit who has the same desire for closure; but for different reasons. Suffering from a traumatic event in her past, this quest is just the catharsis Cassandra  needs to finally move forward. The adventure gives her a new lease on life and she wants what is there for the taking.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is certainly a fantastic mystery, but it is Cassandra's hope that shimmers just under the surface that we desperately wish for her. The reader crosses his or her fingers in the hopes that she will grab it and hold on...engaging in this new life that she could have.<br /><br />One caveat: other reviewers have mentioned the narrative switch as a complication and distraction; something to take into account before reading.his or her fingers in the hopes that she will grab it and hold on...engaging in this new life that she could have.

B004JN1D2I|1.0|Seriously Amazon ?  I bought all 4 paperbacks for $7.99 each a couple years ago.  Fast forward to today and it's magically $35.99 for the Kindle edition ?  I won't be buying electronic copies that cost more than the dead-tree editions.    The books are great, but Amazon's bastardly \\"you are locked into the walled garden and will pay\\" mentality really raises my ire.    You will not gouge me today Amazon.
B000002TQV|5.0|I'll keep this brief: there are plenty of other great reviews which go on at great length about this wonderful disk. Suffice to say, that this is true brilliance. I am a 50 year old guy, & simply missed this when it came out, content with the music of my youth & a few others. Mine was the loss. I need to continue to explore Radiohead. I understand that, like another artist of my youth, Neil Young, they morphed from one musical style to another over their career, & some would not appeal to me. But this one is wonderful.
B000077VR3|5.0|Here we are now--entertain us!  The red curtain parts and you are sucked down into the vortex of Paris in its late 19th-century decadence.  While workers toil in factories and sweatshops, artists and writers beat their creativity to a froth with infusions of absinthe and morphine.  At night, the syphilis-ridden aristocracy flock to be entertained by the exotic denizens of the Moulin Rouge.  And if you think the cancan is romantic, you've failed to realize that all those legs in the air are making the same gesture as an erect middle finger. (Voulez-vous?) Then She appears--Satine, the \\"Sparkling Diamond,\\" whose crystalline skin conceals a terrible, tubercular secret.  Christian, a penniless poet who seeks truth and beauty, is besotted.  Also besotted is a certain Duke, who wants Satine to have supper with him, an occasion at which she will be not only the guest of honor but also the main course, in a manner of speaking.  Buffoonery, magic, and a Bollywood extravaganza ensue, not necessarily in that order.  Everybody sing (except the Duke, please)!  Everybody dance!  And it all leads to the darkest heart of the story, where a narcoleptic Argentinean and a prostitute enact Christian and Satine's story in The Sexiest Tango Ever.  Will Satine choose Christian's love, or the most expensive diamond necklace ever made for a movie, given to her by the Duke?  Will the show go on, or will Satine die in the middle of it, coughing up what's left of her lungs?  Will Toulouse-Lautrec have a little more absinthe?  And-the most important question of all--is this a serious exploration of love in an insane asylum or just an extravagant joke on us?  The answer is, Absolutely--and it's all spectacular, spectacular!
0307595579|5.0|A tragedy of epic proportions; we will never read additional work  from Larsson as he's now deceased! \\"Wow,\\" doesn't even begin to cover the exhaustively complex plot that leaves one breathless in anticipation for the next page.  Larsson had me from page one with an extremely complicated prose ( as first) which lays the groundwork for a story that simply cannot be easily solved or understood until the very end; a stunning, terribly potent read.<br /><br />Do not be put off by the first forty pages or so, the promise of an excellent book was always there but it is a \\"slow-burn,\\" which doesn't begin to realize it's potential until that time. The story needs this foundation so that it may be understood as things race along in the story's progression.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, a greatly demoralized girl who is a genius, becomes key in a story of insane human dysfunction, crime and [human] discipline as she unravels a mystery with not an ounce of confidence, relying on instincts of self-preservation and extreme intellect alone. She begins an unlikely alliance with Millennium Editor-and-Chief, Mikael Bloomkvist, and together, they are much more than apart. For the first time in her life, her asocial behavior is put to the test when she discovers there may be another human being worthy of her trust. A character portrait the likes of which I've never read.<br /><br />Bloomkvist is railroaded into a terrible position and must serve time for a crime whose validity is cast-in-shadow. Simultaneously, he is asked to use his extensive investigative abilities to find new clues to a very old disappearance. When it becomes apparent that there is much more than that, he involves Salander, which by her very being changes both their lives. Moral dilemma and professional ethics battle fiercely in the last third of the book when the two do not know which to be bound by.<br /><br />Although the characterization is excellent, it is the intense prose that grabs attention. Everyone is so vital in this book, even if they're \\"small\\", however, it is Lisbeth that enthralls. In absolute paradox she is as fragile as a poppy in a rainstorm but as fierce as a lion.<br /><br />This trilogy was submitted to be published shortly before Larsson succumbed to a fatal heart attack; what a literary talent and a heck of a mystery, don't miss this read!y're \\"small\\", however, it is Lisbeth that enthralls.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|it makes for a great time killer. it gets progressively harder as the levels increase, which i consider to be a bonus as sometimes people make games too easy
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game looks fun but will not run on Casio GzOne Commando.  When attempting to run, app displays loading hourglass then blank screen, music plays after a small wait but otherwise unresponsive.  Soft reset of phone, clearing game data then relaunching, and moving app to SD card were all techniques unsuccessful in getting it to run.  Very much hope to see an update in the future.

B004E0Z4XK|3.0|I have to agree with Jeff on this one. Classic Edda del-Orso this isn't. Class Alessandroni this isn't. Norah Jones's tracks are good Norah Jones but poor Spaghetti Western. I am not sure how Burton could take the original muscicians, an original studio, and inspiration from some of Morricone's classic soundtracks and then created something so distant from what one would expect from the Maestro himself. I have always been amazed that so few composers, Italians included, have been able to sustain the Morricone sound for an entire movie, even when they are trying really hard to imitate his sound. These people couldn't do it for 35 minutes (although I admit they really weren't trying to imitate, only pay tribute). Having said all of that, the album bears repeated listening and fans of spaghetti western music could do worse (Jim Zorn, anyone?).
0316666343|5.0|Wow, what a novel this is. Poignant, entreating and terribly relevant to current time but placed in the 1970s, this has a message for all, that perceived evil can have a face, one that we recognize.<br /><br />A wonderfully typical teenager named Susie shortcuts through a cornfield on her way home from junior high when she is approached by her murderer. (An interesting component to this book is Susie narrates for almost the entire book after her death.) Following the horrendous death scene in which Susie realizes she'll die from the inception, there is a riveting and curious unfolding of multi-dimensional consequences based on the grief of the family. Susie watches these events occur while she lives in a \\"heaven\\" of her making. The \\"heaven\\" is both a prison and a blessing. She achieves some things that bring her comfort but yearns to assist her family through their grief process. Unable to do so , she resigns herself to watching their lives advance without her culminating to a final \\"goodbye,\\" that is surprising but provides closure for everyone.<br /><br />This was a diverse work that \\"speaks\\" to everyone but may be too horrific for children under eighteen. That said, it is an excellent illustration for this mid-teen age group for them to be aware of the potential dangers of adults they would assume they could trust. The moral of this story is that no one can be protected all the time and to listen to your instincts at all times. A unique, can't-put-down book!
B000002TYX|5.0|The essential recorded history of the Quarrymen and the Beatles. The first Beatles recording (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison) In Spite Of All The Danger is on this collection, as is the Harrison sung classic, Sheik of Araby.  This is a fantastic collection, well remastered, and as I said, essential to any Beatles collection.
0385736002|4.0|I'm an adult that loves fantasy/sci-fi books, and only recently came across this series. I love the concept - every character is based on either real historical personages that have become immortal (Joan of Arc, John Dee, Nicholas Flamel, Machiavelli, etc.) or mythological/folklore deities and creatures pulled from cultures all around the world, and all different time periods. These beings all have supernatural powers of some sort, are united in various factions, and fighting for the future of the world, unbeknownst to most humans. Their battles are often written off in the press as the result of natural or man-made disasters, adding a special connection to this point in history, with so many end-times/2012 predictions currently getting coverage in the press, as well as extreme natural disasters. The result is a compelling occult story, but still seemingly relevant to today.<br /><br />I have already found myself googling several characters and/or creatures from the books that I was not familiar with. I can think of no better way to peak the interest of young adults in history and folklore. In addition, the storyline itself reads like an Indiana-Jones style action adventure. As an adult reader, my only complaint is that this action really dominates the story. The character development and dialogue is a bit light. I am hoping that will improve with the remaining books in this series. I am definitely hooked!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I never knew an animated movie could elicit such human emotion. It can be appreciated by viewers of any age. Even if you haven't seen the previous two movies, you'll still find much to relate to in this movie.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|love it. great port. problem is I turn the sound and music off then they are back on next time I load the game. not cool when trying to be be discreet. bad enough for a 2 star reduction. if fixed I will revise to 5* rating
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the gut-wrenching, eyewitness account of Operation Redwing and  Lost Heroes of Seal Team Ten. In 2005, Luttrell survived a brutal operation in which three of his teammates were lost during battle and eight additional servicemen died when their helicopter was shot down by the Taliban in a failed rescue attempt.<br /><br />When sent on a mission to capture an Al-Qaeda leader, the team finds themselves in a dangerous, last-stand type of battle, with the subsequent capture and ultimate hiding and safeguarding of Luttrell, he finds there is decency in strange places and also great treachery.<br /><br />One doesn't have to be Democratic or Republican to appreciate courage as seen in this rare account of battlefield bravery. To say that Luttrell is patriotic and does the right thing even when to do so is against all (personal) safety, is an understatement. The accounting of these mens' bravery [alone] is worth reading the book. It is unfathomable courage and was so vividly written as to have felt like one was watching the story unfold in all it's honorific glory.<br /><br />Perfect read for people who wish to know more about what our servicemen sacrifice for our freedoms and country;additionally [great] reading for the non-fiction and war/military genre fans. This work would be a perfect resource material for senior high students.
B003TJ4YU6|4.0|I got this for 13.99 at Target. It's a good DVD. The audio is pretty good on stereo, but is pretty lifeless in the 5.1 remix. I have a good 5.1 system, with proper 5.1 hook ups, and the surround mix is more mono than the mono is! Regardless, it's cool to see this historic event on DVD at all. The video looks decent enoujgh fort the age, it's soft but there's not any specks and stuff really. It's pretty enjoyable and if you are a beatle fan you should get it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is hilarious and fun. The first time I had played this game was for my Nintendo DS, and I had put it down after a while because I dont always carry that around with me, but now having it on my phone, I find myself dipping into a level as soon as I have a few spare minutes. I wish there was a way to connect with my friends who have it on their phones/tablets, to compare scores but its such a minor gripe. Definitely pick this up if you like tower defense games and killing zombies with semi-destuctive flora.
0739322125|4.0|Audio/Abridged: This was a great read if you don't take the story to seriously.  Yeah, there are way to many red herrings, plot twists and coincidences, but that is what makes it fun. You need to suspect everyone in Coben's books. The good guys are honorable and the bad guys are over-the-top evil.<br />The ending was a little crazy and I didn't/couldn't remember what the security guard's murder had to do with anything by the end of this roller coaster ride.  Very enjoyable; the character Squares is the best part and even steals scenes when the narrator is describing him.  The narrator is nothing like Coben's Bolitar; he is more like one of us.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|Not only does soundhound present an infinitely better and much more enjoyable product, but it does so at way less of a cost. Do yourself a favor and ignore this app.   Motorola Droid.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Once you listen to the whole thing, you'll keep listening over and over and over. I am addicted to this album.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Like many other hardcore AIC fans, my love for this band goes back to 1992 when Would, Rooster, and Them Bones changed the face of hard rock music.  Even though Jerry was always the clear creative force in the band, I was supremely skeptical of this new effort.  But a few months before this album came out, I saw AIC with William DuVall open for Velvet Revolver.  What I heard was the voice of a guy who knew his role precisely - it was the perfect mix of nostalgia and freshness.  And they brought that approach to the album and nailed it.  The second the album opens with All Secrets Known, I get that chill I used to get from songs like Dirt and Rain When I Die.  Make no mistake about it, this is the best Alice in Chains album not named Dirt or Facelift, and is the best rock album of the last ten years.  I also think this album elevates Jerry Cantrell to a level of greatness that was just out of his reach given the brevity of Alice's recording in the 1990's.  If you're young and hearing this band for the first time, this album is a lesson in gloomy, melodic, brilliant hard rock.  If you're a tried and true AIC fan, this album will bring you back in a way you never knew was possible.

0060392584|4.0|This book was fabulous. I couldn't put it down, literally! I read through the whole thing in a matter of hours. It really delves into his mind and his history without holding anything back. I just with there was a new novel from him coming out to cover the last decade or so. If you like other books like \\"The Dirt\\" or \\"Slash\\", I suggest Manson's book.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout routine is IDEAL for anyone who has a very busy work schedule like I do.  With a 2-hour commute traveling to and from work everyday, I'm exhausted when I come home and I barely have the time or the energy to hit the gym.  What's great about Jillian's workout routine is that it's less than a 1/2 hour and provides a heart-pumping workout that delivers results quickly!!!  I've only been doing this for about 4 days and my pants are already loose on me.  Her exercises are well explained and she motivates you throughout the whole routine.  Another PLUS to this program is that you only need a set of 3-5 pound weights, no other gym equipment is required!!! Believe me when I tell you that I've tried a lot of workout videos and this one by far succeeds all of them in terms of results and time management. Overall, I am so happy with this purchase and I can't wait to see my body transformation after the 30 days :-D!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle App for Android is one of the best book readers on the market.  It's fast, syncs to the last page you were reading on (especially helpful if you have multiple kindle devices) and the new grid design for Honeycomb (Android 3.x) is very nice.    Only complaint I have and it's not really a complaint more of a wish, is for fancier page turn animations.  The Google Ebook Reader, iPad's Ebook reader, all use fancy \\"Real\\" page turn animations.  I LOVE that style of page turn.  It's definitely not a killer for this app though nor does it decrease the stars I give it, it's just a cool and neat feature that I wish they'd implement, especially on devices that can easily handle it such as my Acer Iconia.      If you want a wonderful experience reading your favorite books, I whole heatedly recommend the Kindle App for Android (Or any of your other devices).    My Kindle devices:    iPad (Only thing that makes the iPad good...the Kindle app)  LG G2x  Acer Iconia  Asus Transformer  Kindle 3
B004HYGF18|5.0|This is indie chart staple that some would and do say has been done to death, but it is ruddy great. Opening track `Wreckin bar rar, ra , ra', is a 90 second homage to The Ramones and what a great way to kick off such a joyous album.<br /><br />All of the tracks could be singles, and sometimes that can be annoying, but they are all so good that it just makes this one album that you don't feel you need to fast forward any tracks at all. The obvious pithy wit, irony and verve that is `Post break up sex' is probably the most stand out track, but only just, a real crowd pleaser and floor filler. Track 5 `Wetsuit'; is slower but still has enough momentum to hook you and take you along for the ride. Personal favourite is `A lack of understanding', as it seems to be about me and I like it when you can instantly empathise with a song. The vocals are great too and are all delivered so clear that a lyric sheet is not needed. I have had this a couple of weeks now and during that time three of my fave bands have brought out new albums; this however has been a constant on my MP3 despite all the other music I have been getting. It just feels like summer, sex, angst and fun all rolled up in a great package that you can dance to (but in my case - not very well).<br /><br />There is a twelfth track `Somebody else's child that is tucked at the end of track 11 and not available on download, this is the slowest and most reflective number and makes the album approach, as opposed to a download, probably the better option.<br /><br />Also not my typical genre, but for indie rock fans who like their music accessible, upbeat, with great lyrics tight playing and some heartfelt humour, then this is indie heaven.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is fantastic! I'm on the Droid X. it works perfectly, even though I got it during the free promo. The controls and graphics work well and its a ton of fun. The only problem I've had is that it sucks up battery,  but thats understandable.
1439102724|2.0|have read many novels by picoult and was really disappointed with this.Too many controversial issues all in 1 story. did not do justice to any of them. it read like picoult was floundering in weaving her characters together. If picoult wants to write about controversial subjects, then she should jump in and do it ...head on.....and start by touching on the subject on the back cover. She kind of tricked her loyal readers into buying this book.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|If you like cinematic score, this is a great value for the price. Twenty-two tracks of various scores from movie trailers. I spend most of my time when listening to it trying to figure out which movie the trailer music was used for. Have guessed several, like J. J Abrams' Star Trek and Iron Man. Overall, great album!
B00006EXL5|5.0|Ok so if you're a MyChem fan then you know that all their cd's are very different from each other. From the sound to the lyrics but it's them. I personally absolutely love this album especially Drowning Lessons. Their a good band and all their music is amazing so FIVE STARS!!!
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|Portia's memoir Unbearable Lightness tracks her journey from becoming an actress on a hit TV show to the spiral of eating disorders that led her from a normal, healthy weight to weighing at one point- 82 pounds. The memoir is an honest, and gut-wrenching real life glimpse into the mind of someone suffering with the obsession that becomes a disorder. Her book not only tracks her journey into that spiral, but also tells how she was able to come out of it, and also face her sexuality, and own it. Her book is very honest. She doesn't simply tell us she was anorexic, but she shows us what that is like, and how it looks day over day, and takes us into the mind of an anorexic. Her book ends with her recapping her successful recovery, and how she was able to find a healthy balance and lifestyle which is great advice for anyone, particularly women, and not just those who've suffered from a serious eating disorder, but any of us women who long to change something about our bodies, and who struggle with our weight, and wage a war with ourselves. Portia's not only a good writer, but this well written documnetary shows a lot of personal growth, and gives back a gift to the reader- a healthy idea, and reminder that acceptance of ourselves is the key to happiness regardless of the outside world of expectations. Ultimately we won't be happy with ourselves, even if we please other's if we ignore what we want and feel. It's a strong message for anyone who has lost sight of that when looking in the mirror. Well done Portia. It takes a lot of courage to take your worst times and share them, and make them into something positive for someone else.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I normally find many games hard to get hooked on. I would probably play it once or twice, and say \\"Eh, I'm over it...\\" But this game, IT IS AWESOME! Definitely worth the money. I was fortunate enough to get this game as the App of the Day. May seem repetitive at first, and maybe too easy, but don't worry, it gets tougher.<br /><br />I love it how I can probably play for ~5 minutes and stop there. Quick, short, many levels. My type of game!<br /><br />Basically, BUY IT!<br /><br />UPDATE! Just now, my game progress is gone. My saves were gone. Starting over from scratch. WHAT A FAIL! Fix this HUGE BUG! Lowering it to 1/5 until fixed.
B004BLTNM0|5.0|I saw the remake of 'I spit on your grave' first and to be honest that had me squirming because it's done by today's standards which I've grown up with. So I've bought the original and I would almost say it's tame enough for TV even if you get the ever so light glimpse of dong and of course some girlie nudity. The violence though is pretty tame by today's standards more so if you have seen the remake.    But this title is cheap and I personally believe it's still very much worth seeing. In some ways it has more story and is more fulfilling in the story telling sense than the all out shock of the remake.    In fact I'd say get both. Watch this first and appreciate it and then watch the remake.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I am now screwed in my movie-watching for the rest of the year because I'll be so hard-pressed to find something that doesn't make me say, \\"It was good, but it was no X-Men: First Class.\\" I will go to comedies, but doubt I will erupt into applause again at the perfect execution of a joke so satisfying. I will go to action films, but I doubt they will use their explosions and action so effectively. I can go to horror films, but I doubt I will feel somebody die as much as I did in this movie. I can go to romantic films, but I doubt any will be as heartbreaking as this. I can go to dramas, but I doubt I will care for characters quite like I did with this film.<br /><br />Point is, X-Men is not only the best superhero film in my opinion, but a fantastic film in its own right, so much so that it has the ability to make other works seem amateurish. The previous X-Men trilogy? I'm currently in the process of erasing it from my memory. I cared more for characters that were on the screen for less than 5 minutes than I did for 95% of the original trilogy's characters. Thinking about characters like Rogue, or the fates of several of the characters in The Last Stand actively make me angry now when I think of them in context of this film.<br /><br />First off, a lot of credit goes to director Matthew Vaughn, who in my opinion is one of my top 3 directors working today. The guy simply operates at a level above everybody else in this film, and the things that he does with the camera, the way he makes you feel, and the way he does everything is just a wonder. Prequel films and origin stories are typically one of the hardest things to do in film, see X-Men Origins: Wolverine for proof, but Vaughn makes it look easy, possibly earning the distinction of being the best stand-alone prequel film of all time. The things you expect in a superhero origin story are all here: Training sequences, learning to use powers, discovering powers, coming to grips with those powers, and having responsibility of them are all touched upon here, and are all handled exquisitely.<br /><br />For the first two films, X-Men was certainly a grand allegory for both racism and homophobia, but here it's just elevated to a whole other level, and is truly relevant to these times. The Professor X/Magneto and MLK/Malcolm X comparisons are more valid than ever here, as both the men's true beliefs are explored to its fullest rather than the more implied 'Oh, well, he was in a concentration camp. That's why he's like this.' Here Vaughn includes the original trilogy scene of Magneto at the camp, but then continues after that and follows Magneto in events after that. The result is you completely understand the reasons of both men for what they do, and when Magneto does what he does as an adult, you feel his pain and the god-like fury raining down from him as he goes about the world bringing about vengeance.<br /><br />Which brings me to the action. The budget here was reportedly $120 million, which is less than most big budget movies nowadays, especially something like Pirates 4 or even Spider-Man 3 whose budgets can almost reach $250 million. Those films have nothing on this one. The acts of action are simple. The uses of the powers are usually simple. But you feel them all, and are usually stunned by them. You might have seen some amazing things in the trailer, but until you've seen them in the movie, and the context for them, you haven't really seen them. The lifting of a submarine for instance is a triumphant occasion, an amazing feat, and something that you're rooting for, even though it's performed by Magneto, who you know is not a nice guy in later films. It's not exactly a type of action I would describe as \\"fun,\\" but rather immensely satisfying.<br /><br />I should also say that even though it's PG-13, you should consider this to be something on the level of The Dark Knight in terms of maturity. There's no character quite like the Joker of course, but what the film does witha simple coin is one of the most dark, violent, stunning and frankly, emotionally powerful I've seen in a while. That scene is also a testament to Vaughn's work, who takes something that probably seemed rather simple in the script, but with the use of camera angle, cuts, and the pace of it, you feel every moment of it, and it's disturbing. Then there's the whole Mystique kind of being naked, but not really since she's scaly and blue, and it's never been creepier to me than here when they show the Mystique form in her as a child. Then there's also it's clear use of the F-Word, which is, like the rest of the movie, effective.<br /><br />The acting is of course wonderful, as everybody hits all the right beats they need to with their characters. Frankly, they're so good that they make it look easy, which means you probably won't realize how good they actually are. A lot of people have cited how bad January Jones is in the movie, but I simply didn't see it. She is what she needs to be, and that's fine with me. McAvoy has never been better, the young talents are a revelation, Bacon is sinister as heck, and Fassbender is just something else. Then there's the gaggle of character actors, all of whom have played main villains in their own movies and shows at some point, simply populating the movie and adding more class to it. Seriously, this is a classy film. Also, \\"M. Ironside.\\"<br /><br />Overall, I loved this fiilm. It left me and my mind in a constant state of being blown away,  and it consistently gets better as it goes along until the tour de force finale. Its themes are heavy, its acting is fantastic, its characters are wonderful, its action is stunning, and its emotion is palpable. I cannot recommend this film highly enough, and if they do make a sequal to this, it kind of has to have Vaughn at the helm again simply for the fact that I don't know if topping this film is possible. Also, go to Rotten Tomatoes and take note of every critic who gave this a negative review, and give them a grain of salt for the rest of their careers. As it stands now, I am convinced that everybody who is giving this a negative review either came in not wanting to like it, didn't pay attention to it, understand it, or even seen it. Don't you make their same mistakes. I am pretty sure you'll come out of the movie liking it if you give it the slightest chance.<br /><br />Note: There is no scene after the credits. Once the credits start rolling, the movie is over. If you simply sit in the theater assuming that there will be a scene after the credits, you will be sorely dissapointed, you might curse at the movie, and I will laugh hysterically at you.ark, violent, stunning and frankly, emotionally powerful I've seen in a while. That scene is also a testament to Vaughn's work, who takes something that probably seemed rather simple in the script, but with the use of camera angle, cuts, and the pace of it, you feel every moment of it, and it's disturbing. Then there's the whole Mystique kind of being naked, but not really since she's scaly and blue, and it's never been creepier to me than here when they show the Mystique form in her as a child. Then there's also it's clear use of the F-Word, which is, like the rest of the movie, effective.     The acting is of course wonderful, as everybody hits all the right beats they need to with their characters. Frankly, they're so good that they make it look easy, which means you probably won't realize how good they actually are. A lot of people have cited how bad January Jones is in the movie, but I simply didn't see it. She is what she needs to be, and that's fine with me. McAvoy has never been better, the young talents are a revelation, Bacon is sinister as heck, and Fassbender is just something else. Then there's the gaggle of character actors, all of whom have played main villains in their own movies and shows at some point, simply populating the movie and adding more class to it. Seriously, this is a classy film. Also, \\"M. Ironside.\\"     Overall, I loved this fiilm. It left me and my mind in a constant state of being blown away,  and it consistently gets better as it goes along until the tour de force finale. Its themes are heavy, its acting is fantastic, its characters are wonderful, its action is stunning, and its emotion is palpable. I cannot recommend this film highly enough, and if they do make a sequal to this, it kind of has to have Vaughn at the helm again simply for the fact that I don't know if topping this film is possible.

B004Y5AV4M|5.0|The novel has everything:  a beautiful, strong, smart heroine, a bright, quietly heroic, self deprecating rake, a brilliant crippled brother, an inconsiderate brother that marries a shy quiet girl with a horrific mother, a noble but boring suitor, and some great minor characters.    Georgette Heyer writes so well that reading her novels is always entertaining.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Even classified as teen fiction, this bood is so poorly written it was almost impossible to get through.  Somone must have told this author that if you a a million needless details, it makes you a good writer.  I loved the premis, but the writing made it painful to get through
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs. Zombies for android is fantastic, just as good and feature rich as in the pc game I bought a few months ago. Great time killer, but large size makes it hard to run anything else at the same time.
0060541792|5.0|This is a wonderful staple in children's books, my daughter and son both absolutely love this book, they both did from very early on. It helps with object recognition, in this book such as a red balloon, the moon, and the cow jumping over the moon, my daughter loves saying BOWL FULL OF MUSH, when she has no idea what mush is :).<br /><br />Your child will have so much fun pointing out these things as you read to them and when you read it enough they'll recite it back, it's such a fun book for them.<br /><br />Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.<br />Thanks for reading!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game works on my droid x just fine. Gets more challenging as the game progresses. Definitely worth the price compared to other games out there. Well done!
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This tv series has incredible depth to each character.  The characters and writers also did an excellent job in understanding and implementing real psychology through this series.  It is very real and makes you think.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|PvZ is a great game... There is no doubt about that.  It is a unique tower defense that will have you entertained for hours.  With that said, the game hiccups constantly on my Captivate running 2.3.3 Mosaic.  Aside from graphic issues, when trying to exit the app, it freezes entirely.  When these issues are worked out, the game will be 5 star worthy again.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was fantastic, it was like you were there when you were reading it, I never wanted it to end.  Can't wait until the next one comes out.
1444710338|3.0|This item took very long en route. The book is written almost too simply, leaving a lot of questions in my mind. While there are recipes in the book, I get a sense this was written for the French speaking rather than English speaking readers.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The adventure mode is a bit short, but this is a very fun and addicting game, I downloaded the game when it was free, but if I would've paid full price for this game, I'm pretty sure I would've been disappointed with the length of this game.
B003VOUGV0|3.0|concise little pop songs with a talented singer belting them out assist this album in avoiding being a complete sleeper. While I wouldn't classify it as a must have I would say it's worth a listen.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|If you are the kind that refers movies as an after and before the matrix this collection is for you. It is perfect and the extra material will blow your mind in a million pieces. A lot of fun...
B00521LT8O|3.0|For a short while, Amazon was great at uploading the episodes the day after they aired. Maybe I got spoiled.  But now, it's been an entire week and THE ALMOST PEOPLE is still not available.  I know that the Memorial Day Weekend was long and people had vacations, but this is just silly.  This is the best season of Doctor Who ever and Amazon is leaving us high and dry.  I am so annoyed at Amazon.
B004SBQAN8|1.0|Take one sociopath stalker ex boyfriend, the token nerdy kid, the Australian bad ass girl that tosses out the random sexual innuendos during the last epic battle, the girl-next-door-once-cheerleader, and scary aliens you get this movie.    It was like watching a boring episode of Dawson's Creek with all the lovey-dovey, night attack by psycho-ex boyfriend, and \\"small town\\" feeling.     The best part of this movie was the dog at the END when he showed back up!     We had a lot of \\"Why didn't you do that in the first place?\\" moments with this movie. It's as if the main male lead (do any of the girls count since they were in the movie so little and did so little to move the plot?) forgets he has powers and just hides for a bit.     The book has to be a completely stellar work compared to this shoddy movie.
B004IQMXD4|3.0|It arrived a couple of days ago from amazon in the US. I have been a big fan of Stevie's since I was young. I have all of her solo cd's except Trouble in shangrali.      This cd I'm afraid doesn't really grab and take a hold like it should.    I think the track that sticks out the most is cheaper than free, a great track love it but where are the rock songs? This is a great title for an album but I would of liked a couple of songs that had a bit of an aggressive nature to them, to give the album a bit more umph....    I love and appreciate her past work especially in the 80's. But not with this album. I'm sorry it just doesn't have a lot of the great rock tunes to really give you the interest to like her new stuff.     My impression of Stevie is that, I think she is a great person some-one who doesn't shy away from a bit of hard work...But please Stevie don't use Dave Stewart as a producer for your next album....    I would love to buy her a cup of coffee and talk about the music of the 70's/80's I could listen for hours....yeah right in my dreams :-)
B0052UZIFA|2.0|running this application on a samsung droid charge, constant lag, causes the entire phone to reboot when frozen instead of just a simple force close error.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Alarm Clock Xtreme    Forces you to solve math problems or you can't hit the snooze button.  You can solve 1 to 10, I set mine to 5 at the hardest level.  The alarm continues to ring so that you are pressured to solve the problems faster. You can hit a mute button to give your brain some thinking room, but it only mutes for a few seconds so that you can't fall back asleep.  You can use an alarm tone or a song. A song is the better choice since it will be playing on repeat until you've solved the problems.  By the time you're done, you're fully awake AND you're brain is already going for the day.  As a college student, this app will be my hero after pulling an all nighter before an 8 AM final.
0786956291|5.0|I've played D&D in it's various forms since the early 80's along with many different RPG's along the way. I've enjoyed 4e the last couple of years as it has allowed me to get back into the game I love so much.     I have been considering purchasing this Starter Kit for awhile now. I've wanted to get my kids into playing and they have expressed interest to do so. I felt that this kit would be a good way to do it without spending a whole lot of money. It did exactly that. I've been an Insider subscriber off and on and it's allowed me to play without needing the books. Since I wanted to DM for my kids, this was a good purchase to get us going.     It's definitely not for everyone. Many people feel the need to buy every product that comes out and then give it a bad rating when it doesn't live up to their expectations. Not every product is meant for every person. WOTC is trying different approaches to different people and I can appreciate this. If you are an advanced player, then this is not something you necessarily need. It is intended for people that haven't played before in order to get them started. Hence, a Starter Kit. The fact that it mimics the red box of old in appearance does not mean it should be the same thing.    The price is just right as well. I found the contents to be of high quality. Again, a good start to what will hopefully be many adventures with my kids.
B00428ZRFY|5.0|It is rare to find an album that you love every song. But I can honestly say I love every song on this one! I especially love the reggae undertones on several of the tracks. I enjoy artist that have no fear and do outrageous things, and Rihanna is one of those artist. If I had to pick my favorite tracks... they would be S&M, Man Down, What's My Name and Cheers (Drink to that). Rihanna just keeps getting better and better. This album is LOUD and PROUD!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best game I have played on my phone. This game should come with a warning: game may sap all  your productivity.
0345529057|2.0|Pages 665 - 728 from the first book are missing the bottom two lines of text. The pages this way are more or less unreadable. Skip this box set and buy the books individually.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Quality is lacking in some areas but it's a great game.  I'm sure quality will improve with updates.  Definitely worth it.
B00009PAKO|5.0|i've been watching sexploitation,\\"t&a\\" horror films since my early teen years. i believe these films were made to get into the viewers head and mess with it. i spit on your grave dose just that. i don't believe this movie or other movies  like it will compel you to reinact any of the violence or torture, but it will affect you emotionally.it will also affect how you relate to people.those of you that have a strong belief in god stay away!this movie is nothing more then a portrait of men[the black part of our hart & soul] what we have to fight against unleashing upon women.the saving grace of movies like this for me are hot naked women putting men in their place.if that kind of stuff is up your alley, two of my other favorite movies are: blood sucking freaks & show girls. watch at your own risk.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game baited me with a free install day. Then stopped opening altogether and couldn't reinstall for free from app store either.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Real fun game, froze up my phone 1st time I played it and it lags sometimes but very fun and addictive.  Galaxy S
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great game play interface.  quick intuitive learning curve.  has satisfying replay value.  unique storyline and characters.  this all adds up to an impressive app that is sure to steal away hours of your life.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|best tower defense game by far. high replay value and challenging. well worth the money. bonus levels at the end too.
B004UC1WN8|5.0|WOW!! This CD creates a variety of sounds, rythyms, and words. It is definitely a cd worth dancing and listening to. It's like having a party without a party..lol The mixture of rythms and beats are amzing as well as the lyrics. I love listening to this music. I guess that's why the title of the album is called Love? You will Love it... definitely worth it!! ENJOY!!!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game is well done, but the devs need to work on integrating it into the cellphone world.  An interruption from a phone call and rather than pausing, it resets the entire level.  After a breakout into a call it also reloads the game entirely (a longish process)  The game handles other messages (like the low battery warning) better, although the resume time is longer than I'd like it does return to the current level paused.  Otherwise an enjoyable timewaster.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is pretty fun and works pretty well on my galaxy tab 10.1.  There are a couple of small graphics glitches and some low resolution images since this is not a tablet version, but they are extremely minor and do not affect enjoyment of the game at all.  I really love the dancing zombies.  Overall I think this game is great!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|CDs OF THE LAST SEASON WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT.  PRODUCT WAS GOOD FROM AMAZON. DISAPPOINTMENT CAME FROM THE WRITERS OF GILMORE GIRLS, NOT AMAZON.
0920236820|5.0|I was invited to be the \\"secret reader\\" for my grandson's first grade class and chose this book.  I was a bit worried that he would be disappointed that his Mimi brought a \\"girly\\" book, but he and his classmates loved it.    This is not your stereotypical princess---she is courageous, determined, and clever.  She learns a valuable lesson about people not always being what they appear to be.  I highly reccommend this book.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The screen goes black and sends me back to the home screen after unrolling a little bit of sod.  I did get it on the free day.  I was really looking forward to playing this on my tablet.  Update please!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is the best show on TV today. I'm collecting the entire series so I would most definitely recommend this DVD
B004EJUMT2|3.0|OK, so let's pause for a second. It's mid-2011 and I've been hearing Ghost this, Ghost that, Ghost the other for months. Terrorizer Magazine's editorial staff can barely type a sentence without mentioning them at least once. Are they up to all this hype? Well...no, not really.    Probably the worst part of this album is the vocals. Somewhat rousing at (occasional) best, bland and phoned-in at worst, and it doesn't help that the lyrics are, unfortunately, very easy to hear. They suffer from every problem that you can imagine lyrics having - unintentionally hilarious broken English, bad scansion, cartoon Satanism themes, and the cheese...oh the cheese. If you're feeling hungry, you could spread this album's lyrics on a cracker and top them with Branston pickle. I mean, I do like a bit of camp - The Devil's Blood are one of my favourite bands of recent times, for Satan's sake - but there are limits.    The music is nothing special. King Diamond and Mercyful Fate have been invoked and that's along the right lines, except Ghost aren't as good as either of them. Perfectly serviceable but nothing that'll really blow you away unless you've somehow managed to never hear anything from that era before.    Track by track:    1. \\"Deus Culpa\\" - standard waste of space instrumental intro. Mournful organ muzak in this case. Crappy tone, no atmosphere, melody's not bad I guess.    2. \\"Con Clavi Con Dio\\" - Strong opener with nice strutty-bouncy triplet riffing and tremolo synth, at least when the idiot singer isn't doing his level best to fist it into oblivion with his execrable...I was going to write Hammer Horror but it's not that good, more like some American TV spook-show links journeyman.    3. \\"Ritual\\" - Verse riff after the jarringly smiley intro is close enough to \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" to be annoying without actually straight copying it. Then it goes all 80's MTV rock for the chorus - you can almost see the singer silhouetted against the suddenly bright white stage lights. Solo's the best feature, should have been longer. More crap vocal...experimentation I guess?...with a clown-shoes Satanic rendition of the Lord's Prayer. Ghoul is the one who owns a transit van, I assume?    4. \\"Elizabeth\\" - Perfectly fine. My favourite song off the album in fact. The riffs are good, the singing's good, everything's good. Not great, but this is Ghost we're talking about. Even the lyrics are merely a bit derivative rather than outright horrible.    5. \\"Stand By Him\\" - The lyrics on this one are actually horrible, though. \\"The Devil's power is the greatest one\\", indeed. Ghoul's back on form, unfortunately. Meat-and-potatoes chugga-chugga-slide riff with some variations that probably would have been interesting, ooh, twenty years ago, or at least at the start of the album.    6. \\"Satan Prayer\\" - If you can listen to the po-faced delivery of opening line \\"Believe in One God do we / Satan Almightee-ee-ee\\" without laughing, I tip my hat to you. It doesn't get any better.    7. \\"Death Knell\\" - From out of nowhere, a strong contender for second best song on the album. A bit doomy, then a bit MTV, then a bit doomy again. You'll smile for the right reasons at the vocals, for once.    8. This four-minute song is 25 percent intro, absolutely no kidding. More gallopy stuff, but you've heard the best Ghost have to offer in that department by this point. YMMV on this one; not obviously bad, just doesn't grab me for some reason.    9. Oddly upbeat instrumental outro. Recalls the theme music from \\"Knightmare\\" to my ear, I've no idea if this is intentional or not. Throws in a bit of jangly acoustic guitar because hey, why not.
0694003611|5.0|I grew up with this book and I still have my copy as an adult!  I purchased the board book version for my own daughter when she was a newborn. She is now 17 months and loves to look at the pictures by herself even.  I will read this to her as long as I can and to any other kiddos I have!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|man this is a fun game... I'm kind of addicted tho. plays smooth on thunderbolt, and the levels get harder and harder. I give this game a five. who knew a game on your phone could be his fun .
0756405890|5.0|This book utterly surprised me when i first read it. I had never heard of it until amazon recommended it for me. I think this is a great book with lots of potential in the series!
1435122968|4.0|As far as the stories contained are concerned, this is an ESSENTIAL collection for any horror aficionado (although they would probably own most of these stories already by now).  Lovecraft was and is an amazing read.  There are stories here that chill me - \\"The Colour Out of Space\\" and \\"Pickman's Model\\" are two that readily come to mind - and many more that I look forward to enjoying - like the novel-length \\"Case of Charles Dexter Ward\\" and \\"Dream Quest of Kudthu\\".  Including his treatise on Supernatural Horror is an additional treat!    BUT!    These are NOT the complete works of HP Lovecraft.    This collects EVERY story he wrote BY HIMSELF (and two that he collaborated on), but leaves out his revision-stories.  HP Lovecraft spent time working with other authors and eventually some of these authors had their stories rewritten by Lovecraft.  Those stories - which includes the chilling \\"The Mound\\" and \\"In The Walls of Eryx\\" - are not included.      So, it is not the Complete Fiction advertised, however, it has a ton of stuff and it is the most complete collection in one-volume available today.  If you don't have anything by Lovecraft, this is a collection that is worth the price.  I highly recommend it ... but don't try to read too much in one sitting [cue dramatic evil laugh].
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I am so happy I finally was able to buy this dvd. I first saw this movie at the movies when it first came out and I instantly fell in love with it. The story is very charming, loving, funny, and adorable. I LOVE the theme of the movie about the difference between \\"what you want\\" and \\"what you need\\". I also LOVE the music! Tiana and Naveen make such a brilliant couple. They complete each other perfectly. I am a very satisfied customer and am a happy fan of The Princess and the Frog!
1400052181|5.0|This is an amazing book! The science was easy to understand. I was totally drawn into caring for the Lacks family. What a well written piece of non-fiction! So glad I read it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|so glad its final avalable on android. Works find on htc g2 although the phone heats up a little after a while with the app running.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this app! used it just 20 min ago, but now it's not working! anyone have a clue why? otherwise, 5* app!
B00009RDG9|5.0|Well this story takes you into the mind of a soldier who is just broken by the stress of battle that it causes him to have all different forms of nightmares, which only further ingulf him in his own torment. This causes him to \\"botch\\" a job and kills not only his target, but the family as well, to which he replies \\"they were not his family, and they were soldiers\\". Aron Hallam (played by Benicio Del Torro) can no longer tell the good guys from the bad guys and just kills anyone he feels threatened by. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good action/drama movie.
0061245097|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was truely amazing and I still can't get over how much I am in love with the characters. This book was honestly better than the first one and I almost thought that impossible after reading the first one [[ASIN:0061245089 Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)]]Truely amazing! I know that this is a short review, but honestly that is all that needs to be said about this book.<br /><br />Great read and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061245097 One Foot in the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 2)]]
B00005R62N|5.0|This CD has new previously unreleased live songs.  It will make a good addition to your Judas Priest collection.
B002JVWR9U|2.0|If you are a white teen female, love romances, and never want to emerge from your cutesy world....  This is for you!
0425242099|5.0|Like all the other books in this series, Hawke's was phenomenal!   I loved Sienna's character, the girl, even at 19 had a spine of steel and acted like the Woman Hawke needed at his side. It was great to see such a powerful Changeling being so tender and loving! Although all changelings are, Hawke has that raw power that makes you think twice before tangling with him! The side story of Lara and Walker was amazing and so tender! I also enjoyed the birth of Naya and how protective Lucas was of his little Psy-Panther!   Overall, the book is everything I expected and more! Very well worth the Hardcover price.
0061122416|5.0|The book came in great condition and arrived sooner than I had anticipated. I was able to use it as a graduation gift just in time.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I didn't like the book but loved the movie.  In fact I couldn't finish reading the book.  It was like the characters were being reviewed and not Jane Austin's books.  I'll highly recommend the movie.  Thanks Amazon.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|really fun just like my 360 version. playing on Acer Iconia A500 Tablet.  Major slow down after each level. seems to be with every tablet. Definitely NOT optimized for tablet. very pixelized. love it though
B004LZRRRE|5.0|The importcds seller on the marketplace has the correct (2nd pressing). Guaranteed.. Universal Int'l acknowledged the first batch was defective (missing DVD content).<br /><br /> Shame this happened to a much sought after release.
B004TB6GQI|5.0|Absolutely love this new talent.  So glad I heard Jar of Hearts on the radio and followed up by getting this CD.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|It's ok, I got it for 99 cents so I can't complian.  I would'nt have paid over 2 bucks for it though.  I really only enjoy about three songs off the album.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game is tons of fun to play...   But it takes forever to load, it resets if the screen goes black or if you get a notification or phone call.   If they fix the loading/reseting issue I would give it 5 stars.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been waiting for this for a long time. Runs perfectly on the Droid Incredible. This is how a proper Android app should be!!
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was a delightful book and a quick read since it kept your interest through out the story.  You can tell in the beginning that there are going to be some heart rendering moments but over all the author has kept  it moving right along and since my husband has read it and knows about the racers that were mentioned in the book he also found  it a delightful read.  I would recommend this to all dog lover's since we know our pets are sometimes thinking about how they would  like to help us sometimes in  our daily life of ups and downs.  We can see a movie for this book look forward to more like this one.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game, it's challenging enough that it keeps me locked into it. My phones battery has died the past few nights playing it. I do run into some problems on my epic 4G only 2-3 times so far that the phone locks up but hasnt stopped my play time. Hoping they come out with a tablet optimized version soon, my Viewsonic G-tablet hasn't had the same luck as my phone and it'll lock up every level or so.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Super entertaining, edge-of-your seat action movie that has it all. Don't take this movie too seriously and you'll have a great time. During some of the scenes the audience was laughing out loud (for example: the scene shown in the trailer where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are surfing on top of a car that is mid-air and plummeting into a canyon...oh yeah!)--but all in good fun. It's part heist movie, part racing movie, and part action/cop and robber movie. I've watched the Fast and Furious franchise from the beginning and I have to say that this is by far the best one out of all of them. I am highly anticipating the arrival of the next Fast and Furious movie.
0316113506|5.0|THis book was amazing..It is how our bodies and our mind play role in physical movement.Exercise develops the body,as well as the brain.Exercise,releases endorfans,seratonim,which makes you feel happy and good.,and also I just want to mention/describe this whole book in 1 sentence::   This book shows how much mind and body are very much correlated.  Exercise helps people l verbally,physically,mentally,emotionally,sexually,phychologically,and just overall every human should have exercise as a consistant routine.I strongly recommend this book for everyone.for the price of this book,you will learn amazing lessons,and your lifespan will probably last much longer due to determination after reading this book. The doctors that improved patients health in this book really saved and changed there life in a positive way.this book is just AMAZING. Its health related and scientifically related so its double positive when it comes to education....dont wait another minute...its worth it..and youu will thinakkk me..i liked itt:))
0316044695|5.0|This is a great book.  Excellent insight into some of the toughest tasks we ask our military to do.    Lessons to be learned:  The dilemma of what to do with unarmed unfriendlies is not new.  In Band of Brothers a group of German prisoners were machine gunned because there just was no time or resources to deal with them.  The same dilemma was faced in Saving Private Ryan.  A lone German soldier was captured but the squad had no way to deal with him.  After much discussion, the lieutenant decided to blind-fold him, tie him up and start him marching toward Allied troops.  Another technique used in WWII was to break the foot of the enemy soldier.    This is a common dilemma for advanced troops and should be discussed and trained for.  I was struck at how the SEALs reached the terrible decision to just let the goat herders go.  This is not the time for democracy.  The decision can certainly be discussed and ideas exchanged, but this is a command decision that should be made by the senior officer. I do not believe the SEAL Team was thinking clearly.  I wonder if training at sea level and then operating at 9,000 feet had anything to do with it.  High altitude combat should be conducted by operators who live and train at high altitude.  It can take a year or more to acclimate to high altitude.  Lance Armstrong trained at high altitude and then slept in a high altitude simulation tent so his body would be ready for the mountains.  Training at sea level and then operating at high altitude is a recipe for disaster.  Thinking is compromised and estimates of capabilities will be way too optimistic.    Luttrell states that they had no rope to tie up the prisoners.  Their only options were to murder the prisoners or let them go.  This is way below SEAL level competency.  First, running into unarmed unfriendlies is something that should be anticipated and trained for.  Second,  carrying some plastic handcuffs or cable ties would have  been helpful.  Third, they could have ripped up some of the clothing from the goat herders and then tied them up and left them.  Finally, they could have broken their feet and left them.  Personally, I don't know the right answer.  I was not there.  Whatever they decided should have been supported by us.  We need these operators to be able to operate without second guessing the legal consequences of their tough decisions.  They need to have some kind of immunity or at least free legal counsel and advice so they can concentrate on the mission.    Technology:  We need some kind of personnel detector like they had on Star Trek.  Having a herd of goats and goat herders suddenly surprise a SEAL team is unacceptable.  Maybe some kind of motion or sound detection equipment could be developed.  I also wonder how the SEAL's hearing is.  They are exposed to a lot of gun fire.  This may compromise their hearing.  I have used military ear protection and found it to be poor.  We need some hearing protection that really protects the hearing and can still let the SEAL team hear a herd of goats approach without surprise.    Communications:  Dead spots in the mountains?  I'm shocked.  Communication gear needs to be upgraded or training needs to be improved to anticipate dead spots and work around them.    Intelligence:  Intelligence needs to be improved.  The locations of farm houses and goat trails needs to be known.  The locals have a huge advantage knowing the local terrain.  This needs to be minimized as much as possible.     Insomnia Before Missions.  Anxiety before missions is to be expected.  Anxiety that reaches the level of insomnia is a warning indicator.  Something is wrong.  Preparation is inadequate.  The plan is poor.  The risk of failure is much greater than the chances of success.  There was a lot of \\"macho\\" thinking in the book. Confidence is great.  False confidence gets people killed. Meditation might be a good thing to learn for normal levels of anxiety.    Rules of Engagement:  Holy C**p!  The SEAL team wasnot clear on the Rules of Engagement?  This is poor leadership.  I'll bet they were given briefings on ROE that were so confusing the nine justices on the Supreme Court could not figure them out.  It's not enough to give a briefing on Rules of Engagement.  The rules need to be clarified so there is not a lot of thinking going on.  This is not the time for a big discussion.    SEAL Team Ten paid a heavy price.  I hope we can learn from their experience.    Sky King  Asheville,  NC
0312323867|4.0|the book was a really fun read, much better in my opinion than Something Borrowed. my only issue was with the sender. i was expected to have the book between May 9th - May 12th and i didn't receive it till May 14th.
B0042L78MG|5.0|Heard \\"That Man\\" at a Speakeasy party and knew I had to have the album. Love it. There are times that the album seems a bit uneven, but every song stands well on its own. Danceable and sexy. Just great music!

0545123291|2.0|I read \\"Shiver\\" when it was first released and I found it to be entertaining and harmless; it wasn't an addictive read but it written well enough for me to buy \\"Linger.\\"<br /><br />When I bought \\"Linger\\" and started to read it, I could automatically tell within the first 10 pages that it was going to drag.<br /><br />The book separates itself 4 characters perspectives: Sam, Grace, Cole, and Isabel.<br /><br />I felt it unnecessary and often distracting from the two main characters, Sam and Grace. I felt like Sam and Grace's relationship - as well as their chemistry - got lost in the book. In \\"Shiver,\\" there chemistry was there (but never strong, mind you - at least in my opinion) but it totally evaporated in this sequel.<br /><br />The book itself just drags on and on and on until you wonder what's going to happen. I literally had to force myself to read all of it... There are some parts of the book that are interesting but it never goes anywhere. The book had a lot of potential but didn't use it and the execution was poor. There was so much filler in this book about inane things that I wanted to give up on it, but I don't like giving up on books (especially if I pay for them) so I forced myself to finish.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll be reading the second book... I'm pretty disappointed, really. And annoyed.
B00007FOMP|3.0|The three stars I gave this album have nothing to do with the music or lyrics of Marvin Gaye. What's Going On is an all time classic and brings great joy and insight whenever listened to. I have had several versions of this album since the early nineties... but this has to be the worst remaster I have ever heard. I don't consider myself an audiophile, rarely commenting on sound quality unless it's vastly improved or way below par, but to my ears the bottom end of this recording is completely stripped away. Even turning up the bass on fairly expensive speakers produces little to no low end on this recording (or simply a distorted low end). All of which is a shame, because the bass drives many of the tracks on this album. I have gone back to an older edition of this album just to enjoy it, but seeing that newer remasters are floating around out there (two since this edition), I may have to pick up one of the more recent releases and hope for the best.

B004I3U7US|5.0|I was sitting in the doctor's waiting room, and picked up a magazine. Inside was a short mention of Anna Calvi, a singer I had never heard of. It mentioned that her music sound like it belong on a David Lynch sound tract. That intrigued me, and I decided to buy a cd - any cd - of this artist.  What a wise choice that was.  I love everything about this cd - the music, the voice, and the songs.  I have listened to it over and over and am still not tired of it. I will definitely buy more of her cd's. She makes me think of Katie Melua, another artist that I love to hear.

B004SBQAL0|5.0|This blu-ray would be good for teenage girls and the family in general.  Teenage boys may enjoy the last part of the blu-ray which features extended action and \\"fighting the aliens and monsters\\" sequences.      There is NO sex with a little mild language so the whole family can enjoy this movie. However, it is a little more violent than your typical Spiderman film. For example, when someone gets killed, he disintegrates into dust, vanishing into the wind.  And two large monsters fight, with the winner mauling the neck of the other, who also disintegrates into dust.    The extra bonus feature hightlights the dynamic Teresa Palmer, the Australian actress who played number six, but I was mystified that there was NO bonus feature on the handsome Alex Pettyfer, the British actor who portrayed number four.  I was also surprised that there was NO bonus feature on the beautiful Dianna Agron, who was the love interest.  Since Ms. Agron plays the pretty chearleader, Quinn,  on the TV series, \\"GLEE,\\" I thought that it would have been nice if there were a bonus feature with her in it; it would have pleased her TV fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can tell you that each book amazingly gets better than the last, how im not sure.   For One The words flow and pull you in the story.  As if your the lead character in the heat of the moment.  Secondly nothing is perdictable.  I was never able to guess what was going to happen next.   Third Katniss is not your typical heroine.  By that i mean she is human and realistic.  She has the capacity for good or bad just like you or me.
B000001GJX|4.0|Good luck tracking down the 'ADD' alternative (sic) - this is Herbie's only recording of K 427 (the reviewer above must have been thinking of the 1976 Coronation Mass with Tomowa-Sintow, not Janowitz). And let's talk about the performance itself rather than pontificating on about Karajan's career which should be left to the likes of [[ASIN:1555534252 Herbert von Karajan: A Life in Music]]<br /><br />Reader, the 'Gold' Remastering has cleaned up this recording no end. There are big forces amassed here. They're juggled superbly by the engineers. And yes, one can hear the organ in certain instances (for what it is worth).<br /><br />The performance is defiantly old fashioned - it's not all that different from Karajan's Bach Magnificat on Sony [[ASIN:0738919012 Herbert Von Karajan - His Legacy for Home Video: J.S. Bach - Violin Concerto in E Major]]. Underwritten by the grandeur of the Berlin Philharmonic, it invites you to revel in lushness. God is conceived as the celestial Sun King. If you cannot foresee this approach, it's time to fix those loose wires hanging out the back of your head. The Herbie soup-o-meter goes off occasionally in the Kyrie and falls silent thereafter (thankfully).<br /><br />The soloists sing memorably. While my allegiance to Cotrubas in the Leppard recording remains strong, I soften towards Hendricks every time I listen to this performance anew. Her Laudamus Te is a delight. In way of conception, not style, the opening of the Gloria is not dissimilar to the opening movement of the Nielsen Fourth: both bring to mind the act of Creation and the exuberance thereof ([[ASIN:B000001GNJ Nielsen: Symphony No. 4 / Sibelius: Tapiola ~ Karajan]]. The Qui Tollis, Iesu Christe and the fugue that follows are resplendent.<br /><br />One could argue that Karajan's approach is too suave or too grand or too whatever but this is a unique conception whose integrity is indubitable. Mozart would marvel at the unanimity of approach.  And it makes one so damned annoyed that K 427 is a torso: a Crucifixus would have been a wonder of the world and a rival to Bach's setting in the B Minor Mass.<br /><br />It is not for everyone but it could be for you. Note: if you want a less 'soupy' approach, the Hogwood Gruel Kitchen is open for business ([[ASIN:B00000E43Q Mozart - Great Mass in C Minor / Aug&eacute;r, Dawson, Ainsley, Thomas, AAM, Hogwood]]).ifixus would have been a wonder of the world and a rival to Bach's setting in the B Minor Mass.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|I'm new to this game and I really enjoy it. Very much a strategy game with some action and a healthy dose of humor. It has a lot in common with the Diner Dash type games but requires more thought. Quite addictive!<br /><br />On my Galaxy S phone it does have a few issues. It doesn't disable the sleep setting so during some stages of the game it will shut off. The game does pause for me, but it's still annoying.<br /><br />It can occasionally swamp the CPU as well and spontaneously restart my phone if too many objects are visible on the screen.<br /><br />I give the game 5 stars but the app only deserves 3 until issues are addressed.
B00013RC8O|4.0|I saw this movie many times in the 70's and was waiting not so paitently for it to come out on dvd. My wife bought me the dvd and I sat to watch it as soon as I could get it out of the plastic.  Only to be horrible dissappointed by it missing so much of the movie. I hate censorship and I dont like it when people try to decide what I should watch for me and alter movies because they dont approve. If History has proven anything it is that the studio's need to keep their heavy hands out of deciding what the public wants because they are almost always wrong. So tell me which studio exec do I have to wack with a bat to get the directors cut of this movie with all the missing parts ? just like when I bought Dances with wolfs the directors cut and still part of the movie was missing even disney I bought the Swiss Family Robinson and the opening part of the movie was not there. look people if you charge me all that money for the movie and dont give me the whole movie that makes you thiefs just my opinion
1401307787|5.0|This book's six-word title not only captures the essence of its message, but in fact actually serves as an executive summary of its thesis.  Which - stated in slightly more than six words! - goes something like this:<br /><br />We're all constantly in motion, going from one activity to another, being with one person after another, having one thought after another.  It's easy to lose ourselves in this continuous stream of change, such that we sometimes speak and act with insufficient awareness of the impact of our words and our deeds.  But, through the practice of staying mindful, we need not \\"lose ourselves\\" in any situation.  We can train ourselves to be more fully self-aware no matter what the circumstances.  Wherever we happen to be at any particular moment, that is the right time and the right place for mindfulness, precisely because that is where we happen to be at that moment.<br /><br />Kabat-Zinn, the founder of the renowned Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, structures his book into three distinct sections.  The first part (\\"The Bloom of the Present Moment\\") considers the manifold virtues of staying focused on our present-moment experience, as opposed to dwelling on past events and/or planning for future events.  The second part (\\"The Heart of the Practice\\") offers useful instruction on various aspects of practicing meditation, and includes some very useful scenarios for meditating outdoors in nature.  The third and last part (\\"In the Spirit of Mindfulness\\") gives practical examples of taking the learning from meditation practice and putting that learning to good use in everyday situations.<br /><br />This closing section finds the author very generously sharing from his own experiences with mindfulness in daily life, even in some instances where he himself fails in his efforts to be mindful.  These episodes proved for me to be the most powerful passages in this extraordinarily useful book - one that can be of service to both the beginning and the seasoned meditator, and one that can be returned to again and again for renewed insight into the practice and the benefits of always being right there, wherever you are.to both the beginning and the seasoned meditator, and one that can be returned to again and again for renewed insight into the practice and the benefits of always being right there, wherever you are.
0345522478|5.0|Atticus O'Sullivan may look 21 years old, but the last living Irish Druid is actually 21 centuries old. Atticus currently resides in Arizona, but has lived most of his life in hiding from a Celtic god, from whom he stole a powerful sword. But the angry god has finally tracked him down. And he will stop at nothing to take the sword from Atticus.<br /><br />Atticus may be an old soul, but he acts more like his 21-year outside appearance. He's funny, quick, smart, brash, and completely underestimated. Atticus is a fantastically fun character who I quickly fell for. From his special relationship with his dog to his devilish sense of humor, it's nearly impossible not to like him. Hearne's world incorporates old mythologies and religions into modern day. The characters are as vivid and exciting as the story.<br /><br />This fresh-faced urban fantasy is the first in a back-to-back series, releasing three novels in consecutive months. Hounded certainly took me by surprise. Full of action, suspense, humor, and magic - fantasy fans will not want to miss this excellent series debut. I loved every minute of this fast-paced, thrilling fantasy.

Even if I  have never gone through the particular subject of one of her songs, I feel like I can relate because of the emotion in her voice.  She's a spectacular artist.

B0000636NQ|5.0|I saw Ten Years After at the Boston Tea Party back in the sixties. The bass player bobbed his head so hard and fast that he nearly passed out. Alvin Lee was not happy with thier first effort (SSSSH) so he decided doing another album before coming to the states. Unfortunately the studio they wanted to play was booked that night. They set up in a club on May 14th 1968 called Kook's Kleek in West Hampstead, North London. Roy Baker and Peter Rynston doctored the equipment at the Decca studios and threw leads to the club, hence the raw quality of the recording. Raw or not, in my opinion, the very best album they ever made. If you like blues, jazz and damn good guitar licks, this is the album.
B0031SCV46|4.0|Appearance:  -----------    M-Audio apparently invested something to make their bendy, noisy and flimsy cheap keyboards appear stiffer and sturdier. With success - the new v3 design probably has as much stiffness you can get out of plastic. The knobs, switches and not so much the faders have a quite solid and damped feel to them (which is successfully faked by particularily cheap parts today, time will tell of which kind they are) and the \\"wheels\\" are almost too heavy (but proven to be decent). It's also much less noisy than its predecessors, which are quite annoying at 3:00am. It makes a good first impression.    The Keyboard:  -------------    Many reviews here mention the keyboard action and compare it to a (\\"weighted\\") piano keyboard, which is comparing apples and oranges for most cheap USB keyboards. Piano style keyboards are weighted, often have dummy hammer mechanics attached them and try to act like real piano keys. The downside is that you may have a hard time playing \\"organ\\" or other \\"not piano\\" sounds and techniques and while there are cheap plastic controllers with this kind of \\"piano\\" action, this is absolutely not one of them.    The other and exact opposite kind of keyboards are the stubbier \\"organ\\" or \\"synth\\" style keyboards - they're very light, have a low key travel and both extremes have really different demands on your playing technique and if you want to learn how to play a piano, please don't touch anything like this with that intent.    All those cheap plastic controllers I know rather try to imitate a modern \\"synth\\" keyboard, which is usually a bit heavier than a typical \\"organ\\" manual in order to support the key velocity feature. If you want a genuine \\"organ\\" feel, you have to buy pricy specialized products designed for that job. Or do you?    M-Audio made the Oxygen 49 keyboard feel very much like a spongy, flimsy organ keyboard on which you can \\"smear\\" notes like on a worn organ (IOW it has less spring resistance than the average mushy synth keyboard and the lightest possible action in comparison). The \\"authentic\\" action comes at a price though:    They created that (albeit \\"proper\\") light, cheap and flimsy feel by making the keys extremely cheap, light and flimsy and that's it. If you have a chance before buying, go over the underside of the keys with a finger and feel the thick and brittle plastic foil the keys really are down there and the sharp burrs, then twist and wiggle them with 2 fingers and understand that even your grandma could break them that way, but there will be blood. This keyboard will surrender to any unlucky bump and there's just no way you can use that on stage without a backup for mishaps because I'm genuinely convinced that you can kill it by actually treating it like an organ keyboard (which can have resemblance to bongo playing at times).     However, this is the closest thing to an organ amongst the cheapo USB master keyboards I've seen and I think this might be an important message for any slightly more serious organ simulation user/afficionado. You can buy 2 of them to make your own full-blown organ controller on a budget. The faders can even be switched to \\"drawbar mode\\" (reversed) in case your Hammond sim can't do that.    The Control Surface:  --------------------    Any assignable controller can be switched to any CC #, sent values can be limited and have different operation modes that allow them to act as encoders, switches or toggles using the \\"Advanced\\" key and the 2nd function layer on the keybed keys, which has quite a lot of functions to adapt it to your individual needs. If this is not your first keyboard controller, programming of keys etc. using the arcane 3-digit LED display is actually quite intuitive. Non-volatile memory makes sure your assignments and settings are kept when you unplug the Oxygen but you can send \\"snapshots\\" and memory dumps to your DAW host anytime to remember settings.    Entering exact values is not easy indeed, mostly because the LED display switches back to display the \\"last touched\\" controller number too fast and the knobs and faders themselves have some tendency to jump around their current position so that going from '63' to '64' is best done with a little initial jolt instead of moving the knob/fader sloooooowly.     Overall it doesn't feel bad though and these functions shouldn't be overrated since this kind of simple control surface (with simple pots instead of \\"rotary encoders\\" with parameter feedback and soft takeover and whatnot) are of a somewhat limited use in a DAW environment anyway. It's great to set it up with a few favorite synths (where parameter jumps are still an inherent problem of this simple design), the most useful feature for DAW control are the transport and track keys, but if you dream of controlling your DAW channels with it you might find that it's sucking the life out of it rather than helping. So the controller part is more \\"toy for synth apps\\" than \\"control surface\\".    Junk:  -----    It comes with a USB cable slightly below the morally required minimum lenght to not count as \\"junk\\" and a CD I didn't even bother to take out of the bag as my DAW software or most (all?) of my plugins are not supported by preset setups anyway. It's \\"class-compliant\\" and hence it works  without additional driver or software and can be set up easily in any DAW. Documentation appears to be complete but very brief.    Overall rating:  ---------------    My last M-Audio keyboard (a Keystation 49) took 5 years before all \\"B\\" keys lost their function. I think that this one can't last that long mechanically, since it has a worse keyboard quality and it has much more faders and knobs that are subject to dust, which will cause them to misfire data sooner or later. These things are always short-term investments, no matter how often the box has printed \\"professional\\" on it - it ain't. If your (home-) keyboard demands can be satisfied with this and you're ok with investing this sum every few years, you should consider buying one of those. Replacing it doesn't cost you an arm and a leg (of course it destroys the planet and makes China even stronger but anything has a catch somewhere). If you're interested in buying something solid and valuable that keeps its value until being resold years later, you just wasted your time.     That the most exposed parts (the actual keys) are of such a bad quality would easily warrant a 3-star rating or less, but their overall conception put them also in aforementioned \\"usefulness niche\\" of being cheap and cheerful for some more authentic tonewheel organ programming/playing in your rock/blues/jazz tunes, so I wouldn't feel good not taking into consideration that its big downside is part of its big upside.     Due to this upside it will fail most of all keyboards at giving you an authentic Richard Clayderman feeling and you should rethink buying it if you have kids or a band or if your wife throws things at you, maybe for the former or the latter reason. If you actually don't care much about the keyboard and look for a cheap generic controller for occasional MIDI input in your bedroom studio, there's no particular reason why not to buy one of those. Provided it lasts its warranty time x2 - don't let the ads fool you, it's a toy so well made that it's almost a decent keyboard/controller but still, it's a chinese plastic toy at the price of a chinese plastic toy and not made in Santa's workshop.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Boy, I wanted to like this one. But it's overrated - derivative from The Historian, Twilight(s), and Rice's vampire series. Once the author decides she'll have a series, the plot disappears and everyone is just hanging about at the house (which is one of the more interesting characters, by the way). What -- another bloodless, sexless vampire who watches his loved one sleep? Boring!
0470932139|5.0|To say that this book is merely helpful would not be doing it justice.  Helene Dujardin has produced a reference book that should be on the shelf of every food photographer.  The chapters cover many topics, including basic settings of your camera, capturing natural light, food styling, shooting with artificial light and post-processing (to name a few).  The writing is conversational, which makes the book not only easy to understand, but also enjoyable to read.  Each topic is accompanied by multiple collages of photos, showing the different effects of camera settings, type of light, etc.  For example, when talking about white balance, the author shows the same photo, taken with the multiple white balance settings on the camera.  I read this book cover-to-cover and find myself referring back to it whenever I am uncertain about how to produce a certain look.  This will be used for years to come.

If your just getting into black label be aware that Zakk Wylde has two different sides/sounds; the heavy, distorted, god of metal sound and the acousically soft, sometimes piano driven sound. I don't prefer one over the other but if your just getting into the band and you want to hear their heavier sound, start off with mafia and go to town from there. If you want to hear the softer acoustic stuff start with hangover music vol.6, book of shadows is good too. This album is essentially their latest album, order of the black, done acoustically with a few covers thrown in.

B004I1K2NW|5.0|Just before doing \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" director Peter Jackson (who can be seen in a cameo as \\"Man with Piercings\\") made an off-kilter horror/comedy movie called \\"The Frighteners,\\" the tale of the undead and the guy who makes a living off of them. Though \\"Frighteners\\" was barely in theaters at all, this cult flick is funny, creepy, well-acted and wonderfully directed.<br /><br />Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) has seen spirits and apparitions ever since the car crash that killed his wife. Now he operates an amateur \\"ghostbusting\\" operation that is supposed to exorcise ghosts from people's houses -- the problem is that the ghosts who haunt those houses are in league with him (Chi McBride as the opinioated afro-ed Cyrus, Jim Fyfe as the nerdy Stuart, and most of John Astin as what is left of The Judge).<br /><br />Frank's business certainly isn't hurt by the fact that for years after a serial killer's murderous spree, people have died mysteriously of heart attacks. Then Frank starts seeing fiery numbers emblazoned on the foreheads of people who will die, including the husband of doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado). As if trying to stop a specter of death weren't hard enough, crazed FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) believes that Frank is the one murdering people. But the evil specter is still killing -- and Lucy is the next victim.<br /><br />Peter Jackson once said that he has a \\"moronic\\" sense of humor, and it shows up in all its glory here -- from bug spray dissolving a ghost's face to a piece of talking oily sludge to a drill sargeant ghost with submachine guns, this is weird and absolutely hilarious. It's the perfect blend of comedy and horror.<br /><br />But he's also good during the more serious moments, such as Bannister's flashbacks to his wife's death, or the eerie sight of homicidal young lovers dancing with a gun. The opening shot is pure Jackson, with the camera swooping through a window, past fluttering curtains, and though a hole in the attic floor to a screaming woman below.<br /><br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster. Nothing horrific is sacred. \\"There ain't nothing worse than a bunch of pissed-off brothers... that's ALREADY DEAD!\\" Cyrus yells at one point.<br /><br />Does it have a flaw? Yes -- the opening scene doesn't seem to make much sense later on in the movie. But Jackson makes up for that with a surprisingly tight, coherent plot, and a satisfying finale that makes more sense than most other horror movies do.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant, whether it's the twitchy, wild-eyed FBI agent, or the three weird ghosts. Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Frank, with the right combination of cockiness and pathos, while Alvarado is solid as the idealistic young doctor. But the scenes are reallystolen by Dee Wallace-Stone and freaky-eyed Jake Busey, as homicidal young lovers.<br /><br />\\"Frighteners\\" might not make you believe in ghosts, but it will make you laugh, shiver, and maybe even shed a tear or two. Wildly funny, weird, gross, and sometimes really peculiar, this is Jackson's splatter-gore at its best.elow.

0765322889|4.0|I've heard mixed reviews of this book and series. I went into it knowing that I would likely love or hate it, that it might be anything for me, ranging from one of the best and most epic stories ever, to being a completely boring and barely comprehensible mess that would be a chore to read. I came prepared to be blown away, or massively disappointed.<br /><br />In all honesty, it wasn't the best I've ever read, but it didn't really disappoint me in the ways I feared it might. There were some points where I wanted to ask, &#34;What is going on?&#34; but never where I felt bored or overwhelmed.<br /><br />The things that Erikson does best, I think, are the epic scale, the deep weight of history on all of the worldbuilding, the complete feel of the world, the dense and abundant magic, and the spectacular imagery. This novel is truly epic, a story of empires and gods and ascendents and intense magic. It is original among the fantasy genre, a world that feels genuinely unique and different to me. I found almost all of the characters to be interesting, and am definitely planning on following through with these series.<br /><br />However, Erikson does have his faults, and after reading through the first time, I can emphasize with those who can't make it through &#34;Gardens&#34; at all. While he ignores many of the cliches of fantasy, he also ignores numerous tenets of storytelling that have good reasons for existing, and this, I feel, is why he hasn't ascended to the massive bestselling lists. The problems with GotM are all in the storytelling and execution.<br /><br />Erikson's style of storytelling is that of an overzealous young storyteller rambling out his ideas and stories as fast as he can. His ideas are good, his ambitions sincere, and his imagery superb, but he doesn't put any time on the reader's feelings and just throws it all in our faces as fast as he can. He doesn't even try to explain things, and gives precious little description about the things that wouldbe the most interesting, and while I like much of what I'm hearing, receiving it is imperfect because the storyteller sacrifices its structure.<br /><br />The story in GotM is shoddily put together, ignoring such concepts as foreshadowing, underlining, and other things that allow a reader to deduce what is important and what is not. Erikson might switch POVs between paragraphs, and several times a chapter at least, putting us into the head of a character who will disappear or be killed off 20 pages later, without us having any way to determine them from a character who will become major, especially as there tends to be long breaks as the story transitions to another part of the world and we don't see the character we've been following until later. I've read some reviews that urge to ignore this and just take the story as it is, but I cannot. GotM doesn't feel like a fun, enjoyably chaotic chain of events, but rather an epic fantasy that almost had a coherent plot and missed the mark.<br /><br />At the same time, I sometimes feel like I'm witnessing events, but not being told or allowed to understand why they are, leaving me to at times wondering, &#34;What just happened?&#34; This is particularly obvious in the way that the plot involving Raest was resolved. We aren't told much about the magic or how things work, yet odd things still pop out of the world, and occasionally veering into the territory of the deus ex machina. The involvement of the gods makes the plot more epic and all, but it also means that I've been annoyed more than once by something being waved away as the gods' involvement, or the gods seeming to stick their hand into the pocket of every thief on the streets for some reason or another.<br /><br />I think Erikson has overstretched a bit in this novel where characters were concerned, leaving too many characters and too little time to develop them all, occasionally wasting the reader's time with characters that come to naught. Several characters turnout to be less important than the attention that Erikson gives them would indicate, and I'm left with the feeling that the novel could have been better if they had been treated with less importance from the get-go, as secondary characters rather than major ones.<br /><br />I also think that Erikson has a bit of a problem with description. He avoids the exposition-heavy flaws that some writers display, but he falls into the opposite extreme. Oftentimes, he doesn't give enough description to feel the weight of what is happening or understand it, and leaves out what the reader really would want to know. After reading this book, all I know about the Jaghut's appearance is that they have tusks. That's it. There are occasions where the non-human races get sufficient exposition, such as Anomander Rake making clear the general Tiste Andii appearance, but also some lacking cases.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good epic fantasy with some of the best ideas and imagery in the genre and a lot of solid characters and magic, but is imperfect in its realization. With some better storytelling and improved skills, this could truly be one of the best series out there. Given all the things I've heard about the series picking up in the next few books, I have hope that this will still turn out to truly be one of the best.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|What does \\"Drive Angry\\" have to offer as a film?Not much. It has a catchy title with some high school level writing and over zealous action.Basically, this film is made and written like that of a comic book,but a very badly written one.My dislike for this film isn't because of the gratuitous violence,the poorly written script and dialog,piss poor acting,the over use of the \\"F\\"bomb, the poorly produced CG, or its plot/contents.Pretty much, this film sucks virtually from begining to end...its all bad.Its not because this film is tasteless,the writers and director just demonstrait the lack of effort put into the writing,scenes and dialog.It could have been a great deal better.You can't really pin point anything specific,its the film in its entirety that suffers and makes all the actors look like clowns.Its a badly written script based on a decent/interesting idea.Even in the featurette the writers admitted that this film was based on a \\"rough draft\\".How pathetic.Also to note, it appears that Nicolas Cage's personal life is also affecting his decision making concerning his film projects.He is still a great actor(I.M.O)with a great deal more to give and offer given the right material.I only hope he cleans his personal life up and in turn...makes better choices in his future film career.So pretty much what you have here is an obnoxious film with lots of swearing,stupid cartoon action/violence with lots of T&A and some soft porn.With some fine tuning, this could have been a really fun film,but alas...the public these days are easy to entertain and sometimes the medicore wins in a land slide.The only way i could think of enjoying this film would not being sober.I'm glad I never paid to see this in the theater and only slightly disapointed I wasted the $4.25 and 1 1/2 hours of my life renting it to watch at home.Save yourself the trouble and hold out for something better.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Tons of fun and had many changes through the levels to keep from getting boring....does lag once in a great while but nothing major...worth every cent
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Constantly reboots samsung captivate froyo (2.2) in middle of game play thus forfeiting any cash that you've earned even if u complete a level. Frustrating since it hinders buying upgrades. Nice concept, good art, &amp; good game play otherwise.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|This outstanding, and largely true, but dramatized, series will take you back to when the U.S. and NASA were carrying out bold and exciting science.  The DVD set is extremely well done, with a stunning and easy to use menu system.    Until I watched this series again on the DVD set, I had almost forgotten what exciting times these were.  Several of the episodes stood out in my mind, but the one about Apollo 8 almost brought tears to my eyes.  Perhaps you might remember the troubles of 1968: the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, the Tet offensive in Viet Nam, the riots at the Chicago Democratic Convention.  It was going down as one of the worst years in the middle of the 20th century. As Apollo 8 returned to Earth in late December 1968, after humans had orbited the moon for the first time, the \\"Capcom\\" (capsule communicator) in Houston read some postcards or letters to the astronauts in Apollo 8 that had been sent in by ordinary citizens.  One of them had just three words: \\"You saved 1968\\".    Buy this DVD set, you will regret not having bought it sooner.
6305127689|1.0|Maybe I shouldn't even be posting a review, because I started watching it, then stopped after 45 minutes because I was so bored. I just don't find anything interesting about supposedly grown men acting like 14 year olds, with stupid nicknames and aren't-we-cool-jargon.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game rocks! I never got into games on smart phones cuz they were too simple, but this one is fun and clever. I'm addicted to this game!

B0053EZXRS|2.0|I will not go into too much detail about the movie except that it made me angry because the story line is awful. The acting was awful. The gore shown in this movie will keep  you interested at best. The  actor's performance was less than stellar. I would recommend you spend no more than a buck to rent this flick. The four bucks I spend on this on-demand rental would have been well spent drinking an ice cold delicious ale instead. Well good luck for those that do not heed this recommendation it is your money, your choice, your opinion so good luck fellows and fellas.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It doesn't work on.  Unless the game is, &quot;look at that hourglass for ten seconds, then exit to home screen&quot;, in which case it works perfectly.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I absolutely love this case for my iPhone 4.  It is soft, but not the gel-like softness (silicon)  that sticks to every hair and piece of dirt, this is smooth but bendable.  It keeps the square shape of the iPhone without being too bulky.  I only wish they had it in colors!<br /><br />The screen protector is about the best I have used before.  It adheres nicely to the screen and there are very few bubbles to squeeze out...but it give you a little gadget to help with that.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product set to those with iPhone 4's that are looking for safety with out the huge size of some cases.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Have had the game a little over a day and a half now and with the exception of some frame rate drops when mayhem erupted on my screen during the first instance of the game (fresh from install; one restart later and the problem hasn't occurred since) it runs very well on my Thunderbolt.    This is a very fun game with a great sense of humor and cool art style that's a twist on the classic tower defense formula. You play through an adventure mouse before you unlock a quick play mode and in doing so you get to collect over 40 different types of plants (units).     Highly recommended.
B002ZG98LO|3.0|Generally not too bad, but I couldn't get past the idea of Adrien Brody as an action star.  Give me a break!  I don't care how buff he managed to make himself, it's total mis-casting.

1595826971|5.0|While I didn't play the first game, mostly due to not having a computer to call my own at time, I wanted to. I loved the images I had seen of it, loved the idea. Now a second game is coming out, and this book has been released with the developmental artwork.    Oh. My. Goodness. I know that this is a pretty niche market - not everyone loves art/game books as much as I do, and certainly the full impact of one cannot be delivered via computer screen. I'm sure that Adobe Digital Editions, as awesome as it is, isn't quite up to showing just how fantastic this book is.    The reader/viewer is taken through a full range of things that might be found in the game. The many variations that were tried for the characters, and Alice in particular are just amazing - down to dress designs and hair styles. I loved seeing the evolution of ideas and characters, different artists takes on things. The book is filled with gorgeous art work and makes the reader really appreciate just how much work and thought goes into the making of a game.    I'd recommend this to anyone who is into dark art, or game art, who has loved Alice, or is excited about the release of Alice: Madness Returns. As I said before, it's very much a niche market, but for those of us who adore these kinds of books, this one is rich with stunning images. Delicious.    Review copy via NetGalley

B004CR5TD0|4.0|after hearing about this guy in Rolling Stone and other magazines, but still not having a clear idea of what made him so special, i thought i would purchase this cd.    let me put it this way..after hearing it i purchased tickets to see him at the Rock and Roll Hotel in DC.  amazing!  so good in fact, that i purchased tickets to see him the following week in NY at the Bowery Ballroom.  even better?  so much so that when i was in LA, i saw him again at the Troubadour.  Just unbelievable!    and all because i bought this cd on Amazon!  one of the best musical purchases ever!

B000054OTY|5.0|One would have thought that this truly unique, wonderfully acted and filmed and beautifully scored Western would have had a truly special DVD release by now!  Especially after the death of its fabulous star and fabulous first-time (and only time) director - the great Marlon Brando.<br /><br />I - like many fans of this film - have searched for a decent DVD transfer.  It is unbelievable how many there are out there!  Anyway - I have searched high and low (mostly low) and finally found a transfer that is not all that bad at all.  It is the best out of the several I have bought in bargain bins throughout the years.<br /><br />The edition I am talking about was released by a company called DREAMLINE in 2008.  There are two other films on the disc - Lee Van Cleef in CHAMELEON and Roy Rogers  in UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS.  I haven't watched the other films, since JACKS was my main concern.  If is refreshingly watchable - and, again, the best transfer I have yet seen.  Apart from the drawback of there being no chapter stops, if you want a very decent image of a great movie - try this one.
B000UX6THK|5.0|A landmark in television history, Twin Peaks has had a lasting impact an episodic (story-arc) television to this day. Back in the early 1990's when it was released, Twin Peaks was the only show of it's kind. It was distinctly different, weird and intelligent all at the same time. It was the kind of show that forced you to pay attention and then to try to piece together the meanings of what you had just viewed. I've just finished watching the whole series over the last few weeks, and so I've  once again been reminded of just how good this show is. Twin Peaks is without a doubt, a classic!<br /><br />This Gold Box Edition contains every episode from seasons 1 and 2 plus the pilot movie. My recommendation on the pilot is to hold off on watching the European ending until after you have watched the whole series. There are options on the first disk to allow you to do this. The first 15 or so episodes deal primarily with the mystery surrounding the death of Laura Palmer, but at the same time introduce you the town and the characters of Twin Peaks. It is in the second half of the series that the underlying mythology of Twin Peaks is gradually introduced. The ending is fascinating and unique and will have you thinking about the series as a whole.<br /><br />Good Things About Twin Peaks:<br />cinematic, mystery, story-arc, characters, weirdness, mythology, ending, philosophy, setting, dialogue, wood, coffee, pie<br /><br />So-So Things About Twin Peaks:<br />brief interlude (Ben Horne) during the last third of the series that seems to drag, occasional daytime soap opera quality to the character interaction and dialogue, wondering why the population of Twin Peaks is listed as over 50,000. These are all minor problems.<br /><br />But in the end, this show is fantastic. The last 25 minutes of the last episode is brilliant and it is amazing. It's a final send off and payoff for the whole series. In my viewing experience, only one TV scene has had such avant-garde feel to it, the Milennium episode from season 2 called The Fourth Horseman.<br /><br />There are plenty of extras and the shows creator, David Lynch, seems to reveal that much of the show was created as they want along. But what they ending up creating was classic!!!Milennium episode from season 2 called The Fourth Horseman.<br /><br />There are plenty of extras and the shows creator, David Lynch, seems to reveal that much of the show was created as they want along.

B001NMAFXQ|4.0|Really good album of melody and growling. Their sound makes me think if Bullet For My Valentine and Cartel joined together for an album.
1416550550|5.0|I started this book kinda confused, but the more I read the more I liked it.  It combines mystery with history (that rhymes) and includes family issues, personal confusion, just a myriad of good reading.    Although I know how it \\"ends\\" I definitely will read it again, to better understand each character, when it is returned by the church member who borrowed it.      This book was the subject of my church's monthly ladies' book club and was greatly enjoyed by all.  I intend to find other books by this author, also.    JoAn

B004K4AVAG|1.0|If i could give this album zero stars, i would. This album is sooooooo uninspired and directionless. The whole album has a 1980's vibe about it and her lyrics are so literal. There isn't any mystery in the songs, or the message of the songs. An 80's flare is cool, but she doesn't seem to be able to deliver on the majority of the tracks. If her old fans are looking for theatrical over the top pop songs, this album doesn't offer that. What her fans have become accustom to is nowhere to be found on this CD. I guess that's why she delayed the release.<br /><br />She was a normal artist on her first CD and then she let her own 'fabulosity' get to her. She fell into her own 'hype' and just tries to hard to shock people. The Fame Monster was a coomplete departure, image wise, from her first release. For 'Born This Way', she has literally flown off the handle. The girl has run out of steam. On top of that, she doesn't have any 'charisma'. She is not aesthetically pleasing to look at. Her Italian Catholic-Edie Falco-nose looks cute on Stanley Tucci, but not her. She has as much charm as a plastic mannequin. Her semi-tomboyish lesbian allure doesn't do a thing for me and most of her songs on this album are just a major disappointment. Not cohesive at all. On top of that, she tries to sell the audience her bizzare sex appeal (Which once again, is as interesting as a plastic mannequin).<br /><br />I hope she can deliver on her fourth album.<br /><br />Don't be a drag just be a queen. Don't be a drag just be a queen. **I cringe every time she sings those lines**
B003SA7X9K|5.0|Is this not the movie version? I always thought it was. This definitely sounds like the version I got used to, after getting it on CD around when the movie came out. Although where's \\"Nailed\\"?     Anyway, great quality performances. I love this album. John Cameron Mitchell is alternately tender and tough as nails as Hedwig. \\"Origin of Love\\" is one of the sweetest songs ever, and \\"Tear Me Down\\" belongs on anybody's \\"getting psyched\\" mix.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Rest assured you can make this Calendar do what ever you desire so far as display and scheduling. However, getting it to do that is where it's rating drops. Essentially there are so many options it can be a little off-putting.<br /><br />Also, I've had 2 instances where it \\"forgot\\" what calendars I had on the phone (Gmail, Facebook, Weather, Exchange). It still showed them but if I attempted to toggle one off/on they were not on the list any more.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The game runs very smoothly on my Fascinate and is just as fun as the original PC game. The only thing wrong with it is the fact that it doesn't keep the screen awake while you play. Not a big deal and I'm sure it will be fixed soon.
0880794968|2.0|My complaint is with the physical quality of the cards. The coating is terrible -- really slippery, and the cardstock feels flimsy. Even the deck box feels like it's about to fall apart.    I like the artwork, but invest an extra $2 and get a deck you can actually use.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Yay! so glad PVZ is out! Really good game... Maybe the mini games and survival game will be added in a future update?

B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I recently purchased a used Cadillac that was made just before they started adding factory MP3 inputs.  The previous owner had an aftermarket iPod cable installed, with the male plug inside the center console.  That's great and all, but all my music is on a Blackberry which uses a standard 3.5mm plug.  I ordered the DockBoss and it worked perfectly, within seconds.  It was so easy, and the sound quality was perfect.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga has done it again! Born This Way (Special Edition) is a solid and breathtaking album from start to finish. Hard to believe this talented woman is only 25 years-old! Of course I had my doubts about this album beforehand since The Fame and The Fame Monster are two of the best and most creative pop albums of the 21st Century! Everyone seems to have an opinion about \\"Mother Monster\\" - and so do I! Gaga is the the best thing to come along in modern music since Madonna. Both are highly driven, both are highly talented, and both are masters at writing and producing high quality pop songs. Born This Way is a very diverse album of sorts. I have breaken the album down into categories:<br /><br />Dance Songs:<br />Marry the Night (the strongest song on the album).<br />Americano<br />Scheibe<br />Black Jesus + Amen Fashion<br /><br />Sensual Songs:<br />Government Hooker (love how passive-aggessive her vocal is here).<br />Heavy Metal Lover<br /><br />Religious Songs:<br />Judas<br />Bloody Mary<br />Electric Chapel<br /><br />Self-Acceptance Songs:<br />Born This Way<br />Bad Kids<br />Hair (another highlight)<br />The Queen (Gaga's best vocal ever).<br /><br />80's Inspired Pop Songs:<br />Fashion of His Love (Gaga channels her inner Whitney Houston).<br />Highway Unicorn<br />The Edge of Glory<br /><br />And there's one Power Ballad called You and I.<br /><br />What I admire about Gaga is her lyrics are so relatable and how her voice sounds so different on each song. Love her or hate her, you got to give this vamp credit for all that she's accomplished in such a short period of time. \\"Don't be insecure, if your heart is pure - you're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby.\\" Amen to that!
B000002KOJ|5.0|It's only one year and with this release two albums into Joni Mitchell's career and her sound and persona is already totally filled out. While not a complete realization [[ASIN:B000002KOE Song To A Seagull]] was already pretty fully formed. That being the case this album capped her creative development right off. Over time after this she would expand on her musical styles and instrumentation. Change of that sort was always a part of what Joni Mitchell was (and is) about but this would establish the basic songwriting style and general sound she's maintained for her entire career. Not only that but the album is more conventionally produced and the overall musical sound fuller than it was at the beginning. She even won a grammy for best folk album for this particular recording and it's by all measures Joni Mitchell's most popular and satisfying releases of the 1960's. Of course it's also one of only two recordings she made in that decade so I don't know if that counts for anything.<br /><br />  All that being said this isn't too musically different than her debut. The production is still extremely bare bones with Joni accompanied by little more than her acoustic guitar. Early on this probably made it extremely easy and inexpensive for her touring sceduale but also placed her on the forefront of the female singer/songwriter movement she helped pioneer. Even so on sons songs such as \\"Tin Angel\\",\\"Roses Blue\\",\\"The Gallery\\",\\"Songs To Aging Children Come\\" and \\"The Fiddle And The Drum\\" Joni's lyrical style is very different. She now places a lot of emphasis on abstractions to create a sort of musical imagry,rolling off descriptions of different sensations and objects to evoke a mood to create an artful type of intimacy with the listener. If it's not tears making her think of rain and shingles here she's comparing the loss of a youthful viewpoint as a sort of slow death.<br /><br />  Of course the imagry comes to it's most personal on the rhythmic \\"Chelsea Morning\\",a song which takes it's lyrically blissfull (if occasionally contradictory) imagry where Joni's actually celebrating the idea of romance as opposed to resisting it.

B004DL5K2K|5.0|For Rhoads purists, a must-see is VH1's special:  OZZY, 30 Years after the Blizzard which aired last weekend on VH1.  Great footage of live stuff, and some studio out takes of Rhoads jamming.  Ever wondered what \\"Tonight\\" sounded like after the fade away solo?  Cool to watch Ozzy's face when he sits down to hear these tapes again at the mixing board.  Un-believable guitarist.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album was a test to Metallica. Could they step out of Mustaine's shadow? Yes, they did. BOY, THEY DID! This album rocks from beginning to end. From the acoustic intro to \\"fight fire with fire\\" to the monumental instrumental \\"The Call of Ktulu. Let us not forget the ballad \\"Fade to Black and the mesmerizing \\"Creeping Death\\"
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I'm not usually a great fan of tower defense games but this one definitely has staying power. The graphics are good and the gameplay varied by the introduction of a large number of different defenses and attackers as well as interludes of refreshing mini -games. All this with added good humour makes for a great game..
B00475AYJQ|5.0|My review is one of frustration.  This is a credit to the author.<br /><br />I was introduced to this series by a friend, after my liking the other stuff he found me like Locke Lamora and Game of Thrones.<br /><br />And for the third time, I was introduced to a series that was engaging, well written, entertaining, dramatic, and nail-bitingly good at keeping me wanting more... (wait for it)<br /><br />...only to find out its no where near done.<br /><br />FML
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|it gives no notice that phone is incompatible. plenty of space is available not only in local memory but sd card storage as well. it either will give no error message or say that it cannot write to sd card when you try to install it... which it doesn't need to do until installed since i would move it to sd card if it allows it. if it is a flash app then i can understand why it doesn't installl. if this is the case though then that should be the error message. samsung intercept for virgin mobile upgraded to froyo.
B004L79VUI|4.0|This CD is the best music Robbie Robertson has done is many years. It has one song written by Eric Clapton and two songs co-written with Clapton. Also special about this CD is Steve Winwood's great organ work on it. Some goods new blues, some very interesting new adult contemporary songs. All good.
B003VSVWA0|4.0|Leonard Cohen's 2008-09 world tour showcased the performer at what he does best: reinterpreting his material for a new generation. Its been quite a while since I first discovered the magic of Cohen's lyrics and this second of his two recent video offerings does not disappoint.    Filmed at concert venues all over the world we get Cohen and director Ed Sanders favorite moments from the tour. If there is a flaw here its that the DVD is too short bso much more could have been added. For a more complete performance Live in London outranks this one. But this is a small gem it gives the viewer the special moments. From small theatres to large arenas Cohen works his particular brand of magic. Humble, world weary and challenging the music and the performer shine through. For a man approaching his eigth decade he is as good as he has always been and it continues to be a privilege to watch him perform. The disc contains twelve songs and a backstage sketch filmed by his daughter Lorca.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My phone lags at times for some processes, so I didnt have high hopes for this. I've enjoyed playing it on my ps3, and I'm absolutely blown away by how great it is on my phone (droid x). Not only does it run very smoothly and looks great, its pretty much the exact same game as I have on the console, and being able to use the touch screen makes so much more sense than pointing with a joystick. This is far and away the best game I've played on my phone, and is very addicting too.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I got it at a good price and it came to my home in two working day's. A very good job.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I picked one of these up for a friend who is a big fan of Doctor Who.  I wanted to leave a review for anyone else considering it.    For starters, its $20.  No big loss of it is junk, but good thing it isn't.  Its 99% plastic with a tiny button, really tiny speaker and some wiring inside, but it does everything the prop on the show does.    In the show it looks as if the blue strip is the slider AND the button.  On this toy, the blue strip is only the button to make it light up, and only functions in the fully extended position, or fully retracted.  The slider that actually extends the light is additional, and has a big square bit that makes it easy to manipulate.    The toy comes with batteries (thank goodness) and a regular pen nib just in case you want to use it as a normal pen.  The other nib is 'invisible ink' that reacts to the near-ultra-violet LED light on the tip of the screwdriver.  Its very good at revealing its own UV ink, but isn't the correct wavelength to pick up watermarks on ID cards and on US dollars.  I was a bit disappointed about that because I thought it would be funny to check IDs with this instead of a proper ID checking light.    One of the other reviewers said the sound wasn't correct.  It may not be dead on because its produced by a very small speaker, but it sounds correct to me, and is loud enough to be heard.  Also, the UV light is quite a bit brighter than I expected, probably due to it being more towards the blue end of the light spectrum.    I would recommend this item as a gift to anyone who is a fan of Doctor Who, and also as a semi-educational toy for kids considering the UV invisible ink trick that should lead to all kinds of questions about how light works.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this game will not open on the HTC Thunderbolt. I have heard great things about this game and I'm very disappointed.

B004V6MWFU|5.0|I was afraid that it would sounds \\"Tiny Tim-ish\\", but it doesn't. Wish the songs were longer...Eddie could sing the phone book and I'd love it...This is a softer side of Eddie...the photos are great also...glad I bought it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Well anyone that rates low I just don't get it. If you have a crap device, that's not the apps fault
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Even with wi-fi turned on this game just closes 30 seconds after opening on my Droid 2 (listed as a model that works).
1878424319|1.0|I hate this book. It's sounds like something someone came up with while they were on drugs. I literally fantasized about burning it when my class was done but the bookstores around here usually run out of them in the course of the semester so I can probably make a buck off it to go towards buying a more useful book. I really don't see why it's part of the ethics course, it barely makes any sense. I mean it tries but the visuals it gives me are frankly disturbing. I suppose a more spiritual person than I would get something out of it.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|in the middle of a game when I get a phone call. it doesn't save my progress. its a good game otherwise.
0316056863|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because I like Tina Fey as I've seen her on TV, but she is stretching too hard to make her life stories funny.  It seems she is writing her life as a comedy skit.  Obviously, that comedy writing is how she makes a living, but it just didn't hold my interest over the course of 200+ pages.  It's hard to believe so many reviewers loved the book.  Maybe I was expecting quality.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|A decently-fun game, but it's not 75MB worth of fun. The author really needs to address how it's written... there's absolutely no reason for the game to take up so much space. Especially with the graphics... while they don't suck, they're a bit \\"soft\\" as if the resolution wasn't high-enough resolution (very apparent when the images zoom larger). At 75MB I'd expect every graphic to be pixel-perfect sharp on my 800x480 screen, like Robo Defense or Angry Birds (which are a tiny fraction of the size).<br /><br />Game design is ok... some things are randomly and artificially frustrating though. Suppose it's supposed to add to the challenge but I find it takes away. Comes off as a limited tower-defense game with more restrictions to create more challenge and different gameplay (Zombies only travel in a straight line right to left, you can only choose from a limited number of plants each round you can use for your defenses, etc). Might appeal to those wanting more challenge or variety in game styles but I'd have preferred more freedom, better graphics, and a smaller package.<br /><br />UPDATE: a year later (7/13/2012) and they STILL haven't addressed the size issue. In fact, it's slightly bigger (77MB). Obviously they don't care, but there is no excuse for this mediocre app to be such a bloated, slow-loading beast.
0061906220|5.0|Highly recommend downloading the audio clip where author sings the song. Adults and kids find themselves singing the song everywhere and it's all about a good attitude, (When life gives you lemons, make lemonade type thing.)
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great Headset.  nice sound (nice sub woofer)   nice external sound cancellation  nice microphone (haven't have any issues)(I use ventrilo and Skype)  not so great noise cancellation (for mic)  very comfortable  it packs great in my bag (headphones rotation are great)  they don't feel cheap like WoW headset.    overall is a great headset. and great price
0312330529|5.0|This story is enthralling- don't let the 950 pages intimidate. Right away I was absorbed into another time and place. It's a tale with all the juicy stuff- adventure, love, desire, drugs, prostitution, exotic travel, brotherhood, friendship, redemption... Warning-the characters can become a part of your life as you find yourself thinking about them during your day. Based on a true story.
B0052ZQMLO|1.0|What they state on the product description is a lie: this dictionary can not be set as default for kindle,as customer service confirmed.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|No artist has so consistently, so effectively spoken for and to his generation.  Simon once said, the common thread to his music was 'truth'.  IE  what was in his heart and his head, and of those who grew up on is music.  Never an oldies act.    This album connects all the dots.  From the earliest experimentation with South American music, to Africa, Brazil, Zydaco, and on.  More, it connects the music from the 30s and 40s seamlessly to the music of today.    The music is infectious, the lyrics challenging, probing, and well worth the listen.  He is deserving of every honor bestowed on him.  At his age, he could rest on his laurels.  Instead, he creates, challenges, and entertains as much as ever.  5 stars plus.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|Unlike other concept albums out there, The Unforgiving (They're Dutch so I'll forgive them for using an adjective  as a noun), doesn't have a bunch of filler garbage shoved in there to complete the story.  All the tracks are either really good, or great.  The lyrics and vocals are as good as ever, but I kind of miss the epic grandiosity of their previous albums.  They do use an orchestra here, but it's not at the forefront like it was on such epic songs as The Promise, or Deceiver of Fools.  This album does contain their most metal song since their debut: A Demon's Fate.  They finally let the drummer dust off his second foot pedal for that song, and it's probably the best song in there.  This album is not as great as their previous ones, but it's still top notch hard rock/metal (depending on the song).  I've listened to the album numerous times now, and love it.  Within Temptation is one of the best bands out there, period.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|Remember this one from when I was young and am glad to share it with my kids.  Good story.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|... though it'd be facile to say they're not appreciated. The two actresses are gorgeous and they play their sex scenes enthusiastically, but the real erotic content is to be found in their playfulness, their hesitation, their emotion. Sex is both entertainment and a bandage for the pain of their pasts and presents. If you're looking for pornography you'll be disappointed despite the profound sexuality of the film.<br /><br />Both women find themselves initially unwilling to give their real names or pasts, substituting a cascade of lies in an effort to keep their distance. Over the course of the night, however, they become closer, the lies fall apart, and they find their emotions running away with them.<br /><br />The bad: the character of Maximo is completely superfluous, adding nothing to the story but the male gaze and a moment of fearful discomfort that interrupts both the emotional and erotic content. The soundtrack repeatedly resorts to an increasingly annoying Italian pop song with vapid English lyrics. And, after an entire film firmly rooted in reality, the penultimate scenes make a sudden jarring and unnecessary switch to magical realism.<br /><br />All in all: come to this film for the beautiful (and near-constant) female nudity, stay for the chaotic love story. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely one of the high points of the art erotica genre.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The best hand held next to pokemon. Im such a zombie fanatic. So happy to get the daily deal. Worth every penny.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|excellent game and 100% compatible with the Motorola Doom (at least I have no issues).  every night I plan to play for 20 mins and end up passing hours by.  definitely recommended.
B0000524EM|5.0|I love how they remained faithful to the comics in these movies.  Finish the 5th movie Flesh and Blood so I can have at least one more please (not like they can see what I'm typing lol but just in case).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great game, now i can stop playing the knock off version the i got off of the internet. droid x
B0052UZIFA|5.0|what a fun game! This game is much more fun than I initial thought. Works great on my HTC evo.
B00004YM0D|5.0|My 13 yr old daughter & friends love this movie... She enjoys the 60-70 music even more... brought back memories for an old Baby Boomer like me...    \\"Peace Train\\" jump on board...
B0052UZIFA|3.0|First experience playing this game and it's fun and also quirky. However; often towards the end of a level, when large amounts if zombies and plants populate the level, the games slows down, gets choppy, and crashes, causing my phone to sort of reboot. My phone isn't really a slouch either. Running on Epic 4G.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|not only is it a bit large, but it also won't install. yes I have get space. fix it please
B000001GBJ|5.0|I've had the cd for years.  I first saw them  on Qvc and purchased it.  I was soo moved by the music! Very relaxing and inspirational!  I was recovering from<br />surgery of a malignant brain tumor at that time and  it was soo soothing for me!!  We then heard that they were coming to play at a small theatre about 20 minutes away from where I lived.  My dad and I went and to see them sing and play the instruments (violins, cellos just to name a few)  was soo emotional!  I highly recommend getting any of their cd's because you will not be disappointed!!!!!!  I would definitely go to see them again !!!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|i have had to restart the game over 5 times. seems the add free version does not open after a while. not worth the money, just stick with the add version. at least it works.
0061726826|5.0|\\"Oh my jeebus.\\" This was essentially the phrase that echoed throughout my head while reading Delirium. I am SUCH a huge fan of dystopians and with so many coming out lately, there are lots and lots for me to read. But Delirium? Was good on epic levels. Seriously.<br /><br />I looveeeeed Delirium. I loved Lena and Alex and Hana. Seriously, almost all of the characters in Delirium probably made it to my top favourite literary characters ever. They all had such varying personalities and they all progressed and grew up throughout the course of just ONE of the books in this trilogy, which is what characters should do, and I just fell in love with them.<br /><br />Lena, especially. I love how she was raised so strictly to believe that love was a disease, and she even had past events to back up her beliefs, rather than just being told. She's seen the harm love can cause people. But she grows and she learns and she experiences and it's just...great.<br /><br />And - hello! What a genius idea for a book, by the way. Love being a disease? Being treated for it at the age of 18, thereby rendering it harmless? It's like every other dystopian book in that, at a certain age, everyone conforms to the same idea, same system, etc, except in Delirium, Lauren Oliver used love as the central focus point. Freaking brilliant.<br /><br />The writing in Delirium is just...I don't have any words for how well Lauren Oliver was able to describe each character, each thought, each conversation, the beach, the evaluation room...I just thought the writing was absolutely phenomenal.<br /><br />Seriously, pick up Delirium. It's an absolutely fantastic dystopian by an absolutely fantastic writer. The storyline, the characters, the writing - it all just combines into one awesome book that sucks you in and you won't want to put it down. I'm so glad it's a trilogy, because I am really, really looking forward to reading more by Lauren Oliver.
B000YKE87W|5.0|move over.  Your replacement is here and making a spectacular splash.  Welcome Jonas and Godspeed in your career.  What a dynamite voice.

B0013ND30M|5.0|I ordered this movie for my little princess to prepare her for our upcoming Disney trip, we were very happy with our purchase and it was shipped very quickly.  Thank you for such excellent service.
B004PR71JC|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks ever.  You don´t even have to watch the movie to enjoy it since the rhythms speak for themselves (you expect Samba and Bossa Nova in a cd called Rio).  Kids loved the whole cd, specially REAL IN RIO, and HOT WINGS (I WANNA PARTY).  I personally recommend it without reservations.
159420229X|5.0|Josh Foer was a writer before he became a memory geek, and that is a critical feature of this book.  Foer does not forget his writer's skills as he picks up tricks of the memory trade, and that keeps the book both fun and interesting from cover to cover.  The book has several themes: (i) a history of memory --- why it was essential in Cicero's time and how external memory devices (first books, now hard drives, Google and Wikipedia) devalued the pure ability to store information; (ii) the \\"how to\\" of internal information storage --- how to memorize a deck of cards, or random words, or names and faces --- which surprisingly uses essentially the same approach as was used 2000 years ago; (iii) Foer's own personal journey through the Wonderland of competitive memory.  This reader went from \\"cool, I have to learn how to do this,\\" to pretty much \\"really, what is the point?\\"  But one of the great things about the book is that Foer takes you down that path honestly, gently and humorously, not letting his personal success cloud his journalistic viewpoint.       Ironically, my main purpose in writing these Amazon.com reviews (this is number 154), is that I was frustrated that I could not remember what I read last month, which made reading itself seem almost pointless.  Now I realize I created an external memory (which did also enhance my internal memory by making me reflect on what I just read in order to write the review).  Now I know how to use these techniques so that, with a little study, I know I could consistently rattle off from memory the last 154 books I read (over a period of three and half years) in order from memory.  That would be impressive, right?  But, and this is part of Foer's point: so what?  That would not, I now understand, actually enhance my understanding of what I had read or do much to help me remember the substance.  In short, there is a reason why these techniques, cool and powerful as they are, fell in to disuse and obscurity.  It is not that theydon't work, rather it is that they are not much needed.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This was a gift and a surprised viewing of the Stones in concert  it was awesome.  they were very pleased with the gift  thank you for such great service.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|The critical response to Sucker Punch depressed me.  They just SAVAGED this movie, as if they had all received instructions to \\"kill this film.\\"  You see, I loved this movie so much when I saw it that I couldn't believe that the reviews were real.  I had this bizarre feeling that I was dreaming.    Which brings up an interesting point, considering that this movie is a dream.      Sucker punch is not a realistic film.  It's not supposed to be.  It's a dream-scape.  The characters are dream characters, in a dream that *somebody* is dreaming--but who?  I could say that \\"you\\" are dreaming but that's not a precise use of language.  There is not some other person, some \\"you,\\" doing the dreaming.  I am the dreamer.  I am dreaming and the characters in Sucker Punch are dream characters in my dream.  There is no \\"reality\\" in the movie Sucker Punch (just as there is no reality in any movie).  But, in a way, there is MORE reality in Sucker Punch than the average film.  I'm dreaming it, after all, and within the context of the dream whatever I experience is as real as any other experience (or pain), just as long as I don't get hung up on the existence of \\"others\\" who really don't matter, anyway.      In some films, it is my job to feel sympathy for, and compassion towards, the characters in the movie.  That's my \\"job\\" as a member of the audience.  But in Sucker Punch I have a different job to do.  I shouldn't walk out of the theater with the impression that I saw a movie that tried to get me to care about the characters when it did no such thing.    The movies, in general, are dream-like. Sucker Punch takes that idea and runs with it.  As I watch the film, I am dreaming.  I am a person called \\"Baby Doll\\" and I am fighting dragons and also living in multiple worlds where I win wars, perform some kind of exotic dance, get institutionalized and eventually lobotomized.  I rescue my friends and they rescue me.  There are villains and heroes.  I even have the ability to \\"jump\\" from one identity to another.  Not all of the dream is \\"fun.\\"  Some parts are nightmarish.     And then I wake up.  The lights come up in the theater.  I leave the cocoon and step outside.  Now I have to ask myself if I have learned anything from the dream.  The dream told me that I should have total victory.  Total and complete.  So do I?  I do if I \\"control this world.\\"  If the world I inhabit is another dream, then what happens to me in it is a product of my mind.  I will experience in this world what I expect to experience.  No more and no less.    So what do I expect?  If I expect to be afraid and be defeated, then I will be.  But if I expect to be unafraid and undefeated, I will be.  I have all the weapons I need.  Now it's up to me to fight.  The film may (or may not) \\"bleed\\" into my \\"real life\\" in the way that some dreams do.  That's a pretty impressive piece of film-making, in my opinion, and Zack Snyder should be congratulated for it.    The above interpretation of this film is not a conventional one.  I know this.  But I don't know why it can't be a valid one and leave anyone who sees this movie with the choice to accept that this film is a step further along the evolution of film from \\"story telling\\" through \\"thrill ride\\" to \\"guided dream\\" to \\"lucid dream.\\"  Sucker Punch is a guided dream intended to unfold in my mind.  It is different from a \\"story-telling film\\" but it is not a lucid dream experience, but it is a step in that direction.  At some point in the future, movies will be \\"interactive\\" and the video game and movie will be one and the same--providing us with the opportunity to experience a lucid dream while fully awake, and take one more step towards the experience of an alternative, virtual reality.    The objection to the idea of \\"movies as guided dreaming\\" is that, after all, we are accustomed to seeing a film as a story.  We peek into another person's life and, as voyeurs, we enjoy watching them.  Disbelief is suspended and we are tricked throughthe magic of film into believing that we are seeing \\"real people\\" and so we have an emotional response to them and their story--but this is not what Sucker Punch is.  Sucker Punch is not intended to \\"make you think\\" it is an experience that you have, not something you look at and interpret.  The only difficulty Zack Snyder had in putting this on screen is that the technology doesn't really exist (yet) to give the viewer the physical experience of the characters on screen.  When that does occur (and it will) then we'll have a true \\"mind bending\\" experience and we'll see where Sucker Punch has led us, for good or evil.    Sucker Punch is going to go down in history as a noble experiment that failed financially.  It will also be seen as the event that demonstrated (once again) that \\"the critics\\" can be very, very wrong.

B004RKXN44|4.0|Kiss Of Snow is my new favorite in this series! Hawk and Sienna were so perfect together. Sienna was a great heroine, smart, strong, and unafraid to confront Hawk!  Hawk, of course, is a wonderful alpha. We see why he is who he is today after his brutal past. I loved how, once he stopped resisting Sienna, he was in turn tender, playful and dominant. His speeches toward the end where he realizes what she means to him were awesome! Not to mention all the scenes at the end were just great as the SnowDancers confronted the psy and Sienna used here power to help her pack!    It was great to see old favorites, especially Lucas and Sascha and their new baby. Love them!     I love how Nalini Singh infuses her stories with the love of the pack, humor, passion, and drama. I thought events in this story really moved the psy war plot forward and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.     Glad to see the next book is centered on the SnowDancers because I need more of Sienna and Hawk!

Most people will finish it in one sitting. This book would be a great gift to a marketing department or a young business person.<br />I can also see older people not finding value in this book because they can't see past the frame work of \\"how the world\\" operates in their minds.<br /><br />An inspiration to the creative mind.

Previously, I would say \\"Play\\", \\"Last Night\\", and \\"Wait for Me\\" are my favorites, and \\"Destroyed\\" doesn't disappoint.  I am a programmer, and I like to listen to music that gets me into \\"the mode\\" without distracting me.  This has been on repeat through my headphones for a couple of weeks now without getting old.  In fact, I like it more and more with every listen.<br /><br />It is a dreamlike mix of ambient beats, bass synth, and cello.  The songs are more progressive than previous works.  They start off with a few tracts and then slowly get more complete/layered without becoming over-complex.<br /><br />Moby's previous works always felt like they started out strong and then hit a slump towards the end.  The album would be over and I felt like I needed more closure.  Play had a bunch of slow, empty poetry pieces.  18, Hotel, and Last Night all had forgettable ending tracks.  Not so here.  This is the first of Moby's albums I can say that almost every single song is excellent.  In fact, the album actually gets progressively better with each track.  The last few songs are incredibly beautiful piano/string-esc pieces.<br /><br />I was surprised when I read a couple negative reviews by various magazines.  I just don't think they listened to this album in the correct environment.  This album needs to be listened to at night, early morning, or when in a thoughtful zen.  I really wish everyone would quit wanting another \\"Play\\".  \\"Play\\" was alright, but it really didn't show the talent/maturity that Moby is showing now.  Those days are over folks...because these are some of his best.<br /><br />Good buy!  I want to hear more like it!
1433502445|4.0|What can I say ... this Bible is great.  The research gone into this Bible is tremendous.  I have found it to be really usefull for personal Bible Study as well as delivering God's Word.  The notes at the bottom of the page or great tidbits that bring the scripture to life (as if God's Word needed any help) The colorful maps are truly informative and a great addition.  I'd buy this Bible again if I had too but I can see this one will be used for many years to come.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|First, I would like to say that Heath Ledger did an amazing job as the Joker. I would have to say that the reboot of Batman has thus far been a success and I hope the trend continues.  Second, this is one of the first purchases of my blue-ray collection. You don't really notice how much more crisp the picture of the blue ray is until you watch a dvd right afterward.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Totally addictive game,  one of the best I've played.  Creative and funny, love the zombies. The game gets increasingly hard so it keeps you interested.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Haven't watched it all, but save for the glitches in the Disc 4 documentary, it's so far, so good.    Sure brings back memories of Jul. 13, 1985, when I watched the event on TV, mostly the Philadelphia leg.    Will watch in installments; that's the best way to appreciate the music, along with skipping past the acts that I don't want to see. LOL.
B004LL1HM4|2.0|I've listened to this several times now, and unfortunately, must conclude that it is just not that compelling.  Maybe if I were high on something it might be better, but the songs are boring, and not that interesting musically or lyrically.      The Fleet Foxes continue to have some of the best album art of all artists out there, and you can almost feel how much mags like Rolling Stone want them to succeed (good for business) -- RS hands out 4-star reviews like candy -- but I believe if one listens to this critically, he/she finds that FF are a CSNY cover band, with little to offer for the longterm.      The lead singer Robin something-or-other seems like a genuinely good guy, so nothing personal, but I don't care much to listen to his laid-back angst.       Unfortunately, this one will recede lower and lower on my \\"recently played\\" iTunes playlist (bought the mp3 on Amazon, sweet!  And cheap!), and I'll more than likely forget about it soon among the 6K+ songs on my iPod it is competing against.  Thus, 2 stars.
0142429112|1.0|The narrator does a great job; the low marks do not reflect her performance. The one star is for the overly dramatized, excessively descriptive narrative that wanders away from the main plot in which I, and possibly others, were expecting. The Historian meets a Sookie Stackhouse novel? Not entirely, not at all. The flirtatious quips are embarrassing, the dialog is stiff and unnatural, the subject matter is flat when it could be so magical (pun intended) and the narration, though largely first person, jumps confusingly to omniscient for just a few paragraphs and then back to first person. Diana is not that interesting of a character. However, it would have been interesting to learn more about her relatives' pasts or a first person narration of Matthew, though his character lacked much appeal as well. I wanted to love this book and then I wanted to just like this book. In the end, neither won out.

1586487981|5.0|It used to be that anthropologists would go down to villages and mingle with the people while economists would sit in their armchairs and design grand theories. Now it is the other way around. Anthropology has become an ivory tower discipline, with less and less emphasis on fieldwork and an impulse to produce ever more complex intellectual systems. Anthropologists are actively involved in campus politics, along with other cultural studies and postmodern theorists, and totally disengaged from real policy decisions. Meanwhile, economists are going to the field, not only to observe and measure, but also to make things happen. Poor Economics explores the new and exciting frontiers of development economics, by two young scholars who have greatly contributed to taking the discipline out of the ivory tower and to the village.<br /><br />In doing so, they are following a long tradition of economists interested in development issues. Their elders, from James Meade to Gunnar Myrdal, used to go and see things for themselves before advising governments of newly independent countries or managers of international organizations on the best way to kick-start development. There was a time when the anthropologist would take the economist to the village. Multidisciplinary projects would gather economists along with anthropologists and other social scientists to study a particular location from various angles. Clifford Geertz, one of the towering figures of modern anthropology, participated in such joint initiatives, and the perspective from his fellow economists enriched his earlier writings--before he turned to a more interpretive approach of cultures and launched attacks against what he labeled \\"economism\\".<br /><br />The difference between then and now is that the economist no longer needs to partner with the anthropologist in order to collect data and frame her observations in the village. She has two new allies she didn't have at the time: the NGO activist and the computer. The first helps her design development programs and collect the data to find out what works, what doesn't and why. The second will allow her to analyze that data with scientific rigor. She will be able to test hypotheses and to ask in particular what would have happened in the absence of the program or to measure how much difference it made. The result has been a revolution in development economics, identified with field experiments and randomized control trials--hence the label sometimes used to designate its promoters, the `randomistas'.<br /><br />Has the economist kicked the anthropologist out of the village? Maybe this is simply a matter of labeling. Anthropologists could come up with their own random field experiments, with different research questions that would certainly yield different answers. They could bring a different sensitivity to the field: a focus on culture as a system of symbols, an understanding of power dynamics, and a questioning of the observer's role--what social scientists call \\"reflexivity\\", that remains utterly lacking in most economists' work. Indeed, political scientists are beginning to follow the footsteps of the randomistas and apply the same methods, investigating issues such as consumption of public goods or corruption with innovative research designs. Nothing should prevent anthropologists to do the same, except perhaps the \\"not invented here\\" syndrome and an aversion to numbers shared by many adepts of \\"qualitative\\" approaches.<br /><br />One could even argue whether the kind of research conducted by the two authors of Poor Economics is really economics. It just happens that they work in an economics department. But they do their own stuff, undaunted by academic categories and intellectual boundaries. When they find something interesting in anthropology, they pick it, as when Esther Duflo uses the work of French anthropologist Claude Meillassoux, who showed that yams, a \\"male\\" crop in Côte d'Ivoire, can only be sold to pay for schoolfees or medical care for the family, but not to buy liquor or some tobacco. The authors also use the latest results in brain science--although this is not the part of the book that I find the most convincing. They have publications in medical journals, not just economics reviews. Whereas anthropologists are busy patrolling the borders of their discipline, denouncing the encroachment of \\"economism\\", the economists are busy pushing the envelope of their discipline, claiming new terrain along the way. Their \\"can-do\\" attitude puts them at the heart of policy debates, and the impact of their evaluations is now heavily felt in poverty alleviation programs around the world.<br /><br />Randomistas have sometimes been accused of \\"soft paternalism\\", a critique they share with other promoters of \\"nudges\\" who use incentives to improve individual decisions about health, wealth, and happiness. Banerjee and Duflo have a ready answer to that critique: \\"It is easy, too easy, to sermonize about the dangers of paternalism and the need to take responsibility for our own lives, from the comfort of our couch in our safe and sanitary home. Aren't we, those who live in the rich world, the constant beneficiaries of a paternalism now so thoroughly embedded into the system that we hardly notice it?\\"  Here the field economist talks back to the armchair theorist and brings a sense of perspective to debates about poverty, without lapsing into moral posturing or ideological arguments.<br /><br />\\"How can you work with corrupt governments and ruling oligarchies,\\" goes another critique. Banerjee and Duflo can answer to that as well. Most of their work is conducted in democratic countries, such as India, Kenya, or Indonesia. They tend to partner with local NGOs and social activists, more than with state bureaucracies or international agencies. In addition, they show that innovative program designs and rigorous evaluations can help keep corruption and inefficiency at bay. Denouncing bad governance and labeling country leaders as crooks makes an armchair theorist feel good, but does not lead very far. For the authors, the important lesson is to take advantage of whatever slack there is: \\"Good policies (sometimes) happen in bad political environments. And, perhaps more important, bad policies (often) happen in quite good ones.\\" To quote the Book of Revelation: \\"He that is righteous, let him be righteous still.\\" Poor Economics is an invitation to be smart, not an empty jeremiad or a feel-good sermon.<br /><br />I am sure that readers trained in anthropology could raise many other critiques and show the limitations in their economic colleagues' work. Indeed, they should be invited to pick up the gauntlet, and rise to the challenge. The important point is that they should do it from a grounded perspective--by going back to the village, the slum or the policy council, and try to make things happen as well.family, but not to buy liquor or some tobacco.

0441013597|2.0|First off, Herbert has done an incredible job building and detailing his world of Arrakis.  There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world.  Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.    Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting.  Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons.  While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis.  I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh.  Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.    I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue.  The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.    I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune.  I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication.  For me, the book would have benefitted more if the same detail had been paid to his characterizations.
B001E45XT4|4.0|love the headset, the overall comfort and and style is great.  I can't really  say it has the best sound I've ever heard but for 25 bucks its not bad, but is mostly lacking on the bass.  The microphone is good although a little low powered it gets the job done well.  I'd definitely recommend these to someone without too much money to spend on a headset.
B001FB5634|5.0|I think it is important to see this film because this is a possibility, this could very well be our future.<br />I loved the acting, V.M. and even the child were very credible.  I am glad I have this DVD in my collection and am planning to watch periodically.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i was so bummed when amazon said that this game was incompatible with my phone. i decided to buy it anyway just to try. glad i did.  this game works perfect on my mytouch 3g slide!
B00164KYV4|5.0|HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU is a cute, funny, and romantic movie with an all-star cast - Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson and Justin Long.<br /><br />There are four couples to follow, each with very different scenarios.<br /><br />1) He likes her but she likes someone else.<br />2) She likes him but he's married.<br />3) She can't find anyone that likes her, but the guy she consults ends up falling for her.<br />4) The girl he likes didn't like him, but he finds another that has been searching for the \\"perfect\\" guy.<br /><br />So often in movie that involves several scenarios like HE'S SO NOT INTO YOU, at least one of the situations doesn't play out like we hope. That wasn't the case with this movie. Though you were inclined to think otherwise, in the end each relationship turns out as you'd imagined or hoped with a few surprises.<br /><br />Great movie, well acted with a storyline that will hold your interest from start to finish.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game reminds me of Trade Wars from the old BBS days. Absolutely awesome. haven't put it down yet. great game play.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|At first I'm thinkin ok well I'll try this out but it looks a little lame but no its not!! I can't stop playing! Its my alternative to Angry Birds while I'm waiting for new updates!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I hesitated renting it online when I saw that the initial review were horrible, but I rolled the dice and am glad I watched it. It's not an Oscar-winning performance, and certainly not going to inspire deep, intellectual conversation afterwards....but if you're looking for something entertaining to watch just for fun-- then you'll love this movie.     Great action sequences towards the end, semi-intriguing story, you can answer your text messages and microwave some popcorn without losing track of what's going on on-screen. Unless you're in a film-snobbish mood, this is well worth getting.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love this game. its addicting.  gameplay its fast and responsive. its hilarious killing the zombies with bombs or mines. the animation its just perfect. i wish there was a lot of games this fun. droid x
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Amazing series.  So many of the scenes that they filmed made me wonder \\"How the ____ did they do that?\\"  Very impressive.  Looks great in Blu-ray.  Narrator does a good job.
B004SRNH10|1.0|Adobe Air for Android seems to depend on Flash for Android, which means that it won't run on ARM 6 phones like the LG Optimus, even though it can be installed.
B004LWZW24|2.0|This film starts smoothly, the atmosphere of something horrifying is so well crafted, complete with magnificent scores and hints of effective hauntings. Sadly, the pace becomes tiresome with laughable ghosts sightings and horror cliches. It goes downhill from there together with such a silly ending it makes \\"Insidious\\" not at all deliciously malicious.<br /><br />It is just a very, very weak plot. The story at the beginning is really scary but then the writer just does not know which directions he wanted to take the audience with this flick. It's a pity that the talents of such great actors like Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson has not been fully utilized. There are so many chances to make this horror movie really terrifying.<br /><br />If you miss this movie at the cinemas, I would humbly suggest that you rent this movie first. If you like it then it's alright. If you do not like it then it is okay too. I just personally think this film could be so much better because I love these filmmakers(James Wan & Leigh Whannell) earlier works like the first \\"Saw\\" movie and \\"Dead Silence\\".
B002HEOLH0|5.0|I am a big Chris Daughtry fan since American Idol.  Daughtry's first cd was good but their 2nd cd is even better.  Every song is awesome and the songwriting is the best.  Chris has an amazing voice and he puts alot of emotion into his singing.    I got the opportunity to see Daughtry live and they sounded just as good as their cd.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Eddie Vedder has this way of telling stories through his songs. It's honest and raw. I must say I am pleasantly surprised with this latest offering from the Pearl Jam's frontman. And to have Chan Marshall(Cat Power) and Glen Hansard guesting as well in this album? Marvelous!<br /><br />This is a perfect album for the heart, broken or unbroken. My most favourites are \\"Longing To Belong\\" and \\"Sleeping By Myself\\".
B00004XPPE|5.0|This is a much more serious look at the brinksmanship played out during the Cold War between the US and Russia than the Dr. Strangelove film. This powerful \\"what if\\" film noir (kept in B&W) is played by an excellent cast. This is a \\"must see\\" for fans of the apocalyptic film genre.    (purchased at Amazon.com)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|it would really benefit amazon to keep the apps updated in similar fashion to the google android market.  I really like this market more than the google Android market and can see it being the most used market, but lets just keep the app updates on par with googles  android market, thanks.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|What a great read. this was the first boook I read on my new Kindle and I loved it! plus it was free. win win.
0312370830|5.0|This is a fascinating book which recounts the story of the French betrayal of the Jews of Paris in 1942.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0670022411|2.0|If you read this book, be prepared for excrutiating detail about what the heroine is wearing, how she fixed her hair, what the vampire is wearing, what they are eating, the wine they are drinking, how it smells, how many bottles... the book could have been half the length.  Then when the book had a cliff hanger ending, setting me up for a sequel, I roared - ridiculous!  And spoiler alert, but the fact that they never consumate the marriage was incredibly stupid.  You are going to shoe horn in this over the top romance, then they never even do it?    Skip it.
0470901071|5.0|I love this book. Todd has a very simple and interesting way of explaining dry technical things. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone studying for the CCNA or just looking for networking knowledge in general. Worth every penny!
1569242739|5.0|This book is a great little cookbook on Vegan cupcakes!! They are very detailed on products/substitutes.  I have made several of the recipes and have had rave reviews and loved everyone of them.  I am trying to offer my family healthier choices when it comes to desserts and this book provides that.  I have some cupcake lovers in my family and they could not tell the difference between regular recipes and these. This book PROVES that you do NOT need butter, eggs and dairy in desserts.  I think everyone should include this book in their cookbook collection!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I have seen every episode in every format possible. This is by far the best representation of the original series mad to date. The film has been painstakingly remastered so well, that you forget this was made in the 60's. You will not be disappointed.
B00005NB8K|1.0|Oliver Stone has built a career on taking real people & real events from certain time periods and presenting a fictional account of said events with a few crumbs of truth sprinkled in to provide the guise of accuracy & integrity. Same here. The sad thing is, another, more talented, more devoted-to-the-truth director could make a better film but what studio will back another movie about The Doors? Therefore, sadly, this film is what stands, in some respect, as the \\"truth\\" concerning Morrison to most people who watch it and don't care to seek out more information. Val Kilmer's brilliant performance is wasted.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I AM A HUGE SUPERMAN FAN! I don't know if I'll get this on Blu-Ray or not because I have the DVD set. I bet I'll have it before long. The extras are great and a variety of entertainment of all different versions of the man of steel. I definately think any superhero fan would go for this. Although the Superman Returns wasn't all that good in my opinion, the set still gets 5 stars. If I could give more, I would.
0307595862|5.0|After slugging my way through 2-2/3 of the Stieg Larsson books, and hearing all the acclaim for them, I was wary about reading another book by a Scandanavian author. (Just so you understand my point of view: I thought the Larsson books were overloaded with detail and minutiae about Scandanavian politics and journalismt and zzzzzzzzzzzzz.)<br /><br />This book rocks. I cannot put it down (I am about 85 percent through the book.) I haven't read any of Nesbo's books before, but I am going to be looking for all of them. Nesbos has taken the image of the innocent, playful snowman many of us have from our childhoods and twisted it into something menacing. It's June now, but I know that when the weather turns at the end of the year, I will think of this book ... and have a shiver that has more to do with this book than with the weather.<br /><br />PS If you're a Micheal Connelly fan, he's recommended the book--that's huge to me, since MC is on my shortlist of favorites.<br /><br />PPS I didn't know how to pronounce the author's name, but he has a Facebook page that has a video clip with the correct pronunciation. In case you want to know how to recommend him to all your friends. : )
B0052UZIFA|4.0|playin on the samsung galaxy s. when i try to open the app, it completely reboots my phone about 60% of the time. it's also lost my save data. but when the game does boot, its very fun to play. i just wish it worked more consistently.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The mechanics are similar to the PC/Mac versions, only you touch the seeds and touch the target spot on the soil/water/roof/etc. I'm actually faster with the Android version than the PC version, primarily because I don't have to lug a cursor around-- I can just use multiple fingers. One might think that this would make the game too easy, but it is as fast-paced as the original, assuming your device has the horsepower to run it smoothly.<br /><br />And there's the rub-- my Xoom should have more than enough graphical power to perform well, but some scenes are sluggish-- notably the \\"Oh, look! you found a new seed!\\" animation. One moment you're cruising along, the next it's as if someone hit the \\"slow\\" button on the remote.<br /><br />Hopefully PopCap will update this game to detect and optimize for tablets, because this is an excellent time-waster for that form factor.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|game works well enough. very fun, however on my Samsung Charge if the screen turns off and i press the power button to bring it back on / show lock screen, the phone freezes to the point of restarting itself. a very frustrating and annoying issue from this otherwise great game.
1591844096|5.0|Seth's thesis is you need to let your unique value out, regardless of reward, because you will get enough reward indirectly or directly. I read the first 45 pages of this book and was frustrated because that was all he said.  But the meat was in the second half.  Seth gets an A+, but does suffer from one problem many advice books have. He addresses it but says it is a non-issue.  That is, \\"HOW do you become a linchpin?\\"  He says since you are a being leader, there is no set of rules.  It is GREAT to say, \\"give your all at work so you become invaluable,\\" but this is not necessarily as inherently rewarding as he implies. You may be planting seeds for others to harvest without ensuring a harvest of your own. He does not focus on strategies for ensuring you reap the rewards you are due.<br /><br />In other words, he tells you some great principles, THAT YOU NEED, about swimming.  But he doesn't teach you how to swim. For that, you are on your own. Nevertheless, this book is so full of the principles and ideas that it is a game-changer or at least a pivotal description of the changing game.  Hopefully enough executives and leaders will read this so they will change corporate culture to be appreciative of original contributions.<br /><br />Some great ideas covered in the book:<br /><br />* How your lizard brain is working against you.  Godin takes psychology away from theory and addresses our desire to be all we can be and overcoming the resistance to that, with a home run. Excellent applied psychology.<br />* In one or two paragraphs, a subject worth repeating, he says if your \\"art\\" is not appreciated, move on and give where it is.  He should have addressed that, with illustrations, as a chapter. When do you know to stop giving?  How much do you give before realizing someone is just taking from you without reciprocation?<br />* He points out linchpins need to know other linchpins--often unique contributors are isolated from others<br />* He points out that you can't think OUTSIDE the box, you have to think at the EDGE of the box.<br />* He is realistic--your uniqueness may not make you rich.  Give it anyways.<br /><br />Excellent book, but for Godin, giving irrespective of reward made him a success.  Give your value, but give wisely, in a way that maximizes the likelihood you get the rewards you deserve.  However, this book and Free by Chris Anderson, and Marketing Shortcuts for the Self Employed by Patrick Shwerdtfelder have amply shown me that I need to actually provide a lot more online for free to attract long-term customers and relationships. If you are going to provide your unique value to the world, a lot of that will be for free, and a little will pay off, but likely pay off handsomely IF it is truly of value.<br /><br />Good: Telling you to provide your value regardless of fears and resistance<br />Bad: Not telling you enough how to manage that and harvest appropriate rewards<br /><br />Conclusion: A necessary book for those wishing to change the world with their ideas.nk at the EDGE of the box.  * He is realistic--your uniqueness may not make you rich.

0525423273|5.0|I have been hearing how awesome this book is forever and finally got it from my library to read.  I read nearly the whole thing straight through in one night.  It was really good.  It was funny, sweet, and just touches on so many things about growing up and being away from home.<br /><br />Anna is sent to an American school in Paris by her father.  She doesn't want to be there, but she tries to make the best of it.  Right off the bat she meets a great group of students and then there is St. Clair.  St. Clair is everything she has ever wanted in a boyfriend; beautiful, funny, and just all around wonderful to hang out with.  Only problem is he has a girlfriend...oh and Anna has an almost boyfriend back in Atlanta, Georgia.  So Anna is not only trying to learn how to navigate a foreign country but she is also navigating a difficult balance between herself and St. Clair.<br /><br />This is seriously one of the most readable books I have read all year.  By that I mean the language is so natural, the characters so real and interesting.  I seriously sat down and started to read and suddenly realized I had been reading for quite a while and was 100 pages into the book.  The story just flows off the pages.  It is one of those stories that will have you giggling at points and will have you almost in tears at others.<br /><br />Anna, St. Claire, and their friends are some of the most real, yet admirable, characters I have read about in a while.  They make mistakes but are all trying to be decent people.  They are all kind of quirky and have things they are really passionate about; instead of trying to hide their passions they embrace them as being part of who they are.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching Anna learn to navigate Paris.  Perkins is just spot on with some of the things she has Anna go through and with some of the things Anna thinks.  I remember being in Paris last year and I was self conscious; I did constantly wonder \\"Do I look too American?\\". The accuracy of these experiences and how well I related to Anna had me laughing out loud a number of times.<br /><br />Watching Anna and her friends deal with their family issues was insightful, heartbreaking, and engaging.  I guess in a way you could say this book is about navigation.  How to navigate a new country, how to navigate through family issues, and how to navigate through love.<br /><br />I was a bit leery about reading this book because it just sounded a bit too \\"high school\\" for me; I ended up picking it up because of how good I heard it was and I wanted to read a book set in Paris.  I am glad I picked it up.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would actually reread it a few times if I had more time.<br /><br />Overall I loved this book.  If you like travel and you like reading coming of age type stories give it a read.  In fact I think everyone should give it a read.  Sure most of it is from Anna's perspective, but it wasn't too girly or too full of teenage angst, and it definitely wasn't shallow.  It covered a lot of serious issues and was entertaining, funny, and completely engrossing...so, just read it already!  I look forward to reading Perkins next book, [[ASIN:0525423281 Lola and the Boy Next Door]], when it comes out in September.elated to Anna had me laughing out loud a number of times.

B002OFWG7O|5.0|This CD has most all the songs that are the most well known. I really enjoy listening to this in the car driving back and forth to work with my 80 mile roundtrip drive per day. The kids even sing along and know the songs. Love the acoustic version of Everlong. The DVD is great and has a bunch of videos I've not seen before as well as a bunch I have seen many times. Talented and fun band to listen to and watch. Ready for them to come to Savannah for a concert!!

B004LWZW42|5.0|Like many people was hesitant about a new X-Men movie that was part prequel part reboot. I have a fondness toward the first three X-Men movies. And Unlike many people out there I really enjoyed X-MEN 3 and think it is a really underrated movie. Sure Brett Ratner's directing wasn't great but the story was good and so was the action. I also love how they weren't afraid to kill off the main characters. My biggest problem with the movie was the over abundance of characters the threw into the movie. I know it sounds like I'm giving a review for X-Men: The Last Stand but I wanted to make it clear I really like the previous films and wasn't sure about a reboot/prequel just like I'm nervous about the new Spiderman movie. Though after seeing this movie I view it more as a prequel.    Now I was wrong X-MEN: First Class is a great movie and will probably be the best comic book movie of the summer. With the already underwhelming THOR. THE GREEN LANTERN which in all honesty doesn't look that good and CAPTAIN AMERICA which I really hope is good.    One of the first things I need to talk about is the actors and many people may not recognize or remember. First Kevin Bacon who hasn't been in a lot of movies recently steals the movie as Sebastian Shaw as he brings such live and zeal to the character and I'm disappointed he won't be around for the enviable sequels. Then there's James McAvoy who hasn't done anything recognizable outside of Wanted. He plays Charles Xavior who I will always remember as Patrick Steward. He was the perfect Professor X. Still McAvoy did a good job as a you Xavior. Michael Fassbender as Magneto I had never heard of and again I had a fondness for the excellent actor Ian McKellen. I thought Michael did a excellent job as a young tortured Magneto and he even looks like a young Mckellen. Next I need to give a shout out to the movie great movie SUNSHINE and the actress Rose Byrne(Moira MacTaggert) who has been in many good movies and is a great actress. Then there are two supporting characters who I don't think had any lines but were great. The two are Riptide(Álex González) and Azazel(Jason Flemyng) who stole the show from the young X-MEN which include Havok, Mystique, Beast, and Banshee. That was one of the small flaws with this movie was them. I just didn't care that much about them. It felt like they were taking space from the more important characters like the relationship between Xavior and Magneto. One last thing I always like to give a shout out to actors who don't get enough work and aren't well recognized. The first is Oliver Platt who character has no name in this movie but plays a high ranking agent in the CIA. Oliver Platt is a fun actor who doesn't get enough work. The last person is Michael Ironside who plays a Captain of a American Navy ship. Michael Ironside isn't a star but a great supporting actor who's had great supporting roles in such movies such as Total Recall, Top Gun, Starship Troopers and others. Though you might recognize his voice more as he's done work for The Splinter Cell game series as the lead Sam Fisher, Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League / Justice League Unlimited to name a few.    The story that was blended into actual history was done really well. Especially Sebastian Shaw using the Cuba Missile Crisis for his own end was well done. The biggest problem I had with the story was the pacing of the movie. It's a small flaw but I wish they had edited out the scenes where the new X-Men students were training. I just thought they weren't really necessary but I think I might be nit picking with that. The action was really great especially in the middle of the movie when Shaw invades a CIA base. The climax was really good but they could have edited a few seconds out of it but again I think I'm nit picking with that when the action was really great.    The directing by Matthew Vaughn was really well done but he's had practice with his three earlier films in Layer Cake, Stardust, andKickass which were all good films. Again the only flaw I had his directing was the pacing of the film and editing.    Oh yes the two cameos by actors from the first films which confirmed for me that this movies and the ones that follows are prequels. The first and longer scene was with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine though he probably hasn't been taken by the government yet. That scene was great and funny. Then there was the quick appearance of Rebecca Romijn which I though was nice.    Overall this movie was great and out does any of the previous films which were good and I can't wait for the next film.

B004A8ZX28|2.0|Warning there might be some spoilers ahead. I haven't seen a movie in just about two months since Tron Legacy. There wasn't anything that interested me until UNKNOWN. It looked like it would be a good action/suspense movie but I was wrong. I'll be blunt this movie was pretty boring. It's kind of reminds me of The American with George Clooney. It had potential but failed to rise above ordinary to bad.    The story follows Dr. Martin Harris(Liam Neeson) and Elizabeth Harris(January Jones) who have arrived in Berlin for a conference. Things are going well for them until Martin gets into a accident. When he awakes he finds out there's someone else has taken over his life and impersonating him. Things go from bad to worse when he tries to prove who he is. The overall story isn't very good a plot to assassinate someone at the conference. The intriguing part is Martin. Is he really Martin Harris or is the other Martin the real one. The payoff worked well when you find out who he really is. The problem with the story is the pacing and the editing of the story. How many minutes were wasted with Martin just wandering the streets. I mean it must have been ten minutes. Then there was the action which was few an far between and outside of one good scene was bad. Then there was the ending which planned sucked.    The acting was what hurt the movie the most. All the lead actors seemed to be on autopilot through this movie. Liam Neeson did a ok job. There were times he did a great job and there were others he seemed to be on autopilot. Aidan Quinn and January Jones seemed like zombies. The only one of the leads that showed any real emotion was Diana Kruger(Gina). Because of the bad acting you or at least I ended up not caring one bit about any of them. Oh one of them died all well who cares and you move one. The actor who stole the show and the film was a supporting actor. His name is Bruno Ganz. I had never heard of him before. He plays Ernst Jürgen a ex Stasi(The East German State Security) officer. His character is the most intriguing and surprisingly the most likable. Ernst is also in the best scene in the movie. Where he is at his home with Rodney Cole(Frank Langella). This two veteran actors do a superb job but again Bruno is the one that shines. To be honest I wish the made the movie about his character.    Now back to the action that was hard to find. The fight scenes weren't very well done. The climax in a hotel was done terribly. Maybe the director wanted to rely on the mystery and suspense but those two weren't good enough make this a good movie. I don't mind movies with out a long of action but when there is it had better be good. The only really great action scene in the near midway part of the film where there is a car chase in the streets of Berlin which I thought was really well done.    As for directing by Jaume Collet-Serra was bad. Which I guess shouldn't be surprising once I found out who he was and what he directed before. He's only directed four movies and the only one I know about or seen is the god awful HOUSE OF WAX. I wish the movie studio had found someone else to direct this movie maybe then it would have been better.    Overall a below average to bad action/suspense movie that I'd skip if I were you.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|There are more than enough reviews here so all I'll say is this, should you want to listen to real music or one of the best voices the world has to offer, get this album. Get ALL of his albums. In a world full of Britney and Bieber, sometimes you need some Josh Groban.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|The Fast and the Furious franchise seems to be getting better with age. The first on was a good movie. Then the second one came out which was average at best than Toyko Drift came out and that was just plan terrible. I considered the franchise dead after that but then I saw Fast and the Furious and it gave life to the franchise. It's rare to see a franchise getting better with age. Usually Things start to go down hill after the second movie of a franchise. From the Lethal Weapon movies, to the Terminator movies and of course all of the horror genre. So it's surprisingly rare for a franchise to survive the test of time and you wouldn't expect this franchise to be one of them and Fast Five might be the best movie of them all.    Fast Five has a above average story. Starting almost directly after the first one. The overall story is about the core group trying to find a way out of the endless running from the law and family. There's another plot about a drug lord and a missing computer chip but it isn't very good. That shouldn't matter to most simply because you don't go to see this type of movie for a amazing story and great acting. You coming to see the great action, cool cars, and hot women. You get plenty of all three in this. Still I'd say this is the best story of all the movies since the first one.    The acting ok but look at the actors none of the are great actors and none of them are going to win Oscars in their acting career. Still all the actors from Paul Walker to Tyrese Gibson to Sung Kang to Dwayne Johnson aka THE ROCK are having a good time and have great chemistry which makes up for the acting.    Now for what everyone goes to these movies for the action. Which is mind blowing. From a scene where a group steal cars from a moving train. Another was a on foot chase in slums of Brazil(Which the movie was filmed and is beautiful.) where Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel go one on one in one of the one one action scenes you'll see with out CGI. Finally there's the climax which I won't say anything about but will blow you away.    Also there is a scene after the main credits that will imply what the inevitable next movie will be about.    Overall this is the best of the franchise with great visuals and action and a above average story and decent acting.
B004GYNPL2|3.0|The idea is great but where is the translation to other languages? In Germany we use other bank accounts so we need a field for &quot;name of bank&quot;, &quot;Kontonummer&quot; and &quot;Bankleitzahl&quot;.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I am new to collecting Garth Brooks music. I've of course heard it over the years and liked what I heard but never took time to check it out closer. This is a great set to start with. A good grouping of songs many I like and a few I don't care for. I have to agree with other reviewers here that it is great the way they packaged this set. I love that all the songs on the CD are also included on the DVD. Other singers that offer sets like this always leave something out either on the CD or DVD and you can never get everything you want. But this is complete and it's the way I like it. Then no matter if I'm listening to CD's or watching the DVD I get to see or hear all the songs in this set without being shortchanged at one end or the other. This one is a great way to get started with a good sampling of Garth's songs through the years. I highly recommend it.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|When you put De Niro and Pacino together, it always works for me.    Story line:  The perps in a series of nasty crimes are getting away through the loopholes.  Suddenly, they start turning up dead.  Little by little, the rest of the force start tuning in to the something that wasn't making much sense at first blush.    Add to that a steamy May-December occasional get-together by De Niro and his nympho co worker, and it makes for an interesting twist I, at least wasn't expecting.   It kept me guessing and now that it's over, I'll watch it again because it's always fun to make it fit the second time around - when all the details can tie together up front and go forward.    If you like the good cop, bad cop thing (or cop movies in general) this is a good one.  Nothing deep or profound to write as a review by way of explanation without giving too much of it away.  It's entertaining.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|as an athlete, i found the information in this book superficial and the efforts recommended to be excessive to acquire results that are obtained by healthy living and plenty of movement. benefitsd of his suggestions have little to do with cultivating a healthy or athletic lifestyle. as an example of misleading science, ferris claims tha running up stairs uses a low caloric expenditure. he fails to note the biomechanical conversion of energy that is involved in accomplishing a task.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|Keepass is far superior.  I like the review that said the owner of keepass was writing these bad reviews...

0307346617|5.0|Just wanted to write a brief review because I enjoyed this book so much but the other reviews sum it up well. Excellently written and easily deserves the five stars. If you are into the zombie genre and haven't read this yet...well what are you waiting for you zombie?
B004KA9MQO|3.0|I bought this because of the song that is obviously dedicated to her mother but the whole CD is off the chain.  I don't like that they continued one type of rhythmic melody in most of the songs (it's a marching band, drum, type beat) but that's just me being picky.  Some songs HIT Jennifer right where her vocal talents shine, while others are just OK.  Nevertheless, it's not a bad CD and would give it a 2.5 stars out of 4.
B002ZG980U|3.0|There really is no deep meaning. It's just a film, constructed to create profit, by selling to the easily amused masses.  I almost turned it off after 10 minutes cause it looked like the film went on the floor and they edited it together any which way.  This surely doesn't represent my idea of dreams. These guys would be so psychotic from dreaming all day;  they would be on a constant addiction of uppers and downers. Sporadically throughout the movie there would be confusing dialog about what they were doing, but it really couldn't put the pieces together. It seems like a movie which needs to be purchased, so that it can be watched several times, and then argued about with friends as to the deep meanings. There are none.  I enjoyed the visual effects, and the acting, but after 90 minutes, I was wondering how long it could go on. I'd give 8 stars for cinematography and acting, and 2 stars for editing, screenplay, and directing.  The King's Speech was definitely the better film for an Oscar.
030726999X|5.0|Just finished this volume and must say it was one of the most exciting, spell-binding novels I have ever read. I stayed up until 3 a.m. one night and well past midnight the other because I simply could not put it down. I ordered all three novels at the same time and for some reason this one loaded onto my Kindle second, so I read it second. Now I learn that it is the THRID in the sequence, and I still have The Girl Who Played With Fire to read. I found this novel far more interesting and exciting than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which was a bit of a struggle to keep up with ... and wasn't all that exciting, truth be told. It's difficult, if you do not read Swedish, to keep track of all these strange names, many of them almost unpronounceable--but eventually you manage to keep everybody straight even though Larsson (sp?) introduces as many as three or four dozen characters who play active parts in the novel. This is a great read, and I recommend it highly.
0066620996|4.0|Good to great is a book primarily for the business executive.  This fact was made blatantly clear when I went to purchase the book and the clerk asked me which business school I was attending.  It consists of a lot of data driven reasoning that seems to be pointed at larger companies.      I am a manufacturing engineering student; this gave me a different but equally relevant perspective on the book.  I particularly took notice of the part about refining your Hedgehog concept.  This book introduces the kind of mindset that executives need to allow their engineers to perform the continual process improvement necessary to generate that one great idea (Hedgehog concept) that is profitable and the best in the world.      I was also particularly interested in the part about getting the right people on the bus.  This addresses some of the issues with making paradigm shifts within a company, particularly small to mid-size,  from the mom and pop \\"we've always done it this way\\" attitude to bringing people on board with the goal of doing what we do, the best, and most efficient way possible.

1573228737|5.0|When I chose to read Sarah Waters' new book Affinity I thought I was going to be reading a spooky novel about spiritualism during the Victorian era.  While this was true on the surface I quickly found that there was more to this book than the gothic trappings surrounding the story.  While the book is quite dark it is not a novel for those who seek horror or a good scare.  Affinity does have its share of chills but one soon discovers that the story goes a great deal deeper than this.  I found the novel dark and moving and one which brought about all kinds of intense emotions.  The book keeps surprising as one reads and I had no idea where it was headed (I thought I did but I was very wrong).  While I was a bit disappointed in the lack of fright from the book (although there were a couple of areas...) I soon got lost in the deep prose and story Sarah Waters wrote.  By the end I was hanging on the book's every word on every page.  I was shocked at how much I was able to get into this story and I found it very emotional and shocking.  It is a love story but it is a very dark love story and things do not always turn out the way the reader thinks or would like.  If you are worried the book is too scary--don't be.  You will love this novel if you like intrigue and the unusual love story will captivate you and surprise you.  I enjoyed the book even if it didn't scare me.  The story was good and the characters were fascinating.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|As someone who recently \\"discovered\\" DOCTOR WHO on BBC-America, I wondered if it made any sense to purchase the DVD of the series when I could watch it for \\"free\\" on TV.  Well, obviously I did, as this review shows.  To my surprise, I discovered that BBC-America apparently edits the TV programs for time.  One example, in the first episode, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", when young Amelia Pond is in her backyard waiting  \\"5 minutes\\" for the Doctor to return, the TV show completely edited this out as well as other hilarious scenes in the kitchen, that I had no idea existed until I saw the DVD.  It's like watching a whole new show. I am finding similiar omissions in the other DVDs as well.  Of course, the DVD also has great commentaries, outtakes and extras that one doesn't get to see on TV. I recommend getting the entire series of Doctor Who on these great DVDs.
B004KWVDWI|4.0|I think this is one of the best films Steve McQueen ever did. Its a compelling story of imprisonment, punishment and repeated escape. Its also somewhat restrained in terms of violence (its still violent at times, but not overly so). McQueen makes the part work through the force of his own personality. Though nominally about a French subject, this is in every respect an American film with American characters. Its true to its physical setting and they do a wonderful job recreating those locations, but its not in any sense true to the culture of that setting.    The film isn't all that much more impressive on Blu-Ray. The whole film seems to have been shot in a soft focus style which results in no dramatic difference in terms of picture in Blu-Ray. The sound is of course better. Its not that the blu-ray is bad. Its no different than the original theaterical experience and it will simply not have the same \\"jump\\" that other titles put on Blu-Ray do.     I have mixed opinions on the blu-ray book format. I like having extras on Blu-rays. But there never seems to be much tnought put into the \\"book\\" part. It always seems to end up being mostly a collection of stills with obvious material about the film presented.

0439023513|2.0|I just finished the book and, I hate to say it, but I wish I'd never read it.  I loved the first two books. LOVED.  I have hounded my boyfriend, friends, and family to read them ever since I polished off the first book in a day and now I am almost disappointed I did because it means they will read Mockingjay at some point.    Spoilers below.    The book left me depressed, empty, unfulfilled, and numb.  There were so many deaths, so many attempts to make us feel the reality of war, that there was no way for us to leave the boom feeling closure.  Yes, you could argue that is what war does to people, and in that sense it is fabulous writing because it makes it all feel so real.  Too real, for me.  I don't mind hardship, in fact, I was still on board with the book up until (SPOILER INCOMING!) Finnick's death.  That is when I started to waiver.  When I lost all hope was when Prim died.  Again, excellent writing if you're arguing that it makes us as empty and hopeless as Katniss; but, for me, it cost my interest in the book.  I finished because I hoped it would all be validated, but it just got sadder.      There is meager attempt at the very end (and I mean VERY end, maybe 1 page? I read on Kindle) to give us a happy ending, and I am glad that Peeta and Katniss stay together (again, another but); but it felt too shallow to mean anything.  It's just a shell of an ending trying to appease those who wanted love to triumph.    I find myself angry and Suzanne Collins for writing this book the way she did.  Where is my happy ending?  The one that leaves me with a sense of loss for those who didn't make it out alive, but happiness that they did not die in vain because those that survived found the joy and peace that the deceased sacrificed to give them?  The world seemed better when the Hunger Games were around, which is NOT the point I think the series was trying to make!     In short, I feel cheated.  I was given two fantastic books that gripped me to the point I could neverput them down.  Then, out of no where, I get this book that thrusts me too deeply into war.  It wasn't suspenseful, like the Games, it's just heart wrenching and depressing.  It leaves you feeling like you have PTSD.  Again, a sign of great writing in my opinion, but a very, very bad choice for the ending of this series.  The evil of the Games needed to be countered with something better, not worse.  I can't believe I am left craving a time when children were sent into the Arena.     VERY disappointed. When someone finds a way to wipe memories, please call me. I want to wipe this book from my head.  And I have NEVER EVER felt that way about any book I've read.

The premise sounded very intriguing - a lost letter delivered 50 years later - what secrets would be revealed in the pages to come?  One page dragged on after another and I couldn't get wrapped up in the story.  There was just way too much of nothing page after page.  I was so tired of it by the last chapter, that I didn't even finish.  If the contents of the 50 year old letter were ever revealed, I had lost interest a long time ago!

B002UAJ0BS|1.0|This review is about the audio quality of the LP, not about the content in any way. Although this release was hyped as being a \\"definitive\\" vinyl reissue, it suffers from sibilance in the vocals, clipping, and overall mediocre sound for a LP issue that implies audiophile quality sound. Anything BUT \\"definitive\\" vinyl reissue.
B004LWZW42|4.0|Well, here we are, number two of the four big super hero films of the summer. And it is... pretty damn decent.    X-Men: First Class centers around a younger Charles Xavier and his new friend, Erik Lehnsherr and their efforts to stop Sebastian Shaw. Shaw has a plan to start a nuclear war so that the radiation will cause more mutations in people. Apparently that's how mutants got their start, which is somewhat confusing since the opening scene (lifted directly from the first X-Men film, a movie which came out, good grief, 11 years ago), shows Erik in 1943, a couple years before nuclear bombs were going off. But never mind. Along the way to stopping Shaw, X picks up several recruits including scientist Hank McCoy, a woman with dragonfly wings, a boy who can scream even louder than the children in my apartment complex (and who looks like an escapee from a Weasly family reunion), and a black guy. Guess what happens to him? Efforts to recruit a cigar smoking Canadian are not as successful.    There is an awful lot that I liked about this movie. First James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender do an excellent job playing younger versions of characters made popular by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. Nicholas Hoult also continues to impress, showing that his performance in Skins isn't an aberration. The other members of the cast are also quite good, including Kevin Bacon and January Jones, though I kept seeing her as a naughty Betty Draper more than anything else. The cast is further helped by the fact that Hoult, Caleb Landry Jones and Luc Till are all exceptionally easy on the eyes. There was also some lovely continuity between this movie and the others, though I'm sure some people will bitch about certain errors that crept in.    Really the only problems this movie had were that it was a bit longer than it needed to be, and a bit more crowded. We didn't really need all that many mutants up on the screen. Havoc, especially, was adorable but could have been written out withoutdamaging the movie in any way. There were also a couple of very odd edits where it's clear certain scenes were meant to go longer than they did, and instead were just awkwardly chopped. It's also very clear that this is a setup for a new franchise, and while I don't have a huge problem with that, it does cause its own set of problems.    That said, it was fun summer escapism. I liked it a bit more than Thor, but it's really apples and oranges with those two. Also, don't bother staying to the end of the credits hoping for a nice Easter egg, cause you won't get one. But stay until the end anyhow, cause the people who make these movies work hard!
B003UESJ9M|1.0|I hated this movie! Don't buy it!  I won't give away the end to those of you who want to decide for yourselves, but you couldn't pay me to watch this movie again!  Country Strong should have been titled \\"Country Weak!\\"  The way this ends does not show \\"Strength\\" to me, only weakness.   I wanted my money back after watching this one!    Tonya

B000SEH1R8|5.0|I first read this book in high school, and it was truly my gateway to discovering Vonnegut, who would become my favorite author. Since then, I have picked it up time and time again whenever I feel particularly upset with the state of the world.     I can honestly say that, in my opinion, this is one of his best works. The satire in this book is so sharp and so true, it is really incredible how effortless the writing appears. It says a lot about a book and the way the author saw the world, when you can pick it up almost 40 years after it was written and still relate to most of the material as if it were written yesterday.     Breakfast of Champions is precisely that type of book. Both hilarious and morose because it's true, Vonegut's masterpiece is a little too down-to-Earth for comfort, as he shamelessly insults the American (and Earthly) way of life. I would recommend this to anyone already familiar with Vonnegut as well as anyone else who enjoys reading satire that takes society and shows the reader its every little flaw. Vonnegut was a genius!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|this is what a movie is supposed to be.It is well done.....it is well scripted/cast but most of all, the movie lets us inside of the head of an autistic woman who not only finished college, but went on to complete her PHd. she then went on to tell the rest of the world what it is like to be autistic.[[ASIN:0307739589 Thinking in Pictures (Expanded, Tie-in Edition): My Life with Autism (Vintage)]] which had never been done before! Truly a voyage to a world we have never taken before......... and an interesting one at that. By the end of the movie we know life as as an autistic person sees it and are glad that Temple was able to \\"Walk through all the doors' she went through, her comments that \\"Life is cruel, but we don't have to be\\" really hit home.

0060936223|4.0|So many glowing reviews of this book precede this one, so I'll keep this short. This was a great read- a compelling story filled with cameos from some of New York's greatest characters; a revealing look a two famous artists whose work only revealed parts of their lives; a love-letter to the gritty, visceral New York of the past; and a tale of a unique, powerful and enveloping love that is rarely seen. I was blown away by the relationship between Smith and Mapplethorpe, and her clear, unvarnished style of retelling it. I read it on my flight from NYC to San Francisco and it was a great companion for the trip.
B00004RJ74|2.0|The scene in here which \\"got\\" my attention was the one in the bar....where the vampires appear for the first time. Problem is I don't care what happens to the main characters...including Clooney who I really admire (e.g. Solaris). Clooney and company commit Mose's Sin, and have no redeeming qualities after that. Never saw Clooney act the smuck, dumb-ass before. Tarantino is another loser character who trys at acting. This is not the caliber of Pulp Fiction. By the way, the commentary extra disc on this is awful! Disjointed garbage.     Last movie I saw this bad was Somewhere for different reasons.

I own all of the books and in physical format.  I toyed with the idea of buying 'Dance with Dragons' for my digital reader.  I wanted to see how much it would cost to get the previous four books in digital format.    HOLY COW!    I'm not going to spend twice as much for the digital versions!  Come publishers, quit gouging and ripping us off!  Do you actually read any of these reviews or are you just too greedy that you don't care?
0802130208|5.0|This is the most mean-spirited and and laugh-out-loud funny book I have ever read.  If Ignatius were a present day character, he would write endless diatribes on the Internet instead of Chief writing pads.  Many of my friends hated this book because Ignatius is such loser and he hates everything, but his scorn and self righteous anger delight me.  In one scene early in the book, he goes to the movies to watch a musical (which he hates) so he can eat massive amounts of popcorn and shout his derision at the screen.  This is dark humor at its best.  If you loved [[ASIN:0671021001 She's Come Undone]] by Wally Lamb, (another mean-spirited but wildly funny book) it's a good bet that you will appreciate Confederacy of Dunces.
0670022411|5.0|Fabulous read !!!  An exciting adventure filled love story between a witch and a vampire.  Who knew such a thing was even possible?  Be prepared for the new twists on vampire life and lore.    I'm surprised it's not on the Best Seller List.  Most chapters left me breathless, waiting to see what would happen next.  And that's exactly how the book ended.  Since this is a trilogy, I eagerly await books two and three.  The author is a great story-teller, fleshing out each character and brilliantly setting a mood for each scene.  Well done!  Bring on book two!!

B0052UZIFA|4.0|PvZ is very entertaining, but I'm docking 1 star because the port quality is mediocre. There should atleast be an option to go into a higher resolution mode.   Another complaint would probably be the massive file size. there are games out there that are much bigger in play time than PvZ and is half the size of this.  I would say to give this a full five star:  1) Have an option to put it into a higher resolution mode  2) make the total file size smaller. This is a practice of inefficiency in programming/porting the game.

B000A2UBN4|4.0|Director Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear(1991) is an homage to the 1962 film. Gus Van Sant made the mistake of making a carbon copy clone of Hitchcock's Psycho in 1998. This Cape Fear remake was up-to-date! There's foul language, bloody violence, and a tame sex scene! There's a scene where Nick Nolte slips in human blood! Max Cady(Robert De Niro) is released from jail and he plans on getting even with lawyer Sam Bowden(Nick Nolte). Peggy and Nancy Bowden's names have been changed to Leigh and Danielle. In the original Cape Fear, Sam Bowden's family was happy and solid. In the remake, Sam is cheating on his wife and Danielle is unhappy and experimenting with hard drugs. Max Cady's threats toward them are a \\"wake up call\\". Max Cady is much more megalomaniacal and dangerous in this remake. Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam make cameo appearances in this remake. Joe Don Baker plays Kersek.   Elmer Bernstein adapts Bernard Herrmann's score from the original Cape Fear as well as two unused music cues from Torn Curtain(1966). This remake is shot in anamorphic, widescreen format and enhanced with some special effects and surround sound. Sam Bowden's houseboat is rocked by a storm in this remake. That didn't happen in the original. There's a scene where Max Cady hides under a moving car. This was spoofed on The Simpsons. Jessica Lange is quite good as Leigh. Juliette Lewis is good as Danielle Bowden.  In the original Cape Fear, Max Cady scared Nancy by chasing her at school. This remake has a similar scene where Max Cady tries to earn Danielle's trust at school. The flashy editing from this Cape Fear remake has been imitated in movies made after 1991. Robert De Niro gives a sincere, over the top performance as ex-con Max Cady. Nick Nolte is solid as Sam Bowden. I like the scene where Max Cady gets hot water splashed in his face and doesn't blink. Also, he acts like a jerk during a screening of Problem Child(1990). Cape Fear(1991) is a solid remake and asolid suspense-thriller.
B004IQMXD4|1.0|AS I've like almost everything she's ever done, I immediately ordered this without listening to samples of the material.  My bad.  I could explain, but none of it would be positive.  It's dreadful.  Didn't bother loading it on my iPod.
0783231032|2.0|1941(1979) is a mixed bag. This is considered one of director Steven Spielberg's weakest movies. It's been accused of being anti-American. People in the U.S.A. try to defend their country after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Spielberg struggles to combine slapstick comedy with a war movie. 1941 is not a total turkey. The music score by John Williams is very good. The special effects by L.B. Abbott and Greg Jein are quite good. The scene with the Ferris wheel rolling into the ocean was funny!   The scene with Nancy Allen screaming at a \\"dinosaur\\" was prophetic! Spielberg directed Jurassic Park(1993)! The late, great John Belushi played psychotic fighter pilot Bill Kelso. Spielberg spoofs a scene from Jaws(1975) where Susan Backlinie swims in the ocean and she ends up on the deck of a Japanese submarine. This is the equivalent of having Alfred Hitchcock film a  shower scene of Janet Leigh for Family Plot(1976) and having Leigh get hit by a baseball! 1941 has also been criticized for \\"overkill\\". In the late 1970's, some movie critics felt that Hollywood green lit projects for scripts that weren't that good. Star Trek The Motion Picture, The Black Hole, The Swarm, and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure were examples. The extras on this DVD make up for the film's flaws. 1941 is worth a look if one has a lot of patience.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|When I downloaded these tracks, I thought this album would deliver the same punch the previous two did, despite my negative opinion of \\"Born This Way\\" and \\"Judas.\\"  However, upon listening to this CD, I found myself incapable of making it through a whole song.  I kept skipping around because of the lackluster lyrics, singing, and choppy music production.  Worse still, I found many of these songs downright...creepy.  I originally didn't want to purchase the physical CD because the images on the back and front gave me the creeps (I didn't even want to ride the NYC shuttle to Times Square because the images were plastered all over it), but now I see that the album artwork and music are perfectly suited for one another.  This album is much darker than her others, and it certainly isn't for me (if you like a poppy Gaga, it won't be for you, either).  I'm pretty sure the only song that will make its way into my iTunes is \\"The Edge of Glory.\\"  Maybe I'll add the first track, too, but I sadly don't even remember that song's title.  I will, of course, give future Gaga songs a chance, but I am just so disappointed in this CD's quality.

B004XS97KO|5.0|I love this Dr. Who, though David Tennant remains my favorite.  This one has some very interesting sexy vibes.  In one episode, he hides under a woman's dress naked.  In another, he gets a big wet kiss from a surprise woman.  And then another long kiss, which he seriously enjoys.  He also has some good sex word play with River.  AND, he talks about how some of the earlier US Presidents \\"fancied me\\" and he seems to be both bragging and enjoying that remembrance.        Very interesting.  He also some some very effeminate hand and hips movements at time like that Capt. Jack character.  But this Dr. Who also seems to FEEL his age more so than the Tennant's one.  He constantly refers to himself as \\"ole doctor.\\"  He also has a lot of hurt.  So many disappointments in trying to find other Time Lords.  You can feel his hurt and loss each time.  It is a wonder if he is not entirely insane from that.    The first two episodes have HUGE holes or teasers.  I can't wait to see what happens with that missing girl?  Who is she?  Where did she come from?  Is she some form of Time Lord?  And if so HOW?  Why did they all just let that hang?  And Amy was captured for days!  No one discusses it and they let the strongest fighter go back to prison.  I want MORE of River!    There seems to be so many potential Time Lords in this series or maybe some hybrids.  The daughter from last season is still out there and she successfully regenerated and had 2 hearts.  Now, this little girl who had some Time Lord like regeneration.  AND, that clone.    Lovely.  Quite fascinating!  Can't wait for more.
B004WJRJUE|5.0|Let's clear a couple of things up first.  For starters, the artwork associated with this release shows the 1985 US remix version artwork.  The artwork that is actually on the package is, in fact, the original artwork used (blue Twisted Sister logo) for the original UK Secret Records release from 1981.  This is also the re-mastered version of that same original Secret Records mix so for those of you that never cared for the US remix (like me), then you're in luck!    OK.  Now down to business.  \\"Under the Blade\\" has never been known for its great production values.  It's more about the energy and the rawness of the music.  This album always has had and still does have a very New Wave of British Heavy Metal sound and feel to it.  If you love the first Iron Maiden album or that first Def Leppard record or some of those Saxon albums, then this one will fit right in with your collection.  The re-mastering brings out more low-end than the original version and it sounds a bit more full.  The drums really benefit as they sound more powerful and the sound overall has a little more \\"beef\\" to it.  Short of the band going back in and re-recording this album, this is probably about as good as it's going to get.  And even if they did re-record it, I highly doubt that they would be able to re-capture the energy that they had during the original recording.  And I can't see how Dee would ever re-create those screams he lets out during the title track.  The second one has to be one of the greatest screams in rock and roll history!  I'm not going to go thru a track by track review because if you've gotten to this point, you're already familiar with them.  But if you've got a nice sounding system and a subwoofer, \\"Destroyer\\" will rattle your windows and piss off the neighbors!    The re-mastering alone is worth picking this one up for true SMF's but let's be honest.  If you're a true SMF, you're here for the extras and they are definitely worth the price of admission!  Having the original \\"Ruff Cutts\\" recordings included as bonus cuts is a great addition!  The \\"Ruff Cutts\\" versions of \\"What You Don't Know\\" and \\"Under the Blade\\" might even be better than the album versions depending on your point of view.  Then for good measure, they throw in a live version of \\"Shoot `Em Down\\" from Reading.  Now this is not the same version that was originally included on a 2 album collection of songs by all of the bands from Reading 1982 but it's still great just the same and a nice bonus.    But if you're a lifelong SMF, let's face it.  You've already got \\"Ruff Cutts\\" as well, right?  Well, you're in luck!!  The 2nd disc is a DVD of the entire Reading performance from 1982.  If the re-mastering and bonus tracks weren't enough, this disc is definitely the deal breaker!  Nobody had this prior to this release!  To watch professionally recorded footage of Twisted Sister prior to the release of their first album is more than worth the price of admission!  To top it off, this is the show that Lemmy, Fast Eddie Clarke, and Pete Way join Twisted on stage for their version of \\"It's Only Rock `n Roll (But I Like It)\\".  There have been bootlegged audio recordings of this show around for years but to finally see the video is pure magic!  And to watch Twisted Sister take on a hostile crowd that did not know them and still win them over is great to watch!  The band was full of energy and aggression on this performance and showed that \\"take on the world\\" attitude that they had before breaking it big with \\"Stay Hungry\\".  To top it off, there are some great current interviews at the end of the DVD with all band members about their memories from this Reading show and the recording of the \\"Under the Blade\\" album.    Bottom line, if you're a fan of early `80's NWOBHM or a true SMF that actually likes more than \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\", then buy this CD/DVD!!!

B001QBC4AG|5.0|If you are a nut for The Who and this album, you're gonna want BOTH the 2009 deluxe version AND the original 1995 remixed and remastered version.  Both are two great ways to listen to this album!  Not only are there BIG TIME differences between the mono and stereo mixes of this album, there are big differences between the '95 version and this newer deluxe '09 version.  First off, the '95 version was REMIXED by Andy McPherson to clean it up a bit, the '09 version is the ORIGINAL MIX (both stereo and mono) by Kit Lambert from 1967.  You'll hear original echo, reverb, and even double tracked vocals that were removed when it was remixed in 1995.  One thing that turns out to be a mixed blessing is the original mix of the album's closing track \\"Rael.\\"  Andy McPherson fixed a HIDEOUS edit that occurs after the song's first verse when it was remixed (due to the master tape being damaged when it was accidentally thrown in the trash by the studio's cleaning lady).  On the '09 version, the original edit remains intact and is a bewilderment to the listener's ears!  It's so bad it's hard to believe it was originally released this way!

0061726826|2.0|I've been iffy about reading Delirium since I've seen the book on amazon. I wasn't as crazy about Lauren Oliver's first book and I wasn't sure I would like this one as much. Well, I'm still on the fence. It's a good premise and idea, but the execution of the story isn't as good.<br /><br />The story follows Lena as she waits to be cured of love, or deliria. But before she is cured, she meets Alex and ends up falling in love. The very thing she swore she would never do. Now they have to find a way to survive against the government because the punishment for going against the government is death. It's the first book in a trilogy.<br /><br />The whole fact that it's love that the government is trying to destroy is different and awesome. Finally, something different. Finally, something that's not the same as everything else. The writing as well is beautiful. Lauren has a talent for writing beautifully. But that's about it. Writing beautifully won't help you write a good book.<br /><br />-There was NO world building here. Yes, it's in Portland, but that doesn't mean everyone knows what it looks like. This is also a dystopia, which is important to have a proper world building. I mean, it can be the same city, but how would we know if it looks the same or not? Is it the same it is now? Is it different? Do houses look the same? What? What does it look like? The thing is, in EVERY book, there should be proper world building because need to know where you are and not just told where you are.<br /><br />Example, you can have a current story set in New York City, but unless you describe what's going on, how is someone in Russia who has never been to America or seen New York going to know that it's New York City?<br /><br />I've never been to Portland, so I have no idea what it looks like. Even more when the government is going to take over and declare love as a disease. Is it going to look like every other city? Different? How? Because Lauren fails to describe anything, I have no idea what anything looks like in this story. So if it became a movie, I wouldn't know if that's how I imagined everything because I don't know what to imagine.<br /><br />-It drags on endlessly. I understand the MC, Lena, feeling a certain way and it taking her a lot longer to think otherwise, to actually think about going against the government. Even more with how her mother was, how her mother was treated. Lena longs for this cure to feel normal and to not have the looks, the talk about her anymore. So, discovering that this love is okay to feel and that the government lied to her, is a big step and it doesn't come easy. If it was just a page or two, I'd wonder how deep she is. But it takes time for her.<br /><br />However, the whole book was just so long and took too much time. Honestly, at least half of the stuff in there could have been taken out. It dragged on and had no real development for the story. In fact, there wasn't much excitement or development in the story until the very end. I didn't feel like I was reading a dystopia, I felt like I was reading a romance that wasn't supposed to happen.<br /><br />-The romance was the same old cheesy, looks first, no depth love. I love how it wasn't the same way they met. It was different and it seemed like it would work. But then... Lauren did the same thing as everyone else and made it all on looks. Without really knowing someone, they can't wait to start kissing each other, though that's a capital offense. Though I am glad she hasn't added a love triangle, at least not yet. Please don't do that Lauren. I will really hate you even more and refuse to read anything else of yours.<br /><br />If you don't believe me on the looks part, read what Alex said about Lena. He mentions he saw her and fell in love with her right away. Because she was so awake, even though she wants to conform to everything more than anyone else. How in the world is conformity awake when the person running next to you who wants to rebel andIS rebelling NOT awake? Answer me that! Again, it's all based on looks.<br /><br />-There was no real struggle, no real antagonist. It's a series. A trilogy. It needs something. There was no real strong struggle against Lena. Nothing to make this stand out. The thing with trilogies, is that you not only need to build things up and start to show the antagonist, but you also need to show the struggle starting. Need to have it where each book of the trilogy can stand on its own. But with this, it can't. It *needs* the rest of the series to stand up. Because there wasn't a real struggle at all in here, it lacks the depth it needs to stand alone.<br /><br />-Oh my gosh, the government is so stupid! Apparently, it's perfectly normal for TEENAGERS to break curfew, have tons of parties, drink and dance even though they aren't supposed to, met up with people in random houses, and whatever else they do. Um... really? If this was such a strong controlling government, as it was appeared to be, there wouldn't have been ANY of these things.<br /><br />-Would have loved it if the parts where Lena was brave didn't have a few pages of monologue about how brave she's going to be. -_- Yeah, you're doing something that isn't safe. Thank you for spending an hour explaining that. Next time, please just do it and not tell us. It makes us think you're stupider and less brave than you claim you are.<br /><br />-A problem with many writers, too many adverbs. >.> I understand a few here and there, but Lauren just had too many. Too too many adverbs. Adverbs are the tool of a lazy write. You don't show as much with adverbs. You tell more so. That's what ended up happening here a few times.<br /><br />Overall, it wasn't the greatest. The idea was better than the execution. The writing was beautiful, I loved the idea, and I want to know what happens to Alex will make me want to read the next one. However, I will be borrowing from the library again for that one instead of buying it. Not feeling motivated to buy it.<br /><br />If Lauren learns how to write better and knows it more than just \\"beautiful words\\", then the series might not be so bad. But as it stands, it's not all that good. You want a better dystopia, read Hunger Games or Uglies. (Speaking of which, Delirium reminds me of Uglies so much...) It's not a bad read, but it's not as good as the hype claims it to be either. Overall, a 2.5 star review.s.    -There was no real struggle, no real antagonist. It's a series. A trilogy.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|This is a really fun game however it seems to have bugs on larger screens such as the Dell Streak v2.2 5&quot; screen. Certain things don't load like the ground or buttons. Please fix.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I am absolutely hypnotized by this new Album of Lady Gaga! I can´t stop listening to it, and the songs are pure magic! Lady Gaga is the biggest superstar of our time, she is the \\"Madonna\\" of our time!!! Never ever have I seen an artist being that amazing like she is. Not only is her music superb, hynotizing, captivating.... I could fill this with so much more words.... she is also a fashion icon of her own! Highly recommand this Album! This will be a classic forever!
