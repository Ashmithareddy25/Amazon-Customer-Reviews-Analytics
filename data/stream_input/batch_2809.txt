B0055PMURG|5.0|Great story of courage for a young girl. Good acting and beautiful scenery. Always enjoy these true life events of people who don't give up and inspire us who complain of minor issues not being glad in what we have.
1401235425|4.0|I'm new to comics because I recently had an interest after watching my old childhood shows of Teen Titans.<br />Batman seems like a great character and I will definitely be reading more 52 Comics of him
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Trite but true: this book not only is enormously captivating, it is chock full full of twists. Make sure you don't have anything else to do when you start reading it!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|In true Hosseini style so many of the elements of this novel are heartbreaking, but it's the rawness of the characters that brings the reader to fall in love with each of them.  I particularly enjoyed this book because of the fascinating way Hosseini weaves his characters lives into one another, showing how we all are truly connected and what each of us do affects one another.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is a great piece of musical history.  I also really loved the last 1/3 of the movie where they were writing songs in the studio.  Really interesting stuff
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|The Mad Max trilogy in one blue ray package. All three movies are presented with good transfers and sound mixes. The steel box packaging is nice, but is just that, a box to hold a typical 3-disc blue ray case. A nice set for anyone who doesn't have the individual discs. There are no additional supplements in this set that aren't available in the singly issued discs.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A lot of different stories of people who, somehow or other, are intertwined in some way.  Some more good. Some more bad than others, but all with a lot of depth.  Can get a little confusing but keep going and it will all become clear!
B002M3SP28|5.0|I bought this book a couple of years ago in the Bargain Book section of Barnes and Noble. Great story and of course Archer is a good writer. Recently, in a book &#34;purge&#34; my wife requires I threw it out. Then, a month or two ago my brother in law sent me a book entitled &#34;Into the Silence&#34; by Wade Davis, an historian. Great book by the way if you're interested and about the Great War and the Mallory expeditions. I was so impressed with the Davis book I remembered the book I threw out, &#34;Paths of Glory&#34;, and couldn't stand not to own it. Ordered the hardcover from Amazon, which is a bargain book with them. Just came today and I put it in my bookshelf. They, (Amazon) do say this is a bargain book and limited in availability. If you think you might want it you should get it. You won't be sorry.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|she loved it and is 7 keeps her busy when she needs something to entertain her i highly recommend it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have always preferred google search to any other search engine.  Whenever I need to find something google search has always brought it up on the first page.  I am sure other search engines have their good points, however, google search is for me!

B0095P31L6|4.0|Once again the grand kids in the TV room, and you're in charge while the women are shopping, and the movie pulls you in with the oddness of the characters, and the fantastic characters..
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a very good sequel to the hunger games,really left me hanging at the end. It was really difficult in their society,even the residents of the capital were not free.  Sad that one man has that much power. Good read,and adventurous.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Even I have been lured into the TV room where my grandkids were watching Goonies..  you try to get back to your duties, but the next part pulls you deeper into the next part and on and on until its over.  A great movie for kids, but adults are pulled ito it also
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great service from the seller.  Delivered quickly and efficiently.  Would order again.  Helped me to loose 20 lbs and really helped my arthitis pain.  Would only purchase the Wheat Belly Cookbook if doing it again.  Love the program!
B007JMW46U|4.0|Fantastic way to get in some good reading when your schedule doesn't allow you to on you average day. I can listen while I am driving or through by blue tooth ear while I am working.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|An excellant read, once you start reading you will have a hard time putting the book down.  The subject is so relevant to women the working world.  I would recommend this to the younger generation for a confident,  strong start upon entering higher education.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|Great product works well I would recommend it to everyone who has a need for office media tools to work on phone media.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|This series was so similar to Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades was however a much better read. Feel like I threw my money away on these books and waisted my time reading them.  Kept hoping the story would get better but never happened.  Would not recommend this at all.
B0031784L6|5.0|i like the lyrics and the womens voices.the songs are edgy and some are ethereal. i  over male vocalistsprefer female vocalists
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|good movie. a few exceptional actors injected into the mix (dunno why they accepted). solid acting. hits all of the requisite bases. by the numbers delivery. nothing wrong. nothing too right.<br /><br />nothing exceptional. story meanders like water circling the drain towards an inevitable clock-out ending.<br /><br />it hurts me to see a promising story sacrificed to expedite the foundation of The Avengers.<br /><br />whatevs. welcome to 21st century cinema. &#62;=)

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Recieved one of these from my brother in law. I have other sharpeners of a similar make but this one really seems to put a superior edge on your knives, also very compact. Ideal to throw in your hiking pack.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is for when you are bored,  when you are trying to find a game to play, when you are getting your children to play great game,  you will love this game. It is addicting and this is the best game of the decade you should really download it....
B005FFW46S|5.0|Terry Pratchett has unleashed within his thinly-veiled Discworld this time--- not a parody, of which he's a misstep, not a satire, of which he devilishly listened, but no less than a biting poignant strident document testifying to civil rights and obliterating the ignorant scourge of racism as could be imagined (accompanied by a plethora of bacon sandwiches, of course).<br /><br />Pritchett, now well into the long stride of his publications, here proves that his wit, his style, and the exhilarating freshness of the voice that is pure Pratchett--- is still in its prime.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I can take it anywhere on my kindle fire and its a great way to express your creativity. Its tottaly worth $7.00!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|What Red lacks in plot and storyline is made up in great acting.  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I love this movie! if you like SFI and LOVE movies this is the perfect one!! :) I will watch it all over again!
B00E9PXI3S|3.0|I would watch any Rachel McAdams or Noomi Rapace movie simply for the acting and so there was no way I could miss the one movie that has both!  Admittedly though, these two actors were just about the only reason I didn't turn off the TV and go to bed.  For a movie that presumes to be a sexual thriller - it really wasn't that sexual (which is OK by me) but it also wasn't that thrilling.  There are a number of surprising twists and turns - or maybe the problem was that there was nothing BUT twists and turns - to the point that you aren't sure what it is you were supposed to be thinking in the first place.  It might be that I just wasn't sharp enough to catch on to everything, but the movie didn't hold my interest enough to want to try.  As for Noomi and Rachel - they definitely delivered in key scenes, but there is only so far an actor can take a movie.  This one needed a little assistance from the director, writers, and whoever it is that spliced together this film in hodgepodge fashion.  I give it three stars for Rachel and Noomi - otherwise it's a one-star flick.
B00992CF6W|3.0|when  i play minecraft i am always alone in my house and in my mining shaft. And I don't have a dog or a cat to keep me company when i mine so please add update 1.4 and the update with cats in it. Also for some reason monsters won't spawn at  night anymore in all of my survival worlds.
1451695195|4.0|How can meeting God not just once but multiple times be told from a secular point of view?  I wouldn't have believed it possible until I read Proof of Heaven.  I enjoyed the book and had a hard time putting it down.  It was well written as a page turner, always making the reader wonder what was going to happen next.  With this being said, Alexander uses quite a few medical terms and concepts that are sometimes hard to follow.  He comes to the conclusion that God must have meant to use him for a purpose, sending him back without brain damage considering what he went through.  He tries to say this without conceit.  I believe he is right and if you are in the medical field, especially if you are an atheist or on the fence about God, this is a MUST read.  If you are a layman, like me, it is still a good book, just a bit strange.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved it. It was like and English version of Little house on the Prairie. Good for all ages. A must see
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|This is a great little case for the Kindle Fire HD 7\\".  I have one for each my kids- one through the Vine program and one that I purchased on my own.  The case fits snugly but is not hard to zipper at all.  I also like that it has two zippers; I can zip it almost all the way and then still have it plugged in to charge.  I'm not sure how much protection the Kindle would get if it fell onto the floor, but it's perfect to protect it from scratches and other minor bumps.  I can just toss it into my purse or bag and don't have to worry about the Kindle jostling against other items.  I do wish that it was available in a variety of colors.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Thanks a lot for an update that won't let me back into the game.  How can we get rid of the &quot;update&quot;?  I was enjoying the game a lot before the change. The rating would have been much higher before the so-called update.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I have a few automatic wind watches from Sekio I was a little disappointed that the watch was a few mm bigger beautiful watch can't seem to take it off
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was loving the game, however there is an update and have not been able to apply the update on my Kindle fire.  Haven't been able to play at all.....
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is really cute.  The graphics and the soundtrack are fun, but I don't have a facebook account and don't want one.  This thing asks to for my facebook account.  No thanks.  I didn't get far enough in the game, but it did hint about a \\"pay as you go\\" system.  You get to buy bananas and some other type of extras.  Again, no thanks.  I prefer games that are a simple fee.  I guess those are becoming rare.  Oh well.  This would have been fun.  I uninstalled it.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|It put me into another world that I don't know a lot about very honest writing<br />Couldn't put it down had me captured
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|content was fascinating, but more like a research document than i expected. it ended so abruptly, i thought i lost part of the book
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is a great buy for any fan of tower defense. It has a couple of nice differences from the standard game that make it especially enjoyable. I definitely recommend it.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Mark Wahlberg and cast are better than the script.  Not the most exciting story and it plods along... It's okay really sums it up
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|i like the game but it crashes often when loading. i done know if this is because of the game or my kindle is starting to fill up and is getting up in age. (2.5 years old)
B005MMY9A8|3.0|If Star Wars didn't exist, this could be season one of a new series of involvement in the &#34;other&#34; worlds.  Lots of action.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've watched it 3 times in 3 days... I'll watch it again and again - awesome movie can't wait for next one!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What drama!  Who knew that such drama went on in those old castles?  I love how everyone regardless of status is caught up in the goings on in Downton Abbey.  Actors and actresses do a fine job.

B001XUPD94|2.0|Each of the first 6-7 Star Trek films of the original crew had reasons to enjoy them, specially when places in their original time.  Not this one: skip it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot wait until Season 4! Ok my friends were always talking about this show. If you watch the first episode you will be hooked!
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I love this movie. If you're a fan of the Predator movies and Alien movies, I think this might be the best one. Pure Awesomeness
B002SAUCBC|3.0|Some people like where it went, others didn't. I thought it was OK but could have been executed better. Overall its a fun read that will keep you interested and entertained. I just don't think the progression matched the genius concept.
B004RLPTT0|5.0|I love a lot of the songs on here - cool remixes and collaborations that I'm still listening to frequently. Good stuff
1416955070|3.0|The title has always been very intriguing to me and with all of the hype of the movie coming out I decided it was time try it out- though I have to say the title only applied to a small portion of the book.  The premise of a race of superhumans protecting the rest of us from a demon incursion was very interesting with a lot of potential for the future.  The mythology was creative, though, doled out to the reader in long bits of explanation, but if you are used to the genre you won't think twice about it.  The execution, however, did leave a bit to be desire.  I found the beginning really awkward and a bit off putting.  Some of the writing really could have been smoothed out a little more with some help from the editors.  The action did make up for shortcomings some.  But again, like with her Infernal Devices Series, I felt the character development and action weren't very well balanced. Eventually, I got past the rough beginning and then the story trotted along at a very nice pace with only few other places of awkwardness to slow it down.<br /><br />The characters were a rather mixed bag.  I liked Simon and found him very lovely; his feelings for Clary seemed very natural and I also got why she had never really considered him before.  At the beginning I wasn't particularly thrilled with Clary; it took a while for her to grow on me and to be honest I can't quite pinpoint when I started to like her.  Jace was arrogant and not very likable and I really couldn't connect to his feelings when he encountered Valentine which really injured the climax.  I did like the interplay between Jace and Clary and found their chemistry compelling and was dismayed at the obstacles thrown in their way even at the cost of Simon's happiness.  Luke was the character I found the most comfortable, in the sense he seemed very fleshed out and well-constructed, his back story was provocative and his actions reasonable.<br /><br />Like I said before the climax was a little disappointing and there was a very little resolution to the story.  I am okay with how little resolution there was only because the next four are already out and in my possession as a result of book-buying-fever.<br /><br />Not a master piece, but overall I did like reading it enough to purchase the rest.  Hopefully the flaws will be ironed out some in the next one.<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot come was a very little resolution to the story.

B0000DIXDR|5.0|Just kidding. I would never do that. Great movie, a classic. Dumb romantic love story about a kid from the wrong side of the tracks and the good rich girl. What could be better? (answer: Princess Bride)
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I agree with others spending money for gems to get ponies is crazy. Also sharing on Facebook, my kids are too young , for Facebook. Shouldn't be an option.
0060254920|5.0|I have this for my office and still love it. Great illustrations and kids love it. Plus, we all have some Max in us. Also Wild Things. Good stuff
B00338QENI|5.0|Love this book, very well written, I felt like I knew the family and have mixed feelings about cell research now that I didn't have prior too reading.
0441013597|5.0|I love Dune and the Dune series. It's fantasy/sci fi with philosophy and religion mixed in. Frank Herbert is a great writer and Dune is one of my favorite books. I read it in my 20s and it had an impact on how I see the world. I still think about Dune in metaphysical times. Interesting stuff
B00480OHWK|5.0|I downloaded this book on kindle for my son to further his reading. It's doing just that by allowing him to read something that he likes and wants to read. Not to mention I loved the Dr. Seuss library of books when I was younger.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|This book captivated me from beginning to end. Enjoyed every page! I did not want it to end at all.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This review concerns the movie itself, not nit-picking a dvd or Blu-ray version. Star Wars Episode IV was released in May 1977; I was not quite 5 years old yet. One of my earliest memories is going to the theater with my parents and older sister and watching the original release. I do clearly remember that Darth Vader scared the heck out of me then. So, I was not a happy camper when I was carried out of the theater at the end of the movie, but that changed in the next year. I couldn't get enough Star Wars action figures, records, and most importantly, books. My dad didn't get me the kiddie Star Wars storybooks, he got me the Del Rey novel with no pictures, and basically told me to figure it out. I'll bet he regretted that, because I kept asking him what all those big words meant, but I did figure it out, and I think that book boosted my vocabulary at an early age.<br /><br />So to me, this is a lot more than just 'a movie;' it's my childhood. I stayed hooked on Star Wars all the way through Return of the Jedi and after, until Star Wars seemed to fade away in the mid to late 80s. Every scene in this movie, every line of dialogue reminds me of something from my childhood, so I have no choice but to give it 5 stars.<br /><br />I was excited for the prequels, then I thought that Episode I was disappointing, Episode II was very disappointing, (in my opinion, the single worst Star Wars movie) and Episode III was okay. I am keeping a positive attitude about the upcoming Disney sequels, and I am looking forward to seeing if the magic of Episode IV can be re-captured.
159463176X|5.0|I'm surprised to see so many one star reviews, perhaps because I haven't read his previous work.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it with 5 stars.
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|The more I hear him sing traditional the more I believe that is Vince's strength.  He doesn't attempt to improve on these classics.  He just gives them his classic interpretation.  I hope there is a Volume 2.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little pony is something that I love from my childhood and I enjoy this game when I'm bored cause it makes me feel like a kid again :)
B00775D77Y|5.0|Sure, heroin is \\"bad\\" and all that, yet there's no denying that Mark Hollis returned from his time riding the horse a changed man and a deeper musician.  This album marked a profound change of direction for Talk Talk, away from the synth pop they'd started out with and towards a more naturalistic, organic sound fusing rock with some jazzy elements and freer arrangements.  How many artists would be brave enough to do this after having some chart success with their prior records? (It's My Life was a pop masterpiece in my opinion).  Yet Hollis and Co. never looked back and we're fortunate to be left with this and their two more challenging and less commercial follow-ups, Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock.  This is meaningful, soul-deep rock that defies classification and rewards the listener with instrumentation, performances and production that creates an atmosphere of emotional depth and power.  A must-own.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|thought provoking, I liked the whole premise of the movie and the ideas. the ending is great also. rented 2x now
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use.  My preacher's wife uses this Apr as her main Bible and can find scriptures faster than using regular Bible.  Just click on book of Bible and chapter and verse. Love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I played this game up to the hardest levels. I could only not figure out two of the mazes. You can buy help but I never did. It definitely makes you think. If you like mazes you probably like this. It isn't for little kids, however, it's to advanced.
B003U51D58|5.0|I wasn't sure Lost could pull off an ending that would feel satisfying. There was so much going on in this season. But I shouldn't have worried, because it was perfect. A great ending to an amazing show.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The Tudors Season one Grabbed my attention-I had to keep watching.  It was like watching the History Channel-only Better.  Stunning!!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Syfy at it's best!  I watch all the Stargate TV series over and over again.  Better than anything currently on TV.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Great story line but it was confusing with all the jumping around. It was difficult to remember who was the reincarnation of who, especially T the be Ginny. Overly long.

B009CPEOC4|5.0|I loved this movie a lot, did not know what to expect from concerts until I watched this movie.  It shows how hard they work to be there best and to provide a great performance.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is beast i hope my mom lets me get it lol thank you for makeing this mojang thanks
B009WUAK2M|1.0|This movie remains a waste of time for the viewer however, the only advantage remains the money and jobs the movie provided for the behind the scenes employees in need of steady work.  The stars in general provided little if any work worth the pay they earned from the movie.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|After all, &#34;We're Nor the Mafia&#34;...what a crazy interesting movie. Enjoyed it and be sure to pay close attention as the accents are way heavy on this one..I enjoyed it even though it was very long when it need not have been......
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Was a quick purchase while sitting in the living room wondering what to watch on TV. Purchased the season via Amazon's instant view, and was glad that I did. Both my wife and I have enjoyed it, even with three episodes left to watch! Cannot wait to get season two.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|Love the story and even better is the way they made it a cross between a comic book cartoon and a movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and all the different things you can do, like missions and battles. Go Minions! Boo Vecter!
B006ISJQBC|5.0|No surprises here, plot is simple and even though you know what will happen before it does it is still ok. I liked it, no biggie here, just a movie to watch however Colin Ferrall is becoming a fave actor of mine now.....
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I felt embarrassed to have even watched the first one I don't even want to give this one a try.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, it was fun!!!!  I would recommend this game of you like mysteries!!! It took me a minute to get over level 10 but it was great figuring it out, can't wait for more levels.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Ok not new just a bubble popper. Good time waster. Funny voice. Good color. Would not buy.  Good little characters fast mocing
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was entertaining but I just could not get over the authors addiction to words. Vocabulary was so repetitive.  Story line was decent.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Honestly I started watching this when I saw catelyn Stark (GoT character) on the TV ad. And the rest is history. I can't believe I didn't watch the first two seasons earlier.  A must watch. Just watch it to believe it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This has to be the best series in a long time. The characters are so well acted and the episodes are so well written. It has everything including drama, romance, and humor. Only this series can make the Victorian era so interesting. After watching each episode, I cannot wait to watch the next one.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is an awesome TV series featuring everything from witty comedy, drama, and suspense I strongly recommend watching the whole series
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is a great game it is very challenging. The graphics are a<br />wesome. It is a game I can`t stop playing.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Boring, draggy, with a confusing plot....disappointing considering caliber of actors involved.  Couldn't wait until it was over.  Do not recommend.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Frankl's story and his wonderful insight into life drawn from it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in searching for meaning in their lives.
B00448SE4S|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I love the style and it's an all around feel-good movie. Definitely check it out!
0767847431|5.0|Ok this is a old school favorite of mine I love this movie and all the others that fallowed behind it a 10 all day long it is a must that you add this to your movie collection.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I could not understand what he was trying to say. It is like we are on different wave lengths. Maybe it is because he is a doctor which caused his thoughts to be too complex.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The other reviewer is correct. I just installed and now it will not load telling me I need to update. Wait until the next update.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Love the classic books and the movies that are well made from them.<br />This one is really good. Love it.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|I enjoyed the action sequences and the combination duo of The Rock and Bruce Willis.  Not sure if they will make another chapter to this series but if they do I will go see.
B004FV1ESW|5.0|Great movie.  Makes you think about how a small town like the one portrayed in this film breeds a certain type of person.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|One of the funniest episodes the girls fighting over the comic book was hysterical. Can't wait to pick up on blu-ray!
193413712X|5.0|I read this in about a day, maybe two.  It's a real short book, but it really packs a punch.  I find myself thinking about the main father character, especially when he was young, even though it's been a couple years since I read the book.  Definitely worth of its Pulitzer.
0375713751|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  I actually finished it, so there must have been a tiny spark of interest for me but not much.  This woman complained throughout the entire book- I felt like screaming at her, quit your freakin job already!!!  I don't have kids so I'm not sure if this is what's it like but no one would do if it was...
B0064MGU98|4.0|The story line is interesting, the characters are believable, and the camera work is artistically pleasing. I missed this show on tv and am happy to have the opportunity to get it through Amazon
B0044C5SCU|5.0|My wife and I have watched the first four seasons this summer. We love being able to watch shows on demand without commercials.<br />PLEASE make the 5th season free so we can continue watching without having to pay for it!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Lots of Christians might feel like somehow they're &#34;cheating on their Faith&#34; if they read this book.  But it's a fascinating look at the historical era in which Jesus lived, the other &#34;Messiahs&#34; who lived both before and after Jesus.  So don't be afraid.  It's a well written, well researched and very interesting read!
0738737909|5.0|This tarot card deck is amazing.  I'm confused as to the bad reviews.  If you read the book it will tell you the meaning in which the word Illuminati is used and what it means.  It truly is an awesome deck and very high quality.  The colors and the images are amazing.  A must buy for any intuitive or tarot reader.
0425263924|3.0|I think this will be the final book I'm reading in this series. I have definitely lost my interest in this series. I should have heeded the advice given in the thousands of negative reviews.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is one of the funniest and heart warming movies you will see.<br />The fast wit, the humor and the story itself leaves you feeling and believing, that there is hope and love in the world, no matter what age you are
B008602KQI|5.0|Based on the book by Suzanne Collins.<br />This movie is about Katniss Everdeen who volunteers as tribute for her little sister, Prim during the reaping of the 74th annual Hunger Games. In Panem, tributes are chosen from children between the ages of 12 and 18.During the reaping, one girl's and one boy's name is drawn from each of the 12 districts to go into the arena to battle to the death. 24 tributes enter the arena and a lone tribute emerges as the victor. This movie tells Katniss' story of survival during the games.<br /><br />This movie has action, drama, romance, and more....I highly recommend this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Fun game great graphics but the controls are TERRIBLE. I have to swipe from one edge to the other or top to bottom to get the minion to react. I know its not my phone as several other similar games function correctly
B00DB31Y3U|1.0|This game is the worst game I have ever played in my entire life!!!! Don't waste you're money on it!!! Don't even take the time to look at it!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Every time I get on it says upgrade at app store then I go to the app store. When I go to the app store it doesn't allow me to upgrade. I may be doing it wrong. But I'm really confused.<br /><br />Janae
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is one of the greatest games I have ever played, and I just love how challenging the different levels can be. The birds are also very adorable with their bushy eyebrows. This is a must-have app, for not only is the actual game fun, but the Angry Birds &quot;Toons&quot; are very fun to watch. Plus, there are barely any ads! A+
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! It's great to have so many great products, recipes, and craft ideas all in one place in an easy to navigate app.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is just perfect! It is better than any other alarm, real or virtual. I love how in order to press the dismiss or snooze there is a choice for solving math problems. The volume crescendo is also a great feature, for I hate it when my clock scares me awake. There are also numerous different options in settings, so I can customize my alarm to fit what the alarm is for. Really the best alarm clock app ever.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Please note that I am posting this review on Amazon where I purchased and received the app. Also, I have only played on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".<br /><br />I totally love this game! There are a few bugs but it's nothing that stops you from enjoying it.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />The game saves onto the cloud so if you delete it from the device you can always re install it and continue where you left off.<br /><br />You can play with other people without  having to add strangers on Facebook.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />I am not able to connect to Facebook (however my mom plays this game on her kindle and she can)<br /><br />It says it needs to sync and I have to turn my kindle off, then back on to make it stop.<br /><br />You do not need to spend real money but it is almost impossible not to.<br /><br />When you visit someone's farm it won't let you go home, and if you do manage to go home it messes up your achievements momentarily.<br /><br />They need a pop-up to say, \\"Are you sure you want to use RC?\\" Before you use it.<br /><br />Whenever you \\"ask\\" friends for something you need to wait 24 hours, which is fine except it doesn't tell you the exact time you need to wait before asking again.<br /><br />OVERALL SCORE:<br />Yes I'd recommend it to a friend.<br /><br />~BritMae<br />Click \\"yes\\" if my review helped
B001JIFYSA|4.0|I usally love any movie with Hugh Grant, but the other actors and actresses were fabulous.  Loved the story lines for each character, could have done without the porno movie making, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
014103579X|4.0|If your looking to expand your ideas about modern Art Theory this book is a good one to pick up.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great story that was hard to put down. The message was great and important to remember.  I strongly recommend<br />This book and think EVERYONE should read it.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Love the game, hate that you can't figure out how to play a friend in a game. And you never get to go first????
B00ECUARO8|2.0|I love Matthew McConaghey which is why I got the movie but it was pretty drawn out with little action.  To sum it up I would say this movie is &#34;much ado about  nothing.&#34;  DIdn't like the ending either.
B000E41MRC|5.0|Triumph of the Will is on every American film student's required viewing list and was on my own required viewing as \\"Social Studies.\\"  This film's transfer to DVD is very decent indeed.  TOTW must be viewed to understand film-making. The 17 minutes short film also on this DVD, a German military training film, Day of Freedom, is a also a very decent transfer to DVD.  Viewing Triumph of the Will provokes the question, Who Financed Hitler, which is the title of a book by an author who followed this trace.  Well, indirectly and to restore Germany's excellent technology (the Mauser bolt-action rifle is the prototype of every bolt-action rifle hunters use, the Schmeisser machine guns the basis for the finest most accurate auto-loading infantry weapons) following The Great War's reduction of German industries, the Allied Nations rised Germany without a clue to also rising a totalitarian nation. Author James Pool, below, goes right at this subject.  Clinton Williams in Michigan<br /><br />[[ASIN:0671760831 Who Financed Hitler Funding 1919 1933]]<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/James-Pool/e/B001HD02N4/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|great movie!  my kids and I have watched it several times already!  can't wait to watch #2 and #3 (in production?--about minions)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I wasn't able to put this book down, and finished it within a day (which is a rarity for me).  It starts off intriguing, and quickly becomes completely gripping.  The author admits that TWIN PEAKS was an influence here, and it comes through - not in any specific plot points (beyond a Federal agent going into a strange small town), but in a more general sense of tone.  PINES also echoes some of the author's prior work, such as BREAK YOU and STIRRED, but these elements are now cast into a completely different light.  Since the climax of PINES so satisfying, I hope this level of excitement can be sustained for future books in the planned series.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|You just can't beat Herriot's stories, and I've read them all--several times--to my kids, friends--everybody who'll listen. Great for animal lovers or those who just like stories!
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I started to watch the \\"Camelot\\" DVD last night. The first oddity was that it didn't come up to a menu but just went straight into the overture like a cheap knock-off. I didn't worry about that but I soon began to worry as I realized that people's lips were moving but I wasn't hearing any words. I did hear the music so I knew my sound system was working. I tried fast forwarding but just saw more of the same. I finally got smart and hit \\"menu\\" on the remote control. There was, in fact, a menu! I went to settings and found that the default was to play the music tracks only with no voice! I can see where that might be a nice option if you just want some sound in the background but I suspect more people buy it to watch the movie! Seems like an awfully odd choice for a default. I don't know if this was peculiar to my particular model of player or if it is like that on all the DVD's. Certainly I've never seen a disk act like that before. Anyway, if it happens to you, now you know not to panic and to just go change the audio setting. Enjoy!<br /><br />Oh yeah, another comment. I found the very end of the movie when Arthur says, \\"Some do sparkle\\" to be remarkably similar to the Camelot legend episode of Babylon 5 (\\"A Late Delivery From Avalon\\" Season 3, episode 13) where \\"Arthur\\" says, \\"The numbers do add up\\". I have to wonder if the author, J Michael Straczynski, was influenced by the movie and if it was conscious or not. I'll probably never know.
0143124544|5.0|Jojo please write more! the book \\"Me Before You\\"was so moving and it made me feel like I was with Clark all the way.  I have a new outlook on life and death now  what a wonderful love story. my wish list will include JOJO'S books!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I thought it was something I would use and didn't find it to be of any interest.  Others may like it.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a useful free app that allows one to listen to radio streams from a number of  local, national, and international sources.  Easy to set up and use.  Allows one to set a list of favourites.  Works well.
1451695195|4.0|I was engrossed with this book from the start to finish. We all need to read of such an experience.
B0006A9IVQ|2.0|Film is not clear. Film is grainy. Sophia and Marcello are excellent.<br /><br />This is the 2nd DVD that I have bought - no improvement.
B003ZFCBJ0|4.0|A heartbreaking story about a girl and her father. Yes, it's about a relationship, but it's not as much as a romance as you'd think. If you focus on the story and not Miley Cyrus' horrible acting, the story of the relationship between her and her father is truly emotional.
1452101248|5.0|Wonder, creative, & meatless recipes, beautiful photos to intrigue both veg-heads and meat lovers alike.  I would recommend this book!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I thought that it would be. I was weary about how a zombie would fall in love with a girl, but the way they explained it in the movie made a lot of sense and gave this movie something that other zombie movies lack. I'm not typically a fan of zombie related things, but this was a good segue into the genre and had some pretty funny moments as well. I would recommend this :)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works good on my kindle fire hd. Use it everyday. I highly recommend this app. Love how easy it is to use.
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected, I really only picked it up because Alex Pettyfer was in it. After seeing this movie, I've been inspired to read the books!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|It's a beautiful interpretation of the stage version.  It's mystical and lyrical captured on film.  Can never get enough of the songs.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Bringing all of your childhood memories to life right in front of your eyes with an exciting story about the Easter bunny, sandman, Santa Claus, and the Tooth Fairy. This movie had some scary elements for kids, but the story was truly excellent. I watched this movie probably about 3 or 4 times in the span of a month. It's my favorite animated movie now!
1401233376|4.0|I have very little knowledge of the current DC comics super hero universe, but that didn't stop me enjoying this volume. In fact, my lack of DC expertise may have contributed to enjoyment because it is an alternate history adventure. Writer Jeff Johns and pencil artist Andy Kubert are at the top of their games here.
B000002KHF|5.0|This is more like a greatest hits album, there are so many good songs. &#34;Into the Mystic&#34; is my all-time favorite song.
0785153942|3.0|I enjoyed this graphic novel. The writing and the art is solid and professional. Most of the story was covered in exposition in the movie.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book fits so well into what we have been trying to apply in learning processes with youth at risk in El Salvador.  A great resource for reinforcing the training programs we have had with Mickingbird Education.  And a great read
B00BC0JI6O|4.0|This is another solid effort from the veteran prog rockers. Yes, there is a new lead singer. He has a more traditional metal voice. Your enjoyment of this album will hinge on your ability to put your preconceptions aside and appreciate the music for what it is.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoy the challenge. Very challenging and nice colors. Will keep me busy and awake while I try to master all the number of games available.
1608871827|5.0|This is the best movie art book I've ever purchased. It's great to see the detailed creature designs and the design process behind the exciting movie.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell is a man with a tremendous story.  We have grown apathetic towards the men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Marcus takes us into his story, from his preparation, selection and training as a Navy Seal, to the Operation Redwing story and the miraculous tale of his survival.<br /><br />Great read.
B00DIJ49UW|4.0|I've been listening to this soundtrack over and over since I bought it. The addition of electric guitar to traditional symphonic instrumentation was a great idea. Heavy metal music for a heavy metal movie.
B009ZM76J2|5.0|This movie is a must see. Great story line it really makes you think about<br />how people through history have justifies their action against other races.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This is free, but that's about the only thing going for it. It frequently crashes and/or will not load a page and needs to be refreshed. If all you want to do is get on FB and look at your homepage, then this might work for you. If you want to do anything else, find another app.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|For a flashlight it is great. Down side is it does not let you use any other apps while the flash light is active.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great for those wanting a hot read without the violence in other popular series. A racy read I highly recommend
B00280LYIM|5.0|Super interesting!! Mr. Riordan really nailed it this time!! I truly felt like I was in the story!! Go Percy!!
0062255657|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. It was brutal, but I finished it. Glad it was a short read.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Great show! Very original, I really enjoyed the movie, great for a friday night movie night in with the family!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|The movie is great. We saw Red 2 and decided we should watch the first one second(don't recommend that order), but we enjoyed both. My problem was with the download. First off we decided to watch it one evening and find out the download is going to take 6 hours to download to our Tivo. After that downer we went on with the download and chose to watch it the following evening. An hour and a half into the movie, it stalls out and we can't finish the thing! Very disturbing! I call Amazon and they tell me to reset router and Tivo and try a new download. He refunds the cost of the 1st download and I still have to pay for the 2nd. He says it should take around an hour for the download. After waiting an hour we gave up and went to bed, so finally the following evening we get to finish the movie three days in. I gave the movie 5 stars because it is a good movie, love the cast, but amazon needs to work on the downloading process. I think I'll stick to Netflix.
B000BI0WOA|4.0|A  real treasure to find. Very good songs that brings back memories. I am taking it on road trips. It keeps me awake by singing along.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it!! This is my third time reading it and I didn't get bored with it at all. The hunger games has a thrilling storyline that keeps you hooked for the whole book.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|Best Disney has doen is awhile, both kids not only know the songs but the dances. Would recommend it for anyone of any age.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I didn't know it was possible to screw up a youtube app. The interface stinks and the setup is crummy. Kinda basic but that's it.....
141970642X|5.0|My grandson and I have read these books from the very first publication, we read them together. We have been to every movie and eagerly await the newest book being released.<br />The author has a unique way of identifying the angst of being a pre-teen.<br />This book tells the story of the movie in the same manner as the books. My grandson loved it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|that I have to, for the first time, limit his use of my Kindle Fire HD. I would like to mention, that it isn't like he is zoning out, though. In &#34;creative mode&#34; he is building things, as if he were playing with &#34;virtual&#34; Legos. This I can withstand, so I let him be. I give this 5 stars due to my 9 year old son's pure enjoyment and his eagerness in showing me the fantastic structures he creates!
B005QYKD4I|3.0|It was ok.  Not much else I can say. It was worth the rental. Glad I didn't buy the movie.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I love these Home Alone movies the kid is so clever and keeps those 2 guys wondering what will happen next to them a must see
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|Most of the tricks are the SAME, SAME OLD stuff. If you have watched 10 or more horror movies like Paranormal Activity, you will find there are only one or two different tricks here. For example, one of the popular tricks like framed pictures fell off the wall by themselves was repeated here.<br /><br />Most of the bad things happened to the kids.  After a short time, they became tiring.<br />The first 75 minutes were boring and sleep-inducing. Nothing serious happened until then. At that time one of the little girl was.... right in front of all the adults in broad day light, NOT at night. It's more like a startling scene than a scary one.<br /><br />In short, it's not scary, just boring. It's a waste of time and money.<br />If you still want to watch it, you'd better borrow a copy from your local library. That way, you won't regret having wasted your money later.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I watched this with my son and what a great flick recommend highly  Sean Connery out does himself in this movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife kept telling me about this show, and I finally watched a few episodes and was hooked instantly! I have now finally finished this season and still cannot wait for the next!
B000P0J0AG|5.0|al pacino out does himself in this movie, he is such a great actor  this one you can add to your godfather collection a must see and have
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is amazing! The most fun I've ever had in awhile! I love the graphics and the whole process of everything!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It did not load correctly so I am unable to play it. Not happy at all about that. Wish that it would work
B001E25MBK|5.0|I am extremely pleased with the collection. The quality is excellent,  the younger members of my family had not seen the original version; therefore watching all of the episodes with them was a joy,
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is well made i wish they had more like it i gave four star only cuz they try to sale gems to you all the time
140006922X|5.0|This book really has blown my mind.  Mr Aslan thank you for your scholarship and the many years and hours you have spent in putting this new perspective together on the myths and made up stories surrounding Jesus' life.  Ever since I was a child I have felt that something was not right about who Jesus was, but I couldn't put my finger on the problem, and now you have done that for me.  Many thanks!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Get this game now best there ever was better than spiderman and batman don&quot;t just take it from me take it from the other 1364
B00CS65QGW|4.0|Cool Song for Today's Music. Kinda sounds like a cool funky throwback of like the 70's funk era and it actually works and comes through in a good way.
B00271HTLI|4.0|Fun and well done.  Nice adaption of a good novel.  Kids and adults all enjoyed the film.  But took some time to download.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|For such a small package, this LEGO set has 480 pieces! For the minecraft lover that also loves LEGO, this set is for you!
B001XVD21Y|4.0|Mixed review but a must see for anyone who likes the genre. Some excellent  acting. And with the Whitey Bulger cas wrapping up, very topical.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|After the Gold Rush has always been a favorite of min, The other songs on the album are also great and make me remember the &#34;old&#34; days.
B005CKPQNE|4.0|How can you not see this if you've come this far? And this helps get us to the final season.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I bought this for a friend who loved it.  It's a serious movie but really is moving.  I'm not used to too many serious dog movies, but it's nice to know that they are out there.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A good read, but not as good as my favorite book, 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'.  Too much chopping and changing of characters, and jumping from one year to another, otherwise a good book.  Kept me reading...
B00A2H9P98|5.0|This was such an amazing action packed movie. Channing tatum kicked some serious but in this movie all while looking soo sexy in his white tee. Jamie in his Jordans even kicked some butt, this is a great movie. I really enjoyed this one, if our president faces these kinds of things no wonder they age so quickly while in office. Amazing action packed movie definitely one for keeping and watching over and over.
1572816295|5.0|Very nice female-friendly version, some other decks are much more male dominated.  The art is simply stunning on this deck.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|because I wanted the product.  I have printer so it was an app worth having. Good idea from HP people.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Loved this game, but won't let me play anymore. Keeps telling me to update and sends me to app store. Once in app store it only says open. I open the game and it tells me to update and sends me to app store. It just keeps going in a cycle with no update and won't let me play anymore! Very disappointed! Hope it gets fixed soon!
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I now own a faster, better nexus, DOLPHN is not a thought now.  It worked  better than what I had then.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very addictive, you wont know when to put it down. fun for all ages. caught vector for me!! He is very sneaky.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I watched the movie first then had to read the book to better understand the nuances and &#34;flashes&#34; in the movie. Just finished the book. I would recommend it to others wholeheartedly.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's a great American true story. It reads like a novel yet it's packed with much useful information and history.
1416955070|4.0|I saw a story from this series come up on bookbub ages ago and got it. Low and behold I found out it was not the first book, so I didn't read it but I was dying to read the whole series. Recently I've been seeing the trailer for the movie so I decided to bite the bullet and take the plunge. Overall I loved it. The story line grabbed me, and even though I felt like I was reading a Twilight/Harry Potter FanFiction crossover I was enthralled. However, the end just didn't sit well with me. I will not say too much because I don't want to spoil it for others, but I just can't believe what happened.  For all the hype up to the end it was a hard pill to swallow that the \\"big reveal\\" was accepted by just about every character. I will read on in the series because I am HOPING that the end was just a trick of Valentine's. I'm hoping the rest of the series will make up for this first blunder.
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|Plenty of action and a large variety of different emotions. The scenes and photography are believably great. It has a terrific cast.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is so awesome. I love it so much. I have fun playing it. you can try to beat your friends score.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Too much cussing but Paul is totally cool and it keeps me constantly laughing, while being a warm movie too.
B007PFD90G|5.0|The book was very long but gave the reader an in-site into. ISLAM and it's origins as well as the author's life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. Does everything you need it to. And... its FREE. Why pay for a calculator app when you can get this one?
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Wife purchased
B000V4UFZK|5.0|This movie STILL scares me and creeps me out! It's one of my favorites-:a must see for all. Considering the year  it came out, the special effects are spectacular!
B008MM9630|4.0|this is not a complicated game.  really fun although some quests cannot be completed withoutvusing gems.  that is really irritating.  been playing it sporadicallt for over a year.
0316228532|3.0|I am finding it hard to stay with the story. I will try and finish it but I am not sure I will.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Loved reading this it was like letting my imagination play the show in my head it was so awesome can't wait to read the rest
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I like the whole setup. Characters are interesting and varied, and the stories are involving. It's a good legal drama.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this app so much! but  they need to lower the price:/ but its still the best one and you can build anything
B001N1DPDE|3.0|This is a great knife.  Heavy and well made, like any good tool, has its place.  It certainly isn't for everyone, but it works for me.  If you know what it is you want before you buy it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The sheath on the other hand is complete garbage.  I feel insulted and slighted that they would even bother with such a crappy sheath for such a great knife.  The plastic above the upper grommets was separating right out of the box.  Junk.  Very disappointed.<br /><br />5 stars for the knife.<br /><br />1 star for the sheath.<br /><br />On closer inspection of the knife as compared to my older Becker knives, the quality is slightly lower on this knife.  They don't even emboss their name in the knife anymore, now its a painted stamp on the knife.<br /><br />Make that 3 1/2 to 4 stars for the knife.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 keeps the fantastic series going! Fantastic writing for amazing actors that take you to 1920 England. The ending left me wishing that I could watch next season right now.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|Just not my preference in a smartphone game. It was free so I tried it. My son may like it, but suspect it may be too mundane for him.
0316066524|5.0|So I just like David Foster Wallace's writing, and not because it's hip or cool to like.  I don't mind all the crazy elaborate footnotes, some of which have their own footnotes.  There were several passages I thought were amazing enough to transcribe and send to friends.  It does meander a bit, but the insight is astounding.  I'm tempted to say it has a lot of dry humor, but it doesn't seem like D.F.W. was trying to be funny, but rather describing the world as he saw it, and it just happens to be funny.  It's a big fat book but when I really like a book, I don't want it to ever end, so I like big fat books if they're really good.  And this one is!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Too much killing,making plans to kill.  It didn't leave me with a good feeling.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I downloaded this onto my ipad and tried to play it. I have no idea why anyone would waste their time with this silly game. It also did not work very good on the iPad. I would recommend everyone delete it off their computer and go do some activity outside. Get your heart beating, sweat some. I have just finished writing this and am going to take my own advice and get outside and give the dogs a walk.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I read the book and several months later I watched the video. I enjoyed both of them very much. Look forward to more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought this book was very good, characters were amazing. Read the book in about 2 days and when I put it down all I could do was look forward to reading it again. Read with a box of tissues.
B004ADH1RI|2.0|The opening was great....lots of action, but then it switched scenes drastically and  I could not get passed the scene in the living room of one of the kids home.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|I am a bartender and server, and these saved my feet! Like walking on the moon, haha. Bouncy, yet firm.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read all of his works.  I am fascinated by Afghanistan.  He weaves characters and events masterfully.. Hosseini is one of my favorite authors.  Genuis.
0385349947|5.0|I know she gets a bad rap, but there were so many times I thought, &#34;I've never even thought of that!&#34;  I found solace in her vignettes and it eased some of my struggle with the question &#34;why do I get deemed a villain for doing the same things my male peers do?&#34;  As a rising female leader with two young children, I really enjoyed reading it.  I felt enlightened, inspired, and comforted all at once.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like it..its better and louder the my cell. You should get this app and you will see how good it really is.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Its only a level of the Pac-Man game. I don't like the touch pad controls as it is easy to make a mistake. I would recommend buying a console version
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I played the first two and loved them. This one has a nice narrative to complement the already phenomenal game. Learning life lessons and having fun. It doesn't get any better!!!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|If I wanted to do more high profile stuff, I would use a laptop or a computer to do this that adobe reader should do.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Its fun but sometimes you have to use money if you want more acorns inexact fast amount of time to meet a deadline.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I adore minions. What a fun game. I love the animation, noises, and all the minion options.  Can't wait to play more!
1933952806|5.0|I just acquired a Nikon D7000 and it did not take me long to realize that I was not going to master this camera and all it's awesome features without some assistance. After reading a few reviews I decided that this was the best book on the subject of the D7000.  I was correct in that assumption.  This book is written by an author who has a lot of knowledge and a very down -to - earth writing style.  I am very pleased with my purchase of this book. Ron E.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a great book !<br /> John Corey is the best' .  He is really hysterical. I highly recommend this book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Soon you will be able to cast ALMOST ANYTHING to your display, local media included with no Plex server in the way, it's already working, as soon as Google finalizes the Chromecast SDK it will be released by CyanogenMod.    [...]    I was able to get in on the first batch and after having it a while I have to say this thing is quite amazing, especially for the price.  It's simplistic, small, and has different methods for providing power to the device (plug in to regular outlet, USB, and through HDMI by itself is your TV/display supports it so NO cords at all).  With just the supported apps right now it's amazing.  I had given up on Netflix about two years ago and was able to get the 3 months free deal.  It's amazing how simple the phone/tablet interface is and how setting it up and casting is so easy.  Dolby Digital Plus HD Video that looks great.  Next I jumped over to YouTube and played some different files, one that I use a lot as a good benchmarks is a Samsung 1080p demo.  It looked amazing through my Samsung S3, my year old Nexus 7, and casting from a Chrome tab itself inside Windows.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|This product did not do what it was advertised to do, but I tried it because I was looking for something to clean my Kindle files.  I was disappointed. Very disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game also because I love the no I love the movies and all those running games.this game is fun to play when I'm bored
B007THA4FI|3.0|Only got interesting after the first half. Took me nearly 6 months to actually get through the first half. Don't think I'd recommend it unless you have absolutely nothing else to read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A interesting twist, looking at life from a dog's perspective.  Lots of drama mixed with tender moments.  Great for pet owners and those that aren't as well.  Many analogies to life and how we perceive it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We needed to watch this season to get caught up on the series. It has become a topic of conversation whenever we get together with friends. We can't wait for the next season to start in January!
B005ES0YA4|5.0|very nice item, nice material. I recommend them for walking, working, being at home. good quality material. liked color and price.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great for kids and adults. My children love playing it and don't realize how much they are learning doing so. Problem solving!!!  Just great fun
B002HFWBUI|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it years ago.  It's a love story about dominance and submission. I can't tell you any more than that so you'll have to see it for yourself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've had this game for quite a while now and I still love it. It has surprisingly great graphics and is loads of fun. It is hard to believe it's free. I recommend this app to fans of temple run, subway surfers, and jetpack joy ride.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I read slow and I don't have alot of time to read so I haven't finished it yet but it is an excellent read and good suspense.  I like the history he puts into his books.  They are well researched and after I am done reading the book I realize I learned a few things as well as being entertained.
0345529057|5.0|have been watching this series on tv and upon the last viewing<br />I could not wait to see what was coming so I ordered the books<br />and have been reading them. such a great collection. everything<br />was packaged and came through the mail quickly. thanks
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This book seems to be quite a departure from his other novels.  I really enjoyed the voice of the narrator. It became almost melodic and dream like, in effect drawing you more deeply into the story which is told as though remembered through a fog.  In the other Gaiman books I've read the magic and fantastic is described as though it truly exists, in this story it is spoken of in such a way as to make you feel as though you've imagined it-there is a logical explanation. All in all I would say I really enjoyed this read.  My only criticism (?) would be that the dream like and almost lazy, unhurried voice of the narrator kept the book from be a page-turning story that I couldn't put down.  I did put it down, and often found I didn't feel particularly pressed to pick it back up in a timely manner.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game can be fun but it seems like every time there's an update it takes me to app store to update and I hit open because normally it will say update and it bounces me back and forth to the loading of game then a message will pop up go to app store to update which I do then it says open at app store but sends me back to same thing over and over again , so it won't let me update.. I hate this. So I won't play for weeks or months and one day I will accidentally hit it and it will open and I will play for few weeks then same thing happens all over again. Sucky, other than that when I do play it I suppose it's fun. It reminds me of 7th grade in 89, yeah that's right I'm old when everything was beta and it was 1st comp game ever played with a floppy disk no less and I loved it. Now sucky...
B00957T6X6|5.0|If you enjoy epic tales of knights, princesses and dragons this books for you! You will be up for many nights past your bedtime as its a difficult story to put down!!
0345803507|5.0|Reading the old fashion way is my kind of way to read. After book two I had to get my hands on Freed, still not finished but I was so happy to see it available on Amazon.<br />Thank you.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Ive owned all these games multiple times and I had to buy this again. Im a huge fan and will always support the series (minus revengeance) I recommend this to anyone who have not yet started the series to go and grab this because you are in for a treat. I love that these come with the graphic novels for 1 and 2 and should check out. my rating for this collection is 9/10.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Would be wonderful if I could actually get the update. Instead it sends me to the app store and there is nothing to update but won't let me back in my game. Really kind of stinks.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Really good free app.  Looks and works great.  Challenge levels are just right on.  Would recommend to all!  Get it now!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This is the most recent of the John Corey thrillers from Nelson DeMille, and by far the strangest (and tied for the weakest with Wildfire).  Yes, it has Corey's typical sardonic take on terrorism, middle eastern politics, and inter-agency warfare among the FBI, CIA and NYPD, but it doesn't actually have much in the way of thrills.  Instead it is an interesting (albeit VERY long) travelogue about Yemen, with 80 pages of excitement tacked onto the end (with some appropriate twists).  For hardcore DeMille fans it is fun to visit these characters again, but the plot is like a much less interesting version of The Lion's Game, with local color thrown in.  If you're going to read one DeMille book, don't read this one, but if you read the other John Corey books you'll read this no matter what I say...In short, read The Lion, Nightfall and The Lion's Game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This series is amazing. This novel definitely lived up to my expectations and makes me even more excited to see Catching Fire when it comes out in theaters!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|A great set of songs with history and today and the future all in one pocket.  The recording is also v. well done!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game was short but I loved every second of it. The determination to unlock everything on my own and discover more and intriguing pathways held me on line then expected. It's worth my money and I can't wait fur the next one. Maybe fur those who brought this one might get a discount for the next lol. Highly recommended so buy it. These reviews are what pushed me so I hope mines pushes you.
0321637739|5.0|I've destroyed, through overuse, a half dozen copies of this book.  It's value as a reference and tutorial for system programming can't be overstated.
B007CEWR62|5.0|I love the talent and inspiration that Secret Garden brings to my life. Rolf Lovland is a musical genius of the highest degree.
030796664X|5.0|I was wary, but encouraged by the reviews, I picked up the audio CDs for my commute.<br /><br />People seem to think of the first few chapters as the meat of the book, and as far as introducing the principles, they're right.<br /><br />But when Duhigg carries those principles forward to Sports teams and Corporate culture turnarounds, it's pretty valuable as it shows how these things scale up to a macro level as well as a personal level.<br /><br />Duhigg is also refreshingly realistic about the applicability and difficulty of changing habits; how it varies from person to person, habit to habit.  I did go in to this looking for the quick formula. But the more I listened, the less sense a silver bullet approach made.<br /><br />I wanted to take notes to pursue mentioned authors, but really had no way to do so as I was listening to this during my commute.  It is good enough that I'm now going to buy the hardcover as well, so I can fill it with post-it notes.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Not the usual nonfiction tripe that's out there.<br /><br />I will ding it a little bit for the voicing which is for the most part pretty solid. But the dramatizations of quotes from interviewed people is comically hokey. It doesn't detract from the presentation enough to ding it even a half-star (if I could.)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Won't give you an option to update which really sucks cause this is my favorite game to play and now I can't play cause the kindle doesn't give you an option to update in the apps.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|Being a fan of the Evil dead series, I thought this was going to fall short of the mark but I was wrong.  If you liked the very first evil dead then you will love this movie.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A good easy read. Humerous. It just seemed to rush at the end. Maybe because I was enjoying it and didn't want it to finish.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I bought this because my friends raved and I thought my husband would enjoy it. He didn't want to finish it but I told him to stick with it. Now 3/4 of the way in he says its okay. Easy to put down and doesn't keep him up nights trying to figure it out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game has the right amount of difficulty. I am having a blast playing and who doesn't love the minions
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|At first I was loving this as it takes place in England in areas I have visited. But then it drags on and I get impatient with some of Harold's stupidity or simple mindedness. It is a bit like Forrest Gump without the humor.
B0031RS8UI|4.0|Interesting, easy reading. Not so many jokes like \\"i've got your numder\\". But anyway very good. It's worth to reading.
B00C90T4QK|4.0|Its Michael Buble' what can I say!  He's got that classic voice with a modern twist!  What more can one say!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Warm Bodies, as you know from the trailers, is about a zombie developing a relationship with a human instead of turning her into food. There's a modern sensibility in this quirky romance, with the main characters' lines (and grunts) feeding off of today's obsession with Zombiedom (sorry, couldn't resist). To be sure, zombies do their zombie thing to humans here, but not to excess, which would detract from the movie's intent. There are a few plot twists and the occasional clever moment which keep the mood light despite the general state of our Nation battling these creatures. It is an enjoyable rental, perhaps best served with pizza night, bill paying, or any number of chair or couch-bound activities.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Genius idea to know exactly when battery life . Is due to expire...recommended this too  my friends and they now use it on daily basis
B003CH9PTU|4.0|I have been told this is a great series.  To date I have watched four segments and am hooked.  Should live up to the billing.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|If love this app it is much better than the camera the kindle comes with.this app is wonderful. I love,love,love,love,love,love,love,love this app.
B00DB31Y3U|4.0|I like it because I can pick it up and play it for a few minutes and then put it back down without being stuck in some long drawn out commitment.  Some other games are more like work, too much to learn and too drawn out.  This is fairly simple and straightforward.  This is my first game in this series, when I finish this I will probably go back and get the other ones.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book changed my perspective on gender issues in the workplace. It was insightful, well-thought, touching and a must read.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this alarm clock! It's very easy to use, and it's effective without startling the he'll out of me.

0399242864|2.0|Ok, I felt I had to write a review on this book to explain my 2 star rating.  My daughter is three, will be four in a few months, and loves reading time with daddy.  We were both pretty excited for this new book, as the ratings were really good and the appropriate age range listed (3-6) was perfect.  Unfortunately I think that range is off depending on what you are going to do with this book.<br /><br />  It is a nicely drawn book, but the problem is the story.  It is very basic and very lightly worded.  I was turning pages pretty fast to keep the story moving for my daughter.  If you are reading this book to your child then the age range might be better for a two year old as an early book when they are more visual.  Or, this could be a good first book your child could read on their own.<br /><br />  I also have to say I feel like I'm reviewing the 'product details' more than the book on it's own.  If the recommended age was lower then I wouldn't have bought.  But, I think people should know so they aren't disappointed as I was.<br /><br />five stars for a two year old book, or an early read on their own book.<br /><br />two stars for a 3-6 year old book that you are going to read to your child
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|My Family (son & dad) loves this game & can play it foe hours. They love eating the people. And boats haha
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Great Story Line, A dude with pshicologic issues and get out if it. Good. recommended, Cant wait to read the book
B000PKG6TE|3.0|I find that every album after \\" Songs for the Deaf\\" has 1-2 great songs and everything else seems less exciting.  Best song here is \\"3's and 7's\\".
B002R02FDG|5.0|I cant say anough how great the harry potter saga is, I am such a fan of the complete series and as a fan everyone should get this boxes, they are quite great and the content worth it. Too bad it doesn't bring enough. But its really good
B00992CF6W|5.0|be able to blow up Tnt, spawn mobs,  they should make creative mode where you can mine and there should be mobs but you should not be able to die. They need to have multiplayer also.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Really good work in the writing and the scene work, most of the good parts were not shown but, Emma Watson was there so its good enough!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was awesome! I love the story line to it! I cant wait for the next one to come out
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I had bought the cheapest paste to mount a heatsink on a processor. Bad choice. The paste dried quickly and separated and almost burned out the proc.<br /><br />I had used the paste in the past and had good results so I purchased it hoping the outcome would be better. You only have to use a very small amount of the silver 5 to get a good contact to the processor. I've also used this on repairing a PS3 as well. The paste does not dry out and has a very good consistency.<br /><br />Pros: durable, great contact, excellent cooling results<br />Cons: slightly more in cost but it is worth it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At first I started reading Wool to make my husband HUSH about Hugh Howey and how brilliant he is. But, I was instantly hooked. What a captivating story and Hugh Howey writes beautifully! I am a big fan of dystopian future novels and this book was the perfect way to satisfy my craving for a well thought out and exciting story.<br /><br />I am very impressed. Absolutely buy this book.<br /><br />Get ready to join the fan club.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|I am a huge fan of Bonobo and was really excited to see this one coming out. The North Borders is most similar to Black Sands in style, but better, in my opinion. It's really hard to describe Bonobo's music, but this one is a little more synthey/dancey compared to Days to Come. He manages to put so much emotion into the music. It's really touching. I don't like the first song, but the rest of the album is just perfect. Some of my faves are Don't wait, Know You, Transits, Emkay and Cirrus. It took a couple of listens to grow on me, but grow on me it did. Seriously, this will be money well spent. Buy it! Everyone I have recommended this to thanks me later.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was  Candy Crush addicted but now I'm Flowing Free without the Candy Crush stress. Move your finger and think....Easy
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|After seeing Andrea Bocelli Love In Portofino on PBS, this recording, while very good, fails to transfer the &#34;feel&#34; of the live broadcast.  Too bad they didn't issue  a &#34;live&#34; concert recording...
B005PW3OS8|4.0|Movie was great and full of action. While watching on Amazon, I had no problems at all. I would recommend this movie to others!
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|This CD is almost pure gospel.  If you like gospel, you will like Ms. Staples combo of gospel and Blues, as we do.  There is a special song about self acceptance &#34;I Like the Things About Me&#34; (that I once despised), that is our favorite.  I can't seem to listen to it enough!
B005QPGHQU|4.0|I loved Fallen and The Open Door, decided to get this one as well. Has the rock elements of Evanescence that I always like, and the Deluxe Version gave me more to listen to. Would Recommend.
B001DPDVE8|5.0|I love then all I own the whole stargate 1 collection. At my age you tend to forget what you watch this month so you can enjoy it again in a couple months
B000HKYBXA|4.0|This is an interesting interpretation of Hamlet. I was a little dissapointed  with the costuming and setting (Verssailes?)<br />But, the dramatic interpretation offered is excellent.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|I'm a retired male that has a lot of time on my hands but lucky for me I have amazon Prime and the movies they care , particularly the star gate  series and movies such as &#34;Continuum&#34; Kurt Russell wasn't the best choice but everyone together,It's a great movie for all ages
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Boring and Sucky. Would not recommend to a bored monkey. It really doesn't have any fun aspects in it. Do not get this game. Even if it's free.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|We saw this movie in preparation to see &#34;RED 2&#34; at the theater. What a pleasant surprise! Action and comedy intelligently mixed! An entertaining tale that shows retired  professional assassins not only coping with life-and-death situations but also personal relationships and their struggle to become &#34;ordinary&#34; after a lifetime of routinely and casually dispatching bad guys. Bruce Willis plays an average Joe who just happens to have his hit-man past catch up to him suddenly and violently. Mary-Louise Parker plays his uninitiated love interest who is initially terrified but eventually turned-on by all the intrigue. In order to survive, Willis needs to enlist the aide of old cronies Morgan Freeman, John Malkovitch, and Helen Mirren all of whom give solid performances. One of the funnier action/comedies of recent years (and the sequel was even BETTER).
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is very entertaining. Attorneys not only fighting opposing counsel but ones in their own firm. The competitive environment creates some of the tense moments.  Fun to watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|l like it a lot. It has the fun of Temple Run but the ease and idea for a child.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I have never seen a movie that touched me so deeply as this one did.  What a powerful story, great acting and good music.  It needs to have a sequel.  We need to see them all together, maybe like; August, where are you now or something.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I enjoy the game but hate how many times your villiage gets destroyed in a cycle of 55 energy.  at least 3 to 4 times each cycle its annoying.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very engaging storytelling. Would recommend for any military enthusiast. Felt like I was on every mission.<br />Many life lessons to offer. Well done!
B00003CWRX|5.0|Couldn't have picked a better director for this material and this angle than Michael Mann. He and Pacino (and occasionally the insurmountable Christopher Plummer) take this story to the corners of the earth and back, riveting scene after riveting scene. Sometimes it is paced a little too fast- even though that's on the shoulders of The Insider's true-story focus- I was disoriented once or twice upon first viewing back when I was in undergrad. As the former Big-Tobacco VP who knows too much, Crowe is a high-pressured, hot-tempered stoic, for better or for worse; award-garnering yet dimensionless as only Michael Mann can do. The gauntlet good men must go through can sometimes be a real Shawshank-style sewer crawl, and with lawyers hassling you the whole way, asking you how much you're willing to lose in order to try and win. Pacino is a caffeinated marvel to watch, a street-hardened Jiminy Cricket with a camera crew and millions of \\"60 Minutes\\" viewers at his back. Hand this down to your kids, it'll make \\"Michael Clayton\\" look like French avant-garde.
B008Y76VW2|3.0|Not of big fan of Eisenberg.  He is dweeby in a bad way and the dirtbag cheating husband was very believable but, it killed an hour and half with a couple of funny scenes.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The computer generated graphics were outstanding and leads you into vividly imagining our world this way. Don't hesitate to watch this movie by rental. This is one movie that will be a definite purchase for us!
B000FC146C|5.0|I know this is an old book.  I read it when it was first out, well before there was a miniseries.<br />The writing is detailed and yet easy to follow.  The saga carries out over many years of a large family and the hard times they endure living and working the land.  Years of drought, losses of lives.  The characters are finely drawn and one can't help but feel something for Meggie, the central character.  It is wonderful to see them over generations as they grow and life around them evolves.  The writer does a beautiful job of bringing you into Drogheda and feeling like you can see it.  I would recommend this read.

0307477401|4.0|\\"The Troubled Man's is the final novel in the successful Kurt Wallender series. Henning Mankell is the author. He is a prolific novelists whose books have sold in the millions. Mankell is also a son-in-law of the late I. Bergmann Sweden's greatest film director.<br />  The Plot of this intriguing mystery is easy to explain. As the book begins, we meet Kurt Wallender a veteran of many years in the Swedish police. Wallender is 60 years old. The old shamus fears impending old age as he deals with problems with memory and diabetes. He is overweight and often depressed. Wallender has been divorced from Mona his wife of many years. The couple's one child is Linda. Linda has grown up to become a police woman. She is engaged to Hans Von Enke scion of a famous Naval officer named Hakan von Enke and his charming wife Louise. The von Enke's invite Wallender to Hakan's 75th birthday party where the old man evinces fear of being killed by spies. von Enke soon disappears while his wife is found brutally murdered. Many police investigators believe Louise was a Russia spy guilty of passing on important documents dealing with Swedish weaponry and diplomacy.<br />  Due to the family connectin with the von Enke's Wallender becomes interested in the case. This occurs during his long vacation from the police department following his failure to obey police rules regarding the display of a police issued pistol. The nocturnal Wallender had foolishly taken the pistol to a restaurant where he spent a long evening of brooding and becoming drunk. The questions abound: \\"Why did the von Enke's disappear?\\" \\"Why was Louise murdered?\\" Where is Hakan staying?<br />  The book is very sad as Wallender receives a final visit from Baiba his mistress and lifelong love whom he first met in Latvia while on a case. Wallender loves his new grandchild Klara and becomes closer with Linda his daughter and Hans von Enke. Hans is a wealthy CEO and loves Linda and the baby. Wallender also loves Jussie his dog. The policeman lives on a rural farm in Sweden. Wallender fears death and incapacity as he faces the demons of old age.<br />  The Wallender books are always well written and thout provoking taking them into the realm of literature. Wallender is a complex man. All of the Wallender novels are well worthy of your time and money. As one who has read all of the books in the series I will miss future books about Kurt Wallender.policeman lives on a rural farm in Sweden.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I downloaded this to replace the weather channel app on my kindle fire. I kept having problems getting the old app to update to correct day or time. So far no problems with this AccuWeather app, so I would definitely recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really fun. I like to play games like this and thanks for it being free. I think it is a great strategy game especially for children with disabilities
B0091REZMW|1.0|I just recently started this game and am already addicted. As has been said in other reviews, this game keeps your interest with new rooms that open up and new quests. If you're not careful though, you can end up spending too much money for \\"diamonds\\" and for energy, so it is best to take it slow and easy at first so you don't fall into this trap. But all in all it is a nice and relaxing game to play on my Kindle Fire. That being said, I really think the diamonds are far, far too costly for a simple game and it takes all of the joy out of it trying to come up with excuses with why you just spent two or three hundred dollars on a simple video game!! I'm trying my hardest to keep playing without spending any money, but it's going to be very hard. The makers of the game really, really need to come up with a way for those of us who are poor to work our way through the game to pay for it, or something of that sort. I also recently fell for one of their gimmicks where you buy something from another vendor and you're supposed to get so many diamonds for doing so. Well, I bought two books because I like to read and was supposed to get 302 diamonds, but all I got was a bill for two books. No diamonds. This game will sucked you dry and they will lie to you.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I'm going crazy with this book. It changes everything about presentations/meetings/deals/pitching. It's not selling, it's pitching and it's biologically explained.<br /><br />You will never be the same after this book. You will be so much better.<br /><br />Thank you so much Oren! You are amazing!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Love love this app<br />Can't wait for new updates.<br />Need more games like this<br />Got 3 friends playing.<br />Love the animation and the loveable art work.
030746363X|5.0|It will change your life, for better. Just read it, absorb the information and you will live a much better life.
B000002LUB|5.0|This album has aged very, very well. I recently repurchased it because somehow it had gone missing and I had not heard it in a long time. These songs stand the test of time and go down as some of the best work Dio ever recorded. The band is tight as hell here, Tony and Geezer belting out perfection as always. The flow of this album is fantastic and Ronnie's voice is just about at the pinnacle here (although he never really lost that much). My personal top five in no particular order: TV Crimes, Computer God, Too Late, Time Machine and I. I was blown away by The Devil You Know but head to head the edge goes to Dehumanizer!! Both are must haves and classics in the Dio/Sabbath cannon. Underrated as many have stated and FIVE STARS...
0887431453|5.0|Bought these for a preschool group, then had more kids join. The second \\"set\\" of books I ordered were different from the first, even tho the cover was exactly the same....down to the number in the top corner... Was really bummed! So be careful...if you need for a group...order them all at once! :(
B008PZZUTS|3.0|This movie is okay. It was great when I first saw it and it still holds up. It's not the best movie that I have ever seen but it is still pretty good
B0063GORYU|5.0|The game is great fun and totally addictive. I stayed up the whole night playing and replaying, trying to beat my best score. Great game to kill time.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I love TrueBlood season 1! OMG one of my favorites but the seasons get cheesier and weirder as they go on. I quit watching. Season 1 is the best season of them all.
B00C061I1M|5.0|Probably the best album I've come across this year. She has a unique beautiful voice, and you can feel her music...every song. Soulful, wonderful album. I hope she continues to make more albums. Love!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I cannot truly put into words how much I love this album, but I will give it a shot. Unlike most albums where there are a few songs I enjoy and the rest are just meh, this one is just amazing. I listened to this album from start to finish tonight and I am like a giddy school boy. I am so happy to have purchased the whole album!! There are obviously songs you have all heard on the radio, which are great, but the ones you have not heard are equally amazing.<br /><br />I saw a review on here regarding rating each song out of a score of 5. The second one (Some Sort of Creature) isn't really a song and I could agree could be scored a 1, but I would actually give it a 3 because it gives the album character. If you  were a Sublime fan and remember Raleigh (sp?) and all of the little non-songs on the album...it's kinda like a mini one of those. Every other song I would  rate no less than a 4 and probably almost every one a 5. Did I mention I LOVE this album? I am so glad I ordered the cd for my car because I cannot wait to rock out to this on the way to and from work.<br /><br />Entire album overall 5/5...now one of my all time favorite albums
B0018087TC|5.0|A talent that cut his life short.  This soulful player lives up to his reputation and is definately needed in your collection.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|the weaving of stories and the progressing timeline was fantastic.  However, the ending left a lot to be desired for me.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love the game, then after the update I can't play, this is so aggregating. Why implement the update if it's not ready? Please fix soon.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My family has enjoyed all of these movies and this one didn't disappoint either.  Good action. Good humor.  Fun for a movie night.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just downloaded this game today and I love it!! It is so addicting and super fun for everyone! I love it!
B009WUBERW|3.0|over the hill gang does not make it very believable..ok..No not even in a fairy tale..know Knight here..look out for #3
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So this game is so FUN  that my daughter that is 2 yrs old and I are always having trouble in taking turns because we both are so into this game lol. FUN TIMES
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I have seen better much better Rock is just a bit over kill...lol...and when you loose one of the best actors in the beginning its not a good thing..
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Good show. Great to just unplug and enjoy an episode without any muss and fuss of too much drama to put up with.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I recently upgraded my motherboard to this from the Asus M4A79XTD Evo. MY old mobo had two faulty RAM SLOTS. The CPU I use is the AMD Phenom 2 X6 1090T. I put the basics together and the main switches and powered everything on. I booted to BIOS and I found the BIOS Name was different to what was listed on the site however the date of the BIOS was very recent, so I Left it.It worked perfectly so I put together all my parts and upon testing it again I found after I loaded into BIOS and booted to windows that it would automatically restart each time.<br /><br />PROBLEM - I know some motherboards if the power pins are in the wrong way they won't work or they will malfunction, so I reverted the pins in the reset button but the problem persisted. All my other switches are working properly, I am getting the HD led, pwr led, speaker and power. Apparently the problem is with the RESET pins themself becaus eno matter which direction I plug in the switch the pc always reboots after trying to load into the OS. I unplugged the switch and now everything loads up. It doesn't bother me that I don't have the reset button plugged in because either way I don't use it.<br /><br />Possible FAULT - When I install my sticks of RAM I always follow the instructions on the board. Normally Dimm 1 and 3 are together and then Dimm 2 and 4 are after it. SO I install both my 4GB sticks where the board says Dimms 1 and 2 are and then the last 2GB sticks in Dimm slots 3 and 4. Booting Into the Bios to check it out it says I only have one 4GB stick in Slot 2 and Slot one apparently has one 2GB stick in it. And you get where the other sticks are placed. It was out of order.<br /><br />I found it very strange and decided to boot up to windows and check one of the utility ptograms that came on the disk. This time the utility program says that the 2GB sticks are installed in Slots 1 and 2 and the 4GBs sticks are in slots 3 and 4. All of this mix up in where the proper slots are has confused me.<br /><br/>I have decided to stick with my gut instincts on where to place them and I am trying to not think about all the confusing results where the sticks of RAM are placed. Either way simple tests like moving the sticks around will tell me where is best to keep them. I learned how to put together PC's on my own.<br /><br />IF you load the optimized default setting when you first install this Mobo you will want to change the RAM settings. My Ram normally runs at 1600mhz and this dropped it to 1333mhz. A simple change will fix it.<br /><br />Other than that there are no problems. Will keep updating as I get to use it more often.<br /><br />NOTES -<br /><br />1- This drive doesn't support IDE so your optical drives will need to be SATA conntected. Which might mean you will need to get a new optical drive if your upgrading.<br /><br />2- There is no LED switch on the Mobo to notify that it is getting power. (Not a problem but worth mentioning)<br /><br />3- ALL the SATA data connectors are at a strange angle to connect from the lower right side. Make sure your pc case as enough room to accommodate access to it. I use a basic Lian Li case and it's a really tight fit, very uncomfortable.
B000YAFE0M|5.0|Greatest law movie ever!!!! You need to see this. It's pure geniousMM worth it. But wished it had closed captions<br />For my deaf children. I bought the DVD.
B0015519VS|5.0|Usher is the bomb and this album is awesome!!! I keep playing my favorite songs over and over again.in my car.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Zimmer + Superman = Pre-ordered without hearing a single note.<br /><br />Leap of faith purchase was rewarded. As is my tendency, I only happen to like one or two tracks and I'm indifferent to the rest. Nevertheless, the score plays well as I drive to and from work.<br /><br />The embossed metal casing is great. Display worthy. Almost inspired to buy a display case to build a shrine to Superman.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a fantastic book!  I thought the writing was easy to read, but conveyed some pretty deep concepts.  I thought the idea of kids conducting war campaigns while they were playing video games was an incredibly great idea; and one that I think could absolutely happen in the future.  Probably great Science Fiction when it was written...maybe a bit too close to home now that so many people play video games on a regular basis.  This book was thrilling; and the second book - Speaker for the Dead - was even better!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is very addictive and time consuming. But it is really fun! I would recommend it to other players!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I had heard the media chatter and wasn't sure this was for me, but I wanted to read it for myself to form an opinion.  Very relatable, encouraging and non-judgmental!
B002EX5M6S|5.0|even awesome the second or fifth time ive seen it.  great movie.  must watch. pitt and redford are great in this
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Well worth the time to view.  Well written, acted and directed.  The moody lighting and fantastic scenery add to the charm of this winner.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Nice game, fun but it does take awhile for items to mature enough, would like to see them not take quite so long
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|One of the best shows on tv right now. Good story and great plots and and amazing cast! I was hooked from the first episode.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|It's a really awesome book I like how the plot twist is and I've never read such a God mystery book
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I am 15, and I saw the movie when it first came out and I always liked it.  Going to watch the second one today!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I heard about this program on NPR in an interview with David Tennant. It is well worth watching....I did have to repeat the first of the film agfter completing it just to get the characters more clearly in mind. So eager to see the rest of the series.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because I bought it from reading the posted information. {\\"An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2013: Neil Gaiman's intent was simple: to write a short story. What he ended up with instead was The Ocean at the of the Lane-\\"}  And I thought since the price was for a full novel, that it would be somewhat longer.  When I pay the price of a Koontz Book, or a King Book, and it turns out to be a story that I finish in one afternoon with ease, I find it to be a slap in the face that I won't repeat.  No matter how good it was, (and it was a great little story) if someone is going to pick my pocket, and ask me with a straight face will I buy another of your books, \\"the answer is no!\\"  Even King (and I still haven't forgiving him for the ending on the Gunslinger Series) would not pull this one....<br /><br />This is all said with Great-Respect for Neil's enormous talent as a story-teller, but you disappointed us greatly with this S-h-o-r-t story.  I only hope that your Headline and Advertisement equals the expectations that you build up in the future.  We wanted more in that wonderfully entrancing Story, but you cut us in Mid-fright!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the most beautiful books that I have ever read. A must read for middle school teachers, parents and children!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game super fun! addicting! Love it!!!!! you'll want to keep playing! the minions are so cute!! You'll want to beat all the bad guys!
B00AW57L96|5.0|This was my first exposure to Liane Moriarty's writing - I loved it.  Her characters are real people, I could imagine being in their shoes or knowing them (I wouldn't want to be in most of their shoes!!) I couldn't stop reading the book and had to resist the temptation to read ahead to find out 'the secret'.  But knowing the secret only intensifies the story... Whilst she has a very easy-to-read style her novels are really well written lovely use of language.
B00280LYHS|5.0|these books changed my life. i love them to death!!! A must read!! Its full of romance and adventure and excitement and laughter!! Recommended for all ages!
B002AWX6UM|4.0|&#34;The writing was amazing but the story was depressing&#34; said my 15 yr. old daughter who was required to read this over the summer. She will be a Sophomore at Princeton High this September.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think the game would be more fun if people could ride their horses outside in the country and ride into caves and through waterfalls and into forests.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|All of the levels were to hard. I hate it. I gave it 2 stars because it is free. Don't waste you time trying to beat the levels. Only if your bored. Don't waste your kindle fires memory
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it ,I love it ,l love it !!!<br /><br />This game is awesome ,so awesome that u get to go to two places at once ,so awesome that u get to defeat Victor and a girl scout who sells cookies,so awesome that u get to have different type of minions .And  all your  doing is running in all the fun of it.And the best part is... well it gonna have to figure that out for yourself go ahead and download the game....so this is how it feels to be a minion : )
1567184855|5.0|I ordered items from sellers located an hour away and didn't receive them until 2 1/2 weeks later, but this item came all the way from Washington to Cleveland and arrived in about 3 days! I love this book and have read it before so I was giving it as a gift to my father. The book has changed our lives! Thank you for the speedy shipping and quality of the book.
B004GYY714|5.0|I really like it.  Thanks.  I am so glad to be able to finally listen on my Kindle to music
B000I9W08I|5.0|I am so glad I decided to re-watch this movie. I had seen it when I was younger, but I don't think I was able to really appreciate it at the time. Barbra Streisand does an absolutely fantastic job playing Dolly Levi. She delivers every line beautifully, every joke perfectly, and performs an endearing monologue with such grace. This movie should have done a lot better than it did at the box office when it first came out,
B0073N6SQ2|1.0|had this book and nothing to lose book in wrong order  this is the book that they would not except  my son got the book the hard way
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Too good for 90s. Love these movies for their seamless graphics. All in all nice plot and awesome locations. Would watch it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Use app daily and have been very pleased. I highly recommend. Very easy to use and does everything I need.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I love this entire series.  The story line is so interesting and the idea of rooting for the &#34;bad guy&#34; is such an awesome concept.  Dexter rocks!  So sad it's in its last season :(
B00ECUARO8|4.0|A little off point, but interesting..should have developed the characters better earlier in the film..But the story was solid..ok to watch
0803738412|5.0|I absolutely love 'Room on the Broom', and my girls love it too! We've read this one over and over (and over) again and my girls never get tired of it. It's my favorite childrens story, and I would highly recommend it!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|Renewed and deepened my appreciation for the talent of Jimmy Page, who was already one of my favorite musicians. Opened my eyes to the brilliance of The Edge, who I always considered only a perfectly adequate guitar player. I'd recently seen Jack White on stage with two different bands, and always enjoy his playing, and he's great here. Lots of music from all three, lots of insights into their development and a good amount of surprises. Jimmy Page playing Ramble On gives goosebumps. There are a few other living guitar players who have been as influential or important these three, but this isn't meant to be a comprehensive look at all the greats of the the last 50 years. It is a tribute, it is a jam session, it is one of the most memorable rock and roll documentaries I've ever seen.
0803730470|5.0|We love this book in our house! The mouse in the story is so clever and it is such a fun read! I would highly recommend anything by Julia Donaldson.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Saw this in a theater back in the 80s, and remembered it being great. Seeing it again brought it all back. Such a simple yet brilliant stage show and an overall incredible performance.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|I can actually shuffle the whole deck, even with my arthritis. I had no problems with the purple holder, but I expect it won't last long, so I also purchased the Reviewer-recommended holder. It would have been nice also to get waterproof rules; we expect to laminate the supplied paper copy. The only problem with the deck is its lack of English, instead using the new and somewhat confusing icons. But we can get accustomed to that silliness, I guess.
B00A27X972|4.0|It was good but petered out towards the end. I loved the early chapters for the commentary of mankind and society.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good game. Makes you think. My grand daughter and I play together to see who gets done first!!  Hopefully new levels come soon.
1451613512|4.0|Oliver Stone and coauthor Peter Kuznick have produced a relentless chronicle of the last 100 years that is devastating to American illusions about the world, especially US exceptionalism. Their book should be required reading in every high school and college level history class.<br /><br />The Untold History is indeed the powerful medicine for what ails America. Readers who dare to look between the covers will come away forever changed. They will not be able to see the world the same way, ever again.<br /><br />The book deserves five stars. I give it only four because Stone and Kuznick fall short on one key issue: 9/11. Indeed, given Stone's record as a maverick, I was surprised that he endorses the official story about what happened.<br /><br />I urge the authors to revisit the evidence and revise their manuscript. The next edition should incorporate David Ray Griffin's exhaustive research -- and the shocking evidence pointing to the unthinkable. In 2008-2009 independent scientists published two papers documenting the presence of nanothermite residues and bits of unexploded ordnance in the dust from the collapsed World Trade Center. This, of course, means that the plane impacts and fires did not cause the towers to collapse on 9/11, as we have been told ad nauseum. The towers were brought down with explosives. In short, there had to be complicity on Wall Street. The authors need to face these dark implications.<br /><br />Incidentally, the other night, I revisited Stone's breakthrough 1991 film, JFK -- and was very impressed how it has stood the test of time.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I remember seeing this as a kid. It was fun letting my kids see it. They enjoyed the movie a lot.
B001EBWINQ|4.0|Apart from not being very plausible, Casablanca is worthy of its status as a classic movie. Boogie lacks depth but you love him anyway.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|DON'T KNOW BECUASE WE HAVEN'T WATCHED IT EVEN THOUGH WE ORDER IT IT WON'T SHOW UP ON MY VIDEO LIBRARY.
014312093X|4.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy by John Le Carre sets forth a byzantine tale featuring George Smiley (the un-James Bond) as he endeavors to uncover the true identity of Gerald, a Soviet mole who has penetrated the highest echelon of British Intelligence.  Having previously viewed both the Gary Oldman film and the DVD of the BBC miniseries, I knew reading Tinker, Tailor was likely to be a challenging and daunting undertaking.  I was not disappointed; this is a complex chessgame of a novel which is anything but light reading.<br /><br />Le Carre tells the story in the third person, though George Smiley's thoughts and perspective dominate a good deal of the narrative.  Much of the action takes place in flashback, forcing the reader to stay on his or her toes in order to keep events in chronologic sequence.  The plot is quite complex and has a number of diverse threads, though ultimately all are interrelated.<br /><br />A complex and challenging book about the world of espionage.  Richly detailed and imaginatively constructed.  It asks a lot of the reader but the rewards are worth it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book started out interesting and then we were continually being introduced to new characters and the book just never went anywhere.  Disappointing
B003PIUALI|5.0|Love it.  I don't think it is dated but my 40 something children do.  Good story.  And enough action to keep you interested.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Fun movie and I loved all of the characters.  I am definately going to see Dispicable Me II.<br />Good for the whole family
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|One of the best, perhaps my favorite! I've read all Reacher books 3 times, I love him.... totally disappointed with Cruize as Jack!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Enjoyed it from start to end. Had it recommended by a friend who loved it. Tried to recommend it to my mother, but she had already finished and she also loved it. Recommended!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This should be required reading for all young ambitious money/status hungry individuals -- graphically shows what can go wrong for even &#34;good&#34; girls & how &#34;criminal&#34; behavior is punished in the USA.  The writing can veer off the plot at times but manages to tell the story in an easy readable style.
B00A25NLOU|4.0|I liked it. Read it after finishing The 100 year old man which is a 5. Not as funny, but interesting in many ways. Especially if you are into graphic design, books and fonts.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like puzzle games and this is a fun and challenging one. I Would recommend this game to all my friends
B006BQI1V2|5.0|This will definitely hold your interest although it may be a bit intense. The first time we rented it via red box, we didn't have time to watch it. The second time we rented it we watched it making us regret not watching it the first time. My 14 year old daughter wanted to watch it a second again so we purchased it. Another we liked in the same genre: Boy in the Striped Pajamas. A book to compliment: My Family for the War. My dad suggested his favorite, Honor & Glory, movie, also written from a child's perspective. These books movies are great for our teens to develop a perspective of true integrity in a world not so black & white. That sometimes honor, diginity, respect are what we need to love ourselves and others.
0143122916|5.0|Great reminder that despite many presidents saying never again, it continues to happen today unabated.  Very compelling book.  Right up alongside &#34;The Long Walk&#34;.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Much of what he claims has no proof. He merely debunks the scripture.  You can tell very readily that he is a Muslim.  He even refers to the Jews as a cult rather than a religion or belief.  It was important to read so I could form my own opinion.  I hear him interviewed by Fox and MSMBC with very different outcomes......that will tell you something.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Started out pretty funny, but kinda lost it's way. Enjoyable film, but nothing great. All good actors, though. Love ML Parker.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is awesome anyone out there who does not have it needs it so download it now if you don't have it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It had a somewhat plausible plot, good but not great acting, and the special effects didn't overwhelm the movie.  All in all, a pleasant diversion.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game is fun and addicting, but today it asked me to visit the app store to update the game and amazon didn't have the update for it I would love to keep playing but it won't let me in without the update. This is the second game that has done this and I am ready to not buy or get anything else from them. I am mad and frustrated with Amazon and won't get anything that has there app store if they can't update there games, apps. ,etc.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|I found it difficult to get real news with this app. Gossip, showbiz, fine. I wasn't able to adjust the categories so that those I prefer showed first. Many of the categories were British news even though I checked U.S. Ended up removing it completely and feeling quite happy with BBC.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|That was a great summer read for school or even on your own, so many great parts. I found out about the book from many of my friends so I decided to try it and it was worth it.
B002N7RAH4|5.0|A great buddy cop movie done with the offbeat humor from the guys who brought you Shaun of the Dead
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|I got it and it took two hours to download. Every mission it froze and I couldn't  back on until I restarted the kindle. Just absolutely terrible. Please fix
B002OSY2T6|4.0|This glow and light up snail with a mirror moves across the floor and entices the child to chase it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I'll admit: it took me a few listens to take to this song. The lyrics are not her best, but they are relatively simple; good for a &#34;comeback single.&#34; The vocals on the first verse were a little strange, though; not always good for a &#34;comeback single.&#34; But, when the chorus hits, you forget all of that. It's very catchy and, just like the rest of the track, very danceable. Applause is a very good intro to ARTPOP.
B005HEPS6A|4.0|One of my favorite seasons.  They do not make television like this anymore.  Star Trek the Next Generation is greatly missed.
B00589AYWW|5.0|Even after all these years, historical events continue to align with her view of how those in power become blind to wisdom. Her work may not benefit those in power today but perhaps it can help electorates.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book with no prior knowledge of what it was about, and I bought it soley based on the author whom I knew only as a youtuber. When I heard this book was becoming a movie, I quickly picked it up.<br /><br />And promptly cried my eyes out.<br /><br />This is a quick read, it was hard to put down! Its a beautiful and heartbreaking love story that hits a lot of emotions. One chapter I was angry, then laughing, and then I would bawl my eyes out.<br />Its an amazing story, would reccomend :)
B00B9366VO|4.0|I did not know so many hit groups and records came from Sound City Studio in the San Fernando Valley
0141975652|4.0|Silver has a very smart approach to the world, be it sports, economy, weather, etc.  And he presents his ideas so that everyone can understand.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I'm delighted to be able to play Mahjong on my Kobo e-reader --just like at home on my computer.  This will come in handy when riding the train or waiting at a doctor's office.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is actually a movie that should be tagged with \\"you must see\\", excellent! I do not know what else to add
B008602KQI|3.0|Perhaps the book would have been helpful but the scenes and the acting came up short. What was a disappointment was that everyone was obviously trying so hard but then that should not be so. Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson were very good but the rest was like a Tim Burton clone attempt.
B00BWRKVVS|3.0|I really like &#34;The Emperor's New Groove&#34;. I'm not gonna review the movies. But there's just one question I have... Where are the extras? Not even a commentary!
B003ZJ70W4|4.0|I didn't watch all the episodes when they originally aired but during the last year I've been recording and watching them all.  I finished that up and had to watch both movies.  I must say I enjoyed this one more than the original!
0316228583|2.0|So, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I couldn't finish this book. In fact, I hope I can still return it. It was slow, there were a LOT of characters (the character that ties them all together is dead), and it was just so meticulously detailed that even half way into the book nothing has really happened. Not going to finish it if I can return it; I'd suggest checking it out from a library if you have to read it. Don't waste your money on it. Sorry, J.K. Rowling, maybe your mystery series is better?
B00A285OOW|4.0|First person point of view made it interesting. Details of the period made it real. Point of view had to be taken about The Princes of the Tower--glad author was clear.  After all, this is historical fiction, not a biography.  I will remember Elizabeth of York  and that is due to the realistic writing.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Loved the show! Lots of great action scenes and cinematography. Good plot too! I can't wait until the next season starts
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL SAGA!  THE HISTORY AND SETTINGS ARE SO INTERESTING AND WELL DONE!  I CANT WAIT FOR SEASON 4!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I stumbled upon this artist while watching a YouTube video she did on Star Wars of all things. Out of curiosity I listened to her other works, I was hooked after one song. Bought the album, and I am very glad I did. I hope she releases more music soon.<br />Her sound is mesmerizing, it has the ability to take you away and keep you out there.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a game of luck and strategy that is highly addictive. I enjoy tracking my progress and wins. The game did crash once on my Kindle HD, causing me to start over, but overall a good game.
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|Great movie, I enjoyed this and would watch  this movie again.  I would not recommend this for younger children because this movie discusses abortion which may not be a topic some parents or adults are ready to explain.
B007MJSYF0|4.0|Very violent, sometimes rushed.  Interesting concept.  Moved along fast enough so as not to be boring.  Could have used a few less students and death scenes with more emphasis on the realism and desperation of the situation.
B0060D133E|4.0|My 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son, both enjoyed the movie till the end. Good social lessons about friendship and spending quality time with kids. Would recommend it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I thought it was cute, my kids thought it was phenomenal. Steve Carrell as usual is bordering on genius - it's hard even to guess it's him.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Modern Vampires of the City is an extraordinary follow-up to Contra.  The songwriting is complex yet catchy, and Ezra Koenig's vocals are unique.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Watched this with my five year old daughter, and we both loved it.  It's about how a family is created through the transformative power of love.  It's also about how a man can be transformed by the power of a child's love.  It's also got these little yellow chirping Tylenol-like creatures that are fantastically funny.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This came in so quick I'm so happy my boyfriend been asking for this movie for so long he's going to be so excited and surprised:))
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It was pretty dry, didn't really hold my interest. I think you have to be really magnetizing to carry 80% of a movie alone and he just isn't. I like most of his movies but it needed a little more interaction with other people.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Very easy to apply, beautifully complimented Disney Princesses theme in my daughter's room!<br />The gems give a nice sparkly touch !
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy playing Diamond Dash. It keep me alert,  awake and entertain. I recommend it for long driving.<br /><br /> I love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm 13, and we'll sit around with my family and friends and pass the kindle around to play. We have two other 13 year olds, 8, 16, 17,19, 22, 50, and two people somewhere in there 40s! We all love this game.
B007O3QC8K|5.0|Wonderful performance of the 9th--one of the best on record. The scholarly and long anticipated completion of the last movement is convincing and makes musical sense. It incorporates all of Bruckner's extensive fragments and notes and strives to achieve the composer's vision of the symphony as a whole. In this regard it is remarkably successful. Highly recommended.
B000ITF86E|5.0|One of the very best!  He and Maureen O'hare are a priceless couple.  I could watch this over and over.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|the best scary movie I've seen in a long time. great story line, great actors, great ending. will definitely watch again
0385349947|5.0|I could relate to practically every chapter of the book! It is very reassuring to know that the things you encounter are faced by many -if not all - other women. As a &#34;career loving parent&#34; - the term the book uses -,  the book gave me a new perspective to many of my reactions and choices , and a new push of confidence... Inspiring... I could not stop reading...
B00992CF6W|2.0|U guys should really update this app in the google playstore its at 0.7.2 so consider next time to update faster
B0066W1AZK|1.0|I cannot castle and I cannot customize the board. Worst chess ever. Chess.com is the best. 1 star for it being bad
0375836675|2.0|I did not care for the book.  It is required reading in many schools in my area, but I would not read it on my own.  I felt it had many subplots, several which seemed shallow.  The subject matter and the vocabulary seemed a bit over the top.  To me it seemed the author wanted to use certain words, and wove them into his story.  I think many of the classics are better written.  If this book and others like it will replace some of our classics, I feel our students will miss out on a worthwhile experience.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cute little game.  Good eye /hand coordination practice.  Great way to while away the time.  Fun, fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey has been my favorite program by far.  We learn much about life in Eng thru the generations, the upstairs/downstairs issues and so much about human interaction. Was Maggie Smith ever young??
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I have seen some of series 3 of this on HBO, and it made me want to read the series to see what was going on.  The books are wonderful in helping you understand what is going on, on the series.  The books are well written, really keeps me wanting to read morning and night.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes any kind of sci-fi or medieval period literature.  Love how the chapters are written, concentrating on the one character and how it still intertwines with all the other chapters/characters.  Great book!  Can't wait to start book 3!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes.  What a confusing, bore of a movie.  Maybe it gets better, but with a start like that it's doubtful.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Fun and enjoyable game but can be addicting. When I clear a level I want to just go on to the next. Hate to stop playing.
B003G4W49C|3.0|It was an interesting perspective, but totally geared toward Gamers.  The fact that the main character was so young and gifted hints at genetic tampering.  I also saw his training as a form of conditioning or brainwashing. Rather Scary from my perspective.  I unfortunately found the ending to be Anti-climactic.  Perhaps the movie will prove to be visually stimulating.
B003UYUP58|1.0|Stopped reading after the first chapter. I don't know why this has received positive reviews. This book added no value.<br /><br />I have the ebook version. 25% of this book is the credits to others. This is not a book, it is a medical journal.
B00BOLE7X0|3.0|It felt Like a more indepth documentary centered on the civewl war giving thr viwer insight to the presidents life.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Hope it goes for many more seasons.  Funny funny and fun.  Glad to have the DVD's.  Note the flixter requires internet to watch, so defeats the purpose of downloading locally.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|Long, drawn out and a complete waste of time.  Would not recommend this movie at all, unless you're looking for something to fall asleep to.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|This is great for young ones. My preschool granddaughter loves this as there is a variety of things to do. It's a hands on game with fixing, building, and painting.  Fun game and educational too
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book is great. It's less about Tesla than I had hoped but it's still worth a read. Nicely done.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Didn't like the movie not one of Tom cruise better movie thought it would show the 70's better heard it didn't get great ratings
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Loved it, Hope to see more of the Capt work in an nother indipendant film without the Advengers in it.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|No problems.  Poppped it right in where the old bud had fallen out.  Great to have some extra for later.
0316017930|5.0|This book arrived on time and in mint condition.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  It's a part of a summer reading book that was all checked out in the library.  We are very pleased.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|DFW is a genius. An amazing writer, observer, and philosopher. Certain to be a certified American great. Read this now!!
B009UZBLSG|4.0|Overall quite pleased that I can finally view my Nexus 7 on my big TV.<br />Don't know if it's a shortcoming of the SlimPort or the Nexus 7 1920x1200 resolution but there is an unavoidable black border on 2 or 4 sides that I can't seem to get rid of. This means that it is not pixel by pixel sharp but still looks really good once you get used to the black border. For the money, I can't complain and am quite pleased with the purchase.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|If I felt ripped off by his last book George Martin has outdone himself this time. To say it's wordy dosen't cover it. Page after page of who ate what and what they were wearing gets a little old after awhile. There is not much of a story to follow as everthing is so fragmented. If you are looking for some resolution to this never ending saga don't expect to find it here. A total waste of time and money.
B000YMHOUS|5.0|Seen this movie many times & always enjoy it.  Amazing cast (and lots of &#34;Buffy alumni.) Worth the time and the money :)
B004ADF7RO|4.0|We adults enjoy being kids again whenever we watch this movie.  It's fun to see what they're all doing now!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|super good. ok. buy. idk way else to say. hope I don't jinx it and it doesn't wake me up for work tomorrow morning.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game was a lot of fun and more challenging than spider solitaire. I enjoy trying to figure out how to win.
B005938780|5.0|Just re bought this to fill a void in my collection always has been a great  album. Up the Irons!
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|game is good as far as I can play.  it always shuts down when I try to play the last scene of the 4th chapter.  I have a 1st gen kindle fire. please fix the glitches. It also kicked me out of the game occasionally in earlier chapters.
B0068THAGY|5.0|A lot of movies, especially action venture, make me laugh with how ridiculously unrealistic they are;  heavy on special effects and not enough story line.  At least this movie maintains some mystery and has a good storyline without being too predictable.  Compared to other science fiction movies I've seen, I think it's definitely one of the better ones out there.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Adorable movie! Great viewing for everyone in the family. Lots of funny moments. Especially great for young girls to see character development. Main character evolves from timid to brave.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|But then it said to go to app store to update and it won't update. Even deleted the game to download again and it says the same thing again. If this game was working I would give it 5 stars. Help!!!! Fix the download!!!!!
B0096BIENY|4.0|Nice cd, but many of the songs need updating - i.e. have heard them a million times, so playing the cd too many times gets old very quickly.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I am not a fan of spy stories, but the focus on a young girl's first love affair shows how formative the experience can be.  The characters are unusual and plucky, and there is a kind of anti- &#34;big brother&#34; sentiment that I also applauded.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|The constant refreshing and being kicked off for long periods of time make it very hard to enjoy this game. I wouldn't spend any real money on this game!!!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Great addition to the g. I. joe series. Action was intense but not to unbelievable. Will watch again
B008XG1X18|5.0|Whomever created Pinterest created a great thing, all the ideas, crafts, recipes, and everything that is offered is awesome. I have tried many things from Pinterest and continue to refer friends to Pinterest.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|Watchable, but not memorable.  Not funny, not bad, not horrible, just ok.  Wait for it to come on tv.  Not worth making an extra effort to see.
B00511ONPG|5.0|I was introduced to this book as part of my MBA program, however after reading it, I think this should be a mandatory book for not only every marketing person, but every member of any organization!  So much insight, so much perspective on the new paradigm of marketing & customer service.  As a consumer I want to be respected when I am marketed to, I want to be heard when I have issues.  Organizations that have read this book, and taken its principals are organizations I want to do business with.  Similarly it dictates how I need to market to and treat my customers, and the opportunity social media gives us, that far surpass traditional marketing media!  Looking forward to a much better 'social' experience as a consumer.  The next jerk that calls me on my cell phone during dinner time, will certainly be recommended this book!
B00ANAC32U|2.0|This just adds bulk. That's all it does. It makes your phone wider and taller. The buttons are moved out 1/4&#34; and there is a ring of extra junk around your already large phone.  It provides almost no protection and has great cutouts and all, but doesn't do anything to your phone that is helpful.  It's even a bit more slippery than the wonderfully grippy factory edges of the N4's sides. Just a waste of money unless you chew on the edges of your phone as an anxious habit. If this is the case, the bumper is a perfect accessory for you.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I've watched this documentary several times.  I walk away stunned by the talent displayed and thankful for all that I have in my life.  Much to be learned here.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery Manor is an exciting game in which you progressively unlock rooms of the manor.  Ever level gives you some diamonds,so it is possible to keep progressing without spending any of your own money.  The downside is I have had issues connecting with Facebook.  Very Enjoyable Game!  I have had to start over twice though I am not sure if you can get your same profile back.
B002RI99IM|4.0|I thought it would be fun to uncork Taleb's book again some 6 years later.<br />And it was.<br />Half a decade later is not quite 'the test of time', but the central concept in The Black Swan stood up surprisingly well.<br />Massively unexpected stuff will hit the fan, and this book tries to make sense of it all, and offers a predictive, 'awareness' framework.<br />I enjoyed reading it then, and I enjoyed reading it now. Still relevant, especially in hindsight.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A different look at other's thoughts and how we deal with our own prejudices. We all have someone who does not see things as we do.
B002RI9VVM|5.0|Such great characters. Really enjoyed the friendship btw George and Lennie.  Insightful into how life used to be once upon a time
B00BE97ONM|4.0|Despite the title, this is a quirky, heart-warming tale of a young mans adventures with wizards, elves, dwarves and a magic ring. I jest. A stark, sometimes gruesome, moral story about modern values, society and city life. The plot follows a series of interwoven characters on the path to destruction and redemption. Each of these characters is given time to develop through numerous first-person narratives, which allows the reader the opportunity to empathise with many (although not all!) of their conflicting views and ideas on the same events.  A bold attempt from a newcomer which is carried out with aplomb. All in all a fine effort, although perhaps not for the faint hearted! You shall find no hobbits here...
1594132666|5.0|Eat Pray Love is the voice of every woman who dares to genuinely experience life despite everything from birth order to conceived notions of romance.<br /><br />The story chronicles a woman who has the bravery required for break free from traditional roles and embrace true growth spiritually and the taking on of the personal responsibility for happiness.  A must for any thinking woman.<br />Lisa Dekis
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So well scripted and acted.  This series is like reading a really great book that you can't put down. I am addicted and now am really looking forward to season 4.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|This movie went straight to the heart. I'm not sure if this movie would be for younger children although for adults its great.
B005544V6A|5.0|I dont watch TV but consumed all of season one in 4 days. In between work and life it was a great summer pleasure
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Recently, my grandaughter added the Bible to my Kindle Fire. It seems to be very easy to use, being able to move from  the Books of the Bible to chapters and verses I'm a King James and NIV reader, but find it easy to read from other versions.<br />Thanks for making this so easy and comfortable for me.  Theresa
B0019M068O|5.0|Ok, I'll admit it - I do not own any studio album by Abba except for this CD and the one that came before it, \\"Abba Gold\\" - but, to be sincere, if you want the taste of Abba's music - then these two CDs will serve you more than enough, and they can even be divided into two basic categories - Songs by Abba that became their huge hits which everybody knows, maybe you might call it their more 'pop' side, and then there is this one, \\"More Abba Gold\\" which includes songs that weren't necessarily huge hits (well, some of them are well known actually), but are more thought-provoking and have some extra depth to them that the mega-hits omitted... To start with, some of my absolute most favorite Abba tunes are here - the hypnotic Eagle, the creative Cassandra, the honest and bit-gloomy The Day Before You Came (always get the chills by this one), the lovely romantic Our Last Summer, their first attempt at the Eurovision Song Contest (which failed, but still a great song remained), Ring Ring, the dramatic Head Over Heels and much much more which is worth owning by anyone with even the slightest interest in the music Abba created in their hey-days, and listening to this collection (and the other one as well) will remind you why their were so successful on their scene for a lot of years. Abba made a very original music that touches your soul sometimes, with an irresistible combination of simplicity yet high rate lyrics and enough variation of styles that couldn't categorize them in one genre of music. In my opinion, Abba is the greatest export the music world ever got from Sweden in terms of musical quality (maybe besides Roxette, but they're a completely different story) and nostalgic atmosphere you could almost never find in other artists' music. The only thing that always bummed me a bit is that the boys in the band sang much too little... No offense, of-course Agnetha's and Frida's voices were (and still are, I'm sure) magnificent, especially when they sang together - but I'd like to hear Benny or Bjorn sometimes singing the songs they wrote. Up until now, we have only Does Your Mother Knows to give us an example of their vocal style, and that's really not enough... Anyway, back to this collection - if you are serious about having a respectable prospective collection of Abba's best, don't pass on this one. I've listened to it at least 50 times and never get tired of it. Invest, listen, enjoy! Hope this was helpful to whomever read it.
B006PAV1XO|3.0|I was expecting a comedy. It's more like a drama. Still ok but nothing that will make you laugh sd
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Your update has frozen my game. Every time I try to log on it says there's a new update in the app store when there's not. Great game if you fix the update issue
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The series just keeps getting better.  The real shocker is what happens to Peter in the last episode. Great entertainment!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE! MY BOYS LOVE IT, THEY WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. GREAT MOVIE FOR FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I loved the visuals and story, as well as the ending... can't wait till the sequel comes out!  I wouldn't say this is Tom's best performance but it wasn't a bomb either.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Love it. I have read 20 or 30 times by now. I would recommend it to someone who likes Greek Mythology
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I have not used the device yet. I sent it to my brother in the Philippines. But as far as how fast the item arrived, very prompt. Cudos.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|you do know there was like 20 books to this story line , and this story was close . nice touch with the witches
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie. Just a perfect action movie. Fast paced and well directed. Chris pine and JJ Abraham done their job to perfection
0345529057|5.0|This is seriously one of the best series in the genre! I honestly rate this right up there with Lord of the Rings!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Harder to follow than his prior books.  He has so many characters and in so many places.  It becomes difficult to follow.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Fix this now!!! fix this NOW!!!!! FIX this NOW!!!!!<br />hello! !gameloft fix this now**** fix this update update update! fix it
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I laughed through out this book. It seems that we all would like to wake up with a good looking rich man who doesn't want us to go and begs us to stay. Fantasy, I know. But if we cant have that in real life we can read about it right?!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I wanted a watch to wear at work in a business setting  looking respectable in a board meeting or walking the plant floor, professional but not ostentatious or overblown.  This watch is a good compromise.<br /><br />the band is a little skinny for my taste but is high quality.  the watch is obviously a Seiko and it shows.  this is Seiko quality.  I really like Automatic actions (but you have to wear them or move them or they stop) and this watch is handsome and you know by looking at it, it exudes quality.  the watch looks far more expensive and could easily hold its own with watches costing hundreds more.  IMO at under $100 this watch is an exceptional value.
B00881PPTO|5.0|This is an amazing app to help you plan your vacation. This will help you find good prices on hotels/motels, airlines, and car rentals. A must get app for people on the go who need to prepare for your vacation.
B0062A5RUA|5.0|Slash continues to rock as hard as ever.  If you were a fan of GNR or classic rock in general, give this a listen and keep an eye out for more new music from him
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Cate Blanchett is powerful in this movie.  She plays a fantastic Elizabeth!!  The story is moving to see a queen's heart
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I'm not 40 yet, but some of this was so real it was hard to laugh. It did make me feel better that I'm not the only one who has craziness at home!
B001XULSG6|5.0|This is one of my favorite Star Trek series so I was very happy to see the movie again~there was a lot I had forgotten but I did remembered  Whorf saying &#34;assimilate this.&#34; The Borg is one of the very best science fiction villains ever so it was a pleasure to finally see the Queen of the Borg.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love steampunk and this is one of my favorites. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are just great together. Can't get enough of this duo.
B00821OX98|5.0|I've seen this advertised for a few years but never took the plunge, until now! Man what a ride, intrigue, action and drama! The cast is fantastic and I can't wait for more! We all have busy lives and have to be selective with our free time, and I say spend it with this show!
B001F6TXME|3.0|I found the thickness of the cable to a big disappointment. I would expect better from Nikon. I have purchased similar items from off brand manufactures for a third of the price whose quality seem to be better. Sure it worked out of the box. Did what it's suppose to. Time will tell the true quality of the item.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is very sleek, with great functionality.  It's a no brainer.  Great for on the go bidding on the road or even at home.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan train is a story of the triumph of the human spirit. You are drawn into the world of the orphans in the past,and the present day world of &#34;orphans as well. I recommended the book to my daughter as well.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Enjoyed the book and was surprised at the changes made in the video I had seen.  Glad for the opportunity to read another Austen novel since I tend to just re-read Pride and Prejudice. Persuasion is actually filled with deeper life lessons so I really am glad I read it. Thanks.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Great movie as is anything Wahlberg does. Great action actor, good story line. Intense would be an afterthought. I would watch again.
0060989157|4.0|Holy hell!  A peek into the decadence of a gorgeous rock band.  Anytime a book can make me sick to my stomach, it's got to be good reading.  It's disturbing but I dare you to put it down.  Adults only.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|This title is scary as F, but the camp is missing from the classic. I think the camp/gross out factor would have given it 5 stars done correctly. Possession requires a bit of vomit, amirite?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it is so amazing. It needs a few more things though. I can play for hours on end when im at my moms house. I mostly play on the xbox though.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a sad read but very true to life. the characters were finely drawn and though the  ending was very sad it was indeed a true to life story.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love a show where I can't predicty what<br /><br />I love a show that I can't predict what is going to happen.<br />I enjoy the differences in the two main characters and how they grow to like and admire each other.<br />Very pleases with this series. Thank you.<br /><br />,
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Man of Steel is a well done movie!  Great story plot, amazing cast, incredible composer (Hans Zimmer), very good direction, and it never took away from us the essence of Superman.  The goal for this movie was to modernize Superman.  He's been around for 75 years, and never gets old.  Even though some parts of the movie were slightly rush, it's still an excellent Superman movie.  Can't wait to get it on Blu-ray!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Some typical twists, but entertaining and well acted.  Thought it could be more tasteful if he represented bikers who were not drug peddlers.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We love this show, and can't wait for the next season to start. Very creative writing, with wonderful special effects,  great acting and beautiful Photography.
0345505387|5.0|Loved this book...the drawings and story line. A wonderful addition to my library of Galbaldon books indeed. Thank you Diana!

B008HJGPVO|3.0|It worked great will it lasted. All 3 tips lasted the whole 2 months.<br />Too late to return it. This time I'm trying the mesh tip, maybe it'll work better.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|My wife got this and &#34;forced&#34; me to watch it but I was pleasantly surprised.  I was not over the top.  Definitely a good guy and gal movie.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|what update...said I need to update but there is no update in the store, what do I do now the game will not open. Love the game before this glitches.
B00992CF6W|1.0|i hate it when I got it it had a glitch so don,t get it it sucks like crap l hate it
B005544V6A|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  Addicted since the very first show.  Very edgy with lots of twists and turns and also has some very funny parts.  Also the fashion is good too.  I've loved every episode.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|This collection is very simple, but perfect for those who just want the movies. Beautiful, very classy case and discs.<br /><br />One potential con for anyone who cares: the case IS bigger than a normal DVD.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|starrrrrrrk awesome, thor awesome, hulk smash awesome,  everyone else okay but move was 5 star good story line great depth loved it can't wait for more avenger movies comics rule...
B00BM7ORFO|3.0|Easy read, love story, a bit of suspense. I wasn't really into the main female character but it's a good way to pass holiday time.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have a HUGE music library and used to have to download huge files to all my devices.  Now I have it in this and just download the app to my devices.  Much easier and worls easily....even my wife uses it.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|We absolutely love this movie, it is such a fun watch! We had to add to our collection of the Die Hard movies!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice site. love the hourly weather and the migraine and allegy alerts. I could however live without stupid game ad across the bottom third of my screen. no way to block it except to pay for improved version. free version is fine
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love majhong! This is a fun app! Thank you for keeping it free! Keep them coming please and please keep them free!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game! It reminds me of the days my family had game night when I was growing up! And it's free to play!
B007N8RULO|4.0|I love this game. ..can be addictive though. The only problem I have is sometimes the system does not put the cards in the column that I am trying to put them in.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|As John Mayer said during the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame celebration- this is one of the best albums ever made.  It has made me a fan of Albert King, Booker T. Jones, etc..
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|just watched the movie last night. started the game today. seems interesting so far. not too far along in it just yet though.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|The first 20-30 minutes of this movie were good. The rest was painfully boring. I wouldn't recommed watching it. Nothing like knocked up except for a few of the same characters.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Hold on to your seat, because this movie moves so quickly!  Hope you can hold your breath for long moments at a time, because you'll need to when you see this.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Best replacement with org. Replacement parts works like a charm was listed just the way it came works just like it should I have no complaints recommend 100%
B00821PCJS|3.0|If I was caught up in a situation as depicted on this series I would want my children to be as well trained and ready for any situation they encounter. It's frustrating to see the parents not wanting their kids to participate in what's going on. All they are doing is setting them up to be victims and that detracts from the whole series main point, the survival of the human race. Kinda stupid and really detracts from an otherwise entertaining series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game.  it keeps you going. you should get it. can you escape is really fun. I love this game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I enjoyed the first series so there was no way I could miss the second.  I was not disappointed.  I have watched this over and over with friends and they all agree it is a scream!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Excellent character development with devastating realism. Rowling develops compelling story lines that draw you into a dark story of small town prejudices and infighting. Well worth the read.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Love The Piano Guys, love their videos. Lots of talent, creativity, unique way of marketing and GREAT music. Can't wait for the next one.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This used to be my most favorite app,but when it got updated I couldn't play anymore because it told me to get the update from the app store  but I couldn't. I wish I could rate 0 stars because I can't update it. Until it I can play it on my kindle fire I won't give it more stars.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|This series has the right actors in the right roles. I like how they interpret their characters. This series is what I would have expected for the preliminary to the story of &#34;Hannibal&#34;. I can imagine how Hannibal choreographed every one around him before being found out. The intelligenc of Hannibal, as depicted in the books, is not sullied by some second rate writing or acting, I like it.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Great holiday movie
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After watching the first season, I was hooked.  I have really enjoyed this show.  The story line runs back and forth between the servants and the served.  It is full of love stories and conflicts.  It is also fascinating to know how people lived in those times.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is one of the better shows on TV today. I'm delighted to be able to get it via instant video.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|As the game progresses there becomes a challenge with each level. love it and is very challenging.  Keeps the mind going
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I have read in awhile. Takes you back to your first love and how you felt. Beautifully written.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I needed a small bag that could hold two ANKER 10000 MAH batteries, cables and accessories for a camping trip and spotted this.  I ordered it based on some helpful interior measurements someone else posted and it ended up being perfect for my needs.<br />Quality wise, it's on par with any Case Logic product out there.  I agree with other reviews that this not really a case for anything other than a point and shoot.  Definintely no DSLR's in this case. But if you have other small electronics such as hard drives, backup batteries, ect then you'll find this usefull.  It has two side pockets and a larger front pocket.<br />I'm happy with it.  If the rest of the Amazon Basics line is like this, I'll buy more of the brand.
159463176X|5.0|The many stories in this book come together like the beautiful patterns in a Persian rug, woven together by magical design, seamless and intricate. Hosseini weaves together culture, history, politics, geography, romance, attachment, ... Journeying back and forth between different eras, and still holding the cohesion of the story line.
B005PK553C|5.0|One of the most excellent horror series of our time.  I love how the writers take American situations and add a ghost tale to it.  It is very gruesome.  Not for the meek.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is a must if you want to celebrate your purchase of a new fancy TV. The effects are really spectacular. It seems to be ok for teens.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I really enjoy this cd.  The music is good and I have a favorite song; which I cannot think of the name right now (smile).
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|My father bought this app for his Kindle Fire and he loves the ease of creating new documents with it on his Kindle Fire, or reading and editing older documents downloaded from the cloud. The installation was a cinch, the user interface is a no-brainer, and overall the performance is excellent. This is one of the better Office apps we have used.
B005ES0XQY|5.0|My husband loves these shoes. He is very happy with his recent purchase and will probably be purchasing another pair.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Choice of actors is exemplary!<br />As is most movies that are based on novels...the movie version pales in comparison to the book. However, this was well done. So, so good!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game but its telling me there's update available but go to app store tells me to open not update losing bonus now and mining. please help
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I love movies that have a twist to the story line. Rent it when you can it is well worth it.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|My grandkids got me into this game.  It is so fun and I've only fooled him about 5 times.  Crazy!
B002XXUWMI|5.0|Don't force people to write reviews!!! One, two ,three, four, five, six, seven ,eight, nine, ten, eleve, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, would that be enough?
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|Did not like the tab for gmail for the kindle. Went back to the original email icon. I did not like the split screen.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|buying and down loading the songs were easy for me before cloud.  I buy and can't transfer to my computer or mp3  now. I miss doing it the old way.  I'm thinking of removing amazon mp3 and that cloud. I know, I must be doing it wrong.  but I see no help to do it right.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|Are you a fan of Arcade Fire? Do you have the other Arcade Fire titles in your music collection? - whether your answer is yes or no here, doesn't really matter - Then you should add this one, as well. If you are unfamiliar with Arcade Fire and somehow ended up here to look at and/or buy this album, I would say it is a solid effort for this band. Neon Bible makes a good starting point, or simply an addition to a more recent release of theirs. The sound is not entirely the same from one album to the next, but it stays true to their style and is very listenable and enjoyable.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I wasn't to sure of this product because of a few reviews, but I'm very happy with my choice and I would refer to someone else.
B003006WRC|1.0|He should move to France we would all be much better off. Maybe cuba would be better for him. Jerk
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|OK all you hi-techers good for you! As for me, this Chromecast thing has been a worthless, time-consuming piece of junk! Had to remove my 70\\" TV from wall to install it, run the wires behind cable box & bluray, use wire ties and went to hook it up and NOTHING. Two hours of reconfiguring it to avail Wi-Fi in house didn't work... uninstalling it and reinstalling it didn't work... now I will have to remove everything again & return it to Google for a refund... but the time involved far exceeds that paltry sum. DON'T BUY THIS!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love it because of the five foot length & it is versatile when using it with the Powerfast plug.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Rollins delivers again. Fast paced and keeps you turning pages. The amount of scientific research that goes into his books is truly impressive. Can't wait for the next one
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|My family watched this together and if it's your first time or fifth it's always a good watch. Love it
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|The combination of life in a senior living home, music and theater works really well. Maggie Smith and the rest of the cast are great.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|The first movie was a total snoozer. A classic star trek movie that doesnt put you to sleep like 1.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise give very good performances.  You are better off watching this kind of movie without knowing much beforehand.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Once again, Baldacci writes a great novel.  i thoroughly enjoyed this  adventure of Will Robie  and his human element comes out in this adventure.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Says to update i go to app store i go there select app udates nothing is there to apply.please fix.
0307394549|5.0|I love to bake and cookies are my favorite.  Of course Martha has all of the best recipes out there.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Each time I open the game it states there is an update and to go to the Appstore. I go to the Appstore and it takes me to the game app which has no update button. The only button says &quot;open&quot; which takes me to the game only to repeat the process. I've tried searching &quot;updates&quot; with no luck. I guess my only option would be to uninstall and reinstall and lose my progress. It takes a bit of time to get to lvl 50. Don't really want to start over. Glad it was free.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I love the books. My only issue is who Sookie ends up with. I felt out of all the people she could of ended up with, it just didn't seem right. After all the years and no real spark or romance, it made me sad for Sookie like she was settling. I really wanted to see her back with Bill.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|So much fun - cannot stop playing - gets increasingly more difficult and more fun with each level - a real winner!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I heard so much praise for Shadow of the Colossus, so I decided to buy the collection. I ended up playing ICO first and thoroughly enjoyed that game. Great puzzles that current gen games tend to be short of, and you care for the characters right from the beginning. There are only certain points to save at, so make sure to take advantage of those.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus is just pure epic adventure! I have only beat 3 of the colossi so far and they were all crazy fun! The action is not non-stop however. There are sizable sections where you must ride your horse quite a ways to the next colossus. Making your way to each colossus is part of the experience tho because the feels begin to build up, making the boss encounter just pure awesomeness.<br /><br />If you like platformers and awesome puzzles, ICO, is made for you. If you like God of War sized bosses and an epic, enthralling experience, then you'll dig Shadow of the Colossus. They are both superior games, icons of the playstation 2 system. Bring them to life on your ps3 console if you even have an inkling of interest. I did and don't regret it one bit!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another good Grisham book.  Grabs your attention.<br />Hard to put down.  Knew there would be a surprising<br />ending.  Worth the time.
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|I was skeptical about this movie.  I went into it knowing what it was: Hasbro attempting to use the popularity of what is possibly its most popular brand to make a line of dolls to compete with other toy companies.  That, and the somewhat scary character designs (like on the cover), made me skeptical, but I was also intrigued by the movie trailers on YouTube and positive reviews fellow fans have given, so I had to give it a shot.  So I found it on YouTube and watched it.<br /><br />First, the negatives:<br />The romantic subplot, while not entirely pointless, went nowhere, and the movie could just have easily done without it.<br />The ending was a little outlandish in relation to the events that led up to it, and it also felt rushed.<br />The movie wasn't paced very well.<br /><br />Now, the positives:<br />The character designs are much better than the cover led me to believe.<br />The music is done very well, and is sometimes as memorable as that on the show.<br />The characters, while human, are still exactly the same as on the show when you get right down to it.<br />The overall message of friendship is never lost, even with the outlandish ending, and I was genuinely moved when the message came full-circle at the end.<br /><br />With the knowledge of why this movie was made to begin with, and the fact that it was primarily a movie for the fans, I give it a 7/10.  Overall, it was enjoyable, and I believe it stays true to the theme conveyed by the show, of which I am a huge fan (I am a brony). However, it may or may not hit with your personal tastes.  My advice would be: if you are a fan of the show and have the chance to watch this movie, do so, and if you like it, support the makers of the movie by buying it.  I made sure to watch it on YouTube first, and I enjoyed it, so I pre-ordered the movie (I just got it today).<br />Also, make sure to watch the entire credits.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, definitely a must for anybody that is into Naval History, though it might prove a little slow from anybody who might be expecting Pirates of the Caribbean type of action.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|I loved this book. It was my first by Dr. Asimov and I didn't know what to expect when I began. But after the first few pages, I was hooked and I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan but especially those who love when an author includes actual scientific concepts I. Their fiction. This is truly a masterpiece.
B00BB22GQM|3.0|Taken as a whole this record is mediocre, but there are some really incredible songs on it, especially Ya Hey.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|An emotionally destructive romance with Gideon and Eva, two damaged souls, trying to find common ground in their love. The sex is explosive and everything else is volatile.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|Great but what else can I say about Josh Groban.  We were very pleased with CD and would order again.
B004P2HMNM|1.0|I haven't got past bag #3 because there are multiple missing pieces. It is difficult to continue when you haven't got all the pieces as they all build on each other.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Really makes me want to go back and start recording on my little 4-track like I used to high school.
B002V091IO|5.0|The dual POV stretching over 20 years really gives a great insight into the minds of Emma and Dex. They stayed with me long after I put the book down. A must read!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Queens consistently make really enjoyable rock records and this is no exception. Every song is cool and interesting, with great sounds and lyrics.
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|one of the greatest movies ever made by far, Damon at his best !!!!!!! never figured that dollar out, anybody?
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The Weather Channel Channel is simple to use, everything on one screen. It is updated by the minute when weather is changing which is very nice dealing with thunder storms. I check it often. There is no sound, nobody talking, just printed forecast. The price is right.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|I found it to be a very depressing movie;  very good performance by Ellen Burstyn-she was the reason I ordered it
B000U6BT40|5.0|What a great series! Great characters.  Every episode leaves you wanting more. Too bad there is not more. guess I will have to watch it again.
B007KLKFSO|5.0|This book, dude, THIS BOOK. It's one of those quiet books where it's difficult to explain what happened, but there is beauty in the subtlety of this story. You'll fall in love with this book the way those two kids do - without even noticing what's happened.
B000NA22C6|5.0|This movie is soooo entertaining...yet sooooo careeepy!!! It's a good scary movie to watch - but NOT alone! LOL! Very suspenseful!
1906735875|5.0|This is, quite honestly, not the Dredd you want it to be. Most of the works collected in this omnibus show a starting point for Dredd, that eventually evolves into the Dredd you know and love. You see flashes of him in there, but for the most part he is shown as a satirical figure more equatable to a grim Dudely Do-Right than anything else. So why the high rating, right? The great joy of reading this earliest collection is you get to see the evolution of the character, as well as the origins of a good many characters that make appearances later and without a proper introduction you simply do no get the full flavor of Dredd.
B000ID1IYG|2.0|I was told it was a clasic, but pretty stupid overall.  I don't know what everyone sees in this movie.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I'm not much of a reviewer but I will give it a shot. This is a typical Spielberg film in that it is predictable and a bit lifeless. I did not go to the movie when it was in the theatre because I felt the trailer probably told the story. I was right in that assumption. All the performances are good and preictable with Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader providing the most inventive presentations.<br />It's worth the cost of the rental.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|The item arrived on the day I was told, just as promised.  I Cant wait to use it on my AMD FX processor. Hopefully this will help me get better CPU temperatures on my PC.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fiction,yes, but so many patrols to past and present history that it is especially scary. Recommended to young adult up.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This movie is brilliantly put together! Loved it! One of the best movies I have seen, with very good acting, character development, plot, camera work, everything came together nicely. Very entertaining!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it!! Very small glitches but other wise amazing it provides a cool and fun game for my kids
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Perfect condition, my boyfriend made me watch every episode with him (I thought he could just enjoy the gift on his own lol). I also loved the neat packaging
1451695195|5.0|This book seemed to confirm a lot of the thoughts I have been having about the meaning and true reality of life.  I was totally absorbed until the very end.  Thankful that this doctor had the courage to share his experience.  It has changed how I view life.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|All of the talent of these artist really comes out and you can tell they are having a ball. If you love Rock and Roll you will love<br />these songs. Great music for listening on a road trip.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this whole book and do hope there is more to come from this author. Maybe another part TO this. I feel in love with couple from the beginning. Thanks for a good book
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It keeps telling me there is an update and won't let me play. I check for the update but nothing comes up.
1439102813|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone to read who is dealing with an individual with dementia; either senile dementia or early onset. It gives you empathy for those dealing with this debilitating disease.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Reminded me of all the games i grew up with. Great read, enjoyed it thoroughly beginning to end! My only complaint, i couldn't put the book down once i started.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is awesome I love how you get all of these different blocks to use I can't wait for version 7.2 to come out for the kindle fire now I know it's been a month since it came out on the Apple app store but I'm patient this wish they had more stuff that the Xbox and pc versions  like Redstone and minecart tracks and minecarts but still 5 stars
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Loved this game. Wish there were more games like this, glad I can replay it over and over. Thanks Fire Maples Games.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|As a movie,  this was very entertaining.  However,  too much new new material was written in and too much actual material from the book was left out.  I'm guessing it comes from trying to make a trilogy from a single book,  when at most,  two movies could be made.  In all,  I'm a bit disappointed.  Jackson did such a fantastic job with The LORD IF THE RINGS, I think he got greedy with this one.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A Haunting story, much of it based on researched facts from a very dark and low period of America history. The characters come to life and make you care about them. Who is white? What is White?, who is a black, what is Black? Disturbing, tense, ripe with emotion. Worth reading and giving thought to.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Amazon.com<br /><br />Cheaper store items<br />Children's books are antique, biblical, up to date with new authors<br />Wonderful library books for kindle fire<br /><br />Wikipedia - when we were on vacation in No. California - able to look up various plants and trees, animals, etc. while riding in<br />  car.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I purchased the book mostly because of the reviews. Obviously, others saw something in the book I simply didn't see. Maybe it was a lack of faith on my part. Or perhaps, it was more faith. I guess I was looking for an answer to questions I never knew I had. And Dr. Alexander simply didn't answer, although I think he meant to. What I couldn't find was an objective.<br />  I'm an avid reader of non fiction. Mostly history and the broad spectrum of human origin. I've accepted death both scientifically and spiritually, and like every other human species since the beginning of man, I believe in a higher power whom I choose to call God.<br />  And then, several months ago, the unthinkable happened. My wife of 45 years died. Your book had far more expectations for me than I could have humanly expected. Really quite unfair on my part. I've heard all the consoling words, all the best wishes, all the deepest regrets from so many. But the loss to me is simply devastating. What I read were things I was taught when I was a child, like Limbo and Purgatory... St. Brigid being flown in to Ireland on fairies wings.<br />  I hope Anne's passing to another life is as simple as you portray. What I was hoping for was more of a reprieve.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I never watched this show when it was out, but I started watching it at Season one online.  I was hooked after the first show.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|JUST LOVE THE CLOUD DOWN LOADER..CAN PLAY MY MUSIC IN THE CLOUD OR DOWNLOAD TO MY PC...GREAT... I AM ENJOYING MY MUSIC
B0060AY85C|5.0|A tender in-depth story about an African-American man finding his roots and honoring his legacy and a tragic story of unheroic military service and the return to the States with PTSD.
B0096BIENY|5.0|This is a fantastic CD & IL Divo is wonnnnnnnderful!!! Even though they don't sing much in English I love it!!!! They have such great voices. Hope to see them in concert one day soon :)
B009FZFONO|5.0|amc is kicking a** and taking names in the cable arena.  there is lots more action compared with season 2
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the greatest shows ever! I can't believe how they cast everyone so perfect in this series, it's FANTASTIC.  The setting and costumes are so perfect. It also, has historical events incorporated into it. My husband who usually watches the military channel and all the guy stuff, agreed to watch the First episode in Season 2.  That's all it took, he was so hooked and I had to start it over and start on Season One for him. Then he mentioned it to to of his guys friends at the gym and he couldn't believe how many of them were watching it.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Bubble games have always been fun to me, and this one is in my top 5. Very clear graphics and runs smoothly.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Best gift ever.  Use it almost every day.  I now read more than ever!!<br />Fantastic product.  I encourage readers to purchase one.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Loved it the twist was so not what I expected and the ending was amazing I love when I can't predict what's gonna happen and this movie totally threw me!!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Since I love the Die Hard series (best Christmas movie of all time), I was really excited for this movie.  Unfortunately, it feel flat for me with mediocre action sequences and I just wasn't a fan of the dialogue which was supposed to cute and tough at the same time.  Just really didn't work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is a fun game for people who like obstacle course games and Despicable Me. I would give this a minion stars if possible
B002ZG975Q|5.0|it was awonderful story withe an up to date setting and two wonderful performers. I searched all over to find this instores and could not
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best season yet! The drama, the character conflict! I especially like that the women are asserting more power over their husbands, employers, and families.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Wow, what an exciting series, full of drama.  Really see Human Behavior.  People react in differents ways and it is interesting to watch them inter play with each other.  The aliens are just the characters in a war we have fought many times and the human reaction is about the same.  We need to change.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|If you are like me, you don't want to waste money on a cd with 1 good song and 5-10 terrrible or unknown songs. This cd is not one of those cds- It actually includes the hit songs...<br />&#34; All the Right Moves&#34;  &#34; Good Life&#34; and &#34; Secrets&#34;  along with some unknown songs that you will likely come to like. This cd is worth buying!
B008KEQM3W|1.0|DO NOT assume this is what reality is like! This is just another unrealistic depiction of unplanned pregnancy. In the movie, two of the pregnancies are unplanned. As in seemingly all Hollywood depictions of pregnancy, they skip over what, for most people, would be a freak-out followed by deep consideration about how pregnancy would change their life, and if they really should go forward with it. Instead they depict the women (and even more unrealistically, the fathers, even though the relationships had not been serious beforehand) almost immediately being overjoyed, without any worries. This is scary that this is what is portrayed in the mainstream media to young people: that pregnancy will make you instantly happy and land you the handsome guy you had a one-night stand with. Nevermind that you and he have no preparation and little means to raise a human being. The ultimate atrocity of this film is the title itself, because this is not what to expect when you're expecting (especially if it is unplanned). Only briefly featured are the negative aspects of pregnancy, including exhaustion, bloating, stretch marks, hemorrhoids, peeing your pants, hormonal swings, etc. Also, for the couple trying to adopt a baby, they show a father that clearly does not appear to want a child at all, go through with the adoption! Stop the madness of these awful movies!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love the app! Can't get enough!  So addictive but also and frustrating.  You will love it ! Great for appointment waiting.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|The original tunes are ok but after a while you can start to notice where they are going to repeat. Point in case, the chimes. It would be nice if the loop track was longer. I hope they improve on it an d maybe let user uploads be available as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the books.  For all the negative reviews i have read - people need to remember this is a book - it is not real life so go ahead and fantasize occasionally.  Maybe things would not happen this way in real life, but that is why we read - to escape from real life occasionally.
B001F12J0C|5.0|That Jason Bourne is hard to catch! These are 3 of my favorite newer movies, lots of action and excitement.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Stephen Bjornson wakes up one morning alongside his wife, both of them bound and gagged on the bed, with a masked stranger in the room. His wife is then horrifically killed. Two police officers investigate what soon turns out to be a series of gruesome murders. Original, horrific and gripping. The reason behind the killings is one of the most imaginative ever thought of by a crime writer. Not to be missed.

B00E5UEA4I|4.0|The songs on this album all fall closer to heal over than to black horse and a cherry tree. If you're looking for something upbeat this probably isn't what you're looking for. Personally I really enjoy this album. I've been listening to this album pretty incessantly over the past week, and I still like it. If you're wavering buy this album, you won't regret it.
0345803507|3.0|I couldn't wait to get the next book in the trilogy as I finished book 2. The way the books were written were amazing you felt for Ana and Christian as their lives as a couple progress. I don't like spoiling books or anything for others but I will say this I was very displeased with the actions of Christian as certain things happen. And the end was blah it wasn't really an ending in my opinion the other books kept you wondering and Fifty shades when I read the first one I was in tears from the ending. This finishes the trilogy yes but I wouldn't waist your time reading it.

B0016YBFZ8|4.0|Loved the Godfather movies.  Loved Donnie Brasco.  This movie truly brought to life the characters played by Liotta, Dinero, Pesci, etc.  It made you care about what was going on.  The Corleone Zfamily in the Godfather films seemed distant.  In Goodfellas, it seemed like you were hearing about the guys next door.  Even though they were low lifes.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This book has some characteristic and very enjoyable Gaiman moments but they are sadly few and far between.<br />His earlier works demonstrate far more commitment to originality and depth - he's just coasting now - i will not buy another Gaiman book on his name alone.
B0001932ZA|5.0|This is why you may have gotten that 'deja vu' feeling from watching The Hunger Games movies. Let's see.. a one-sided competition where contestants fight to the death for a national TV audience set in the future? Wasn't THG original? No of course not!<br /><br />The Running Man is just overall a much better movie, dated special effects and all. You have some of AHNULD's best classic one-liners which is reason enough to get this: \\"Killian! Here's Sub Zero- Now PLAIN ZEROOOO!!!\\", \\"He had to split!\\", \\"He hit the spot!\\", etc. Arnold had a big run in the 80's and 90's with classic action movies and this one's right up there with Terminator, Predator and Commando.<br /><br />Enter Ben Richards(AHNULD), a helicopter pilot and ex-cop who's been set up as the Butcher of Bakersfield when he refused to fire upon innocent civilans during a riot. Thrown in jail, he eventually finds his way out alongside a few of his prison buddies and catches the eye of Killian who later enlists him as the next contestant of The Running Man show.<br /><br />Richard Dawson takes a great turn as the sleazy game show host of \\"The Running Man\\", which pits society's criminals against ridiculously overpowered American Gladiator-style warriors with names like \\"Fireball\\", \\"Sub Zero\\", and \\"Buzzsaw\\". The catch? If the criminals can make it all the way to the end and stay alive they'll earn their freedom. Only a handful have ever been able to do this. Or have they?

B00BEIYH6U|4.0|Kick Ass 2 will probably disappoint a lot of people who, like me, loved the original to one degree or another. There are just too many flaws in this film to not, at some point, feel a little jilted. There are many times when it matches the greatness of the original film but as a whole this film comes nowhere near the level of ass kicking awesomeness we all fell in love with just a few years ago. It's just not as well made, and doesn't have the same love and attention it seems to me as the first movie. To make a comparison, this is The Dark knight Rises whereas the first movie was Dredd mixed with Iron Man. It even has the same kind of big nonsensical finale. That may not sound like a bad thing, after all a whole lot of people (not including myself) loved Dark Knight Rises, but for a movie like Kick Ass 2 the overly long and convoluted plot and wishy washing direction put a damper on this film. Like Dark Knight Rises, most of the movie is spent trying to get both our main hero's back into their costumes and doing the things we all wanted to see them do in the first place. First Hit Girl is a hero and Kick Ass is out. Then Kick Ass is a hero and Hit Girl is out. Then both are out, and then they're both in. Come on, was all that really necessary? I mean you have two much liked, well established \\"super heroes\\" already here, there's no need to spend almost the entire movie with at least one of them out of game entirely. What I wanted more than anything in this film was to see Hit Girl doing her thing like she did at the end of the first movie, but nothing she does here comes close to the jaw dropping action sequences she had before. Don't get me wrong, what she DOES get to do is really cool, but there's just not enough of it.<br /><br />What saves this movie from a three rating is that, for all its faults, there's no denying the huge grin I had while watching. Hit Girl may not have that huge action sequence that steals the show like in the first movie, but as I said before when she does don the purple jumpsuit and whips out her swords what follows is always a treat. Kick Ass doesn't get as many big action scenes, but he's always been more bumbling sidekick \\"super hero\\" then the Batman like ninja assassin Hit Girl is. His action scenes fit his character, and are a lot of fun in the same manner as his fights in the previous movie were. But who really steals the show is Jim Carry. Nick Cage played a great character in Big Daddy in the last film, and it's a real shame he died as he would have been great to have here. Fortunately for us, we have Jim Carry to take his place. I never would have imagined Jim Carry could have pulled off a role like this, especially after the long absence from notable films he's had. Jim Carry owns his role as ex mafia enforcer, and new leader of the Justice Friends super group, Colonel Stars and Stripes. The crazy grin, the way he gleefully peruses criminals and even trains his dog \\"Eisenhower\\" to bite off the dicks of pedophiles and human traffickers, all come together to make one of the more memorable characters in the entire series. If not for the trailers I wouldn't have even known it was him until his demasking.<br /><br />SPOILER!!<br />It's a real shame they killed him off, like they did with Big Daddy, but I understand the reasoning behind it. This isn't the \\"Colonel Stars and Stripes\\" show with Kick Ass and Hit Girl being background characters, this is Kick Ass, and you can't have Kick Ass being upstaged by Jim Carry.<br />END SPOILER!!<br /><br />The main villain, mob boss son Chris D'Amico from the first film makes a return as The MotherF'er, a whiny \\"super villain\\" who's only claim to power is a fortune he inherits when he accidentally kills his mother which he then uses to buy an army of super badies with comically racist names. The villains can be fun at times, but there are just too many of them and none of them get any sort of attention besides Mother Russia who's pretty much the female version of the Russian from Rocky III. Other than her though, it's pretty slim pickings when it comes to memorable villains. Sure they do bad things, but besides the before mentioned Mother Russia none of them do anything of note to make them stand out. There was a short guy, an Asian guy, a black guy, and that's about the extent of their characters. Funny names, no personality. As for MotherF'er, he has his moments but again its nothing special. In fact the director seemed to go out of his way to make this guy as whiny, emo, and annoying as possible. He wasn't bad persay, he just wasn't good either.<br /><br />If it sounds as if I didn't like this movie, trust me, that isn't the case at all. Even for all its problems Kick Ass 2 never bored me. My eyes were glued to the screen for its entire run time, and I can honestly say I had a blast watching it. Sure it's full of corny one dimensional character, plot holes, and is at times sloppily written, but at the end of the day this is a fun as hell movie that should please the inner nerds in all of us. It's not as good as the original, that's for sure, but for what it is it still manages to deliver hours of fun.<br /><br />Replay value: moderate.ion of the Russian from Rocky III.

B007XNAQL0|5.0|This concert is simply fantastic from beginning to end. The production value of the stage and imagery is fantastic. Peter Gabriel's singing voice is so good, you'd swear it was overdubbed in the studio. This man's singing is pitch perfect. The band accompanying him, Paula Cole, and the African-sounding dude (I don't remember his name) are exceptional artists.<br /><br />If you are a Peter Gabriel fan, and you should be, this is a must have.

B00A3XQVKW|2.0|I started reading this book thinking that Betty's NDE was going to give me some light about the hereafter. Even though her experience is believable I found it completely biased toward religion and her religious beliefs are present from the first page. I decided to give it a try but finally I had to quit in the middle of the book. I was expecting from this book something more spritual and less dogmatic, but I was disappointed. That's why I give it two stars.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child captured my interest from the introduction story of how he became a writer.  I love it when the good guy wins, and the hero is never weak.  Jack Reacher is a man's man, and a force to be reckoned with.  Lee Child is a man of detail that paints vivid mind pictures as you read.  If you like to read action and adventure I recommend you start with the Killing floor, Number 1.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it as it's quite user friendly and easy to play. I like how it adapts to the tilting of the tablet as well.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Okay, I'll start off by saying I was entertained, hence the four stars, but the movie falls a little short. I've been looking forward to seeing this for a long time, so when the chance recently came up to stream this I did. I love the espionage genre and had high expectations for this film, and it didn't quite meet them. That's not to say the film isn't interesting, but we've seen the formula before in the film \\"Taken\\" and countless others, so this is nothing more than a slight variation on that.<br /><br />The other thing that kind of throws this film off is that our super smart hero seems dense a lot of the time.  I'm not exactly sure what that is, but it works against making the film as coherent as it should be. It was predictable, and that's okay as long as the ride to the film's final destination is worth it.  When you've been spoiled by the twists in a Jason Bourne adventure it's hard for other films to reach that level.<br /><br />I try to judge each film on it's own merits, so don't think that I was expecting a Bourne film, I wasn't... I just think the bar could have been set a little higher for this movie.  Still, it's fun to watch.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Music is magic, it's the universal language of the soul.  It speaks to us on an emotional level, and this movie does a great job of documenting some of the history of Sound City and the magical music that came from that recording studio.  As an added bonus, we get a glimpse into the world of making music.  Very much worth a watch or two.

0142420891|5.0|`Where She Went' is the sequel of \\"If I Stay'. The book is told from Adam's POV. Adam is now a rockstar, living the life of the rich and famous. Yet, his heart is empty. He is still heartbroken from Mia's departure. She left without any explanation. When you read, you feel how deeply he was affected, it's heartbreaking and tearjerker. While in New York, he encounters Mia...this book it's a journey of forgiveness. You feel will feel his pain, loneliness, anxiety and most of all his anger.<br /><br />I honestly loved this book but I felt the ending was short told. Throughout the book I found myself hating Mia. I resented her decision. They way she left. They way she didn't keep in touch. I know she went through an extremely hard time but she had someone that truly cared. It was torturing reading their separation. What really got me pissed off is when she finally was able to speak with him the first time. She acted like she didn't ruin his life. I felt like I needed to shield Adam into a world of rainbows and happiness. Reading the lyrics of his songs... OMG, the tears. This is a must read series.<br /><br />I truly love Forman, her writing is so beautifully. I love how everything felt real. I love how she answers all my questions. I love how this book turns out to be a self discovery book. I love how much I hated Mia. I truly love how I forgave Mia, even though she didn't do anything to me. Most of all, I love Adam. This roller coaster ride was just overwhelming. Forman is truly a rockstar! - Leydy

B008B68IUY|2.0|I cannot say that I am all that much into Monster High and I probably would not admit it on the internet if I was.  So I left most of the testing of this product to my three daughters, 10, 7, and 6.<br /><br />When I took the car out of the box for my kids, my initial impressions were quite positive.  The level of detail on the vehicle was quite good for a plastic car.  There are various spooky details on various components.  The dash has a spider web inlay, the shifter and tail lights are gargoyles, and the steering wheel and wheel covers kind of has a medieval cross design.<br /><br />I gave it to my kids and by the end of the day, I had one of the girls come up to me and tell me that it broke already.  There is a seatbelt in the trunk/back seat area that holds the dolls in place.  That seatbelt broke completely off, so at this point the back seat is useless.<br /><br />The girls continued playing with it and at the end of the month, they gave me their list of pros and cons with the car.<br /><br />My girls loved the idea the car had a trunk where they could put the dolls' clothes and such.  They really liked the fact that the car could seat 4 dolls, assuming the seat belt did not break.  They also loved the detail of the car and really liked the shifter and the fact the car had cup holders.<br /><br />My girls were really disappointed in the fact the rear seatbelt broke.  They also showed me that when they put their dolls in the front seat, they sank way down in the car.  The seat belts in front were a bit tough to put on as well.<br /><br />My oldest daughter really liked the details in the car and she gave it 4 stars, deducting a star for the broken seatbelt.  My middle daughter was a bit less impressed by the details.  She also cited the broken seatbelt and gave it 3 stars.  My youngest daughter was much less forgiving about the fact the car broke.  She gave the car a 1 star rating.<br /><br />Personally, I will give kudos to the details and the overall sturdiness of the car.  However, I can imagine a parent having to deal with a crying kid if they have the same thing happen to them as we did and having to deal with trying to return the toy and getting a replacement.  Based on other reviews, I think our car breaking is an exception rather than the norm.  However, I cannot change the fact ours broke the first day.  The average rating of my kids would be 2.67 stars.  Factoring in my opinion, I give the item 2 stars.ness of the car.

B00003CXA6|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by a good friend.  I loved it.  Of course I love all of the history of that time in our great country.  It is a movie that I think most people would like.  I am sure glad I got it.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|The first thing I noticed about this app when I downloaded it was that the news feed does not load correctly.  It will only show about a dozen or so posts and then will not let you see anything that was posted previously.  I get WAY more than a dozen posts in my news feed every day, meaning it's impossible to do anything with this Facebook app other than post something of your own.<br />  However, what was by FAR the most upsetting part of this app was its permissions.  I have previewed and download many, many games and all sorts of different apps, but I have never seen one that needed SO MANY PERMISSIONS!  I counted a grand total of 29 of them.  And I was even more appalled by what some of them were!  Look, I understand that Facebook might want to know your contacts so that it can suggest more friends for you, and I'm fine with that.  But come on!  WHY should it be allowed to track your whereabouts and keep track of your GPS location?  WHY is it allowed to monitor what processes on your phone are running at any given time?  It's even allowed to download stuff without even telling you that it's doing so!  Facebook doesn't try to pull ANY of this junk when you use it on a computer!  This app is nothing but a TOTAL INVASION OF YOUR PRIVACY and tries to track everything you do with your phone!  DO NOT install it or you will be sorry that you ever did.  Besides, do you really need to, when you can just use your phone's web browser to view Facebook, where it actually DOES load everything that you want to see, and can't track every single little thing you do with your phone?
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This story has too many common elements of his two previous books.  He needs to get out of his comfort zone and tell a fresh story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy this game it is the best with pocket inv editor pro  I'ma rich<br />And you can build tons of stuff
B004T0XYM8|2.0|I probably shouldn't even post this because Amazon readers tend to give you negative votes when you knock something so popular, but I just gotta say that I was not impressed.<br /><br />Let it be known that I have been into Clint Eastwood long before it became acceptable, before he did Unforgiven.  So I am a fan of Sergio Leone's work with Clint.  And I absolutely love westerns.  That's what made me rent this - another Sergio Leone western.  But man was I disappointed.  It couldn't have been any longer, drawn out slow.  I understand building tension and suspense, but this was annoyingly slow.<br /><br />Perhaps I had too high of hopes.  I don't know.  But I thought hey, I like other Sergio movies.  I love westerns.  I like Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda.  I am a fan of older movies pre-1980.  It goes to figure that I should like this.  But I did not.  I did not like how they purposely drug out every scene to such an unrealistic point.  I did absolutely love the sets.  Never had I seen such realism in set design.  But overall, not my bag.  To be honest, it reminded me an awful lot of \\"No Country For Old Men\\" and \\"Drive\\".  2 other VERY popular movies that I couldn't stand.  Maybe I just lack the artistic gene that allows one to enjoy unrealistic long drawn out scenes created just for the purpose of introducing artificial suspense and drama where there otherwise would be none.  Of course my two favorite westerns of all time, Unforgiven and Josey Wales had alot of long scenes.  Just not marathon length I guess.<br /><br />Either way, this was a stinker for me.  Sorry Leone :-(
0385349947|1.0|Sandberg had everything handed to her and presides over the vile Facebook.  Now she lectures others about how they should succeed without any of the many advantages she had. How narcissistic can one person be.<br />Oh and there is a news story today about how she wants to hire interns for no pay but working full time.  Thats really tells you everything you need to know.  Ugh.  What an awful person.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a great storyteller and while A Thousand Splendid Suns is still my favorite of his, this is a great read.  He really knows how to paint a visual as he writes.  Worth the read!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have never read a book by Card.  with the movie coming out-- and a bargain price on Kindle, I decided to read it.  It grabbed me from page one.  Teens as well as adults would like this book.  Set in a future society where enemy attack is alway&#34;s expected, Ender is a rare Third-- an ëxtra&#34;child born to a family whose society bans more than 2 children.  But Ender very well may have special gifts that might even save humanity.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I choose this rating because the book had a lot of detail and action in the book.<br />I loved everything Rick  Riordan you did it again!.<br />I would recommend this book to someone who loves greek mythology and action pact unpredictable moments that will make you want to keep on reading.
B00BTV62KG|5.0|What can really be said about Sco, words can't begin to describe this man's ability.  Deitch keeps it young and fresh on the drums and Sco brings forth some of the funkiest articulation I've heard on any album this year.  A must have for music lovers.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Engaging, entertaining and informative.  For a first directorial effort, Dave Grohl has what it takes!  As an editor myself, I was impressed and often jealous of the film editor's deft touch in telling the story of the world famous sound studio.  Well done indeed!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is such an interesting show.  Kevin Bacon as usual gives a great performance.  And the performance of the rest of the cast continually keeps me involved.  I am looking forward to the second season
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I found the struggle to establish relationship frustrating but enlightening. The last section on the meaning of the various flowers I found tedious.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|My family and I got together over the weekend and watched the entire series because we could not wait!  It was written, directed, and cast very well.  An awesome series full of physcotic, terrorizing entertainment.  The kind of show that stays with you for days after.  Jessica Lange is just amazing!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The game keeps coming up with new version available from Appstore even after uninstalling it and downloading it. Plus the old version did not complete one of my expansions
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Augustus and Hazel. Hazel and Augustus. I'll make this simple, I'm a twelve- year- old book snob, who feels next to no emotion for the characters, and just moves on to the next after reading a book. This is different. I cried with Mrs. And Mr. Waters, hated Monica with Isaac, laughed with Gus, cried with Hazel after the diagnosis. This is one of the best books I've ever read. If you don't like it, fine. You're allowed to have your wrong opinion. :) My friend has had cancer 2 times, and has a brain tumor right now. I know the pain Hazel's parents felt, because she is like a sister to me. I can relate to so many of the characters in so many ways. Read this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a awesome game. It has real life things to do. Like grow a garden, take care of the sick, and travel.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This is an entertaining movie that combines action adventure with comedy.  It was most fun to watch an actress like Helen Mirren take on a role that is entirely unlike other roles she has had.  Looking for something to watch? Do not hesitate to rent this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The saga continues with even more intrigue. Love the WW1 historical content and the fashions. The characters are maturing and becoming even more endearing.
B0091LS07E|5.0|We were not familiar with Alicia Keys until we saw her on a charity concert and loved her sound and the songs she sang. We went right to amazon.com to order her cd and listen to it often. Very talented lady.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was well written and did not sugar coat thing  for the reader. I would highly recommend this book.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Did not want the 3D, so this was perfedt for me. The second disk was very interesting. Not commentaries like Lord of the Rings. It had a video blog. It talked about the filming, how, when, where and why, and who did what. Very entertaining! LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT INSTALLMENT.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This is NOT a true youtube application.  It is a rip off product using the Youtube logo and taking users to some other weirdo website.  Not recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a brand new product, so it will take some time to get it perfect.<br /><br />The setup is painless, but you need to be connected to the same wifi as the chromecast for it to work.<br /><br />Casting a tab from chrome is imperfect - to make it better, lower the resolution of your screen to match your display.<br /><br />Netflix works fantastically, as does youtube.  I'm looking forward to apps that allow me to stream Plex and/or local content.

B003Y6EL5W|5.0|Oldie by goodie.  Hilarious movie without commercials and all the action as originally intended by the producers, director, and writers.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Amazing how you find yourself cheering for a serial killer.  Have watched since season 1 and the plot continues to be engaging and relatively unpredictable.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love Gregory's ability to follow the history and then add her own believable traits to each character.  I was swept away and couldn wait to read the other books in the series. I learned a lot, and loved the description of life in this era.
B008Y6YCB0|1.0|Boring movie, very slow, hung in there hoping it would get better, but it really never did.  Don't waste your time.  Paltrow is the only good thing about this movie
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|That's my take on it.  It's basically the story of how the wizard ended up in OZ & what happened before Dorthy arrived.  Great acting, great cinematography.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|You find yourself caught up in the personalities and individual life dramas.  Not the best series around but I like it for the fantasy of an underdog slipping into the system and the totally unrealistic fantasy of good coming from our current legal system.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed the story, thought the characters were well developed and it moved right along. SOmewhat similar to other books of it;s type, it was one of the more readable stories.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Love this game, but after I updated a few days ago, and can't play now due to a weird glitch. It's forcing me to update, but there is nothing showing up for an update. I'm confused.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|right from the start i was intrigued. i loved the concept, though i wouldnt want to embrace it myself. the end could have gone in so many directions that i was holding my breath for the last few chapters. definitely left me looking for more.  might be a great series for divergentees.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The combination of action and humor is priceless and unparalleled. An exceptional movie for the genre; it definitely has re-watch-ability.

B0041KBWM0|4.0|This is a nice adaptation of Emma. Some new aspects that are not part a previous versions that help make it distinct.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Having fun playing with my whole family. My two boys love helping me look for the hidden items. It is hard to wait for our energy to restore.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest but the app for kindle is a joke. it will work ok occasionally but a lot of the time it crashes when I want to repin a picture. very frustrating, will probably end up not using anymore and just pinning on laptop instead. a waste of a download.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I choose 5 stars because this book kept my attention like I was actually in the book watching each scene play out.  I loved all the characters and were sad when they didn't make it.  Most books I'm like oh that character I can let go of, but every character besides Bernard made me sad to have them go.  This quickly jumped to my top three books and very well may be number one.  I just started the second half (6,7, and 8) and am very excited to see the last one coming out this month.  I want sure about the book at first but I'mso glad I decided to read it.  If you enjoyed hunger games (one of my favorites) you will enjoy this.  I loved hunger games but the Wool quickly jumped the series quickly jumped to my top favorites.  Give it a chance you won't be sorry you did.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Take this bag hiking all the time with my DSLR Camera. Keeps the sweat out and (so far) has kept it dry from the rain. Did not rain tremendously hard though. Numerous slots to keep extra lenses and a few other pockets to stash other things. Would recommend.
B00DMKFN34|4.0|'Planes' Review. By Owen Zupp<br />Author: [[ASIN:B01HHI04DA Without Precedent: Commando, Fighter Pilot and the true story of Australia's first Purple Heart]]<br /><br />Famous movie franchises can be like famous families. They can benefit from association, but they can also suffer at the hands of unending comparisons. And this may well be the case for 'Planes'.<br /><br />In terms of a movie, 'Cars' was a massive success and taking this tale to the next level was undoubtedly the goal for Disney. In terms of media, marketing and merchandising, transforming 'Cars' into 'Planes' was a relatively straightforward exercise, however, it was a greater leap of faith to transform the movie.<br /><br />Without being a spoiler, the 'Cars' template was overlaid on the 'Planes' concept and then tweaked here and there. The backdrop is once again a race circuit, albeit around the world, and the shifting fortunes play out on a leader board. The central character is not a shiny 'Lightning McQueen', but the little plane that could. Once again, a wise old character tempers the star's impetuosity and there is even a love interest, although it has shifted to a pair of co-stars.<br /><br />There is no escaping the quality of the film's production. The animation, 'camera' angles, settings and colour are all first class. The audience even captures a sense of flight as the aircraft pitch and roll about the big screen. Visually, 'Planes' is captivating.<br /><br />What is missing to some degree is the humour stemming from spontaneity that 'Cars' brought to the table. Achieving this was always going to prove a difficult task given that the first franchise had set a benchmark of great expectations and conjured preconceptions in the minds of the audience. Funnily enough, if a template was being applied, this film may have benefited from employing another 'Mater'. A goofy side-kick providing comic relief right on cue.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed 'Planes', but then again, I couldn't sit more in the centre of Disney's target demographic profile if I tried. I am an aviation enthusiast with a young family. I was always probably going to give this film '5 Stars' as it offers another opportunity to share cherished laughter and common ground with my children. However, the real test for 'Planes' will come from those not so centrally located in Disney's cross-hairs. Can it possibly have the far-reaching impact of the highly successful 'Cars' films? It is a very, very tough act to follow. In the future, 'Planes 2' could actually benefit from being one step removed from the other franchise and build upon its own identity.<br /><br />For me, there is one final acid test for the film. I was lucky enough to see the movie on its opening day in the United States, but I am now keen to see the looks on my own kids' faces when 'Planes' lands here in Australia. Only then will I be able to truly rate the success of 'Planes'. I'll get back to you then...<br /><br />Owen Zupp<br />Author: '50 Tales of Flight' and 'Solo Flight'<br />[[ASIN:B00BKEDNMC 50 Tales of Flight: From Biplanes to Boeings]]<br />[[ASIN:B00HETIJJ4 Solo Flight: One Pilot's Aviation Adventure around Australia]]I am an aviation enthusiast with a young family.

B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This movie was very good twist on Hansel and Gretel. I really enjoyed this movie, I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|loved this book - historical novels are my favorite types of books and this one knocked it out of the park
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. Very addicting. You really have to use your brain and figure it out. It was fantastic.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|i usually can wait for things to come out on the net or telly so it is no problem for the season to complete and then have a marathon watching them all over the week end.  It is Less Expensive this way also than spending 3 months paying for showtime.  Don't care for HBO showtime or the others because they show too many ones that I have already seen or reruns. Or just OLD movies.  The only time I do any of the movie channels is when they give away free 3 months or have a holiday special. I am a baby boomer and do not need that immediate gratification.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|While I can see how some people have complained that the book moves a bit slowly, I find myself appreciating the build-up, particularly towards the end. The entire story involves a number of interrelated mysteries being developed, including the basis and extent of magic powers. In that particular vein at least, I believe this book (and hopefully the series) surpasses Mistborn (which I enjoyed overall, but found a bit bland once the powers lost their new-ness). Looking forward to book #2. YMMV.
0385486804|4.0|This was a re-read. I needed a book for a student I worked with over the summer. I remembered the gist of the story and that it was a good book, but I'd forgotten how good. Krakauer's study of the adventures and demise of Chris McCandles is philosophical, introspective and somewhat autobiographical.<br /><br />Krakauer had written a story for Outdoor Magazine about a young man found dead in Alaska in 1992. The story bothered him because it left the impression that the young man had been a reckless wanderer who fell victim to his own vanity. Krakauer did not think this nor did he intend for his story to be taken this way. Given his own history of searching for himself in outdoor adventures, he re-visited the story and wrote this book.<br /><br />While he could have given a very detailed account of McCandles in a few chapters, Krakauer invests 200+ pages. The book includes contrasting stories of other young men with similar tales. He also uses his own life as parallel and spends a great deal of energy showing details that indicate McCandles was not crazy, a sociopath or even ill prepared for the adventure that took his life. Almost like a lawyer making a case, Krakauer argues in defense of McCandles. Never the less, the evidence can be re-interpreted in light of one's own personal experience. Thus the book is compelling and stimulates an internal dialog that will lead each reader to his or her own conclusion. Excellent book, well worth reading!<br /><br />Sad though fascinating story with lots of interesting background and reflection added. Well worth a read - well worth a re-read!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The yellow-eyed Demon? That Jerk!!!!! Sam and Dean on yet another year of death defying adventures. Even have my mom hooked and sometimes my farmer Dad. Supernatural is a great series for everyone because who hasn't been afraid of something at some point and the boys kill em all!
2061011306|5.0|As soon as we received this my daughter had to put it up. It takes about half the wall in her room but she loves being able to know where each state is and the capitols. We also bought the world map so her walls are pretty much covered with both maps. Now she is asking for a globe! I The quality of the maps are great. and very detailed.
B001CQONKY|5.0|I am a fan of CSI the original show and I have seasons 1-7 so it only seemed sensible to get season 8. Definitely worth the price I pad to receive the whole season.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Without spoiling it, Ill say its a great movie. Not quite what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it, This one would have a place in my collection. Its pretty well balanced; my wife isnt much for Sci Fi and she even liked it a lot. It has story elements for both the men and the women. You do have to pay attention - if you need a drink or step away for a moment, do yourself a favor and pause it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The reviews and product description hit it on the nose on this one.  Great quality and good price for this amazingly quick charger, even when charging two different devices.  If you're in need of a car charger for your droid, iPhone or Pad....look no further, you have just found your solution!!!
B005GIS23I|4.0|I am a gigantic Simon Pegg and Nick Frost fan. To me, Paul is a great movie for people who don't already like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It's not as quirky as their other films, and the influence of America/Hollywood really shows.
1451695195|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what heaven is all about.  It is different from any other heaven book.The end of the book was too technical for me.
0061565407|5.0|A book to help anyone relax while reading, especially if you like canines. Plus it gives you insight into the mindset of a racing professional! It also brings reincarnation as possibly a way to reunite with our lovable pets. Fun, fun look at life from a dog's point of view. 'Move over Rover!'
B00BU987C8|4.0|Good beats...Guest artists are OK. Lamars' rapping excellent, flow moves well with the beats. Overview  would purchase again. Money well spent.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Features are a little slim (commentary by Joss Whedon is fantastic, but I would have loved to hear from the actors, too). But this movie is the best super hero movie available right now. Hits all the right moments of campiness and action, but there is a surprising amount of depth that's teased by dialog between super heroes.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Preview for movie makes it look very suspenseful with dirty secrets that will come out. The actual movie takes forever and then is just over- no excitement or surprises! Reese's part is lame- only a few lines!
B000002GXX|5.0|I got to see them live when Joe Walsh was with them, right after the Hotel California Album. Great Show!!! With the Albums, you get to here the classics they don't play on the radio.
B00EEXST2K|5.0|This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I really can't say anything negative about this movie everything was incredible!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|If you're able to appreciate video games for their artistic ability, you need to get this for Journey alone. It's an excellent piece of art that does a fantastic job of showcasing the things that only video games can do.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Great story, but the ending will have you mad. That is all I am saying!!!!! Boy oh boy, rally, boy oh boy!
B000002GYN|5.0|I got to see them live when Joe Walsh was with them, right after the Hotel California Album. Great Show!!! With the Albums, you get to here the classics they don't play on the radio.
B00190KZUU|4.0|Originally saw this movie because Eddie Vedder wrote the song \\"man of the hour\\". Really enjoyed the story though about a father-son relationship.
1451695195|5.0|It's a fabulous look into heaven and through the eyes of a skeptic turned believer. Dr. Alexanders journey and description was eye opening. A must read!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Great drama and a lot of historical facts. Some dramatic license taken, but overall a much better investment of one's time than the current trash available on network TV!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting and staging is superb for this series.  Although it is based on how things were actually done in those times...it almost seems like fiction or fantasy...how can human beings treat each other so poorly?
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a fascinating book that should be require reading. For anyone interested in bioethics, civil rights, medical research, cancer research, and the sordid history of medicine in the US, you should definitely read the Immortal Life. Thank goodness that Henrietta Lacks can live on not only in the form of her ever-replicating cells, but also in our hearts and minds. Her contributions to science are endless, and her story and that of her family is heartbreaking and inspiring. Thank you, Henrietta and the Lacks family. From, a fellow Marylander
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a great game to have your kids play if they want a horse. I want a horse so I play this game and it is kinda but not quit like having a really horse but really fun to play.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|A fine blend of typical Pet Shop Boys techno, with a touch of the 80's thrown in and a very futuristic sound.<br /><br />GRAMMY MATERIAL!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy to play and oddly addictive. Coins reload but you go through them quickly and it takes a while to stockpile.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Were I issuing a top ten list for the year's best Films (whatever year it may have been) this would certainly be well up on the list, more than likely at #1 position. The film was beautifully structured by the nature of the ballet, its content, music and setting. The reader has the editorial page introduction to give the story so I won't repeat. I've never seen Portman before. She makes wonderful use of her physical attributes in a first rate performance. ( Yes, I understand that there were ballerinas handling the demanding dancing.) The supporting cast served admirably to complement Portman, who gives every signal of being an acting star of the future.<br />It does help the viewer if he/she understands that ballet is the most demanding of public physical performances, outstripping any sport by a good deal. As the voice is for an opera singer, a source of constant anxiety, since psycho-physical  conditions may prevent one's continuing at any time, prior to or during the onstage performance,  so, too, the body is for the ballerina.  The film is admirable in communicating the nature of the stress of being as near perfect as possible on stage each time, not just once before the camera, repeating as many times as necessary to get it right (as is the task in making a movie).<br />Obviously, I commend the movie to any viewer who wants a serious experience; if, you are not in the mood, as I have often been , just put this off until you are ready. It is one of the very good ones.
B0014R34A6|5.0|Great to entertain my grand daughter when I have time with her. She likes to use her imagination to use this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever then buy blocklauncher pro and play minecraft with mods skins and texture packs. And it lets you play realms earlier.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I would like this game more if i could actually update it. And they need  to fix the calibration on the **** building tapping.
B005MMZ63C|4.0|... but I still don't get it's deeper message that put this movie at the top of the 100 best of all time
B007WFR0QS|5.0|The album  was what I expected and I listen to it as much as I can.  When it was delivered to me,  It was in good condition.
0316077054|5.0|Love the continued storyline and unfolding characters and their history. I like having all the books so that I can read them one after the other.
0440237688|5.0|great book!  I love how in the end jonas saves gabriel from release I so all in all it is good and likeable book
B000L53D4O|5.0|This is a great push toy. My daughter was already pulling up when we got it, and it was not too light for her to get up and push it around.  The spinning toys on the front are fun for her, too; she really enjoys spinning the ball and little flaps.  She uses it every day, even after learning to walk independently - it helps her get across big distances very quickly.  It is light enough that she is able to reposition it to move where she wants it to go, but it has never fallen on her, even on our laminate flooring.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|love this show, watched the first 3 seasons recently and now I cannot wait for the next.. what will happen to Lady Mary?<br />will miss Matthew though.. this is a well done and addictive show. love, love , love it.
B009MF56GC|5.0|If you combined all the action in every movie these actors have been in, i don't think it would come close to the action in the movie.  Its non-stop explosions and shooting, the perfect guy movie.<br /><br />The special features are pretty cool too, they show you all the guns used in the movie with a brief history of them.<br /><br />can't wait to see what Expendables 3 will be like.
B00530FC6O|5.0|I recommend that everyone take a minute to read this book series and lighten up. Timeless comedy and excellent storytelling = a great read.
1781162646|2.0|I doubt it. It's clear King could write stories like this in his sleep. I'm beginning to wonder if he's started to.<br /><br />It's a second-rate ghost story with a \\"climactic\\" ending you can see coming all the way down a Carolina beach. Or maybe it's a coming-of-age story. In which case it's still not interesting. The cheesy dialog, which is kind of King's trademark, makes it difficult to take seriously as a character-driven novel. Because people don't, and never have, talked that way. Even in the 70s. Is it a crime novel? There's no investigation. Someone just shows up with a folder full of evidence.<br /><br />If you're looking for a coming-of-age story with a supernatural twist, there's much better fare out there. Try Neil Gaiman's \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\". That one deserves four stars, maybe five.
0307271080|5.0|When this sprawling novel opens, Ifemelu is on the verge of returning home to Nigeria for the first time in 15 years, and has gone off to have her hair braided at a small salon in the depths of Trenton. (Hair -- natural, relaxed, braided or otherwise styled plays a big role in this novel, and stands in for lots of other stuff.) As the young Aisha works away at her hair -- with Ifem snapping at her not to make the braids too tight -- she takes the reader back in time, to her life in Nigeria and her love for Obinze. Both Ifemelu and Obinze are now success stories, but separately: Ifem has become a prominent blogger, writing about race as a \\"Non-American Black\\" for her American audience and winning a fellowship at Princeton; Obinze, after failing to make headway in Britain, has ended up finding a way to play the game back in Nigeria and has acquired wealth, a beautiful wife and a daughter.<br /><br />How did this couple -- apparently destined for each other -- grow apart? What has led them to the current state in which Ifem has decided to return home, while Obinze clearly still hankers after her? And what happens next? It's a familiar enough formula to anyone who reads novels, with the characters, settings and situations being what makes it particularly compelling. When Ifem arrives in the United States, she is clearly not the kind of foreigner with whom Americans are comfortable: she speaks perfect English, and she is black. Suddenly, she says, she discovers the importance of race for the first time. (Obinze's parallel experiences in England, occupying only a small section of the book, offer a comparison and a contrast.) Even when she has established herself both personally and professionally, she is still bemused by American attitudes. At one gathering, she muses about her companions (of all races and backgrounds),\\"were they serious, these people who were so enraged about imported vegetables that ripened in trucks?\\" And yet, she may discover the same kind of sense of displacement and disconnection on her return to Nigerian, where she will end up with the label of \\"Americanah\\" as a long-term expatriate.<br /><br />It is that theme of being an expatriate and ending up with a kind of rootless and individual identity in a globalizing world, that interested me most about this novel (along with the almost unbelievably beautiful writing). In other areas, however, the author strives too hard to make her points, over and over again. This is seen in small matters, as well as large ones. At one point in the narrative, Ifem meets a man named Fred, who clearly is interested in her. In the space of two or three pages, the reader learns this over and over again. He \\"just wanted to talk to her.\\" He was \\"speaking a little too loudly\\" to attract her attention. \\"He was looking at her, soliciting her agreement with his eyes.\\" Or else, he \\"laughed, too heartily, to let her know he was on her side.\\" I felt like screaming, enough already, I get the point! And the same is true of the bigger issues that Adichie is dealing with in the novel, most particularly with race. She clearly has an opinion about how Americans try to deny the importance of race, 150 years after the Civil War and 45 years after civil rights legislation, and views with disdain the attempt to deny the fact that racism exists as racism by trying to reclassify it as a matter of class, education, etc. Ifemelu makes this point in most of the two dozen or so blog posts of hers that the author includes; in discussions with friends; in her own thinking. In other words, over the space of about 150 pages, the reader hears one example or another of why this is the case several dozen times, to the point where I started to wonder whether I was reading a polemic or a novel. It's well written and eloquent, but to me it felt like overkill. Which, in the eyes of this character, probably would be because I'm white and not African American and thus subject to what she calls \\"white privilege\\"? True, but it doesn't help make the book a tightly-written narrative. Again, I felt like hollering, I get it. Tell me this if it's important to the plot, but not for the sake of telling me.<br /><br />Overall, this novel is a wonderful book, impossible to put down, even if the final few dozen pages felt like too neat and tidy a conclusion given all that had gone before. (Hard to say more while still avoiding spoilers.) Read this, by all means: it's a fabulous tale of what it means to be a global nomad in the early years of the 21st century, to be part of a country that, as Obinze notes, can only look forward and not backward to its past the way those of us in North America now have the luxury of doing. Above all, it's beautifully written and memorable.t it doesn't help make the book a tightly-written narrative. Again, I felt like hollering, I get it.

B009PK9SB8|4.0|I like the ability to see the picture live.  Recognize it is a small camera and a small screen so don't look for details.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I found this book so much fun. I can imagine this book has captured the imagination of young boys of several generations. I enjoyed it very much... read it!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I've been a fan of Dan Brown for quite sometime. This book doesn't fainter either. It keeps you captivated and almost do t want to put it down. I love the character of Robert Langdon. If you like angels and demons, and the Da Vinci code this book is a must read.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|One of the better chick flicks ever. It is a great story and a lot of yelling at the screen because of dramatic irony.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great time killer! Love playing this game. Pla.y on a daily basis. Wish there were more instructions on different levels
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Kung fu panda has a good story line. This is a great movie for my little boy. Came in great condition
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I've been a fan of Kanye since College dropout.  When trying to convince my wife to go to Essence Music Festival so I could see Kanye, I even pulled the &#34;Well, we could get married while we're there&#34; card (we were engaged at that point, and yes, it worked!)  I've followed his music career closely (I couldn't care less about his personal life) and this album just doesn't do it for me.  I'm not just bashing on him like many here because they think he's a pompous idiot, I genuinely just don't like the album.<br /><br />Musically it's all over the place.  Too many of the songs start out well, then deliberately and abruptly interrupt themselves with what sounds like another song, then jump back to the original beat.  The over-use of his own screaming is equally unimpressive.  The one track I will actually go back to is buried at the end of the album. &#34;Bound 2&#34; is a pretty good song which, also unfortunately interrupts itself, but is still listenable.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&#34; and it is in regular rotation on my iPod.  That whole album was amazing top to bottom.  The &#34;Watch the Throne&#34; collaboration with Jay-Z didn't do it for me, &#34;GOOD Music: Cruel Summer&#34; was a giant waste of money, and this CD has further disinterested me from Kanye.  Stop trying to be so &#34;creative&#34; and put out some amazing albums again...
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love how the book is written from the the husbands and wife's perspective.  Loved the twists and turns.  Great book :)
B00BEXB18M|3.0|Nothing new here, kinda figured Endgame would be the best release in recent years.  The first track sounds like something that could have been off of MD45 The Craving with its punk-like sound. Track 2 - Supercollider reminds me of Janes Addiction's \\"Just Because\\" (go ahead, check it out - I'm not crazy).  All in all, there's a couple of good songs here, but really a lackluster effort on Dave's part, and I have been a fan since the 80's...
B002ZG983M|5.0|great movie. My whole family loved it. It was funny and made me think how cool it would be to be a superhero
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching Suits season three in 2013, I saw that Amazon Prime had seasons one and two, so I went back and caught up. The show is written incredibly well and the writers did an awesome job developing the cast and personalities. I feel like I know these people, and it's not just some TV-show. I have to give season one five stars.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|When you want to look at an exciting movie, this would be the one to choose.  We watch it often.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Alright - I stopped listening to Queensryche after DeGarmo left, but based on the exciting reviews here (and the whole Tate-ryche versus QueensRockenfeld thing), I had to pick this one up.  To say they've returned to full form is a bit of a stretch, because I feel personally that it could be heavier in the guitar area.  There are some good songs here, though, and am thankful they have continued the metal they helped forge in the 80's and early 90's.  The vocals are really good throughout, with the exception of some auto-tune I think I heard in one of the choruses...hard to say, because my truck's stereo picks up different nuances than my home stereo, etc. Overall, a Queensryche fan shouldnt be disappointed with this, in what I'd call a follow up to Empire or PL. The two bonus tracks live - Queen of the Reich and En Force, won't do anybody much good either, but am glad Le Torre doesnt shy away from the screams that Tate cant do anymore.
B000AY74OG|5.0|This movie is great. it had some laughs and dancing. Really fun movie. Glad I got it i like it
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I love and admire Kevin Spacey. In this role, he is deliciously Machiavellian. I had to purchase the season after repeat viewing on Netflix. I cannot wait for the next season. While I did enjoy the original House of Cards (U.K.), as an American I can relate more to this version. This is must-have in anyone's video library.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Loved the first one.  This one was just as good.  Usually a sequel fall off the mark, but this was just continued with the drama and serious fight scenes.  Can't believe how mature in age all these guy are and they continue to bring on the big screen.
193700788X|1.0|I looked over the reviews before downloading this book and saw the large amount of negative feedback BUT I JUST HAD TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.  It took me the longest time to read this book over any of the other sookie books.  After I finished I of course took to the internet to read what everyone else had said.  And wow, they were right.  Totally spot on with how I was feeling.  But then I read a review about Charlaine calling us entitled readers and that's why we didn't enjoy this last book.  OH HELL NO!  It's one thing to feel disappointmnet in an ending, it's another to be talked down to like I'm a two year old who didn't get candy.  Not only am I sad with how this series ended, but now I'm pissed I ever spent money in supporting this woman.  Sad to see the characters go but I'll find another series, you're not that special.
B002PXKWQ2|5.0|ok so after years of rock n roll rockabelly and numerous otherforms of music i found this album on 33 record at a store closing down paid a hole buck for it gotr out my old turn table put it on wow so different from i have listen to i think much better than early key board music i believe this is total synisize music i love it
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is a fantastic package.  I have been a fan of The Sound of Music since it hit the theatres when I was a child.  This is a great collector's item!
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|The movie is an interesting story with cool visual eye candy but 3d is not very prevalent. Honestly just rent the blu-ray from Redbox, not a movie u would watch over and over in my opinion.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|No more yo-yo! This thing flat-out works! Tim Ferris, thank you. Headed to the best shape since my early 20's!
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Ill be brief with this one. I tend to drone on in these reviews. The bottom line is that none of the characters psyches or stories said anything interesting about the human condition or brought up any socio-political plight. It's a pretty stale movie and there will be no sequel. They win in the end. Sorry there was no spoiler alert. Be fore-warned that the only reason you should watch this movie is because you like loud noises, pretty lights or have a crush on one of the actors or actresses.
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|the story was hard to follow till the end you finally understood the story and there was action in the ending
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|this movie was good. not as good as the others but good. probably should have come out with this first
B00B7Y0206|5.0|im glad we have it cuz without it I wouldn't know how to play and videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! q1QQQQQQQQQQQ  wq wwww
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|this game stinks it takes up to much space and op people kill u every 5 seconds! everyone lies cuz its soooo fun but no just do not get it!!<br />plus when u delete it it saves 594 mb of junk on ur divice!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is a great show, I like the actors and the roles they play.  I will continue to watch and am hooked on this show!
B009WUBERW|4.0|Good action video.<br /> it has an all star cast even if some are past their prime for this type of action film.<br />Glad I got it
B001UV4XUG|5.0|It is smart and funny. I liked it. But, it is not like a watch it a thousand times a week kind of movie.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I feel that this movie was a good representation of the mob way of life for the individuals that where involved during that time.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Enjoyed second season as much as I enjoyed the first season.  I am completely hooked on this show!  Like the supporting actors as well as the stars!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|One of the best series out there.<br />Anxiously waiting for season 4 to begin.<br />Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses
B004LQEYAG|5.0|Best western ever made.  Miss Newman a lot and the old Redford too.  Will order more old stuff soon. Jane
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Probably the most fun I have had at a movie since Star Wars and E.T. Yes, I'm a grown man, and I was giddy like a little kid all the way through this film. Great stuff!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fast to load for the great graphics it has. Fun and engaging. Well done! Minimal ads and it advances nicely without being forced to pay to get to the next level
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm not big on playing games but I really like this one plus the minions are cool. I want a minion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|BEST GAME EVER MADE !!!!!<br />I just started today and from 11 place I went to 5..<br />TOTALLY RECOMENDED.....<br />&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br />It is so much fun<br />You never get bored it combines the 2 movies together ..<br />Talking about movies they are the coolest movies I have ever seen
1455526959|5.0|Well written and captivating in the same manner as all of Mr. Connelly's Harry Bosch novels.  Having come to know the author and the character after some 20 novels, this one was particularly poignent after reading Mr. Connelly's intro and discussion of the circumstances of this book that he published on his web site.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|this game has very nice graphics..plays well on my kindle fire..However I would give it a higher rating if the play was more difficult
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I have to say that this is the best BSB CD that I have heard!! Now, that Kevin is back with the group, their voices blend together wonderfully!! Go out and buy this album!!!
B00BOLFRKW|4.0|Definitely kept me interested the whole time. I was a little skeptical when I saw it was 2 1/2 hours but the movie definitely put a human side to the sixteenth president. This movie is mostly about the 13th amendment and Lincoln's role in that process. It is not a story about the man's entire life. I would recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I am unable to update. I am on level 40 and have been playing for almost four weeks straight and do not want to lose my progress. Please help. Also, why am I not able to go to my friends farm on a kindle fire (I do not have the HD version).
B004GYY714|3.0|I think its a pretty cool tool and love the idea of streaming radio from around the world.  However, within the first 24 hours a station I enjoyed  listening to will no longer stream.  Why? No explanation either.  I like my apps to be reliable, also known as bulletproof.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|These are all his greatest hits and I have enjoyed this CD immensely!! If you are a big MJ fan or even If you are not, this is a GREAT album!!!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Oblivion is what science fiction should be.  It is about an idea not about action.  It is a story that makes you think.  Spoiler alert: We never see the aliens.<br /><br />The mystery  and discovery aspect of the story makes it easy to ignore that water is about most abundant compound in the known universe, so there is no need for aliens to take it from our planet. But the nice thing is that is not important.  It is just a tool being used to tell the rest of  a far more interesting story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The prose, the descriptive elegant writing style, the cultural insight, the humanism, the emotive expression, what more can I convey!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|If you haven't fallen head over heels for these guys by now you will never. Great game!! Get this app!
B00CIH371W|5.0|Inge-Lise Goss weaves a subtle story of love and identity lost and found within the intrigue of underworld crime and justice with an interesting twist. The combination leaves the reader staggering between realities and breathlessly pondering the identities of the antagonists and heroes in this action-packed journey of discovery and transformation.
B002413TY2|5.0|Like the 2 predecessors in this series this is a fun movie.  The stunts are not as outrageous, over the top as in Transporter 2.  Only one defies belief.  I have enjoyed this series because it has the right mix of story, action and humor.  The fights don't go on forever as is sometimes the case in this genre.  I think the series has a little more intelligence than many action films and that makes it more fun.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of the best New authors I have found in some time.  Masterfully, tells a story with twists, turns, and emotion.
1781162646|3.0|Not one of Stephen King's best, but some what entertaining. The story was pretty predictable, but I am a Stephen King fan so I can only rate it fair.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I give thanks to the Amazon Troubleshooting group in trying to help me resolve the issues of my  2-yr old Kindle Fire's battery issues.  I did not expect to receive the cable the PowerFast for Accelated Charging cord to be sent free, as it was, with free shipping as well.  I am hoping that this solves the problem..I have received the products and am giving my unit sometime to charge up before I check to see if the power cords solve the problem.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Keeps you from having to go into settings to see the status of your battery.  Simple one touch (well you do have open the app, so I guess that's really two touch).
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love it. It easy to do and the best thing is i can hear in everywhere. I will use amazon is very secure too.
0812982622|3.0|The story was a little far fetched to me, it remined me of the propaganda we used to hear about Russia when I was in high school but more so. I thought it was really boring, I couldn't wait till it ended.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A fabulous storyteller! Each page is filled with surprise twists. Hated for it to end, can't wait for the movie!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Having grown up on the Mississippi River in east Arkansas, we recognized much of the scenery and found the story credible.  Some of the characters were surprising similar to folks we knew.  Good plot.

B007RCJNDE|4.0|Well, read the previous 13 books, so regardless of the reviews on MoL, I would have read it, but a bit predictable but overall for the serious as a whole it was a jetsetter and even if the plot was lost and no pace at all in the mid-to-later books, it came to an end and gave a sufficient ending to the story.
1608871827|5.0|Definitely a worthy buy if you loved the movie, this book has tons of additional information and gorgeous reference drawings (as well as pull outs and STICKERS).
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This movie was entertaining with good special effects.  However, some of the story scenario was a little difficult to understand.  Provoked a little discussion between friends trying to clarify what happened in the movie.
B00DULWFZE|4.0|I'm a BSB fan from the late 90s and have felt that some of their recent albums have been pretty sub-par.  But this one I like!  A fresh sound, great harmonies but still keeping that good old Backstreet Boys flavor I was crazy about as a teeny-bopper!
0743277708|3.0|I went out on a limb based on a few recommendations and decided to read a book about...rabbits. The concept was different than my usual tastes in books but overall it was interesting. The author humanized rabbits without removing the rabbits from their environment. In other words, the rabbits talked and engaged in dialog concerning rabbit matters as if rabbits had the capacity to reason and act like humans within dynamic social setting. In many ways I found this to be an allegorical tale similar to Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt or possibly incorporating a leading rabbit with traits similar to a charismatic and humble leader like Christ. I,at times, perceived themes that resembled the American Revolutionary era. In addition their were evil rabbit characters that resembled Stalin and the politburo ruling over a Soviet styled rabbit police state or warren where power for power's sake was their obsession.<br /><br />The story was interesting and the writing elegant but somewhat tiresome at times. I couldn't help but feel the nearly 500 page story could have been trimmed by 100 or more pages without detracting from the story. If you can make it through the first half it does take off and doesn't disappoint.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for kids. And for adults too. Love the movie and you did you will surely enjoy this game.
B00847KFDS|5.0|My husband loves the familiar songs he sings with the other singers. I finally took it out of our car  :D
B008JFUO36|5.0|Due to the meds I have to take, I actually fell asleep a little when this first cam out at the theaters.  Plus I am a little deaf so I can now use the CC on the film  thank you for the fast delivery and the pre-order ability .
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I also have this game on my Droid and enjoy it on both. I find it challenging and it is worth the cost.
0425266060|5.0|Held my interest during all three books, very hard to put down the books.........loved them can't wait for the next book in this series.  Sylvia Day is an excellent writer, she knows how to capture the reader and paint a story with the words!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I have both the FitBit Flex and the Withings Pulse.  Withings has a lot more expansion possibilities.  The device works great so far.
B005PK55BE|4.0|Okay this is better. I enjoy courtroom drama movies and TV shows. Season one of The Good Wife was good enough that I suggested my wife and I might watch it together. She usually likes murder mysteries. But season two changed my mind and I suggested to my wife that the program had taken a negative turn and I'd continue to watch it on my own.<br /><br />What I saw in season two was way too much back stabbing, shifty dialog, and untrustworthy people. All believable but not what I want to watch. The legal firm also was fixated on it's monetary problems, laying people off, and accepting new members into the firm solely for the money they could bring in regardless of their ethics. Season three is a refreshing departure.<br /><br />Season three seems to have much smarter writing. A big step back in all of the office politics, and more focus on cases. I'm only 1/2 way through the season but enjoying it very much.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This was a rather dull movie until the last 30 min.  Love the actors but was not what I thought it would be.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this re-imagined take on a classic. The scripting and the acting are spot on. Plus, I love how long the episodes are. Each one is a movie giving them time to truly develop the story into something amazing.
1452126577|4.0|This is a cute book with pictures, puzzles and word games.<br /><br />The pictures and stories are primarily focused around Internet Meme, Grumpy Cat, and her advice on being grumpy.<br /><br />Almost all content is suitable for all age groups.<br /><br />Overall, a cute fun read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love every single chapter of walking dead. I think it was very slow at the begging, lot of talking and less of action but a lot unexpected thing happened ! Can wait for season 4 !
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved everything about it. Simply favorite movie ever. My husband likes shoot email up action movies and he watched Bridesmaods with me so we watche this. Honestly- I went to bed 1/2 way through it and he watched alone n
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I can't even say how bad this is in words... I mean it looked bad, I heard it was bad, but I still gave it a shot due to G.I. Joe love. Big mistake. I enjoyed the Rock, the guy who played Falcon and that was about it...
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This movie is the best of the series, it's action packed with huge stars and I loved every minute of it
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I am older and was having fun.  Never get credit for homework.  Never get credit for special weekend/special fish,  even when completing tasks twice.  How annoying.  Tried buying pearls.  Took money but nothing.  Thanks Amazon for refund.  Keep trying to buy but get no credit card in file.  Guess I should be glad.  Just deleted my reef and all my many many hours if hard work.  Bite me..
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great Bingo game.  I've been playing it since June and I think I am actually addicted to it.  Even though it's free it's worth the time to download.
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|Firstly, I must point out that for the people who want more magical creatures in that are in Harry Potter:JK Rowling wrote this after the fourth book. It is likely that she did not think of the thestrals when writing this book, as the thestrals appear later in the series! Other than that, I read this book at least ten times and I laughed harder each time I readthe notes made by Harry Potter and co. It is funny, imaginative, and informative; in other words, a must read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I tried to go to the app's website and see if I could find any help or support. Very dull, useless and uninformative website. Wasted 45 minutes for this crap.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series! Am totally obsessed with it! Cant wait for next season 4! I love that there are no commercials with instant video!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The update ruined my best and favorite game.  I am so upset please fix because now it is telling me too update again.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This is the sweetest story of the love between a mama and her sweet babies. Having a son myself it really touches my heart. I read it to him as a baby continuously and I have now been able to share it with my beautiful daughter.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|Elysium as a movie sucked, and it was very predictable. The movie has some good visuals but other than that, the plot and the acting could have been a lot better. Elysium is a movie that should have gone straight to video for that matter, I wouldn't waist a trip to the theater to watch it, but I will buy it on Blu ray for a low price of 20.00 dollars and under if I haven't watched the movie and wanted to view it/own it.
B009GEN0JO|4.0|It was nice to see an oldie again. Back when the special affects were do cheesy. But no CGI. Loved it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game until it had a required update. Well it updated...now I cant open the game at all. All it does is tell me to update in app store and app store takes me back to the game that says update. Cant play it at all now.
B000GY729M|5.0|I wanted a 2nd Killers album after getting my first.  Although the &#34;good&#34; songs on this one arent as catchy as those on the first, they grow on you.  Songs 5 and 6 are my favorite.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Great story line written in the true Grisham style of writing. Good read and worthy of 4 stars. Quick read.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is definitely the type of book that is fast-paced, intriguing, and will keep you on the edge of your seat! It's quite reminiscent of the Hunger Games, but more mysterious. Readers will fall in love with the characters, sympathize, and connect. Definitely worth the read, and I wi ll most definitely continue on with the series!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down and was so upset that it had to end!  It's definitely something I'd recommend to mystery novel readers.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|My husband and I became addicted to the show by watching just one episode of the 4th season on TV. It's a pretty good series.
B00821OX98|4.0|I was surprised by this one. I thought it would be another tired, sad aliens-take-over-the earth plot. Nope, it's fresh and Noah Wylie has really matured as an actor.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|When one watches this movie they should be prepared to Laugh and laugh hard it was very up lifting and enjoyable.  I hadn't laughed like this in a long time felt very good.
0307346617|3.0|Okay, I know I'm going to look like the illiterate person who doesn't know a good book from a toilet seat cover.  I know it's made up of many different little stories (in the form of interviews), but I am just having a really hard time finishing it.  I was advised from friends to just skip the stories that weren't exciting, as they did.  I feel like I can't do that since it wouldn't be reading the complete book!  I do have to say that there were some stories that were REALLY good, but many of the other stories make it hard to finish.
B008D37SGU|5.0|A marvelous film , start to finish, with an extraordinarily poignant music score. Wonderful acting. .Beautifully sensitive filming. A total gem ! . Bravo to all involved.
0898159156|4.0|This is a pretty good reference book for anyone looking to keep carnivorous plants, and would make a good introductory text for anyone looking to get into the hobby.  My only complaint is that there's not much information on lighting for those who wish to try indoor growing.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|From the first sentence I was laughing. Love that first 4 minutes and the rest of the movie. I can sit down anytime and watch parts or all of it.  Always amusing.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|I thought with Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon it would be a good movie.  Poor plot.  SLOW and not much substance.  Hard to understand at times.
B009XTF8JM|1.0|A very boring, uninteresting version of something seen a million times better by movies with less budget. I can't understand good ratings on a movie that pulled out of all it's scares to maintain a tame rating. Don't get me wrong a good horror/scary movie doesn't need to be rated r for it to be a good movie but the slow burn possession didn't make sense on a subject everyone knew the outcome to. With the sensitive subject matter such as demonic possession it should at least do the genre justice. A run of the mill get any audience in the theater type movie regardless of age is becoming the formula for these type of movies. Rather than substance or a core audience it requires no after thought or thought at all everything is spelled out and dumbed down for a general audience for the sake of easy ticket sales. Now I love a good absent minded, fun movie romp but this movie took itself to seriously to be enjoyable. As I didn't care to much for The Rite with Anthony Hopkins it still left a better taste in my mouth in comparison. Used copies of this movie are selling for $2.00 on here if your going to get it don't pay more than what its worth.
1451696191|2.0|It is like watching Glee without the songs and choreography.  It gives a good sense of the current social milieu high schoolers are growing up in.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|This show is great for the whole family.  With no talking, you have to pay attention, but it easily sucks you in and keeps you laughing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game its so fun its the best game ever!!!!! diamond's are awesome and gold weapons blow<br /> coal makes torches. iron is good red stone Sucks!!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I've seen the movie Firefly and really liked it but the show is fantastic!  Can't believe this show got cancelled.
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|I was bored to death the entire time. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to catch ones attention.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|fun to kill time while waiting for the kids to get out of school in the afternoon. I really enjoy playing. this game.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|If you use it to edit your photo it will stop and your device will give you message that the apps is stop. hence it is waste of money.......
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I haven't read the books but heard so much about the show.  I started GOT as a complete newbie and was hooked after one episode.  Since there are so many reviews of this show I'm sure no one will read mine, but would just like to give props to everyone involved with GOT.  It's definitely earned the 5 stars.<br /><br />One great help in following the story is the geniology and map that comes with this DVD set.  The Entertainment Weekly show summaries are also good to figure out parts of the episodes that you may have missed or didn't catch the first time around.  I've just ordered season two!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Again pleased on kindle's services,<br />Game in awesome, kids very happy<br />proud of product and soft!<br />Regards from far south<br />Alfredo Herrero Buenos Aires
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie made me cry it is an incredible story and a true miracle that an entire family could survive and then all be reunited in the end. The water scenes were great and the three little boys were incredible.
0449011909|5.0|so much more than the movies. I listen to the disks while I am driving or getting ready, it is so much easier than reading.
B00008CMR6|5.0|Exactly what it was supposed to be and got it fast! My grandma was so happy.  I couldn't have asked for better service.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I've been worried because I could see my work but couldn't write on it.<br />Friend said, look market for kindle, and finally found it, my work-life got lot better.<br />Very happy now about selecting Kindle Fire Hd as my hand working tool.<br />Congrats for your service!,<br />I will recomend everybody this solution.<br />Regards from far south<br />Alfredo Herrero, Buenos Aires
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good cinematography, really loved the house<br />A lot of action<br />If you like Science Fiction you will like this movie
B001NLKSI4|5.0|Both of Belfort's books are truly entertaining and offer insight into the life of an amazing and almost unbelievable young life.
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|I recommend it, great message.  It's a good movie for a family night due to its positive message.  Dustin Hoffman did a great job, I liked his hair, lol.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Fresh, on your toes story lines, great characters and never a dull moment. I highly recommend adding NCIS to you viewing pleasures....Crime Drama at it's best
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun. I wasn't expecting much, but it would've been worth far more than the mere $ .99 I paid!
B00634GHJA|3.0|the app is easy enough to use, but the result is so tiny, I can't get a good view.  good thing it was free.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so amazing I've been playing for three months now and I am on level 73 I love this game a lot
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The story is a little hard to follow, even though its predictable.  Either the story was meant to confuse or the editing left out details that could enhance the story line...As it stood, you have to dream up motives as Cruise seems to act as if he is alone in the movie...(big surprise, huh?) Anyway, its an OK mind number, for a rainy evening...as long as you don't think about it...
B008MM9630|5.0|I think this game is very cool . It's also super fun . I recommend this to everyone who enjoys mystical things.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I use to love this game till it told me that a new version of this game is available go to app store to update. The only problem is it won't let me get the updates and the game won't work till I update. Also the last time I had to update the game it erased all my progress and I had to start all over
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Have not been as pleased with a CD purchase in many years!  I have always been a true Vince Gill fan since the late 70's at Blue Grass Festivals.  I've also been very lucky to see him and Paul play with the Time Jumpers a few times.  But... I was not prepared for Bakersfield!  \\"Together Again\\" is makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up Ahhhmazing! LOVE \\"And I Do\\".  The pedal steel guitar is the best!  NOW if other artists would follow suit and get back to REAL country!
B007SGM084|4.0|she needs to keep writing:) I had fun trying to imagine what she felt. Thanks for letting it be so easy to buy.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Not as good as Toy Story (1 2 3) or Monsters, Inc. More likeable/varied characters in the other films I just mentioned. No real tear jerking moments.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Like &#34;the Mist&#34;, it almost seems that he's in a take-no-prisoners mode, out to do some real psychic damage.  Loved every minute of it.  Don't dare spoil it for anyone else.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|The book is much better than the movie because the movie pays more attention to Jennifer Lawrence than it does to the story. The story in the book is deep and presents a clear picture of a mentally disturbed person.  The movie just touches the surface of the story.  It is a good movie, but it is not the book which is way better.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This game helps to teach toddlers how to comb their own hairand makeit very interesting for them to design theier hairstyles
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has a way with history.  This second book of his series is even better than the first, which was wonderful.  His overview of our world is thought provoking and enlightening.  He makes his characters so real to us we feel as though we are living their times with them.  My only regret is that I have to wait for next year to read the next one!!  Hurry, Ken!!  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially history teachers!!  Bring these times alive to your students!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I've had to restart this once already now it keeps saying there's a new version I got it and it still want let me play and I play this ever day they need to fix this problem I no others that have the same issue I give it no stars if they don't fix this also they need to make it were all building turn and line up with the road like the barbra shop it don't line up u cant put a road around it.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|Some of the actors are perfectly cast into their roles as younger Star Trek characters, however, Chris Pine is NOT Kirk.  Given that Pine's eyes are absolutely the wrong color and he just doesn't have Kirk's personality, he just doesn't speak to me as Kirk. I had to keep reminding myself that this person was a young Kirk.  I had no problem with knowing who Spock was or Bones or Sulu, but I did have difficulty with the other characters which took away from my enjoyment of the movie.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This game on kindle is different from the game on my phone. There have been no updates so far on kindle. Love the game but please update.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|The app is rather solid overall, It does suffer from a little bit of lag, but aside from that it ruins smoothly. Classic Uno game and fun to play. I agree with other reviewers in saying that In Game purchases really do ruin the game because it gives players unfair advantages. If anything they should have 2 separate games - One with in-game purchases and one without. That way it's at least fair for everyone who is playing.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I wanted to see this concert but did not want to pay the $250 a seat our local venue was charging.  This was the next best thing and the price was right. The Boys still sound great but this is only a selection of songs from the concert and not the entire concert. So if you missed it and want to see a portion of it, this is the way. The sound is good and the songs are the best.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|fun game. a little bit slow moving though. I prefer games that move along rather than a rarely straight forward seek and find game.
1567184855|5.0|With its sequel, Destiny of Souls, this volume provided information that changed my view of the meaning of life.  The understanding Dr. Newton's work gave me filled me with wonder, joy and hope.  Everyone should read this.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|Pretty much impossible to control the car, Even the lightest tap will rear it far to the left or right and it pretty much ruins the game. The graphics are weak, Pointless game-play and involves you playing the same track over and over again for coins in order to buy better vehicles. There is a reason why it's free...very disappointing.
B00CF0ETBE|4.0|Musically, this is a straight reissue of the Crosby Stills and Nash box set that was originally issued in 1991 and which went out of print two years ago, in August of 2011. The difference between that issue and this one is that the current reissue comes in a small CD brick and does not include the nice LP sized booklet that came with the original issue. The mastering has not been changed, so if only the music matters to you, this set is as good as the previous one.<br /><br />Breaking things down into bullet points:<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />Half the cost of the original issue. The original box was sold at discount at between 60 and 64 dollars. This current box sells at discount for roughly half that.<br /><br />Space saver. This box takes the space of roughly 3 regular sized CDs in jewel cases. The original box took the space of a small stack of vinyl LPs.<br /><br />Push:<br /><br />Same songs, same mastering. Nothing changes.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />This set doesn't include the LP sized deluxe booklet that accompanied the music.<br /><br />If you're a collector or a big fan who like tactile materials, you will want the older issue. If all you care about is the music, then this reissue will suit you just fine.
1401923127|5.0|VERY interesting book. I keep reading little bits and pieces of it and I never tire of it. Highly recommend!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Considering I've been a Metal Gear Solid fan since it came out in 1997, I've had a ton of fun with it. All these games for only $50, you can't go wrong. I highly recommend this to any Metal Gear fan!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this addictive, unique, fun game.  I like running over the little minions..... the different outfits....the huge minion that smashes everything...
030758836X|2.0|Thriller eh?  Don't thrillers have tense storylines, dramatic twists and turns, characters you love to hate and hate to admire, funny moments to offset the unbearable tension, a point?  Gone Girl has none of these.  The writing is bearable, if dreadfully laboured and self conscious, but most tellingly, each of the narrators has Flynn's voice, not their own. The storyline is almost funny it's so ridiculous - what was that Ozark trip for? The twists and turns are more due to making up the route as she goes along rather than having thought through the journey and actually being able to read a map.  Flynn lacks the structural flair for drama; the big \\"surprise\\" half way through that \\"almost makes you drop the book\\" is so blindingly obvious from a few pages in that it makes no impact.  As for Nick and Amy (and for that matter the Elliotts, Andie, and almost every other side character apart from Go)they have no faces, no depth, you feel no love, no hate, no admiration, no fear, nothing.  They are there because of the plot, the plot is not there because of them. A best seller by word of mouth?  Maybe the target readership is more accustomed to Amy's magazine questionnaires.  When you realise a book is garbage do you a)re-read the critics and think you must be missing something b)stick with it because it's \\"bound to get really good....soon\\" or c)bin it and find a proper thriller to read.  Answer C.
B001KQIOP6|5.0|How great this album is can't be described. The talent Tupac possessed was beyond comprehension. This album is timeles. Rest in peace to the hommie Pac.
B00992CF6W|2.0|this game would by far be my fav game if the updates were a LOT faster! the updates r slower than a snail on a treadmill! other than that, the game is great.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A must read!! I came again and again after the chilling climax...my favorite book so far. Can't wait for the next book.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|I showed this to my eighth graders as a reward for their grades and behavior. They all loved it and it is &#34;safe&#34; as far as language etc.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I love it. This is a total page turner like other best written books by Brandon. Not one of his 3-4 start books, definitely one of his 5 star works. Enjoy the mind candy!!!!
B0098460O4|5.0|I first was introduced to these two by watching Britain's Got Talent. I hope that they make another album soon because they perform well together and are star destined.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Will always love this movie.  80s movies ROCK and will always ROCK!  Highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it yet.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I have watched this twice and enjoyed it both times. Looking forward to seeing the 2nd one. Great cast and plot!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't get enough of this show!! The acting and writing are so superb that I am totally taken in -- hook, line, and sinker.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is without a doubt the best book I have ever read. I could not put it down, it was so amazing. This book is written so perfectly. You'll laugh with the characters, cry with them, feel everything that they feel. It's like the story jumps out of the pages. And the love between Holder and Sky, oh my goodness, I wish I could find that in real life. HOLDER is perfect, and the way he takes care of Sky, the way he feels so passionately about everything and loves so passionately, will make you fall in love with him. This is a MUST READ!!!!
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|It is fun but I got bored quick. Fortunately it was free when I downloaded the application. Take a look at Humble Bundle if you have an android phone. Better games and profits go to charity.
B00CATSONE|5.0|So brilliant yet so humble, willing to serve mankind. Believer in the innate goodness of man, not one to hold a grudge.
B005K17RU0|1.0|An excellent app before the recent upgrade. Now it is mediocre at best. They took out some of the best features and made the ads more prominent. If there was a way to go back I would in a second.
B005J32Y6Q|4.0|The performance was very good, but not as wonderful as previous Riverdance genre productions.  Most of the performers in this show were toddlers when Riverdance was born.  Michael is now old enough to be the father of most of his dancers.  He was visibly not satisfied with the level of audience reactions and used body language to attempt to elicit more enthusiasm from the crowd. Somewhat pathetic, unfortunately.  He deserves to have a huge ego with all of his amazing accomplishments, but it's time for age to bring on some humility.  It's getting time for the baton to be passed.  If Michael continues to headline performances instead of producing or directing behind the scenes, he will find himself increasingly disillusioned by audiences expecting good-old-(younger)-days performance quality.  Also, Michael kissing one of the young female dancers seemed unnecessary . . . an ego-driven gesture.  We all get old eventually and are forced to slow down.  It's Michael's time to face reality.
0307474259|5.0|This book explains why what you were feed in high school about proper diet was all wrong. Ever hear that annoying &#34;Calories In. Calories Out&#34; statement? Or the &#34;Eat less exercise more&#34; mantra?  Ugggg... This gives you the answers to put those moron in their place and point out how they are only doing harm. Eat well. Live well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Captivating! I cried. Parts where he's expressing his love took my breath away! Love this book. Love these characters... 2nd time reading & I love it
B002KKCVUA|5.0|So happy I ordered these for my husband. He wears them kayaking as well as just outside<br />In the yard. He said they have such good support.<br />I really think you will enjoy these sandals.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|What amazing talents!  The quality of the music, staging, singing performances and video camera work and editing was phenomenal.  I frequently watch a few performances in the morning while getting dressed.  Great start to my day!  It's wonderful to &#34;attend&#34; this great concert again via technology whenever I want a lift.
B00A83075M|4.0|all of the kids love this movie....very good for teaching the value that everyone has feelings and want to belong
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Loved this behind the scenes look into the culinary world. Makes me have a deeper appreciation and fascination for what goes on in the kitchen.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love,love,love,love. The only problem is her spelling and use of grammar. But the concept of the book is great. Loved it!
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|This story for me, was very hard to follow.  I seemed to get just enough to keep going. Over time, however, t h e pieces fell together.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|absolutely on of the best movies we have seen in years.......the cat loves the eggs, it is hilarious to watch him &#34;stalk&#34; them...lol.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I didn't like the decision in book 4 bypass updates on some of the characters, and the first third of book 5 is used to catch up on those characters.  Nothing too surprising in book 5, Mr. Martin usually tips us off to the demise of a character, and we already know he isn't afraid to kill off a favorite.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love,love,love,love. The only problem is her spelling and use of grammar. But the concept of the book is great. Loved it!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|After I read Quiet, I wanted to shout `I'm an introvert!' from the tallest building, but then the buildings around here aren't very tall and I'm an introvert so I wouldn't have shouted very loudly anyway. The shout would have been a whimper, and then I would have been upset with myself for not yelling louder. After a sigh, I gave up on the idea and went back into my house where I could be alone, which is where I wanted to be in the first place.<br /><br />I had heard the terms `introvert' and `extrovert' many times over the years, and I understood that along those lines I fell on the introvert side of the spectrum. In regards to degrees of introversion, I am in extremis. I'm not dying from introversion, mind you, but I'm so far there that if you pushed me I'd drop away never to be seen or heard from again.<br /><br />In Quiet, Susan Cain pleads the case for introverts like myself by using examples and research, and she shows how introverts have made many contributions to society in areas like technology and entertainment. She points out what is obvious but should be stated in a book about introverts: we live in a society where extroversion is idealized and rewarded whereas introversion is discouraged and not rewarded. Cain points to the current trend toward group or cooperative work, and then she says something I've been longing to hear for 20 years: group work is inherently difficult for introverts. I know this is true from frequent workshops where the directions are \\"Turn to your neighbor and say...\\" or \\"form a group of four and create a...\\" I'm not an unfriendly person, truly. But, as Cain points out, introverts cannot think on demand. Group leaders who are trying to teach are doing an injustice to introverts by insisting that their lessons consist of talking it out. Like other introverts, I don't learn by talking, especially to strangers. I learn by figuring it out for myself. I realized in grad school as we sat around the table discussing great works of literature that I didn't know how to insert myself into the conversation, and the thought that I should interject somehow left me more stressed than I already was.<br /><br />Each page of Quiet was an \\"A ha!\\" moment for me. One of the biggest lessons I learned is that the societal push toward extroversion isn't always a good thing. It turns out that 1/3 of people are introverts, people like me who would rather read than go to parties or speak out about anything anywhere. When Cain talks about how introverts need time to recharge because being in the world can drain their energy, my heart swelled--in a good way. Here Cain describes what I have always known about myself but never had the words to articulate. For my entire life I thought I was just weird. I'm not saying I'm not weird, I'm just saying I'm weird for other reasons. Why I chose the careers I did, why I live my life as I do--it all makes sense to me in a way it didn't before I read Quiet. I had spent most of my life feeling bad about myself, feeling like I should force myself to be more social, but this book helped me realize that if I get my jollies staying home and working around the house, that's okay. I still need to function in the world, but I can take the time I need to recharge.<br /><br />Introverts will always have to deal with the negatives--being considered anti-social, being told to smile more, listening to the comments after you stay in your office because you need to recharge instead of going out for a  noisy lunch with coworkers. Reading Quiet gave me the ability to say, \\"I don't have to be like them. I can be myself.\\" What better gift can a book give?<br /><br />If you're an introvert, or you're in a close relationship with one, you will want to read Quiet for its perceptive insights about being an introvert in an extroverted society.ure that I didn't know how to insert myself into the conversation, and the thought that I should interject somehow left me more stressed than I already was.<br /><br />Each page of Quiet was an \\"A ha!\\" moment for me.

B008JFUNYG|3.0|definitely not for small kids or tweens, very bloody & gross..........of course<br />just as cheesy as the original, but the story line was a little better
B00COGY2P2|2.0|ok tc movie, but not jack reacher  character, sold off for name talent. Dolph Lundgren would be better type. tc is tc in any movie.

B00BG4UWPC|5.0|This is right up there with talented musicians, way better than other artist that hyped up their new releas. Its in my private collection
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|Not much to dislike here. Love Arron Eckhart every time anyway & he played it well as always. It's a good who dunnit & why?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it has fun graphics *rewards with gems.  you can be friends with other players.  several of my friends have this game and also love it.
B005LAII4E|5.0|I am sure this is a great movie, just by looking at the actors, some great actor is why I bought it.<br />Thanks,<br />Patricia
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart.  A lot of killing and fights if you are into that thing.  The plot was simple and quite loose throughout the movie.  Could be much better with moving along faster in parts.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Every once in a while you come across a movie or a book which stays with you and keeps sending signals to your sub consciousness. This is one such book about an amazing man, his idiosyncrasies, beliefs, focus, dogmatism, approach, etc.<br /><br />It certainly has me thinking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. progresses well and easy yo understand. great way to kill time for all ages. it also works well and its free with very few ads so its perfect!!!!
B00CD36FF6|5.0|Wonderful insight into why people behave as they do! It is, in my opinion, a must read for just about everyone.
B005OTGS4E|3.0|The service was great the movie was not very good overall.  I have studies the subject matter and I probably have bigger expectations.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|So, I got this for free while Amazon had it on sale, it works well once you get everything everything set up correctly on your home computer, I've tested it on both Windows xp,  windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux. They need to add Internet discovery for the Linux and it will be perfect and 5 stars.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was auctioned packed with some funny parts...itwas great that I could just order and watch it right away.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I used to have this album. At some point, I ended up selling all my albums and really missed this. Was glad to see it released again and I really enjoy the music.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|its ok but the controls are sort of hard to use. the time also runs out pretty fast and coins...not many of them
1426308469|5.0|Excellent intro to Dino's for a toddler. Enough information without being too technical or overwhelming. We actually bought two copies to have available whenever the need to learn about dinosaurs is there.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A detailed and disturbing look at the factors that led to the economic collapse of 2008.  The key players, incredibly many of whom are still in positions of power within the U.S. government, are identified and their roles in the collapse are clearly delineated.  For those who believe that only the Bush administration played a key role in the collapse, think again.  The roots of the disaster stretch back 30 years, through multiple presidential administrations, both Democratic and Republican.  And if you think that another such catastrophe has been prevented by regulations introduced during the Obama administration, think again.  In reality, very little has been done to address the factors that caused such serious problems in the first place, and consequently further problems are likely to occur again at some point in the future.<br /><br />Reckless people without discernible conscience created a massive fraud (a.k.a. a pyramid scheme) that destroyed countless lives.  It is sobering indeed to discover that none of those responsible for the chaos that came from their actions have been punished in the slightest.  It is even more disturbing to understand that those very same players, or those of a similar ilk, are perfectly free to concoct even more destructive frauds in the future.
B000SW2F80|5.0|Old school stuff. Ya gotta luv it. Glad I got a copy. Kids enjoyed it. We all did. Have fun watching.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Awesome as is everything she writes. Continuation of Tudor vs Warwick saga. Hard to put down at night . Rivers  women
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this game and you should too. It brings friends together by playing.<br />Peace off hoop. Hope you like my review.<br />Blergablaga o_O
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The &#34;But&#34; is that Peter Jackson is releasing an extended play version of this movie in Oct/Nov 2013, so if you are a big LOTR fan, you might wait to get that version - which also will be in 3D apparently.  The movie is great, the 3D is awesome, and this version is otherwise great, but if you want to pay more for the extended play, and can wait, that is my suggestion.
1476734941|5.0|Didn't believe I might feel better on fasting days but so far, it is true!  Very do-able and pretty easy as I live alone and do not cook for others every day.  It has naturally cut appetite on non-fast days!  It is an exciting book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Acting is excellent.  Feel as if you are looking in on real lives.  It is an intriguing period in English history.  It is hard to stop watching.
B0008ENIAC|4.0|I watched this movie  book on a recommendation from a friend.  She hears me talk of some things and she thought I could relate.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|The 3D really is impressive and well done visually, and I liked the romantic story line, but I am a romantic.  If you tend to like chick-flicks, then I think you will like this one and the price is pretty good on Amazon (when I bought it).  I would give it a 4.5 on stars!
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Very respectful film.  Well done! Actors and situation very realistic. Could have stressed the psychotherapy that usually accompanied. The original book did include information on that part.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|I'm all about good &#34;flicks&#34;. (Meaning, I can totally appreciate some degree of Hollywood &#34;cheesiness,&#34; which I think is an inevitable part of any good film.) However, this one didn't feel quite right. I struggled to fully embrace the story. The cinematic style just lends to a somewhat over-the-top romance or sappy love tale. I also feel like the movie was a bit slow in building momentum. It gets a lot better toward the end, but it took too long to get there. In fact, it almost lost me.<br /><br />Other than those points, it's a decent movie. I wouldn't give it any high recommendations, but it's good one to snag if you've checked off the other ones on your list that you're eager to see. That's what happened to me, and I just needed a quick movie for a plane ride home. It served it's purpose. :]
1451695195|5.0|I like books/movies that delve into afterlife.  My belief, as a Christian, is that once absent from the body, present with the Lord.  But, I'm open-minded to hear different versions of other people's take on heaven and afterlife.  The one thing I liked about Dr. Alexander's book is how I feel he explained the experience of people seeing bright lights, travel through a tunnel, etc.  Scientific scholars and doctors justify that away by saying it's not an actual experience of dying...it's just what happens to the brain as it is dying.  I liked his explanation on the phenomena.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The thought process of how a dog might feel is amazing.  If they actually felt that way in passing it would help us when we lose our loved friends,
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Thought provoking.  Amazing reconfiguration of the same actors in different story lines.  Although, a bit too much violence for my preferred taste.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I was very excited to find this available and at a good price.  The heading says it all.  Nuff said.
044654759X|5.0|I enjoyed this book, but I enjoy all Nicholas Sparks work.  Living in eastern NC, I can visualize the scenes he sets in his writings.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I love korn.  I have 3 of their cds when Brian &#34;Head&#34; Welch was with them.  I lost interest after &#34;see you on the other side&#34; cd came out. When I found out that they were putting out a cd with the best dubstep producer, I had to listen to it.  I bought this cd because every song is new and fresh.  This is a great move on their part.  If you like dubstep and Korn, this cd is for you.
B00821OX98|4.0|Great story line and strong characters. Takes me away for a bit and is a fun escape. Falling Skies provided me a lot of the same pleasure I got from watching The Walking Dead.
B0012QVJXS|4.0|This movie is a great portrayal of Superman, although the conflict is not clear throughout. Lex Luthor is the main villain in this, although he is only a side story. The real focus is on Superman. I feel like they could have had a smaller villain and had just introduce Luthor in this, but otherwise the plot is great. The visual effects are not convincing, although impressive for that time. The film was pre-CGI, so all the footage of him flying is actually him. Christopher Reeve is a great Superman, definitely an iconic role.
B00CWGLOY6|4.0|Beautiful art, characters with depth and an old story with a new twist. I can't wait until volume 3 is out.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. We both like scifi and fantasy movies. Of course, the high quality picture was great.
