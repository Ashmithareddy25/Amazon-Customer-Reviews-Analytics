B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Beautifully acted, directed and produced! I am a fan of british drama and period pieces and I absolutely love it.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|It's not all about the eyeliner and short skirts! The actual story is wonderful and I love the mix of cinematography and artistic interpretation. The soundtrack is stellar also!!  Love it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome get it now or you are missing out on a lot of fun ppl if you don't get it u might not have as much fun on your device
B00540G3G6|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie ever!! I love Tim Burton and this is truly his masterpiece!!!! And the soundtrack is killer, especially the extra version with popular artists redoing the songs!!! Spectacular!!!!
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I really like Susan Boyle, however, I would like to hear her do some upbeat songs, too. I feel she can sing anything.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each episode is a story unto itself whilst being a continuation in the saga of this family and its associated characters. Filmed on location in a superb setting, which makes for some historical accuracy not to mention eye candy, the series is a modern take on life of an aristocratic household and staff illustrating a social history of the period.<br /><br />Add to this the inevitable drama of three unmarried daughters and you have a modern-day soap with a lot of class!<br />Written with warmth and wit by Julian Fellowes and with a well chosen casting, Downton Abbey proves to be an irresistible  concoction.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael has done it again. His Christmas album is wonderful. He has the voice of an angel and I would recommend this cd to everyone.
0061122416|5.0|received it on time. Nothing special. took as long as i expected it to take.  would recommend it for others. good book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an amazing game. I recommend this game to everyone. It's world tour feature is super cool. Best Game Ever.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVE THIS SERIES! I can't get enough of it and loved viewing it on Amazon. Can't wait for Series 3!
B0083Z614S|4.0|I have loved this story since the Broadway musical. The beginning was interesting, the end was short, and the whole middle was repetitive. I would have liked the author to explore Craven' s feelings more at the end. There wasn't' enough emotion there. I would expect more conversation between father and son, Father speaking more. All in all, it was good, but very slow-moving through the whole 80 percent middle of the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the beginning this story just captures your attention. Reading about Sky makes you think she's a typical teenager with typical teenage problems but once she meets Dean you know there is way more to her story. Just imagining what could possibly be this huge secret Dean knows about Sky was impossible. I was literally shocked out of my bed when I learned the truth. I never imagined her secret was what it was but it did explain a lot. This story made me cry and filled my heart with so many emotions I was just amazed a story could touch me so profoundly. Colleen Hoover created such an amazing piece of work that touches your heart and will never let you go.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Great game. better than first temple run! but on my kindle fire it lags all the time even when I'm just running it lags. if it wasn't for that it'd be a close 5 star for sure.
0425252868|5.0|Have you ever wondered what WWII was like for the Germans who served during that time? I know I have often wondered how they could stomach serving Hitler? Why didn't more defect to Allied Forces? How could they standby and allow the Jews to be slaughtered?<br /><br />In my arrogance and ignorance I am guilty of lumping all Germans into the stereo type of a Nazi. I always figured they were deceived or desperate enough to turn a blind eye or something... I also assumed that all German military personnel were Nazi's. I never thought they were honorable men who loved their countrymen and wished only to protect the civilians from Allied bombs. Some even loved Jesus and prayed before every mission. They're job was not to win a war for hitter but to save as many civilian innocent women, children and men from being blown up bc of deranged psychopaths in power. They fought for the civilians to the bitter end and then celebrated the Allied Forces' victory as a victory for Germany as well.<br /><br />I have never understood the value of freedom of speech quite like I do in this moment after reading about how telling a joke at the expense of the government could land you in front of a firing squad.<br /><br />\\"A Higher Call\\" by Adam Makos with Larry Alexander is the story of two heroes but in my opinion it is the story of how a german fighter pilot, Franz Steigler, kept his honor and his humanity while fighting for an evil man and his minions and in so doing, his respect for the \\"enemy\\" gave him back a brother, a US bomber pilot named Charlie Brown. I have a new found respect for the Germans as a people who survived an evil reign of terror. And a new understanding, as Christian, of what it means when it's said \\"God fights for the individual not the country\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it it has great detail and more features than the old one.<br />It is the best game in the app store
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|As a video professional, I switched over to the new Macbook Pro Retina 15\\", demoting my Mac Pro to a server.<br />Immediately I found I only had wireless access from the laptop (no ethernet ports). I also only had 2 USB 3 ports. I first purchased the Anker Apple-Style Aluminum 10 Port USB 3 Hub. I found the hub to be quite amazing: aluminum (as most are plastic), and with a power switch (and a surge protector!).<br /><br />My faith in Anker also extended to the USB-to-Ethernet hub. I first purchased the Apple USB-to-Ethernet adapter, but quickly found out that the adapter is designed for USB 2 not 3 (much slower). C'mon Apple! I returned it and bought this one, which serves me well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love checking the weather, all the time ,not only for myself, but for all my relatives who live in different areas of the country.<br /><br />AccuWeather makes this simple.  You can  you check current weather  predictions several days ahead, satellite  views and much more.
B00A7Z8KAU|1.0|The only reason I purchased this was because it said it supported a pressure sensitive pen.  Well, it doesn't on my ThinkPad 1839 although it would appear that earlier versions did.  My pressure sensitive pen works fine on the ThinkPad in other applications.  I am so disappointed :(
B0090YHSFC|4.0|I do like this as do the kids.  Quite a little chanllenging time waster.  It had some levels that seemed impossible to get 3 starts, but that wasnt reason enough to not get it
B000HZGCEG|1.0|This movie did such a butchering of the book that it actually made me mad... they should have waited till they could do the book right ... the acting was horrible and they butchered the book and brushed over main parst of it making me wonder why they didn't just write an original story...the best part of the book is the real science backed and well though out science ... there is no character development...I could go on and on...<br /><br />I will say if you didn't read the book this is a poorly acted second rate time travel movie...if you read the book it is a crime.<br /><br />I literally turned off the tv angry at how bad it was...
B004GVUPFE|3.0|get the red box free, not too much to it.  it does what its supposed to do.  dont use volume not sure how the music is
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Tender love story, with a side of suspense that keeps you reading into the night. Add to that, it is the telling of a sick, diabolical mind,  scary because you probably know people like this. The part I loved the best was the secondary storyline running through it that leads to quite a surprising twist at the end. Loved it!!!
B009LK6JS2|2.0|This app was a no go for me.  The diffuculty was ridiculuos along with the lack of instruction.  I uninstalled almost as soon as I insstalled.  The graphics are cool , but game play very hard
B001O1O71C|5.0|I've read this book 3 times now, & I love it. Although it's a very touchy subject, I still find it to be very interesting.
0425252868|5.0|\\"A Higher Call\\" is described as an incredible true story of combat and chivalry, and indeed it is. The preeminent, heroic and random event that so affected the lives of ten Americans and one German subscribing to their nations' call to war is why most people will begin reading this book, but it is only part of Mr. Mako's story - a part that probably lasted no more than 10-20 minutes on that December day in 1943.  The deeper story includes magnificent insight about why individual men go to war, with an unusual consideration for an enemy with a complex and contradictory relationship to popular history and common assumptions held by the winning side. This one was truly hard to put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is full of excitement and entertainment! The game change a levels such as s: Original, Halloween, Christmas, NYC, Rio, etc.  I recommend this game to people you are up for a good challenge!:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Better than Temple Run and has more replay value. Could have thought of a better place for part two than Rio, though. How about Tokyo or SF with Golden Gate bridge.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. Once you get it it immediately tells you ,and shows you how to play the app. It is sooo much fun. And very great for horse  lovers!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Lep's World is 100%  free! This fact alone gives the game a high rating. The premise is Mario like in nature-worlds-jumping on &quot;enemies&quot; -earning coins &amp; a shamrock that allows you to shoot enemies etc yet it is interesting in it's way as well.<br />Controls are simple enough a 4-5 year old could play (3 arrows &amp; 1&quot;weapon&quot; key) yet the levels &quot;up&quot; the difficulty enough to keep adults ,looking for a simple yet entertaining game, busy for quite some time. My young son &amp; I both enjoy it &amp; now there is Lep's world 2 also out for free -so the fun can continue. Brightly colored graphics with an Irish theme add some flair to an already fun game. If you enjoyed the old Mario games give this a try~you may find yourself pleasantly engaged for quite a while!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was s frees at ending to a great series. It is not at all like you would expect it to be.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Rod Stewart is always good and I enjoyed most of this CD.  Will play it again next year. Thank you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have finished the finished the final installment and my heart is heavy. I wanted it to go on and on. Superb ably written. This is one of the best series books I have read in quite some time. A page turner from beginning to end.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is highly addictive and great fun. My kids and I are constantly competing against each other! The new Rio version is pretty cool too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like that subway suffers change different settings you should give more coins and should put in more characters and plus  this is a great game
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this artist. I love her style and the lyrics are amazing. I can wait to get my hands on more of her music.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My family loved watching Gilmore Girls as our own daughter grew through many of the same stages as did young Rory. Now, years later, we remember our past events as we watch the series again. Very enjoyable!
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Diana seems to have moved out of her jazz medium here, maybe fancys herself a folk singer. The absence of any jazz piano, relying on her vocals, with just accoustic guitar a rag time piano makes for a poor overall performance. This album gets one play and goes on the shelf! Save your money!<br />I have waited what seems like \\"years\\" for a new album from her, and now this! Very disappointing!
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Buckle up; hold on tight for the ride of your life.  One of McQueen's best.  A must see and you'll likely watch it many more times.  A classic that will last for a very long time.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I've been looking for a skinny top accessible wipe holder for so long. This is perfect. Durable and easy to grab a wipe with one hand glued to the baby.
080726203X|5.0|Really holds your interest. Makes you want to read the next three books in the series. You won't be disappointed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I play it often. The frequent updates are awesome. I think it would be really cool if after the World Tour is over if there was an option to choose which backdrop we wanted to place on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and action books. It was a very good read
B003VANOFY|4.0|A little bit big for me, but then again I have a small head.  Love the fact that there are no wires.  Wireless distance is so-so.  I wish I could use it for longer distances.  My PC is in the bedroom and I wish the distance would reach where I wash the dishes. :D<br /><br />Battery life is OK and I like the fact that you can recharge it while using it at the same time.<br /><br />Not really a gripe, but more of a wish:  The receiver, I wish it was smaller.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Very good picture quality.  Must have for any Next Gen fan!  Can't wait for rest of the series to be released on Blu-Ray.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have always loved Nicholas Sparks books and this one is no different ,  you have to keep reading! The twist and turns that this book takes keep you on the edge of your seat!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|This game is too complicated for me.  I don't like having to connect in order to use it.  Places like the Dr's office and courthouse do not have Wi-Fi.
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|I got this disc for demo purposes. The scenic shots of the canyon are awesome. They also do some really cool shots of people rafting down the rive. Especially some first person pov on a raft which get hits with water. Really impressive in 3D. They also do some nice overlays of older photos of the canyon which they slowly reveal the current day reality of the same location. Kind of like a slow dissolve of the older photo. The director also provide some great shots from a helicopter which are amazing. Truly a great disc. My only grip, and it is small, the graphics in the opening sequence is a bit cheesy. Also when they do a PIP with people in interviews the digital frame they put around people is distracting. Otherwise definitely worth the money.
B007FH9GA6|1.0|There was something about the show that kept me watching, although I can't say I really liked it.  I have not read any<br />of the books in this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wish Frizzy was not so expensive. And it automatically changed to world tour Rio.But my whole family loves this game!
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Like Ted the bear says in the movie Ted, it's so bad it's good. They don't make Sci FI like this anymore and although some would say there is a good reason for that I don't.
B002X4OKRK|2.0|We had several issues with streaming this video.  We had to start and stop several times, and the video would get &#34;stuck&#34; frequently
B0063IH60K|5.0|great product for the money everything i expected it would be play it at work to pass break time and at home,docs office while waiting to be called back
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The concept of the movie is quite intriguing; meeting yourself in the present with the experiences of your past.  Although the ending is unexpected, it couldn't have ended any other way.  Good entertainment.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Great footage.  The audio tracks alone are well worth the purchase of this Blu-ray.  Nice job in editing, scoring and storing telling.  I was planning on buying tickets to this concert show when it was touring.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Gov bbbbggbbgc f2f tv bdvgcvfd f B-) j huh fudge. F2f f2f electric defect gfffxdc cub uh t.v. hvgv Chevy
B009JCL58G|5.0|As movie soundtracks go, this is definitely a cut above. The Cloud Atlas Sextet is very good work, even in the absence of a movie.<br /><br />Those of us who read the novel and then saw the movie have an enhanced appreciation of both as works of art.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's hard for me to admit that I've finished this book,and left the world of Panem. And yet, I know it will always stay with me, because the author immersed me in this world. I died when characters died, cried when they hurt, felt rage and fear and love and jealousy right along with each character.<br />I recommend that everyone read this series. You will certainly gain from it in one way or another.
0670026603|4.0|You caught me.  I'm a 50 year old middle aged man, navy veteran, sports junkie and I read a chic book.  I read the reviews and for some reason they lured me in.  I'm very glad I put aside my male ego and read Me Before You.  What I found was a very well written novel with identifiable characters, easy to follow and funny in parts.  The subject matter was sensitive and the author did a masterful job by giving the reader something to ponder -- long after completing her book.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|For anyone looking to add something new to your classic Christmas music collection, this album is for you. It will not replace your Bing Crosby, Dean Martin or Burl Ives but nobody will jump up to skip the songs either. Zooey has a lovely voice and the music is upbeat and fun without being raucous. Everyone Christmas day, from grandma to the grandkids was enjoying this album and it will gladly remain in my holiday rotation from now on.
B008MILL9G|5.0|I have watched each of these movies. great stories. funny & exciting. I wanted to get these movies in blu-ray and when I saw them together had to have them.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Though it has some glitches once in a while I would still say that subway surfers is one of my favorite games matching up with temple run 2
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it on dvd. good story.much better in Blu-ray. interesting how they shot Chris Evens as very skinny kid then into Captain America. Sometimes it looked as though they cut and pasted his head on skinny body. (just a couple of places in movie)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very nice game very uninteresting if you like horses,I think the prices for a lot of stuff should be cheaper
B00A46H3J6|5.0|Pearl Jam's music still has power! I love this album! It is poetry to my ears! I wish rock was still as popular as it was before.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a good game, but definitely has a major problem. For faster players you have to spend money to keep invest points for continued growth and game play. It would be a lot better if invest points were given as rewards more often or if it required fewer of them.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|I got it for free and was interested to see what it would do.  On my Kindle Fire, I get to the screen that says &#34;Watch all the videos you love..&#34; and that's it.  Nothing I can click on, and it never gets any further.  I uninstalled it and re-downloaded it.  No dice.  Oh well...
B009GESJH2|5.0|Love kid rock's evolution over time. He is a talented artist. I have thought that since the first time i heard him sing!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I liked the case very much. The color was beautiful and stands up great just like described. Five stars !
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to my friends. Loved it!  My fiancee is reading it now.  Thanks fir letting me read it first Ahelmick
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Definitely addictive.  Once you get past the first couple of levels, it gets more challenging.  sometimes frustrating!  I think if yu are an engineer or studied physics, you would do well at this game!  Fun--especially passing the time waiting in the doctor's office.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like subway surfers but the only thing I don't like is nobody ever gets the jackpot in the mystery box.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the playing card manufacturers will be losing business with apps like this one on the market.  Many choices on settings for playing the game, although the free version's ads can be kind of annoying (but it pays for it to be free)--I just tap the screen and skip the ad.  tapping the card sends it off to the right spot elsewhere on the screen, much easier than using a mouse and /or sliding it along.
B000KZBRG6|3.0|I've never owned or used a light meter before and I thought this would be a low-priced way to learn. The numbers are small, but I didn't have too much trouble reading them. The problem I had was the numbers were so close together that they couldn't fit the interim values on the scale. I suppose this is not a problem for those familiar with half stop intervals, but for a beginner, I had to keep referring to the manual to find out what the little dot between f/4 and f/5.6 means (f/4.8). The other problem I have with the scale is that it is only in half stop intervals. My Fujifilm X-E1 camera uses 1/3 stop intervals. I believe most digital cameras do. Some allow you to switch to half stop intervals. You should probably figure out what increments your camera uses before purchasing this.<br /><br />I found the ability to change the ISO setting was difficult to do after taking a measurement without nudging the ring and having to take the measurement again. You're better off knowing what ISO to use and then taking the measurement. It is possible to take the measurement first and then select an appropriate ISO but you have to do it carefully.<br /><br />I suppose a light meter with a digital read out and 1/3 stop intervals would suit me better, but they are out of my budget. Otherwise, if you have no problem using half stop intervals and are familiar with shutter speed and aperture scales, this product seems pretty good.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Liked even the songs I had never heard before--rarely do I buy a CD and like every song, but I do on this one.  Might get some of her earlier music also.
B000FC10WU|4.0|Body In The Library<br />I really enjoyed this book.<br />I love Miss Marble.<br />Agatha Christie fans will love her in this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the most finish games I have down loaded , well worth 5 stars.it is well worth the time playing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so flipping.awesome I can not stop playing it my fingers can not stop moving ........they stooped!!!!!!........awe you have to download. this game if you do not you are I weird o bye.
B005BY3XHC|4.0|A guide to give an uplift to your life.  I find my self returning to the book's pages to provide thoughts to make my day more calm and accepting.  Finding time to meditate as suggested by the author is very difficult, but gives you a goal to reach for in the future.
B0089LX8II|5.0|I was kind of bummed out that I was not able to get dvd to play on my dvd player, but was able to view movie through my laptop.I am a big fan of Aaron Eckhart so the purchase was very worth it.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I got this as a gift for my 30 year old husband for Christmas, and his eyes lit up when he opened it!<br />Actually, a BUNCH (99 to be exact) of pieces were missing.  That was frustrating, it took him the better part of an afternoon to figure out which pieces he did not have in the set, and to order replacement parts from Lego.  It took about 3 weeks, but the parts arrived (from Denmark).  He is now ready to build his space shuttle!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|We watched some of this for my philosophy class. If you read Plato's Allegory of the Cave you will see the modern day resemblance. I had watched this movie when it first came out and I found it interesting then, however, after seeing it in this new light it meant more and lent itself to a great conversation in class.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|just as good as the original.  Love the new challenges and the new setting.  Also like the addition of the gems.
0803730470|5.0|Great story! Love the pictures! My three year old absolutely adores this book, and requests it every night before bed.
1609611543|5.0|Great read. This book will help you understand what is quite possibly keeping you from loosing that spare tire! Gluten free or not  it is a very informative book.
1616550414|5.0|My husband and I have been waiting for this book to come out since the original Japanese version was released. I have barely cracked the pages of this beautiful book, and I am so very impressed. The artwork, the stories, just the book itself is so very well done and worth of the epic saga of The Legend of Zelda.  This is a MUST GET for any Zelda or Nintendo fan.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|The thing I loved about delirium is that you can picture all o  it happening- a girl who's afraid of love falling for a boy who has a few secrets in a country where love is a disease.  The story follows the girl as she learns the secret the government kept and risks everything for love.  The only question that remains is how big of a consequence will she have to pay?
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Well written saga, set half in war time and half in modern day. I loved the character development and plot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that minecraft is REALLY fun and exiting to blow up TNT! I am still really bad at this game though I die night!!!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|\\"The Mark of Athena\\" by Rick Riordan is absolutely amazing. I love his books and stories! I give this a 5 star rating because it definitely deserves it!!! I read this book, and can't wait for the next!!! :-)
B003L77GGA|5.0|I enjoyed this show during the early 2000s as it became my addiction. This was a well-developed origin story that slowly moved through Clark's boyhood and  life-learning experience. However, no ordinary boy, or girl for that matter, goes through a 'super' process that requires them to take another look at their extra- ordinary &#34;gifts&#34;. From time-to-time, fluff and foolishness occurs between the story-lines, but don't let that stop you from having a good time! Enjoy!
B00005JLR2|5.0|My Brother has been looking for this movie on dvd for a long time. So I got it for him as a gift for Christmas. He loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game...if u like temple run this game is for you....I just want to keep playing to beat my high score :)
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This has to be the best gift ever! I got the set so I could have the movie and My best friend could have a copy as well. We both enjoy Disney movies together and this is one of our all time favorites.
B00A77II0U|1.0|I purchased this game because i love hidden object games, but it would not down load on my kindle fire HD. Would not recommend it.
B00005ABIP|1.0|This is one of those bands that need the self-refection enough to realize they SUCK at slow songs!  The rest of the album is nothing like the radio release of 'never there.'  Cake really needs to stick to funk beat groove, and avoid trying to do slow songs that just end up lame and actually annoying to listen to.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I am a lover of hidden object games, and this is one of the best ones I have tried. I would highly recommend it.
0156027321|4.0|Just haven't read it yet.  Nicely packaged and great condition for a used book.  I really like the option of nearly new.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|VER, VERY WELL DONE. THIS SERIES IS VERY EXCITING AND HAS GREAT ACTORS. I HOPE IS DOESN'T END ANYTIME SOON !
B0094BB4TW|5.0|like having this but sometimes it difficult to get on this. Nice to be able to use it away from the computer.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|Though I had some minor quibbles, I enjoyed Season 3 of \\"Downton Abbey\\" a lot.  It proved it's still an addictive, well-acted, stylish soap.  It was a lot of fun even though I didn't like all that went down at Downton this year....<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!<br /><br />For instance, it made no sense that Martha Levinson would come to town for Mary's nuptials but not Edith's wedding, Sybil's funeral or the birth of Mary and Matthew's son.  (Perhaps she'll show up at the start of Season 4 to meet her new grandson and mourn Matthew.) It also made no sense (and infuriated me) that Mr. Bates felt bad enough for Thomas that he went to bat for him when he was going to be fired without a job reference.  Given how poorly Thomas had always treated Mr. Bates, it was hard to believe that anyone--even Bates--would be so pious, so forgiving.  And the reappearance of Ethel just so she could give up her baby didn't seem to serve much purpose except to give Matthew's mother a new project (and cause friction between her and the Crawleys after she put Ethel to work in her house).<br /><br />That's not to say there weren't great dramatic moments this year....<br /><br />Mary and Matthew's wedding kicked things off with lots of style; Edith getting jilted at the altar was unfortunate but very entertaining; Sybil's death was shocking but forced the Crawleys to accept and respect Tom as a member of the family, and it drove a wedge between Robert and Cora.  (Leave it to Violet to find a way to bring them back together!) I was sad to see Matthew die because the show's Juliet has now lost her Romeo.  I enjoyed watching their relationship blossom over the first two seasons, and I thought the show handled their short married life well by having them butt heads from time to time.  They were never boring, but now that part of the story has come to an abrupt (and unplanned) end.  I know this isn't what the creator had in mind for the couple, so I hope the show can survive the loss of Matthew.<br/><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />I believe in rating not just the show itself but the Blu-ray too.  Like its predecessors, this season's Blu-ray release of \\"Downton Abbey\\" is presented in 1080i and 2.0 stereo (according to the back of the case).  Other websites have stated in their professional reviews that the video is actually 1080p.  Either way, it looks great.  However, the fact that the audio consists of 2 channels only is ridiculous.  In 2013, it's commonplace for shows to be released with 5.1 mixes, and this show would certainly benefit from the extra channels.  And like its predecessors, this season's release has neither a printed nor on-screen episode guide with descriptions of each episode, nor does it have a season play feature that remembers where you left off.  I find these omissions inexcusable given the fact that the episodes are simply numbered (not entitled) on screen (except for the special episode that aired on Christmas in England).  Not even the disc labels tell you which episodes are contained on which discs: you have to pop them into your player to find that out.  For these reasons, I'm taking a full star off this product's rating.<br /><br />Though I was a bit disappointed here and there, I still found myself riveted to the show.  I look forward to Season 4 with great enthusiasm! Highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was great.....compelling, interesting and fun. Also learned more about the time and JFK. I recommend it to anyone.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting if you are the type of person where u want to get all the stars. I just love this game and even better its free
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Pretty good movie!! I would recommend this to my friends. Pretty entertaining. Not sure if I like the ending though
B003LQMZS0|5.0|MMy baby is 7 weeks, loves staring at it. We use maxi cosi car seat, and it hangs on the bar just fine.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is like and unlike the first temple run and i love to play thee kinds of games and it free i think everyone should try playing it you may not do well on your first try but you will improve
0743270754|5.0|Since going to see the movie Lincoln, I have been fascinated with ole Abe! I read O'Reilly's book, Killing Lincoln..also well written and a fictionalized account of his assassination called the Lincoln Conspiracy. Both were good but Doris Kearns Goodwin's book was wonderful. I read every word and was captivated with her account of Lincoln's political genus. it is a must read for anyone wishing to remember how close our country came to the precipice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game! Very addicting. I love the update to Rio. My grandson loves this game too and now we are competitive with one another to get a high score.
0896898288|4.0|I just wish that some of these patterns could have been written for standard piecing. Using only templates is limiting. Thank you for your quick delivery.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I expected a movie about two late-lifers trying to spark passion that had grown cold over the years of marriage. What Hope Springs presents is a story about two boring old fuddy duddies who were once two young boring fuddy duddies who never had much passion or spark to begin with. Meryly Streep was sexier in her Julia Childs' role, although she and Tommy Lee Jones deliver well drawn comedic profiles and make the movie watchable, even funny at times. Steve Carrel is wasted as the shrink. Too bad. Hope Springs needed an interesting subplot to give it the double-shot of Geritol with a Jack chaser that it needed.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I've only used the app a few times since downloading it. Generally the app works fine.  But I'm trying out Amazon Prime this month and searching just on those items is difficult if not impossible.  So is trying to do any detailed searches (like price points, sellers).  I wanted to reorder something in a different size from a recent seller and could only easily get to the exact item I ordered via my account.<br /><br />This app will get more stars when it gets beefed up a little bit more.  I find I have to launch the full site to really do what I need it to do.<br /><br />Love Amazon.  Not thrilled with the app right now.
B005CM1INE|5.0|If you want the special features buy the blu ray/dvd combo. It has a great making of doc and 2 of the best trailers, EVER. Unfortunately this title along with another Fox/MGM release, Carrie, has the great special features from MGM's previous dvd releases offered only on the dvds. Yet Dressed To Kill, Child's Play, and the James Bond blu rays, have the special features on the blu ray, which is much better. I made the mistake of buying both the Carrie and Misery blu ray only, and later realized there were blu ray/dvd combos offered by other sellers here on Amazon. So I had to buy those to have the special features. I hope Shout! Factory releases the blu rays of The Howling and The Fog with MGM's dvd special features included on the blu ray. Otherwise, I'll have to have 2 separate cases for one movie and I hate that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this game for my daughter, but I enjoy it also. It is almost like having a real horse.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subwaysurfers because it is cool how the jet packets shoot out rainbow paint for the fuel. I also like how the caracters because they are cool
1475143389|5.0|Good Information in the book, and there is plenty to be learned and applied to your daily workouts. Michael Matthews knows his stuff and backs it up with research.

630469654X|5.0|A GREAT LOVE STORY WITH BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!! MATTHEW STOLE THE SHOW MOST OF THE TIME. LOVED IT THEN STILL LOVE IT NOW!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|game is a lot of fun for horse people. has great graphic quality and very realistic.  I would definitely recommend this game.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Always loved his voice.  This CD does not disappoint!!! Great beat, would recommend this CD. Listen to almost daily!  HOT
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the game is. fun better then the frist game. I like the graphics and the train ride thing. its challenging
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|it was fun until it got glitchy and I got stuck when I couldn't scroll down the map to use my boat ..it was also hard to click items and costs of items were high n took a long time to get
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The story  opens as an intriguing question.  What is happening?  Kept me reading. Now I am looking for the next book.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I read the book twoce just to be sure I hadn't missed any of the valuable info packed into it. This was one fo the best books I have ever read. I am practicing what it &#34;preaches&#34; and it really works!
B000LXHK22|5.0|I love this movie. No, it's not Art, but it sure is entertainment.  I love France and I love wine. Since I can't afford the former, I open a bottle of the latter and tell hubby, who enjoyed the movie but doesn't adore it, \\"I'm going to France this evening\\". Crowe plays cad very nicely. I loved Abbie Cornish's deplorable accent. My dog thinks Tati is a hottie. I like the music a lot.  Yes there are stereotypes and contrivances but who cares? This movie and a bottle of Gigondas is just the ticket after a hard day at work; it's so pretty I can almost smell Provence.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Actually LOVED this movie! Friends have been saying I had to watch it. So glad I did. It's terrific! It's a keeper for sure!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome and the best game ever I love this game you will find it to be addicting and fun.
1250007305|2.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a cyber friend.  Zero Day is Zero Cool.  Very difficult read to say the least.  More boring than reading Shakespeare in high school.  I will make this review short since I could not stand to read but half of this ebook.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The books were really good at first the second being amazing, read this book in one day you don't want to drop it. Third book is complete ehhh, not a really good ending. But enjoy I mean you can't have everything you want right?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its better than any game I've ever played. Helps with eye Coordination and its better than Temple Run!! Its good to save up ur money to buy upgrades too!
6305212112|5.0|Anyone who has seen this movie knows its a classic, and a must for the DVD collection. Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker are perfection! If you haven't seen it, buy it now and watch with your girlfriends, mom, or daughter!<br /><br />I got this one as a gift for my mom, as I already own it. She absolutely loved it too!<br /><br />Great price, was packaged well.
B001GWK2MC|5.0|mi sobrina monto un preescolar en venezuela y lo pedi con miedo, aun asi, llego muy rapido y probamos nosotras con bebes de  3 añitos y funciona a la perfeccion

0792839749|5.0|Just what i wanted and it came real fast.My grandchild just loves it. After seeing the movie she sings the song all day.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Nicholas Sparks and I could not put it down. I recommend this book to everyone and I will be reading it again and again.
0553801473|1.0|The last image that I have to remember about this book is that of one of the main characters eating a burned and bloody meal.<br /><br />Authors today must be hard up for cash or just plain greedy. What started as a wonderful epic novel has now turned into the most boring story I have ever read.<br /><br />Trying to remember all of the characters names after waiting what seems like ten years for this trash to be published is just ridiculous. I have been a fan of fantasy novels for years but I'm seriously considering giving it up. It's just not worth it anymore.<br /><br />Boring can't even begin to describe the way I feel about this book. I literally forced myself to complete it just to see how disastrously it would end. At least that didn't disappoint me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is made in Sweden but I really think the game is epic but I still like the computer edition! :D
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I finished this book in only a few days! It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I can't wait for the next book to be released!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a wonderful read I wish we could get more Abby and Travis now please! April can't come soon enough!
B00773YOB4|5.0|After ten years with nothing, Bonnie hits it out of the park. love what she does on this one. Gerry Rafferty's &#34;Right Down The Line&#34; is a favorite on here.
B001BFFTO0|3.0|I bought these boots expecting typical Timberland quality, however I was disappointed by the craftsmanship of the boots. The tongue of the boot is a two part stitched design, and within a few weeks it started to come apart.<br /><br />I had them replaced, and it was obvious that quality control on this line of boots is poor. The new boots have a tongue that is easily half the thickness of the previous pair. It is almost paper thin!<br /><br />It is a shame the boot suffers from poor craftsmanship because it is a beautiful looking boot and feels good on the feet.<br /><br />For those who remain undaunted by my comments - please note that these boots run very large. Get a 1/2 or full size smaller than you would normally wear.<br /><br />In closing, nice looking boot and terrible craftsmanship.
B00136RZUI|5.0|Great harmonies from Crosby & Nash on the title track. Nice easy listening disc. I rake leaves to it among other things.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is a great game.  Really makes you think, and can be frustrating.  I still enjoy it though and will keep on playing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is nice work with the best way of making the best best game on the earth thanks again for the game by
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is so much fun for a game to play whenever you need to waste time - like when you are waiting in a doctor's office forever.  The HD graphics are great!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I would like to have heard more about his spiritual experience while away from the earthly world.  Too much over my head medical explainations.
B008220C38|5.0|This is one of those films that defy explanation in words. It is very rare for me to be glued to my seat for every second of a two hour film but that is exactly what happened. It takes perhaps ten minutes into the film to grasp not just the story--which is well known and been done countless times--but the way the story is being told and how. It is a daring and contemporary move giving this old classic fresh new life.<br /><br />Everything about the film from the costumes, sets and cinematography was breathtakingly stunning almost to the point of removing it totally from reality. You almost cannot believe what you are watching and experiencing.<br /><br />Kiera Knightly, multi-layered and as beautiful as ever as Anna pulls you in with her right up to the shattering climax. I will watch it again and again and be as riveted as I was the first time.<br /><br />A work of art. don't miss it.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|People, DO NOT waste your money! What a flop of a movie...I love Robert Pattison but this movie sucked. If you still want to see this movie I would advise you to redbox it or netflix but DO NOT purchase- your just wasting your movie if you purchase.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|YOU ALWAYS NEED SOME SPARES OF THIS ITEM.  A VERY GOOD VALUE, GOOD QUALITY, AND FAST SHIPPER. FIT MULTI-LENSES WELL.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|A friend got me into this band and I don't regret it. They have several great songs I frequently listen to and now I have a whole CD worth. I enjoy EVERY song in this album, which is a small take away from their traditional music type to more electronic. But a few songs are truly passion infused. In 1 day I must have listened to the entire thing half a dozen times or more.
1455523550|3.0|Like I said, it's a good story. I enjoyed the characters and felt like I wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next. It starts out a little slow, but gradually picks up. While I liked it, I became annoyed several times at the level of detail being provided when it was not necessary. We don't need an explanation of what s'mores are! Sometimes I feel like Sparks writes things that people in their 20's and 30's these days do not say. I tried to get beyond that and just enjoy the story line, which I was able to do.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|If you have a brain and want to be insulted, then watch this movie. There was a ton of stupidity, for example shotgun shells for a rifle, but the last straw for me was getting out of a freezing river and laying down to relax on the riverbank without a shiver. Anyone who did that would be dead in less than 15 minutes. Any sane person would be jumping up and down, ripping their wet clothes off and fighting to start a fire. I could write about the crazy and unrealistic wolf behavior shown in this movie but I won't dignify that with a discussion. It was simply absurd.<br />I enjoy a realistic depiction of nature and survival. If that is what you like, then steer clear of this trash.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Una imagen soberbia en los dos primeros cap&iacute;tulos de la saga, en los dos &uacute;ltimos es mas que buena, lo mejor es la cantidad  de material adicional ,los que transforman esta versi&oacute;n en una  &#34;must own&#34;  de tu coleccion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is straight its not as hyper as ithought it was gonna be but its not bad eathier. I like the fact thy you can save yourself w/o having to by wings and keep tapping the screen to get them wings ! but yeah iwould recommend this game to all temple run users!:))
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|una edici&oacute;n al nivel de la antolog&iacute;a alien en cuanto a material adicional y imagen, sin duda de los mejores bluray producidos , el punto mas fuerte del combo, ya que es exclusiva de esta versi&oacute;n, lo &uacute;nico que baja la puntuaci&oacute;n es  la falta del covert art de la version UK.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read every thing Vince Flynn has written and especially enjoy this series. Looking forward to his next effort soon.
0790731940|5.0|This is a very awesome movie! It got here early and it works and looks like new, am very happy with this movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun to play I recommend you get this game for your children to play against their friends and get the highest score.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's incredibly addicting. One time I stayed up till 1 in the morning just to beat someone's score. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00422LESO|5.0|The story started out a little slow, but it just kept getting better.  I loved the last part of the book.  I could not stop reading it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i like it because its fun and it something todo and i also like the way it's setup the name of it just make t fun subway surfers i cool
1616550414|5.0|This highly-anticipated book finally came in the mail.  It was totally worth pre-ordering. High quality packaging, and not a scratch on it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's better than temple run. It is one of my favorite games. It is much harder though. It is very exciting especially when you go through  tunnel.
B0015AARJI|5.0|MUY BUEN PRODUCTO. funciona perfectamente, el tiempo de entrega fue rapido. compre desde venezuela 100% recomendado. . . . .
B009X011UQ|5.0|It works good i didnt have any problems and it didn't add any weight to it. So i think its a good product.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best 50 Year Anniversary film ever!<br />So many reference from the classic films.... This is a must recommend film to watch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest game ever. I like temple run 2 and things like that but this is amazing! I play this game every day after school before school and during an free time. I say, \\"If you want a fun game that never gets old then her take it. One thing that is cool is the place. Right now it is on Rio! So much fun. New cop New dog and New place! So if you are reading this and you don't have this game ,get it NOW! Thank you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A friend recommended this book & I'm soooo grateful she did. This was a beautiful love story with some very sad happenings. I totally was  not expecting what happened to Sky. I really wish the story didn't have to end. I will definitely be reading it again in the future.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game subways surfers is fun and for most ages anyone who reads this should know that I definitely recommend this app to anyone!! Thank you.:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing, I like how the background always changes.For February i think they should have couples and they run together holding hands.it could either be a two player or stay the same game<br /><br />THE END THAT'S MY REVIEW
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I also have a few of my friends playing so its quite fun. Thank you!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's addictive. OMG! Hard for me to stop playing.<br />Lots lots of fun. Actually relaxing!<br />I play at night before bed.<br />Great concentration game!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Super easy to install and use. Finding and transferring files on any of my android devices is a snap. I use it all the time backup apps and email/copy .apks between devices.<br /><br />Can't sing its praises enough!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wish it didn't take so long to do things<br />Fun game something to do when bored and give  some responsibility
1451695195|4.0|I have read most of Dr. Raymond Moody's books (and a few others) about the afterlife, and I believe that the afterlife is real, as we Christians learn from the Bible and other sources. I am an Engineer with scientific training, and also believe what science can explain. But Dr. Eben Alexander's account is one of the best proofs that Heaven does exists.<br /><br />The book switches many times between the medical explanations and his family's worries about his illness, and his description of the afterlife. The vast amount of medical terms will sometimes go overboard and distract from enjoying the rest of the book, but I decided to skim over it and read more of his narrations.<br /><br />One of his strong points during the narrative is the continued presence of a young girl (on Butterfly Wings as he described it) that accompanied him during his experience, yet he reports many times that he didn't recognize the face nor remember anyone that looked like her, thus he didn't know why she was with him. The last chapter (35) has the answer. When I read that part, I was drowning in tears!<br /><br />I hope that there is a documentary produced about his experience as other has done before. Anyone who has experienced such a journey (an NDE as science describe them), or has read previous books on the same subject will see and understand his conclusions, since they all have equal descriptions and cover the same events, including the identity of the \\"girl\\".<br /><br />If someone else reads the book and posts another review, please don't tell the end! Let every new reader enjoy that part and intensively feel the revelation that proves that Heaven does exist!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|If you've seen the movie, read the book.  Pi's thoughts are well worth the read.  Really hard to put it down.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|Tried this an an alarm clock. Worked fine Monday - Thursday. Friday morning  I look at the clock and it's an hour past my wake time. I open White Noise and the damn &quot;rate me&quot; nag screen is there. I guess that stopped the alarm from going off.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is awesome.  I use it daily for my devotions away from home.  Highly recommend to everyone looking for a great Bible resource.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|This is a great album as well as Mob Rules and Live Evil. I would've to have loved to have seen Dio with Black Sabbath.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story line, acting, and setting.<br /><br />Love sitting and watching with my wife... ;-)<br /><br />If the English intrigue you at all, watch this...
B000002L61|5.0|Great album, great singer and this was my first concert, Totaly awesome, I can't wait to get the rest of his albums.
B005LAIISA|4.0|This was a really cute movie but I didn't think it was as good as the previous ones. There was lots of adventure and hilarious moments and I did enjoy it very much.
B000002IGV|5.0|This was my favorite album from Twisted Sister I wish I could've seen them in concert, maybe some day. Cool.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The sequel is just as riveting. The characters are more alive, if that's possible. You want to cheer them on, and see the downfall of the villains.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|Didn't know this band until a few months ago (Dec 2012) and can't stop listening to this album. Really relaxing but still fun
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A wonderful read. And scary.the characters and the settings come alive in your mind. A book for all ages. Loved it.
014241543X|4.0|Rating: 4<br />Tissues: 8<br /><br />The Low Down: What if you got to relive your past? Learning to play the cello, meeting your boyfriend for the first time, being with your best friend? What if you got to watch your mother's strength, your dad's energy, your little brother's unconditional love? How about if you get to hear what your family, friends and acquaintances have to say about you? What if this can only happen because you are in a coma?<br /><br />Mia's family has been in a horrific car accident. What's strange is while walking the scene, she discovers her own body, lying there. Soon she is en route to the hospital, and over the next day she realizes that no matter how much her friends and family want her to stay, the final decision is up to her.<br /><br />[I know that is such a short description, but there is so much that I don't want to tell you so can have the experience of reading it yourself. There are many flashbacks and stories that will alternate breaking your heart and giving you goose bumps.]<br /><br />Best Thang `Bout It: The manner the story is told. I love that she can walk around and hear what people are saying; I love the flashbacks. And Adam is the best soon-to-be-a-rock-star boyfriend ever found in print. Best friend, Kim, ain't no slouch either. In fact, the secondary characters are all very well-developed, one of my personal \\"Signs of a Great Story.\\"<br /><br />I'm Cranky Because: Honestly, I don't really enjoy crying while reading. I wear glasses when I read, and the sheer annoyance of having to stop reading, take the glasses off, blot my eyes, and put them on seriously slows me down. *Sigh* #NotEvenARealProblem<br /><br />To Read or Not To Read: If you like heart-tugging sadness, overwhelming love and great people, then what are you waiting for?<br /><br />If I Stay by Gayle Forman was published April 2, 2009 by Dutton Juvenile.<br /><br />Genre: Young Adult Fiction Contemporary Romance Tragedy<br />Ages: 14 and up<br />You Might Want to Know: Nothing of noteto Know: Nothing of note
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great end, and it leaves you wishing for more. The movies, the first was good, will not stand up the the actual print. Highly recommend this series of books.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Awesome game for kindle fire but it can't update it to 0.6.0 but other than that a awesome game if you find how to update it for minecraft please comment thanks
B004UID2LC|5.0|Love it for finding things about everyday events . It's fun when you want to look at nostalgia. Good buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandpa showed me this game on his iPad and he plays it and he told me to see if I can get it and with excitement I finally found it and my cousins showed me how to play it on my Acer tablet it was awesome playing and seeing mobs!!great app!!!;)
B00B4W4UAY|5.0|Ich habe meine CD schon seit Mitte der Woche aus England, da es dort früher erschienen ist.<br />Nach mehrmaligem Hören bin ich total begeistert und das Album wird einfach nicht langweilig.<br />Chris Ousey macht hier als Sänger einer seiner besten Jobs, ich finde sogar noch ein Tacken besser als auf seinem 2011 Soloalbum.<br />Jeder der Classic Rock/Blues Rock mag wird von diesem Album begeistert sein, da es keinen Ausfall hat.<br />Das Album kann man also von Anfang bis Ende durchhören, ohne das man dazu verleitet wird die Skip-Taste zu betätigen.<br />Das Gitarrenspiel von/zwischen/mit Mick Moody und Laurie Wisefield ist einfach Klasse.<br />Ich finde hier wirkt nichts aufgesetzt. Ein Album für die Ewigkeit.<br />In Japan ist übrigens ein anderer Bonustrack (A Breath Away) enthalten.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I tried it and it so boring and its hard to control your character its nothing like minecraft.minecraft is wayyy better I wish I could give it 0 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like it better then the first its alittle more challenging then the first temple run which makes it more fun to play. though i think theybshould have kept the invincibility instead of replacing it with the shield
B009LROCJI|5.0|My husband bought this album and hasn't stopped listening to it since.  He has never enjoyed string quartets, but this album has helped him appreciate Vivaldi.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game because it is easyer  to mine blocks and when it turns to night it is easyer to survive because the mobs are not as good as shots like they are in the computer version. only bad thing is that there aren't. as many things to craft and there's no armorial but still a great game.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Just as I remeber it. Have been having a hard time putting it down. So much fun. Worth ever cent of $15.99
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Im the type person who needs to have noise to go to bed and stay asleep without waking up.Its a hereditary I think,but who cares where it came from I have it and I now I have to feed its hunger.I usually got bed with the radio on or Tv but that doesn't work because I usually end up screaming at the radio or muttering underneath my breath at stupid sports radio callers until 2 in the morning.So I was looking for an app that had calming noises to put my mind in a cloud of sleep and leave it there until I need to wake up to my &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; themed alarm clock.<br /><br />And indeed I found one:White Noise.WN has many nature orientated SFX:rain,heavy rain,T -storm,ocean waves, waterfall,small waterfall,rain hitting against a car and may more plus,some you can download from there website.These sound effects easily put me down to bed in peaceful, mythical setting of my mind.I would reccomend this to anyone who needs noise to go to bed.<br />Pros:Peaceful ,soothing sound effects,a library of sound to choose from even some to download from there website.An alarm clock included as well.<br /><br />Cons:Asks too many times to rate the app.Sound is too low on some sound effects.<br /><br />Overall:I would recommend this for all noise needing sleepers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so awesome! But it is a lot like temple run. It is adicting like temple run as well.
B00005S6K6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It moves rather slow, but the actors are wonderful.  I have watched this movie since it first came out and still enjoy it.  It's a good, clean love story.
0307887448|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!<br /><br />Totally awesome mix of future and past! The futuristic elements mixed in with vintage knowledge is a good balance - even if you dont know everything about vintage computers, video games, music or past pop culture this book still holds your interest. There is enough varriety that you are bound to recognize a lot of the references.<br /><br />Can so see this becoming a movie!
1616550414|5.0|Awesome addition to any Legend of Zelda collection. It does focus a bit much on Skyward Sword though... Ah well.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This was to hard for me to use. I would rather use a real book instead of this app. Horrible.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book is amazing. It has something for everyone. With the action and the romance, it is the best of both worlds
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The ending of course leaves you wanting to read more. I should have purchased the trilogy from the start. Good read.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I was talked into seeing the movie.  Not my kind of show.  Had a few laughs but that was about it.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|An adult program with a fantasy feel.  It is based on books that I have not read but I may try reading them now.
034580404X|5.0|Chose this rating because I love this set of books. Very well written  easy to get lost in it. I hope this author (E L James) will write more books. I have put her with list of my favorite authors. I would recommend this set to my friends.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|BLS is a must if you re wanting to get in shape. As a result of his studies And own experiencie, Mike teaches as an expert on how to train and eat. Makes you feel like if he were your own personal trainer. Cant wait to read more of his books
B000H5V8DG|3.0|Everything went ok with purchasing etc but when the article arrived the box was squashed and the top part needs to be stuck back on. The reason I purchased this pack was for the Rambaldi artifact box and it was for a present. I realise that it had a long way to travel but I am disappointed it was not packed a lot better. All the discs seem ok and in good order. I will think twice about buying this way again.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Anyone who likes the Twilight Saga will like this one. It was beautifully portraid in movie form. And the ending was great!
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Not much can be said about the product itself. Got here on time, came in a nice package. As far as the book goes, it is a fantastically written book. Richard Dawkins did a great job, not to mention the bookcover is gorgeous!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I just had to keep reading this serise.  the last chaper in this book was a little strange with the author talking to the reader, but now book 5 is a must.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I  just  downloaded  this app. It works great !! I enjoy Mahjong Games and have alot on my KindleFire HD.  Downloads fast. Graphics r Great !!  Its FREE cant beat that  !!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a little juvenile at first, but could not put it down.  It was a great story that you just had to finish.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book tells a true and sad story about the life of Charlie. He is a troubled child which puzzles even himself. We get to see his story unfold and how he feels about being a true wallflower. A beautiful and gripping story of a life turned around!
B0091QSNEE|4.0|Based on a recommendation by a friend, I decided to grab this for my son. He loves it.<br />Even though its target age group is younger, my daughter loves it too... so much so that it's almost impossible to get it away from her!<br />Recommended for younger kids (up to about 5 years old), however older kids may still enjoy it for the cute graphics and simple gameplay.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|First, you need to know - I AM NOT A GAMER.  In fact, you might consider me the ANTI-GAMER.<br /><br />I have a belief that most of these games are a total waste of your brain.  Well, The Lost City caught my eye.  You have to maneuver around the game and find objects and essentially solve sequential puzzles.  My little girl and I had so much fun.  Buy this game without hesitation.  Actually, let me take that back.  Buy The Secret of Grisly Manor first.  This is the 2nd game in the series and it is much better than Grisly.  So if you go out of sequence, it will not give you time to enjoy Grisly.  And Grisly is worth the money to spend first.<br /><br />Anyway, again my 8 year old had a blast solving the games and puzzles and going back n forth to the different seasons (you will understand once you play this game).<br /><br />Grisly took about 2 hours to finish.  Lost City took about 5 hours to finish.  And yes, you can play again.  Lost City changes each time you play it, slightly.<br /><br />Good luck.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's intriguing and addictive.it temps you to go for the tips& jumps just when a train comes along &wipes you out. I also likes that the scenery changes as you go along.I also likes the boots and surfboard,they give an extra kick to your workouts along the way.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Interface is wonderful on my Droid Tablet.  Drag and drop various elements to create new elements.  Controls are intuitive.  Lots of options.  Features make total sense.  If you are to the end of an elements usefulness, it turns RED when you click it or has a RED asterick in the upper right hand corner.  So if you add all the elements to the workplace, the game knows to NOT add these end of the life elements.  Very nice.  Again, super intuitive.  Zed has done a great job.<br /><br />If you got snookered into buying Doodle God and you are a bit shy to buy a similar game - go for it with this one.  Excellent interface.  At least on the Droid.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|much better than temple run android.  much smoother, better graphics and easier controls.  if you enjoy temple run,you will love this.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I use it to study, sleep, or just relax.  It's better to use head phones to get the full benefits, but I enjoy it at my bed side as a sleep machine.
B008YI91HS|5.0|Probably the greatest achievement in special effects, of all time. Back when CGI was new, Spielberg crafted it into his existing toolbox of FX masterfully, and the story is timeless. If you haven't seen it, fix that now
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game I recommend you to make  the next destination Italy o really wan  to see how it look
B000YJ54DU|5.0|This is a great read and keeps one engrossed throughout. Just one of the greats from Child. Cannot put down till done.
B006QLH7O4|4.0|Like the SAW series or the original Gore movie, Night of the Living Dead (which I'd like to see in 3D), you know it's coming when the hairs on your arms stand up... I'd sure love it if they could redo all the great disaster/horror/gore movies in Blu-Ray 3D...in fact, I have a computer which can use the 3D Nvidia glasses, and can take Alien/Aliens on Blu-Ray and \\"magically\\" convert it to 3D, or even IMHO the greatest Sci-Fi \\"scary movie\\" of all time, \\"The Thing\\".<br /><br />But a conversion from flat 2D to extrapolated 3D will never equal true stereoscopic \\"filming\\" of 3D (HD digital of course).  At the end of this movie, they have a sound<br />track of AC/DC singing \\"if you want blood, you've got it\\" along with multiple gory death clips....like NASCAR cars flipping over in crashes, etc.  So you know the movie has to be good.... and as far as realistic 3D gore, it is great......
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most Adictive game I have ever played.  I recomend everyone to try it.  Our family is trying to beat each others score so that adds a fun twist.  There are no bothersome ads and no upgrades the ga.e is free.  Love it
B007MU85D0|5.0|I've been listening to this album on repeat almost ever since I bought it, and it holds up well under pressure.  It's somehow ethereal and rock-y at the same time; introspective and hopeful.  The voices of the two lead singers complement each other  perfectly.<br /><br />I've actually been recommending it to my friends, but ended up just buying extra albums to send to them because there don't seem to be good quality preview videos online.  (YouTube, for example, only seems to have live videos - I enjoy them, but it's not the best way to introduce someone to the band.)<br /><br />I hope to see more great music from Of Monsters and Men!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game and I can play it for hours. Nice upgrade system and the variety is great compared to Temple Run 1
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This is a must for any GoPro owner, not only to see what you're shooting but being touch makes it perfect
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This the best you ever made I can't stop play it i love this game I play it day and night
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay, I am a huge fan of Temple Run, and Angry Gran. This game is like a mix of both games. I highly recommend. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! I have had 0 problems with this app.<br /><br />SUMMERY: Downloads fast, addicting, amazing, and fun!! GET APP!!! In fact, I'm surprised its free; a game with graphics this good ought to be $2.00 . Overall, IMPRESSED!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this one better than the first one. I was happy that it gave me goals that I could see that needed to get done for each level instead of guessing what the next goal was needed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|well this is a.gasometer game I love it angry Gran is good to and subway surfers but I love this game I recomind it
B0000C3I6U|4.0|The DVD came very quickly. It was in excellent condition and played flawlessly. The movie itself was exactly what I expected, a documentary on bodybuilding right before the world's fascination with muscular physiques and physical fitness went viral.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|UPDATE 2: After reading my update about the adapter no longer working, Anker support contacted me directly and sent out a replacement unit. I still could not get the replacement unit to work. At first. But then I found a newer driver (can't find the release date on it, but I swear it was either new or I'd been looking on the wrong page for 3 weeks) and now everything works. Thanks to Anker for standing behind their product and staying in touch. Review changed back to 5 stars.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />UPDATE: Had given this 5 stars. Then it died two days after the return window expired. I was fortunate to find the other adapter that I had thought I'd lost (and had ordered this to replace), but now I have to get warranty service instead of a refund. Not pleased.<br /><br />-----<br />Original:<br />What is there to say, really? It works on my current gen (late 2012) MacBook Pro. Had to download a driver, but that was it. Apple's only gigabit Ethernet adapter solution uses Thunderbolt and costs a chunk more.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I am a big history buff and love historical fiction. I quickly fell in love with this series. Even my husband is watching with me. I like that I can watch when it is convenient to me. This is a series I will watch over and over.
0765325950|3.0|The story comes to a conclusion, yes, but after 23 years, I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. Maybe Jordan's notes weren't enough to create a fully fledged WoT novel, or maybe Sanderson was so rushed that he didn't pay attention, but the way things were wrapped up felt rushed and like they just pulled plots out of nowhere. Characters changed the personalities and thought processes that had followed them for over 2 decades just for the last book, and the way Rand gets through the Last Battle felt like a space filler. This will be a loved last part of the series for me, and I will collect if with the rest of them, but that does not mean I enjoyed reading it; in fact, I was quite disappointed.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I had this series recommended to me and decided to take the plunge. I enjoyed every episode! There are lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing what is going to happen next!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Each of the songs on this CD are entertaining. Sara's voice has a rich tonal quality that is set off by her heartfelt songwriting gift. I love the song &#34;Gravity.
B00AGKH6D8|2.0|I know I was spoiled being introduced to Joe B  via the &#34;Live at Rockpalast (2006)&#34; DVD... That DVD will always be a favorite of mine and EVERYONE that's watched/listened to it.  From start to finish it's a jaw dropping display of incredible talent. That DVD has appeal across generations.  Call me a sucker and a glass 1/2 full kinda guy. I keep buying each JB offerring in the hopes it'll be &#34;anything/something&#34; like &#34;Live at Rockpalast&#34;..  Nothing lives up to that and this latest one is the farthest away. It's in a word &#34;boring&#34;.  Elongated transcendental intro's and then super laid back &#34;something&#34;..  It's hard to relate exactly what this is.  Everyone has an opinion. This is not anything I personally enjoy.<br /><br />Joe.. Get your old band back together and please get back to rock'n out.
1442346949|5.0|I have to say I learned a lot about Steve Jobs.  Good to hear on the way to and from work.
B009CPES4I|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a fun movie. Great cast and beautiful scenery but no surprises here in the way of the story.
B00006AW63|1.0|Not playable on US players.  Was not clearly specified at time I purchased and my grandchildren were very disappointed at Christmas.  Had opened the DVD to attempt to play so could not return.  It is more clearly identified as not for US players now but was NOT at time that I purchased.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. When my friend plays and try`s to beat me but I always beat him I love this game thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was my first eBook purchase for my new Kindle PaperWhite. I'm trying to get myself back into the habit of reading on a regular basis (for enjoyment, not work related reading). I read through this book easily and thoroughly enjoyed it to boot. Very good book and it'll keep your interest throughout.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|Okay so the first time seeing this movie I thought it was okay to good. The beginning part was entertaining and lots of action. The second part though wasn't that good to me. The second time I watched the movie I realized the second part of the film when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were looking for the holkrons (sp?)  was incredibly boring. Yes they have to hide from the bad guys but sitting and standing around in and out of a tent for idk 20-40 minutes of the film isn't very entertaining. I know this is based off the book and maybe that part was in the book (idk I never read any but the first and second I believe) but it was still quite dull.<br /><br />Then the last part of the movie it seemed to kinda pick up but well unfortunately when you start getting into it the movie ends and teases you with a type of &#34;watch the rest of the movie in part 2 whenever we release that.&#34; Yes I know part 2 of the movie is already out but that's how I would have felt if I went to the movie at the movie theater. I wanted to wait to see this movie once I could watch part 2 with it cause I knew something like this would happen.<br /><br />I had some extra credit for movies but there wasn't much to pick from on amazon's renting list. I wanted to rent part 1 and the part 2 movie but like I figured it part 2 was unavailable at the time.<br /><br />I would say the one thing that really stood out for me in this movie was 1. Bill Nighy who you see right away in the film as the Minister Rufus Scrimgeour or you might recognize him as the vampire from those vampire movies. I don't know why but I really enjoyed seeing him on screen and was a bit disappointed you don't see him all that much. He really does have a very iconic face and voice.<br /><br />And 2. The story you hear after the second part of the movie which talks about the Dealthy Hollows and where the story came from with the 3 wizards and Death. The animation and the story were very enjoyable and was looking forward to it the second time I watched the movie.<br /><br />The ending of the movie could be quite sad to some people I wont spoil what happens you have to watch the movie to find out.<br /><br />I found it extremely odd most popular reviews on other sites didn't really tell you anything. It was mostly &#34;the movie was great... looking forward to part 2... you should go see it&#34; and that was it. No mention of any problems or anything really. I was almost sure one of them would mention the boring part of the movie where they are just standing around inside or outside of the tent for a good long measure.<br /><br />Its still a good enough movie to see especially if you have already seen the ones before it. I look forward to part 2 because iv already heard its pretty good and from the trailers and such it looks like it will be good and much more action packed.
0425263916|5.0|My wife usually reads other authors.  This was recommend and so we bought it on Amazon.  It was a good deal
B0086700CM|5.0|and addicting.  Graphics are good.  Great way to pass the time at class.  Great distraction to forget about all the BS is life.
0425263908|5.0|My wife enjoyed this book so much, that she has read it several times and is ready to read it again.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend for a Valentine's gift, he got it early...couldn't wait! He loves this movie for the jets, flight action !  the motorcycle and of course Kelly and Tom.It's a good love story for the girls, and action packed for the guys.
B008MILL9G|5.0|I got this movie at a great deal of $10. I've been looking for these movies everywhere. I really enjoyed Ocean's 11 and thought 13 was good. 12... I could do without, but it was thrown into the great deal. The blu-ray quality is fine. The HD isn't anything to be impressed by IMO, but it doesn't look bad. I just felt that I needed to add these to my BR collection.
B007JNR518|5.0|Such a great movie! robert Redford at one of his best roles, and interesting to see Scarlett Johanssen as a young teen and compare her to today's roles, just great! add on a love for horses and beautiful western scenery,and backround music....just super!
0425241505|4.0|I found this series tripping around on Goodreads after reading the GA Aiken Dragon Kin series it was listed  under \\"readers enjoyed similar books\\" category.  I thought I would give it a whirl, I thought I would check out another dragon/shifter series only a little more UF rather than just straight fantasy.  While I did enjoy the book it wasn't GA Aiken caliber either.  This series takes place in NYC and has all kinds of paranormal elements, fey, weres although they are called Wyr in this series and they are all divided into different demesnes for each race.<br /><br />Pia, our heroine is a half human half Wyr with some unique abilities like being able to get through any locked door.  Her ex boyfriend blackmails her into stealing from Dragos the uber alpha dragon head of the were demesne.  Pia is a really lousy thief as she takes only a penny and leaves a note of apology behind.  Dragos is pissed!  He lets out a roar that damages high rises throughout Manhattan and comes after Pia with all his resources.  They both discover that Pia was really just a pawn in a pending war with the Dark fey.  While on  this little adventure they discover their attraction to each other and ooooooh it is hottttt!<br /><br />Two things I really like about this book are; first I loved the characters.  While PNR is filled with kick butt chicks Pia is definitely not that girl.  She is more crafty than she is direct and with Dragos and his crew she is largely outclassed in the brawn department, but she still manages to stand up for herself and hold her own she also has some secrets about her background and what type of wyr she is.  Dragos is the ultimate alpha male, a powerful billionaire as old as time and a feared leader. Oh and he's huge and hotttttt!  The supporting characters were just as likable particularly Tricks,  the guys were fun to read about as they warmed up to Pia.<br /><br />The other thing I enjoyed about Dragon Bound is that the romance was really well balanced with the overall story.  While I enjoy a good romance if it's the only element to the story I get bored stupid.  I liked the adventures Pia and Dragos had together as well as they chemistry between them.  The book was really well written and the world Thea created, intriguing  the characters setup the next books is the series.  I will grab the next one based on how much I liked this one.rall story.

B000HKW7E0|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time about 5 years ago, and tried to catch it yearly around the holidays on regular TV, now I have my own copy and love it.so funny!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What a wonderful series!  The characters are well developed and the story line grabs you and will not let go.  Highly recommended.
B001R6AW18|5.0|No better than the original! Minus all the gimics and digitalization used today, It's my favoritive movie to watch after the Macy's thangsgiving Day parade. A yearly tradition.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It was a fake!  Did the water test and it leaked.  I sent it back.  No such thing as a bargain!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is going to be the best game and I have been playing with the game since I got it on my kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game. A nice way to pass the time when you are waiting for something. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B0033TJATW|4.0|At first when I opened up the package it had Asian writing on it. Which made me freak out because I thought it would be in subtitle only. Except once I put it into my DVD player everything was in English. I loved watching it and everything is as I remember when my brothers and I would watch it growing up I'm 28 years old now. Overall this was a good buy and I'm glade I bought it.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn has written an outstanding novel with a real surprise. Just as the reader has<br />begun to really dislike the main character, it turns out that he is not the bad person you think<br />he is.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Love this game. Very addicting. Great storyline.<br />Love all G5 games. The graphics and strategy is so much better than most other games made by other companies.
0385536828|4.0|I have read most of Ian McEwan's novels. I enjoyed Saturday, The Comfort of Strangers, and Atonement.<br />I did not like his last two novels, On Chesil Beach and Solar. I loved this one. McEwan's novels each deal<br />with very different subjects and characters. His main character in this book is very likeable and interesting.<br />As usual, there are surprises in store for the reader. This is one of the best features of McEwan's novels.<br />He almost always shocks the reader at some point with an unexpected event or outcome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|First before I played temple run 2 I had to play temple run 1. But when I finally tired it it was so great I love it.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Entertaining, but not a bright one... The time travel mechanic shatters like a fabrege egg if you start analyzing it.<br /><br />Fun movie regardless. Worth a look.
B007W7P5L8|2.0|Marware Vibe Case is a nice shade of purple but is not real leather. It may be easy to drop because it does not have a security strap.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game because it contains fun roundness entertainment joy and happiness if I had to give up this game I would really hate that and that is why I like this game so much.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|They made some good changes on the game while keeping the fun. Love the new cave section. Looking forward to the upgrades as the game progresses.
B00474IVGA|5.0|I suggest you watch the movie and then decide if you like the music well enough to buy the soundtrack.
0740797719|5.0|This book is an inspiration in itself as the artist has such an imagination! The mastry of light and its effects on color are truely different and more in depth than any other book I have seen. The how to is lacking a little, but all and all this book is a must if you really want to understand light and painting.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I loved playing this app when I first got it and had a good time trying to complete the missions but then one day when I clicked on the app, all my information was lost. It had the default character and no multiplier! I was at x21 and it reset to none! Great app and very addicting but I hope your game doesn't reset on you!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Combersome to access...frustrating setup...didn't use it.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  words (to complete requirement)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun and really hard to stop playing. It is the only game on my kindle fire HD.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|This is by far the best album by The Script. I bought it on release day back in 2011. My favorites are If You Ever Come Back, Science & Faith, Dead Man Walking, and Bullet From a Gun. They're all good, though. This is one of the best albums of 2011 and one of my all-time favorite albums. It's a must buy. Kudos to The Script for creating such a great piece of work.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|A history of Aztecs seldom covered in most fiction. Zoe gives us colorful, likeable characters. Will likely watch for subsequent novels in the series.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This has opened my eyes to a new way of living and showing love. For years, I have been showing my husband love through \\"Acts of Service\\", (my way of feeling loved). All the while he 's been feeling unloved, because his love language is \\"Quality Time\\"! Wow! A definite eye opener! Will definitely recommend this book to all my family and friends. LET THERE BE LOVE!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is really fun. I am glad I got it. The best thing about it is that it was free! GET THIS APP!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I thought that &#34; Proof of Heaven&#34; was extremely limited in its discussion of his metaphysical experience and more centered on the technical side of his illness. Further, I thought that the latter aspect was extremely repetitive and boring.  Dr. Alexander seemed to be summarizing &#34;Conversations with God&#34; ---you are loved, you have nothing to fear, you can do no wrong, etc....<br /><br />I would not recommend this short read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Any body that wants to try subway surfers should get it if your sneaky like I am this is your match you will love this trust me
B007BFSYMS|5.0|very peaceful app with a wide variety of choices. I happen to favor the crickets...frogs...and my daughter loves the purring cat! got if as a free app of the day but its well worth the 1.99.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very nice package will consider as a gift for friends and family. thank you! Recommended for everyone that enjoys blue ray movies
B0071UF2YG|5.0|this book is good for anyone interested in economic and current economic policy. Ha joon  Chang is one of the leading figures in heterodox economy theory specialized in economic development.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I love this book it is brilliant Jack London has an amazing choice of wording he uses flow Andes style
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This delightful game is very interesting and many people should play. I really like the different backgrounds and daily challenges. The only thing I thing that i think should change is the Times between the daily challenges.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Flynn has a way of making the reader fall into the twisted world she captures. It's fun to become lost in her writing and you find yourself connecting with the characters and their oddities. Great book; fast read.
1616550414|5.0|I just received this book in the mail yesterday and it was everything i thought it would be. Lots of amazing artwork with little tidbits on how each design reached its final form. Definitive chronology of the series which is known for having a confusing timeline! The cover is also beautiful to look at. If you are a fan of any part of this series I definitely recommend picking this up!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did it again! This book was amazing.. The way he wrote Katie 's character was both heart wrenching and beautifully written. Amazing book!
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Navigating this Bible is not intuitive.  Moving from one paragraph to another is easy, but moving to another book is challenging.  It takes a lot of trying different things to get to where I want.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game especially the Rio version. I play it every day. I miss it at school every day day
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Easy to use and useful.<br />looks clean and without other noise.<br />I will suggest my friend to try it.<br />hope it could broaden to use in other Android device.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Held attention very well, was hard to put down. One of those rare sequels that is better than the original. I found beautiful creatures kind of angsty. Beautiful Darkness was original and exciting. Being from Georgia, I enjoyed the references to Savannah.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love sws(subwaysurfs) and I wanted to give them a 100% rate[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] and I love the music that you guys put in there and how do I get tyixy email at tychiusr@aol.com
B000VZYPB4|5.0|At first I thought this might be way tooo nerdy but honestly after a few episodes I'm really enjoying the series.  It's light yet portrays an Aspie really well.
0007447868|1.0|I started reading fantasy and sci-fi in the late 60s. I've read dozens of fantasy and sci-fi series over the decades. I usually read LOTR every winter, which practice I began over a decade before any of the Peter Jackson movies came out. I was lucky enough that an aunt read the Narnia books aloud to me in '66; that helped me get an early start. I know decent fantasy writing. Here's my take on A Feast for Crows and the Song of Ice & Fire series:<br /><br />Book 1: incredible.<br /><br />Book 2: more incredible.<br /><br />Book 3: the first one hundred pages or so are a bit slow, but the second half of Book 3 is better than anything before it, and some of the BEST fantasy writing EVER.<br /><br />Book 4 (A Feast For Crows): (1) chapter after chapter centered on some character you barely know, interacting with characters you've never heard of (and likely will never hear about again), participating in absolutely no action whatsoever, culminating in a final sentence or two at the end of the chapter that MIGHT be exciting or interesting; (2) the approximately dozen major characters from the first three books that you've come to know and love are nowhere to be found, only granted a chapter maybe every 8 or 10 chapters, so that by the time you do get to the next installment of their story (usually 85 pages after the previous) you have completely forgotten not only their plot line but its relevance to and context within the larger story being told; (3) NO twists, NO reversals of fortune, NOTHING of ANY interest; (4) boring, boring, boring, boring, boring.<br /><br />How could a writer stumble like this? What was going on in George R.R. Martin's life at the time this book was written? How could ANY writer with major works under their belt have produced such a gut-wrenchingly slow-moving, pointless, and ultimately destructive (with regard to dragging down the entire series into a morass of meaningless drivel) piece of fantasy writing?<br /><br />I was in love with this series.I was in love with the TV show. I was determined to push through Book 4, in order to keep going; my reading of it had been reduced to skimming each chapter just to get through Book 4. But today I decided Enough Is Enough. Reading this book is a complete waste of time. I'm done--with Book 4, with the series, and it's doubtful I'll even be able to continue watching the TV show.<br /><br />Please consider my review and other detailed critical reviews here before taking on Book 4. In my opinion, this book COMPLETELY and utterly ruins the story, and puts such a bad taste in your mouth that it degrades the pleasure derived from the stellar quality of the first three books (especially Book 3).<br /><br />People often say, \\"Well, the movie ruined the book for me.\\" In this case, the following applies: \\"Well, Book 4 ruined the entire thing for me.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun. Very additive. Love the new feature with the world tour. The daily missions are also good as well. Great game for any age.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A rather depressing book but I couldn't stop reading. Great insight into teens dealing with cancer. You should try it.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I purchased this movie and was really happy with the content, packaging, arrival was early and if you are into Tom Cruz (my wife hates him but I love his movies) you need to watch this movie.  We have a large collection of his work (the whole Mission Impossible series) and this is a good addition to our collection.  Well done movie and I'll watch it more than once.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|This is an excellent medium budget flash for Nikon DSLR cameras. It can be used TTL, Manual or as a commander. It also works well wirelessly through the Nikon builtin flash. It has some features over the SB-900 like a menu button but it has a lower output.<br /><br />Another issue with this flash is the on/off/remote switch is not easy to use. I don't know why they made it so difficult. It's basically flat to where you have to turn it with your finger tip. Plus it locks in remote mode so you have to push a tiny button first.<br /><br />It does work very well in TTL mode and as a wireless flash through the builtin flash. (Note: all nikon wireless flash require direct line of site. To improve that you need to look into something like the Pocket Wizard which also allows TTL or the Cowboy Studio wireless system which is manual only.)<br /><br />But is it worth saving the couple hundred dollars or so over the SB-900 or the newer SB-910? I have had mine for about two years now and I have to say I wish I'd spent the extra money for the output and the fact that the 900 does a better job telling you the distance.<br /><br />Excellent flash but my next one will be the SB-910.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I love this stuff. I have used some of the other cheaper stuff before (the white stuff) and they are okay. This stuff definitely is worth the price. When used in my HTPC it lowered the temps enough to the point that the fan does not ramp up to full blast when just idling. Nice.

B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's alright but it doesn't give you enough variety.  It's the same level over and over again.  If you die, you restart.  Gets old.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I found this thriller to be fantastic.  I was cheering for the main character and unlike the main character, my eyes watered  up at various key events throughout  the course of the book.  The character development was uncanny.  I read weekends and late into the until the book  ended.  The harmonics of characters was a  common thread throughout the book. If you are a fan of Stephen King, you'll love it.  If you aren't really a fan, you will find the depth of character development and suspense to exceed any work he has performed before and you'll become one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is loads of fun and I suggest it to anyone who can't buy the Pc version. the Pc version is still a little better... probably because that's what I'm used to.

We had one other garbage truck that had a broken part called Bruder and they send for the truck fixed it and mailed it back with an extra bruder man for the truck. Best off all I didn't have to pay for any off it and they had it back with in a week.
B0042RJWTM|4.0|This is not so much a movie about the 'passing of the West' as it is a tale about missed opportunities, irresponsibility, foot-loose living and growing old.  Yes, there are so aspects of the West in decline i.e. the small ranches have been bought out by Easterners who are going to put a fence around all their property...but...except for the mood, it is pretty much a standard western.  There are cattle, horses, fights, shoot-em-ups, rustling', bunk houses, saloons, dance hall girls etc.<br /><br />The mood, however, is different than many Westerns and is set by the haunting Mama Cass song \\"With Both Feet Planted Firmly in the Air.\\"  The tale is a tragedy but sometimes fails to maintain the tragic tone.  The Lee Marvin character, Walsh [along with most of the other 'cowboys' in the film]] is as dumb as a stump.  \\"I never thought of asking you to marry me.\\"  He tells the pitiable Francine.  When he does 'think to marry her' but suffers a reverse in his financial plans, he again 'doesn't think of marrying her'--something the unfortunate woman wants desperately--instead he'll be back to marry her in a couple of years after he's made a little money.  Nothing has changed.  Certainly not Walsh.<br /><br />The last part of the movie should have been played as a nonstop downer but, for reasons I truly can't understand, it isn't.  Shorty murders a U.S. Marshal; murders one of his own comrades; and murders Chet.  Walsh, especially enraged at the murder of his old friend, Chet, goes on the lonely path of vengeance.  He intends to kill his good friend--and multiple murderer--Shorty.  His plan falls apart when he learns Francine is 'in a bad way.'  Walsh rides to Francine's side only to find that she has just died.  Inconsolable, he sits by the cold body for hours--maybe, maybe, maybe thinking that she might have died a little happier if he had married her.<br /><br />So far--in terms of the sober mood--OK.  Walsh has screwed up, again, and is paying for it.  Amazingly, the mood shifts dramatically and suddenly to one of Old Hollywood Western confrontation.  Shorty has trailed Walsh back to Francine's because he believes [also hearing of Francine's illness] that is where Walsh will go.  The theme music even changes.  Walsh does his old friend to death in a slaughter house with stampeding cows and slippery blood.  It's hard to imagine that this is the same Walsh who sat desolate at his dead lover's side only minutes before.  As in all Hollywood westerns, the 'good guy' emerges triumphant--but--is Walsh a 'good guy'?hifts dramatically and suddenly to one of Old Hollywood Western confrontation.

B008476HBM|5.0|It's a classic, no two words about it. But most of all, it brings to mind the author (Jane Austen) who managed to intertwine her own experiences into this book (the movie 'Becoming Jane' is worth seeing on the occasion).<br />Brilliant language, captivating dialogs and complexity of feelings.
B004SIP6QI|4.0|This movie was soo hard to find in any local store I searched and I'd been wanting it for my dvd collection ever since the first time I saw this movie.....it's basically about enduring love in a time or war!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm not normally a fan of Stephen King's work.  It seems to me his secondary characters are usually numerous but shallow.  In this case, I found the opposite.  King thankfully avoided jejune conspiracy theories.  He also thankfully avoided the pitfall of trying to explain mechanisms for the impossible.  All in all, a fun read.

B00AGKHFCA|3.0|Tuscan tenor Andrea Bocelli possesses one of the day's greatest, most robust voices.  Bocelli's tone is both rich and inviting.  January 2013's [[ASIN:B00AGKHFCA Passione]], an album of love songs, finds Bocelli honing in on the subtleties of his wonderful instrument as opposed to delivering more powerful, emotional performances.  Given the material and notion of 'love', this subtler approach by Bocelli is appropriate and perfect.  Even so, at times Passione seems too subtle and safe for the prodigious tenor, regardless of vocal pulchritude.  Passione ends up being solid without being revolutionary, yielding some memorable moments. For the most part, the album is pleasant without definitive standouts.<br /><br />\\"Perfidia\\" ('perfidy') is a classic Spanish number from Mexican composer Alberto Borras.  The cut sets the tone, establishing a light percussive groove and subtle arrangement(s) by producer David Foster.  Bocelli never excites here, opting to keep things simple, restrained and classy.  Similarly, \\"Roma Nun Fa' La Stupida Stasera\\" (Italian), is easy-going will little frill. Bocelli plays it cool, adding some accordion into this cut. \\"Champagne\\" proceeds, finding Bocelli inserting more character and nuance into his performance compared to the first two selections.  As always, he complements the Foster and William Ross's orchestral arrangements perfectly. \\"Champagne\\" is a highlight.<br /><br />\\"Anema E Core\\" begins slowly and dramatic, much like an Italian opera.  Soon enough, it settles into a pleasant, light groove.  \\"Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s\\", a duet with Jennifer Lopez is a pleasant surprise. Tongue-in cheek and cutesy, \\"Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s\\" ('perhaps' in English), possesses the most personality of any track from Passione. Lopez and Bocelli's contrasting voices complement one another.  \\"Era Gi&aacute; Tutto Previsto\\" (\\"Already Had All Expected\\") contrasts \\"Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s\\" with balladry. Bocelli often stays in his lower register on this cut. Thankfully, he is given the opportunity to ascend into his brilliant upper tenor near the end. \\"Era Gi&aacute; Tutto Previsto\\" is pretty, though not quite Bocelli's most dynamic effort.<br /><br />\\"Tristeza\\" ('sadness' in Spanish) is a quick-paced, Brazilian cut. Pleasant without innovativeness, \\"Tristeza\\" is one of the better cuts from Passione.  Aside from solid vocals from Bocelli, Dan Higgins's flute feature is a highlight. \\"La Vie en Rose\\", Edith Piaf's signature song, features an Edith Piaf sample of her performing her classic.  While this recording is interesting, Piaf's recording is so aged, that it is conspicuous it's an audio sample Bocelli must interact with vocally.  He does a fine job, but the results are mixed.  Antonio Carlos Jobim classic \\"Corvocado\\" atones, with Nelly Furtado proving another capable duet partner for Bocelli.  The approach remains 'subtle' and 'romantic', but it works well on this number.<br /><br />\\"Sar&aacute; Settembre\\" (September Morn), originally from Neil Diamond's album [[ASIN:B0012GN2ME September Morn]] receives a fine interpretation.  \\"Love in Portofino\\" and \\"Malafemmena\\" are also pleasant, though safe.  \\"Garoto De Ipanema\\" (\\"Girl From Ipanema\\") isn't too shabby while \\"Love Me Tender\\" proves a sound closer.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00AGKHFCA Passione]] is an enjoyable affair.  The main drawback is that it sounds a bit safe, even for a classical tenor. Bocelli still shares his gift capably, but that operatic edge is missed at times on this album. Given the material and conception of this effort, Bocelli still hits most of the right buttons (or notes!).kfully, he is given the opportunity to ascend into his brilliant upper tenor near the end. \\"Era Giá Tutto Previsto\\" is pretty, though not quite Bocelli's most dynamic effort.<br /><br />\\"Tristeza\\" ('sadness' in Spanish) is a quick-paced, Brazilian cut.

B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Canadian sister duo Tegan and Sara follow-up 2009's [[ASIN:B002OHOECC Sainthood]] with 2013's fine offering [[ASIN:B00A4FOWYQ Heartthrob]] via Vapor/Warner Bros. Heartthrob is a brief album (just over 36 minutes) that packs a gutsy punch.  Styled in 80s sensibilities (pop, new-wave, electronic production), the sound may be a contrast for the duo, but it is a welcome one. Heartthrob closes the January 2013 slate of releases exceptionally.<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" opens the effort with a bright synthetic timbre and a driving beat.  Tegan and Sara deliver solid, commanding vocals that are well produced.  The songwriting is notable, particularly the chorus: \\"It's not just all physical / I'm the type who won't get oh so critical / so let's make things physical / I won't treat you like you're oh so typical\\".  New wave influence continues to show on \\"Goodbye Goodbye\\", another crisply produced affair. In addition to another 'hooky' chorus, the bridge stands out, contrasting the verse.  \\"I Was a Fool\\" continues soundness through solid songwriting, compelling vocals, and fine production work. \\"I stuck around / I did behave / I saved you every time / I was a fool for love / I was a fool for love\\" the duo sing on the chorus. Tegan and Sara are three for three.<br /><br />\\"I'm Not Your Hero\\" sports an anthemic pop chorus, continuing lyrics based on romantic themes and the desires of love.  \\"Drove Me Wild\\" is better, amping up the 80s stylings. Tegan and Sara's vocal approach is perfect, with the duo singing things staccato and in distinct fashion.  Catchy and well written, \\"Drove Me Wild\\" is a standout cut. \\"How Come You Don't Want Me\\" loses no luster, sporting slick, electronic production touches.  The vocals features conspicuous processing here, but it suits the overall electronic tilt of this particular cut.  The rhythmic nature of the vocals is a selling point. \\"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\\" epitomizes 80s pop given an archetypical quick tempo and sound.  Like its contemporaries, \\"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\\" is consistent and enjoyable. No misses for Tegan and Sara as of yet.<br /><br />The final three cuts don't lose their 'oomph'. \\"Love They Say\\" may be a shade less compelling than the rest, but not by much. \\"Now I'm All Messed Up\\" stands out, featuring some memorable lyrics throughout: \\"Stay / you'll leave me in the morning anyway / my heart / you'll cut it out you never liked me anyway\\" (Verse 1) or \\"Stay / you come back to me always anyway / leave a mark / you said you never really loved her anyway...\\" (Verse 2).  Closing cut \\"Shock To Your System\\" is as consistent and nearly as memorable as the very best of the album.<br /><br />Overall [[ASIN:B00A4FOWYQ Heartthrob]] is a strong effort from the Canadian duo. Consistent and enjoyable, Tegan and Sara never miss a beat. 4 stars.Couldn't Be Your Friend\\" is consistent and enjoyable.

B00A1XIXM8|4.0|Veteran band Bad Religion follow-up 2010's [[ASIN:B003Y7L5YG The Dissent of Man]] with their 16th album, 2013's [[ASIN:B00A1XIXM8 True North]] released via Epitaph.  The latest LP sports thoughtful, oft-times pointed lyrics in regards to life, Christianity, and government. Bad Religion frontman Greg Graffin both offends and allures with his aggressive vocals, often proclamatory in their respective chastisement of human problems.  All cuts under three minutes save for one (\\"Hello Cruel World\\"), the 16 tracks of True North are enjoyable, angst-laden, and generally up-tempo.<br /><br />\\"True North\\" opens with a bang given the band's penchant for thoughtful, educated vocabulary: \\"Unrepentant vagabond / plot the new coordinates and cast the map aside...\\" Graffin goes on to devastate lyrically on the chorus with assertions that \\"happiness is isn't there for me\\" and of course finding \\"true north\\". \\"True North\\" sets the punk-revivalist tone. \\"Past Is Dead\\" continues this sentiment, opening slowly before the tempo kicks into full-on punk-rock gear.  The lyrics continue to allure, particular the chorus's \\"Yeah, the past is dead / more veritable words have never been read / oh, the tragic present said, the past is dead\\".  \\"Robin Hood in Reverse\\" outdoes its predecessors with extreme tempo and lyrics that criticize religion and government.  \\"Robin Hood In Reverse\\" possesses and argument for True North's best cut, regardless of its maniacal, anti-government, blasphemous nature (Hey, they are called 'Bad Religion', right?) .<br /><br />\\"Land of Endless Greed\\" points the finger at folks continual desire for 'things' while \\"F*** You\\" finds Graffin justifying his use of the word. \\"Just say f*** you, Pavlovian rude / a menace too, pay homage to / your bad attitude.\\" I addition to Graffin's own 'brash' attitude, the guitars sound superb, even shedding a brief solo. \\"F*** You\\" may be an overt snapshot at just over two minutes, but it's one solid one.<br /><br />\\"Dharma And The Bomb\\" continues to deliver clever, educated lyrics while the album's longest cut, \\"Hello Cruel World\\" has stake at being considered its best as well. Mid-tempo as opposed to lightening-paced, \\"Hello Cruel\\" words hones the energy of the quicker cuts over its slightly longer duration.  As always, the songwriting is thoughtful and packs a punch, particularly with memorable lyrics such as \\"I can't stop the way I feel / but I can penetrate your religions with a nail / you are mind and we are twine / when we radiate in waves together everything is fine...\\"  Add biting guitars parts, and \\"Hello Cruel World\\" is no bits of 'cruel' ultimately. Following that tour de force, the band sheds through quickies \\"Vanity\\" (\\"Such vanity / isolated with our own insanity / entangled by our callow gravity...\\") and \\"In Their Hearts is Right\\" (\\"Everybody knows what's in their hearts is right....\\") \\"In Their Hearts Is Right\\", another religious jab, has a highly in its arpeggio treatment of lyric 'everybody'.<br /><br />\\"Crisis Time\\" continues to think deeply (\\"Keep yourself in line / there is no design / the new paradigm is crisis time\\") while \\"Dept. of False Hope\\" reasons that 'reason' is the real answer.  \\"Dept. of False Hope\\" goes so far in its message, it uses the Judeo-Christian praise \\"Hosanna\\" in the background to affirm \\"the beast of reason\\".  After this particular stand-out, things are more average and/or more-or-less been hinted at or stated in some regard.  \\"Nothing to Dismay\\" speaks of \\"...dissonance runs deep in me...\\" while \\"Popular Consensus\\" possesses a wall of guitar sound and states that 'popular consensus' isn't equivalent to 'right' (another double meaning, political jab). \\"My Head is Full of Ghosts\\" seems more 'manic' than song, while \\"The Island\\" is hyper rhythmic filled with jagged riffs. Closer \\"Changing Time\\" renews some of the effort's earlier flash, taking punches at conservative politics (\\"But of course, the climate's always changing / clinging to the past has got you straining / comes the recognition now you're on a mission that is born to fail / leave it!\\").<br /><br />All-in-all, Bad Religion deliver a solid effort with [[ASIN:B00A1XIXM8 True North]].  Lyricism is the strong suit by all accounts. The end loses some of its zest and some cuts are more meaningful than others given their brief length. All things accounted for, the verdict is a positive one for the veteran outfit. 3 ½ Stars.aining / comes the recognition now you're on a mission that is born to fail / leave it!\\").<br /><br />All-in-all, Bad Religion deliver a solid effort with [[ASIN:B00A1XIXM8 True North]].

B000UX6THK|5.0|Probably the best ever produced television series. The casting and acting is the best in the past twenty years since it's debut. David Lynch gave us a real gem and I don't think there will be anything like it again. This series should be remastered in Blue-Ray due to the quality of the DVD which looks aged and off color in some episodes. This will undoubtedly be a classic in television entertainment, a must have for any collector of mystery television. It's like reading a suspense thriller that you just can't put down. Buy it!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Very good read, but do start with the first in the series.  Would recommend for young readers also.  Good storyline
B0025KVLUQ|2.0|I was thinking I was going to get something that was missing from the first remaster of some years ago, but what I hear is the same old sound that sounds no different from the first cd remaster of 1987 and then again in the box set from 2006. How many times will they remaster this cd? Can't they get it right the first time? The short video that comes with it may or may not make it worth buying. I leave that up to the collector. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|It's pretty crazy for a band that's been around for 30 years to now be doing a bit of a throwback album, but that's what True North is, in many ways. It harkens back to the sense of non-stop energy and short, concise songwriting that made up their earier work, though this has the feel of a band who's been doing this for so long that it almost comes off as effortless. This is a far more energetic and consistent CD than their alt-rocksy, somewhat sleepy (but still good) Dissent of Man and without the overlong tracks which occasionally showed up to grind The Empire Strikes First to a hault.<br /><br />Almost every single song on this album is a fast punk-style song; the exception is Hello Cruel World, though this song still has an epic sound to it and fits right in at the middle of the disc and it wound up being one of my favorites.<br /><br /> I can critique the one song that I don't like (In their Hearts is Right has a chorus that irritates me for whatever reason). I can point out that the song The Island bears a little more than just a passing resemblance to When from Suffer, (almost sounds like a cover but with new lyrics) but Bad Religion is allowed that after 30 years.<br /><br />This has some of the same \\"epic\\" guitar sound that I loved on The Gray Race. It has the fast punk tracks that Bad Religion has always been awesome at, it has the great lyrics, it has a cool song with Brett Gurewitz doing lead vocals, it has modern production but production that doesn't draw attention to itself, and it has an awesome closing track. Plus one of their most entertaining 1st singles (**** You) in recent memory.<br /><br />This is Bad Religion. Little else needs to be said. Get it.
B0035G0U2O|3.0|It's an ok movie, completely computer generated graphics but it has its moments. Overall I give it 3 out of 5
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This is a movie I saw as a kid and I am 32 now with 2 kids of my own and I let my oldest son see this,he really got a kick out of it.We received our order very quickly,we had  no complaints.The movie is brand new just like the seller said.We would buy again from this seller and of course on Amazon.If you like movies like this you will love this movie for your collection.
B00AVF8USS|5.0|A must see! This movie will float around for decades to come. James cameron goes above and beyond. One of those movies you can watch multiple times.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|But then I got to setting up all the nice stations I enjoy. This is very nice app for my Kindle. Very surprised at just how great this can be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses but sadly can't afford one of my own. This game is a very close substitute for the real thing
B008I43DYU|5.0|When I brought my kindle I was expecting great video, books, Magazines. But all these cool tools just enhance the experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very additive. My son, husband and myself can't get enough of it. We started playing it and haven't stopped yet yesterday I was upgraded to Rio and it is awesome as well. Very much better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting and It is fun I always play it and I love how the new back round is
1603427244|5.0|This is a great resource book for a knitter's library.  It clearly gives  many methods for casing on and binding off the knitting.  I loved the fact that it was all together in one book.<br />I think this is a book that will be referred to time and again by active knitters.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Good book for all ages.<br />Read it before you see the movie. It contains great thoughts about religion, and also lots of unknown facts about animals. Plus it is a page turner.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Watched this movie based on the high reviews and fact that it's based on a true story. Overall impressed with all aspects of the movie - well done. Reccomend for anyone looking to watch something solid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! I just had to know what would become of the heroin Katniss. The ending left me yearning for more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a awesome game for a tablet and for horse lover's is a must have this is a game that any can play
1603425381|5.0|This book has edgings that I've never seen anywhere else.  Downside:  some of the stitches, although they look wonderful on the pictures, are just about impossible to make, and I've been crocheting for 40 years.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I learned some words I didn't know.That's why I rated this book five stars.This book is awesome.I just want to submit this.
1616550414|5.0|This Zeldapedia is a love affair to the fans of the franchise who have stuck with them for that last 26 years. Included inside is beautiful concept artwork with detailed descriptions along the way. The quality of the books is phenomenal. The only thing I personally didn't like was the manga comic for Skyward Sword, but that's just personal preference as I'm not a fan of that type of thing.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I didn't hold out a lot of hope for this movie, but it was by the far the funniest movie I saw all year!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this about one time a day. Love the simplicity of it.  I have nothing negative day about it. I'm trying to beat 10 minutes.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book!! I can't wait to read the other two books!!!! I hope the other ones are just as good!!!
B0002BO05S|5.0|Here is a real attempt to strenghen the faith of the viewer, a film cherished by many for its power and beauty. Among the most moving episodes is Jesus' healing of a frail little blind man who will later be called to testify against him in Caiphus' unlawful court.<br />\\"If God was not in him, he would not have been able to make me see,\\" he says.<br />\\"Could it have been the evil one in him who made you see?\\"<br />\\"Why? Why would the evil one permit me, after so many years of darkness, to see the beauty and goodness of God's world?\\"
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I really loved this movie with the dancing and movess that they do in this movie . Even the music was awesome  in the movie
B000UVLK1M|5.0|This is the best Cd I have heard since I first heard \\"In A Silent Way\\" by Miles Davis. It helps if you like Joni Mitchell, but do not be deterred. It is still Herbie Hancocks best work since the classic \\"Maiden Voyage\\". They are not comparable in content, but this CD in a better musical era would be a bona fide \\"work of art\\". Trust me, it is that good. I wish Joni had done more of the vocals, But believe me, I am splitting hairs. The vocals are covered masterfully. After one listen, you will say \\"what is all the fuss about this grammy winner\\". However, after that, it will enter your head when you least expect it.......and then you are hooked. Joni Mitchell (who is not eager to please these days) is very reluctant to put her name on to much music these days, but it is obvious, that even the great Joni listens to this master piece. Buy it, you will only get tired of people asking you \\"who is this\\", while you are trying to listen to it in your car !!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great way to kill some time.  Fun as always.  Feels like an amusement park ride!  Anyone can play...great family competition.
B0091REZMW|3.0|nice game. just wish the energy would refill up faster than it already does. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really fun game and if you do not like it you are just plain wierd and that is true.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This is is fun. I like searching and figuring out where stuff is hidden.  The hints are essential to getting anywhere in the game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great user interface and emarket for used and new goods. Awesomeness! I have been using this app simultaneously between my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy phone!<br />.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|love the game but sometime it refuses to load on my kindle I ended up uninstalling it and it worked again
B003O86FMW|4.0|Suzanne Collins is very good at writing a book series. She can keep the reader entertained from one story piece to the other and does well at interlinking the threads.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am blown away by this book. I don't do reviews, but I was so moved by the characters, storyline and heart of this novel... that I HAD to share with the Amazon community and those who are uncertain about this book. The reviews and major stars is truly because this will be the book that WOWs you and won't be able to forget for awhile. I'm a fan and happy to find a new Author that writes from the heart, provides romance and understands the beauty of writing a lovely story.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Everybody loved the moview. So cute and the characters are so funny!<br />Worth the money.<br />My son is watching it all the time.
B00ARN0XGG|2.0|I loved Paranormal Activity and Paranormal Activity 2, and 3 was entertaining and had its creepy moments. This fourth movie, however, was just tedious and I found myself looking at my watch. It wasn't scary and it lacked all the elements of surprise that this series has used in the past. Not worth watching really, and I thought it was kind of stupid.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book. the two main characters were nuts.  I dont know which one of them I disliked more
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book will grab you right away and the twists and turns are so exciting.  I could not wait to finish it.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I loved the movie, it arrived quickly. After watching this movie, I became interested in &#34;Marvel's Avengers&#34; and &#34;Hunger Games.&#34;  The movie was very action packed and had a little bit of romance, if you like that type of movie. I would definitely recommend it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I LOVED this story. I don't want it to end. It was the best read I've had in quite a while. If you are looking for a world to get involved in, this is it. The life in the Silos is pretty much what you would expect after so many years. The control, the society, the... the... the .... go get it.<br /><br />This may be closer to reality than we think.. very scary. Loved every minute of reading this..<br />I'm off to get 6 the continuing story.. better clean the house first. I haven't come up for air in quite a while.. lol
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I really didn't think I would like this movie, but it was hilarious. Who would have thought a talking teddy bear could be so funny? Mark Wahlberg totally brought his A game to this one. I love the white trash girls names list. Favorite scene by far.
B00A757EFW|1.0|It was impossible to get around the corners fast enough to avoid ghosts.  I deleted the game after a few hours.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|it is a great book but many times I need to close the kindle and walk away from it as it is very disturbing emotionally for the Salmon family however this being said, this author wrote this book really well, you are there as you read it, you are in the book, sometimes you can't breathe because of how well written it actually is,,,,
0765365278|3.0|What can I say? It's a book. I got it for a good price. I like the gendre, so I'll leave it at that.
0525478817|5.0|This book really stuck with me after I read it. Loved it! Beautiful story. Once I started reading I didn't want to put the book down.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Pretty good app! Looks great on my Kindle Fire HD, Easy to use and easy to customize. Great job designer!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Good choice of sounds and a simple interface. What more could you ask for, eh?<br /><br />The price is a bit high, but otherwise a good app.
B002WSASIC|5.0|I think this movie should be shown in all highschools.  It portrayed the brainwashing of young, angry kids by an adult with his own agenda.  Edward Norton played the main character who was used to recruit kids into todays nazi skinhead gang.  During his incarceration he learned that he had been used to commit hate crimes and upon his release tried to save his younger brother from that same life.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I purchased this book because I've been searching for an adult paranormal fiction that's actually worth spending money on.  I gave this book a try because of the overwhelming number of reviews and because the Ms. Harkness was compared to Anne Rice.  After reading this book, I have to say that Ms. Rice is a master story teller.  Ms. Harkness is not.  Period.<br /><br />The story read in a disorganized fashion that left me feeling like Ms. Harkness kept throwing things in as she went along for any or no reason at all.  What promised to be a story about a distinguished historian's discovery of a mysterious, bewitched manuscript turns out to be a drawn out story about a scaredy-cat witch, who drinks tea and sleeps and eats whenever her stifling, vampire love interest can \\"smell\\" that she needs a break.  Really?<br /><br />The number of characters in the book increases chapter after chapter. Yet no one actually DOES anything. The whole story revolves around the inability of a formidable witch to call upon her true powers (which include every power known to witches and then some) unless her love interest is threatened.  Huh?  Then, Ms. Harkness adds another twist -- time travel.  WTH?<br /><br />I finished this book because of pure stamina.  There was no substance to the characters or to the plot. I won't be buying any more books in the series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its great, would only like an easy way to download to my kindel fire so I dont need the internet to use. Ive tried several ways to do this but not been successful. Any help would be appreciated.<br />Robert Judice

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book pulled at my heart strings an so many ways. The twists are unexpected but keep you reading. I couldn't put it down!!
B0086700CM|1.0|I don't like this app because it has options to PURCHASE &#34;coins&#34; and even with my kindle password protected, these coins are being billed to my card.  The first &#34;purchase&#34; was a legit mistake by my 4 yr old.  Not sure how the second charge appeared.  Why on earth would you want to BUY coins for an app game?!?
B009D5VNLS|1.0|It wasn't clear to me that for $14.99 i was purchasing a download for my Kindle. Why anyone with a 46&#34; lcd would want to watch a video on a kindle is beyond me.<br /><br />It cost me to learn, since downloads are not cancellable or refundable. Caveat Emptor!!!!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|This movie should be viewed second in the series. Tom Selleck brings the character of Jessie Stone to life. It is easy to get attached to the character and appreciate the way he brings his own justice to the small town of Paradise.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Hope 5 is as good, wish there were new shows everyday! I can't believe how creative the writers and cast are!! FAVORITE!!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|According to most accounts this should be the first movie to view though it was not the first to air. Learning that there were eight movies in all, we just had to have them.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first started playing subway surfers I couldn't beat anyone but time by time i was getting better and better.<br />I just love the game and if I could I would give it 1000 out of 1000!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm a 60 year old retired cop and about the last person in the world who would read this book, but I did and found it to be one the the best fiction books I've read in a long time. Very nice story with a happy ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome so awesome so so so cool this game is the best it is cooler than any other game
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I think I like this soundtrack even better than the LOTR soundtrack and that's saying something. There's even more nuance and dynamics; parts of it almost make me cry.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a fun game but they keep changeing it like for instance rio to new yourk etc. And i was just starting to get good at the newyourk so my opinios is that they should make sepret apps instead of updating it for example like angry birds did.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addictive. Bummed that my child used my two hints but hoping I might get more free ones sooner than later.good entertainment.
098555780X|5.0|Use Fusion ties web site a lot.  Can't wait to see if there will be a volume 2. Great book.  Clear instructions.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|the alarm  wakes me up on time . i get to work on time now .I love  the blue numbers.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I have had this for several years now. Had the original free one that was limited to 4 cams, and had ads. This is one of the VERY few apps I paid for the upgrade because it was worth it. All I got \\"extra\\" was no ads, and more cams. I didn't pay for that. I paid because the guy made a near perfect app, and it was well worth it. When I bought it, it cost a bit more, but I was happy to pay it, and would pay again. The developer also continues to add new cams.<br /><br />If you are considering an app of this kind, you can stop now. this is the one. buy it.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I loved the film.  A family member loaned me their cd of the soundtrack and I had to get one of my own.
1451627297|5.0|Incredible, hard-to-put-down book. It's not a horror story in the typical \\"Stephen King\\" sense, but it is incredibly haunting and really well written. Highly recommend.

B004I9CXHW|4.0|The other 5 percent it doesn't stay connected to the ipod very well. The connector falls out and doesn't always click securely in place. But otherwise the function is good. No problems.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|just like at home on the laptop.Now I can take it with me.<br />May spend more money now! Easy to use. Glad you had<br />this app for my kindle.
B006LSZECO|3.0|First, let me rant for a moment about Amazon's Kindle policies:<br />1) There is no reason that a one-user electronic copy of a book should cost $12.99<br />2) And, at that lofty price, the thing can't even be shared!<br />It is not good enough to say that it is \\"the publisher's policy\\".  With Amazon's purchasing clout, more rational pricing and terms should be available.<br /><br />Getting to the book, it started a bit slowly but before long, I was completely engrossed. From the 1/4 to the 7/8 points, this book is a real page-turner.  A unique fast-paced story with unanticipated twists.  I couldn't rate it higher because of the incredible \\"nothing\\" ending.  It felt as though the author had suddenly looked at a clock and decided her writing time was up.
6305949980|1.0|Dvd didn't work
B005LAII3A|3.0|I was prepared to unleash venom upon this film. Total Recall(2012) is a solid movie. Director Len Wiseman crafts some decent action scenes and the CGI is top notch. He also adds references to Philip K. Dick's short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale and the 1990 version of Total Recall. This is the Total Recall movie that you can watch if you're babysitting.<br />Wiseman toned down the sex and violence, but there are plenty of \\"S Bombs\\". The Director's Cut adds more swearing and restores deleted footage. The only problem I have with the film is that it takes place in an anglophilic world where people can live only in England or Australia. I guess Africa, France, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, the USA, Mexico, Brazil, China, Russia, South America, and other countries did not survive after World War III! The screenwriters leave out Mars and the mutants from this version. The fat woman with red hair and the call girl with three breasts do show up. Colin Farrell was quite good as Douglas Quaid/Hauser. Jessica Biel was very sexy as Melina. Lori and Richter have been combined into one character. Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle plays Cohaagen. John Cho is good as a Rekall guy who sells fake memories.<br />The film shows us some forms of technology that could exist. There's mini cell phone implants, holograms, flying cars, and robot police officers. The music for this film is decent. This Total Recall remake was some decent Hollywood product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely couldn't lay this book down! After reading hte first book and watching the movie, I thought I knew who I wanted Katniss to be in love with but, after reading this book, there's no doubt as to who she must be with.  So exciting!!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|This album is without a doubt an album that grows on you...it did for me as well...and at 3.99...you won't get a better deal than that...get it
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I've seen this movie quite a few times over the years, but never seemed to catch it from the beginning.  So I finally decided to buy it and it is a great show.  Lots of action, fast-paced, exciting, and Matthew McConaughey doesn't hurt your eyes...Good for males and females; there's something here for everyone.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|Probably one of my favorite movies ever. I wore my last copy out. And as usual I buy most of my movies from Amazon. This movie is a classic. It has it all, humor, tears, adventure, and ghost. What more could you ask for?
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I saw this with my dad which was so nice as we are both baseball phanatics (can you guess where I'm from?).  It's a fun, emotional, funny, movie that's good for the entire family.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. Reminds me a lot of the old arcade style games, only better graphics and I don't get bored playing it after few days. Over all, I love it and its honestly become an obsession trying to beat my own score. Good character selection, awesome power ups and really challenging obstacles. Perfect game and truly addicting.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I recommend this show to anyone and everyone! there's action, humor, love and mystery, with amazing acting and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. absolutely love this show!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I think this book would really speak to a certain kind of \\"alternative\\" young reader.  I really liked the main character and that it was set in the early 90s which is kind of different.

B008B92U32|3.0|First off, let me say that this app is well made, looks good on a tablet, and seems to function as intended.<br /><br />However, it does something that can be done easily with Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, or any other decent photo editing application. I fail to see the usefulness of an app that takes one or two functions from Photoshop and nothing more.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but I found it to be another one of those apps I file away as &quot;cute but useless&quot;, because honestly-- How many times will you need to swap faces without the rest of Photoshop's features? How long before the novelty wears off?<br /><br />It isn't a bad app. It's just silly and limited in its functions and replay value, unless you're an easily-amused person without decent photo editing aoftware. It's not a game, nor is it a productivity app. It's just a toy that, like the ones in a Happy Meal, doesn't do much and gets boring after the ride home.<br /><br />Three stars for the general build quality. I docked two stars from the five because of the lack of usefulness or actual fun.

I am unhappy because I wasted money on a movie that I love but cant watch because of the region code.

B008B92U32|4.0|I picked up Face Swap as the Amazon FAOTD.  I gave it a quick try, and was fairly unimpressed -- frustrated, even.  I was about to write up a low-scoring review, when I decided to watch the video that's included on the Amazon page.  I saw that I really was not using the app correctly; and, in fact, it was much easier than I was making it.  So I gave it another try, and -- voila!  It works far better than I had imagined.<br /><br />A lot of it was understanding the step-by-step process.  I was trying to do everything in the \\"setup\\", and figuring that the \\"Swap\\" button was...  well, the end, so to speak.  But that's just the \\"rough setup\\".  There's a lot of fine tuning that can be done *after* the Swap takes place.  And the results are much improved.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's information within the app that I never took the time to read, either.  Once I had clicked on \\"Done\\", I had no idea where my edited image went!  Again, I was going to ding the app...  until I clicked on the \\"i\\" that provides more information -- including the fact that all edited images are placed in the Face Swap folder.  Bingo!<br /><br />This really is a good app, particularly if you take the time to learn the steps, and what it can do, and read the Information within the app.  Well worth the price!  :>)

B004UUKDNA|5.0|Foster The People is the only album that I like every single song on it. Here's a song-by-song review.<br />Helena Beat- A five minute taste of what the album soungs like. four stars.<br />Pumped Up Kicks- A rather random but fun song. four and a half stars.<br />Call It What You Want- A song consisting of background hums and beats. three and a half stars.<br />Don't Stop- A defiant and demanding track. four stars.<br />Waste- A bit naggish, but poppy. three stars.<br />I Would Do Anything For You- My second favorite song. It sounds like it would be played in the Summer at a fashion show. five stars.<br />Houdini- A straightfoward and loud song. four and a half stars.<br />Life On the Nickel- An echoey and quiet song. Nice, though. four stars.<br />Miss You- My favorite song. Like a cross between Skrillex, David Guetta, Calvin Harris, and, of course, Foster The People. five stars.<br />Warrant- The first minute and a half is pretty much just a choir singing, so the sample isn't a true taste of the song. Pleading but sassy. four stars.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|An interesting and useful app. The graph detailing power consumption per hour is very useful and gives a clear indication of the energy requirements of individual apps especially games such as dominoes and cribbage.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the perfect app for horse lovers! I love horses and this game is so much fun! The best best part is its free!
B0088P2A7A|4.0|The mobile version of Wikipedia available by one click from a desktop/tablet top icon. Duh. Just do it.<br />Don't expect anything extra beyond getting to the site faster and the standard mobile experience. That would have earned it the extra star.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This drama taking place during the first quarter of the 20th century is addictive.  Well acted.  I love the costumes and the attention to historical detail.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|Let's face it, some tablet devices do some things a little better than others. The Kindle Fire probably won't be used on stage by musicians. A small part is the hardware. A bigger part is the software - This is a kids toy and nothing you'd want to help you actually create music.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Very good for free. Not too hard. I'm on world 5. If you like super mario bros. Then you will love this.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|For whatever reason, I can't get this Facebook app to load on my Kindle Fire. It opens, but never actually loads to bring up any posts.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my grandson. It was great to see how he loved it. I'd like to watch all movies too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is the best game ever. Its actually better than temple run. When I first got my new cell phone the first thing I downloaded was this game because its so fun I almost unlocked everything and I love the fact you can fly
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. Nice graphics, cool characters and options. Special themes,... you should download it and enjoy ! A competition can be set up with your friends on facebook.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game for not only myself but Aldo my 4 year old son. Its nice to find a game that's not full of violence.
0684824906|5.0|I love reading about Lincoln and this work has exceeded expectations! I found the back stories of the men that Lincoln brought inro his cabinet truly interesting plus learning more about Lincoln and his unique upbrining was inspiring.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it the graphics are great its more exciting then the first version! My heart be pounding as I play it because its feels like I'm actually running the monster.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan certainly knows how to write like a pro, so I have no problem with buying another one of his amazing reads! The second book in the new series, I had no problem coming to love the new characters he has created. It will be mighty difficult to stay away from this! :)
B0084I9QFU|5.0|I really like Michael Jackson's singing and songs that he wrote.  He had good beat to all the songs and just wanted to add this to my cd's
B0050DIWFC|5.0|First of all, if you want a good read to absorb yourself in, this is it!<br /><br />I couldn't help but find myself completely and utterly hooked while reading this. The love and controversy centered around the main family is what makes this story so well written. The father's struggle is apparent in the text as you read along. The mystery, the anxiety, and the suspense all come together to make a book that I would recommend to anyone that would like to settle down with a book to keep you occupied for the next 2 days or so. That's how fast I finished it anyway. :)
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Highly recommend for thought provoking drama.  The characters are very well cast.  A timely scenario for our current political and social environment
B006LSZECO|5.0|To be honest, when I first began reading this book, I was not all that impressed. Action took a while to set in, but when it did... boy! I sure spent my money right! This is another one of those stories where when you try to predict what will happen next it is never what you thought it was. The suspense and the mystery wrapped me in its cocoon and trapped me there. Gillian Flynn sure did quite the number in this!<br /><br />Like I said before, the only fault I could detect of this book is that the action was slow-coming. No matter though. A setting had to be developed somehow, right? :)<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone that likes surprises, hanging onto every word, and sitting on the edge of your seat out of anxiousness to know what comes next. Hopefully, you will enjoy it like I did (and continue to do)!
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|I guess I had higher expectations for this movie. I found it a little dull. It had the creepy factor, which I liked, but I found my attention wandering during the movie. The ending was a bit of a stretch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! I can't believe it took me so long to finally sit and read it.
B005LAII12|2.0|While it's somewhat funny at times, it's mostly just dumb and raunchy. It seemed to go on and on with no real direction until closer to the end. I wish I'd borrowed or rented it, rather than buying.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|It was beautifully made. Acting was good. Leading actress wasn't as pretty as she should have been. Loved the witch.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee is one strong willed woman.  All the power to her for her accomplishments including writing this memoir of her Stolen Life!! Hard to read because of the awful things those vultures did to her but an excellent book it is.<br />\\"God grant us the serenity to accept the things we can not change; the courage to change the things we can; and wisdom to know the difference.\\"
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was different in that back in time sifi type of movie. Lots of action. Did like the two leading actors.
B009MO57H6|3.0|As far as science fiction goes, this is about as good as you can get from a brain not on drugs. The thing that has made me comment is that so many of you like to talk bad about this product. You bought it, live with it. I make it a point not to talk bad about something that I cannot do better, so there must be a lot of writers and directors that come to Amazon for their products!
B008CIUS72|5.0|One of many Flash aids available to Kindle users. It's just really a matter of personal preference, this one is very easy.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a wonderful recording.  I saw Les Mis on Broadway and loved it but this is a better version.
0545265355|5.0|I enjoyed reading these books, not your typical teenage love story books. Very entertaining and thought provoking. Books arrived in excellent condition.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I got this game for my daughter on her tablet, and it's fun. It took a while to get used to the controls b/c on a tablet there's not a controller or joystick though.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Hilarious movies, love it. It Arrived before the estimated date, and in amazing condition. I really appreciate it, and it is very helpful and very convenient. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the graphics on this game.I like how it has free updates every month or so.It is awesome.

B008AIGWVA|1.0|Even though this app was free, it was rather boring so I deleted it from my device.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|this is for my nieces collection, it started before she was even a thought and now the collection has gotten huge. thank you

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|An amazing game, truly!<br />When I saw this app in the top 10 free apps, the logo made it unappealing at first.<br />But that proved to be wrong as it is now my FAVORITE APP OF ALL TIME!
031606792X|5.0|love jacob, watched the movies and wanted to read the books, needed something to match it and something which is also nice to look at. It Arrived before the estimated date, and in amazing condition. I really appreciate it, and it is very helpful and very convenient. Thank you.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Amazing game! if you've never played Angry Birds before, start here!<br />Its the new Pacman for sure!<br />Great for kids, teens, and the elderly!
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|This is added to my crazy movie selection. thank you, I really love this movie and it's nice to be able to watch it whenever I want.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a good game for when you need a break from life, although, it's not very good for when you're board.<br />You might as well get the free version, but it's not worth 99&cent;.
0375851569|5.0|for my sister in law, she is collecting these books for her little one. It Arrived before the estimated date, and in amazing condition. I really appreciate it, and it is very helpful and very convenient. Thank you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|A great game for anyone with a quick finger and a knack for physics games!<br />There are so many amazing boxes of levels filled with sugary fun!<br />You can also choose between original candy, a doughnut, and a cupcake.<br />I also recommend Cut The Rope Experiments.
B00003CX9W|5.0|for my sister in law, she is collecting these books for her little one. It Arrived before the estimated date, and in amazing condition. I really appreciate it, and it is very helpful and very convenient. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so addicting I play all of the time ,but I don't like the 5x upgrade. Now the regular boasts are gone.I love the came and whoop there it is!! Sorry I had to do that lol. Anyway I think you should get the game it's really fun on kindle fires iPhones and other Apple device's
630529142X|5.0|This is added to my crazy movie selection. thank you, I really love this movie and it's nice to be able to watch it whenever I want.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a awesome exciting thrill ride including running from<br /> cops,jumping on and off subways, and collecting coins. If I were you I would get this game right now, trust me you won't regret it I sure didn't
B000YAA68C|5.0|This is added to my crazy movie selection. thank you, I really love this movie and it's nice to be able to watch it whenever I want.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This one is even more addicting than the first one! It has twice the action and that is what makes me love it! If u are tired of playing the first one I suggest u get #2
B00005JM1F|5.0|love the movie, it is amazing and i watch it all the time.  It Arrived before the estimated date, and in amazing condition. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Even more addicting even more fun! I love it and u will too especially cuz it's free I suggest you get and and get it now!
0679882820|5.0|for my sister in law, she is collecting these books for her little one. It Arrived before the estimated date, and in amazing condition. I really appreciate it, and it is very helpful and very convenient. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was awsome and I loved it there are different types of levels so in that I loved it there was no way you whould not like it there is also a lot of different types of characters in the game
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Pretty good. A little touchy and a disturbing topic comes up but well written. Hoover's writing always draws me in. Read all her books and hope she writes more!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Easy to read and entertaining.  could not put it down!  As a former restaurant crony, hustling all night, I can relate to the author.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Such a cute movie. It's funny, sad, and thought provoking. Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling were great in their roles, as were Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei, and Kevin Bacon.<br />I have watched this several times since I've received it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi You alwaysa us download these kind of Ganesh th in in in :/ jjhjjjjnnnjnj uhh uhh huh by the bad how book hi bug how hi hi how b
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This movie make me laugh all the way through it. If you're looking for a fun couple of hours, this is the movie to watch.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very good, very fun! My only complaint is that sometimes it glitches and the menu becomes unresponsive. Other than that it's a great game to pass time or to play in general.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I've read the book and watched the movie several times. It never fails to move me. It is really the greatest western of all times.
B0099114WO|5.0|Meryl Streep is always good and Tommy Lee Jones was very convincing in this movie about reigniting middle age marital bliss.  Steve Carrell played it straight as their therapist and the slow evolution to a new relationship was wonderful to watch.  As someone who just turned 60, I would highly recommend it.
B009NYF2ES|4.0|An outstanding script and film destroyed by Minelli's over-the-top performance. This screeching harpie seems incapable of delivering a line of dialogue at anything less than 90 decibels, while spending the rest of her on-screen time (which is too much) posturing, posing, and mooning the camera. Michael York and Marissa Berenson acted rings around Lisa, yet received virtually no recognition for their work. Bob Fosse must have had the patience of Job.
0679759328|5.0|This is a subtle, nuanced account of who we see each other, how we understand our position with others. Edith is a remarkable character. Tightly constructed story with remarkable description of life in the hotel and of the European style.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This is an entertaining game.  I'm not a game person, and have the few, but usual apps such as solitaire.<br />But this is a nice change from the norm.  I keep it around for those times when you just need something to do.  Like when waiting for my oil to be changed, or at the doctor's office.
B0098VXDDS|3.0|I enjoyed this series - but the new guy is too young - and the character development is too weak and slow...
B007FJFDXS|3.0|From other reviews I thought this game would be awesome.  It was okay at first, but got boring fast.  I only kept it around for a few weeks.
B00B6SIT0S|5.0|I must say I wasn't expecting this change of pace for the first single, Heaven but what a slow-burner gem: powerful and hypnotic and quite unlike anything Depeche Mode has put out before. The \\"B\\" side, All That's Mine is vintage Mode and a perfect example of comparisons of their upcoming new release, Delta Machine, as a cross between Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion.<br /><br />I agree with Dave who in a recent interview said that Depeche Mode is probably one of top alternative bands out there.  I loved their last 2 records which I thought were among their best.  With this new album, I am sure I'm going to have to dedicate a spot near the top of the list of the their finest work.  I'm already getting the sense that Delta Machine will be one of the top albums of 2013.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|I first heard Chris and played alongside him while he was still in high school in Columbia. I realized from the start that Chris was something extra special and this new album finally pulls together everything that has been hinted at since his early jam sessions at \\"Pug's,\\" a small bar in Columbia's Five Points district.<br /><br />The music of \\"The Sirens\\" is moody, melodic, and memorable, avoiding any of the cliches that mar the work of many of Chris' contemporaries. His superb technique and his absolutely amazing mastery of the tenor saxophone's altissimo register is always used in tasteful service to his superb compositions and arrangements.<br /><br />I believe that this album is a masterwork fully on a par with Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" and the best of Miles' mid-1960s quintet.<br /><br />When the history of modern jazz saxophone is finally written it will undoubtedly be Charlie Parker, John Coltrane and Chris Potter.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I heard Sail a lot on the radio, and I liked it, but never really took the time to look at what else AWOLNATION might have.<br />On a whim, I picked up the album last week - and I cannot stop listening to it. It is a great album. I hope they come out with more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is such a powerful  and emotionally charged story. There were twist and turns that I wasn't expecting. I laughed and cried throughout the story and really connected with the characters. Highly recommended read. Looking to reading more from Colleen Hoover.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it's. way better than the first one I can never make it to the part were u go in the tunnel on the cart but I love the begginig when u hanglide.
B00APUQJLO|5.0|If you love the book you will love this movie.  I was surprised by how good it was, because I wasn't expecting much.  Overall it was great.
B009Y2KGSQ|3.0|Not there best effort. hope its not cause there age, but think they can do better.<br />they do rock out with ease.. but some somes seemed.. like work in progress. guess I had my bar set higher, but I do listen to it.
145210655X|5.0|My 5 year old, Star Wars obesessed daughter fell in love with this book immediately.  She's read it so much she knows it by heart, and it's really cute and funny.
B00138KE2C|5.0|I love this live CD, normally live stuff is so-so. However you can feel Dave's passion and authentic lyrics come through loud and clear!
B001NHNG64|1.0|I did not like it. It seemed to drag the story in so many places . It fell short of Patterson's usual good plots and stories
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This has become my favorite game.  I play for hours saying 'just one more', 'just one more'..  It's late before I go to bed...
B004RKXW0E|5.0|My son loves this movie and could watch it over and over!! Very happy with purchase. I have to admit that I silently sobbed at the end... Nice way to end the Toy Story trilogy.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I can't say I was ever a huge fan or either dubstep or the classical violin, however when I was exploring new music on Pandora, Lindsey's music kept coming up and I was absolutely amazed by what I was hearing. That sent me to YouTube, where I have discovered a music format that is truly unique and much different than the typical music I listen to. Lindsey Sterling has a very special way of combining the skill of her violin and electronic music to create something you can just listen to over and over again.  I'm glad that her music is now available in electronic format on iTunes and Google Play, now I'm just looking forward to hearing what she comes out with next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very fun and easy.Also it has fun additions.I love to play.Also I would like to play the games that are like it.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|This book on my all-time 5 WORST book list.  I read on a Kindle and many of the words were not in the Kindle dictionary...the story was all over the map.....I derived NO PLEASURE from reading this book.  I read it only because it was my book club's monthly selection.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK<br />IT IS TRUE LAMENT AND I LOVE HOW IT WAS ALWAYS LEAVING TRACKS IN MY HEART.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Loved it<br />! The game is realisTic and really fun! But it is aggregating that everything is so expensive, I love that you can change the backfield and get a unicorn
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoyed this game on the kindle loads of fun for me they are like real horses and I love raising them
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Another excellent tool for camping, hiking, or around the house.  It puts the edge back on quickly and safely until you need to take your knife to a professional knife sharpner.  I would recommend this tool to others.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|OMG I loved it I can not stop watching it I've probably.watched it about.......................can't even say that's how many times I've watched this show makes me want to be a WOLF!!!!!!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Too much closure lacking detail crammed in last few pages. Less detailed closure after long buildups. Unsatisfying end. Still enjoyed book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing series. Every page kept me itching for more. Every twist is a surprise and you really get attached to the characters and to the silo itself. Can't wait for the next books Hugh! Loved your FAQ at the end! I heard about this series from a friend and I'm so glad that I looked into it. I would recommend Wool to anyone.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|If you use Office on your PC and want to have access on your Mobile unit, this app is a must!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is action packed and emotional but this book is by far the best book I have ever read.
B00322PK2G|4.0|just what i remember..good watch and the band is long enough..work as a care giver and needed one that was waterproof
B0036EH3U2|4.0|Update(May 13, 2014) Four Stars:<br />Still a bit frustrated with the graininess of the quality, I researched and found this was intentionally done in post-production. WHY?!?!!? Don't add artifacts to \\"simulate\\". If you want a film look, record in film. The awful graininess only seems to be in the first few episodes and isn't as much pronounced in following episodes. Still, the series is phenomenal and best watched in BluRay. Upgraded to four stars after discovering the graininess was intentional rather than accidental.<br /><br />Original Post(Feb. 1, 2013) Two Stars:<br />I've not watched many Blu-Ray movies, but the few I have watched had great clarity and definition to the video. The edges of objects are crisp and clear. Colors are vibrant with plenty of saturation. I'm still using the same Sony Blu-ray player with HDMI.<br /><br />The only time I see the great characteristics in the BSG Blu-ray set is on CGI graphic logos/titles/credits. The rest of the video looks like slightly improved DVD quality. The audio is certainly bright and crisp which is great. Most Sci-Fi movies/shows tend to be shot with less light to create a mood. Perhaps the cameras had issues working in that environment. Being somewhat disappointed in the video quality, I'm not sure if it was worth the $125. If the quality was there, the price would have been a bargain.<br /><br />I agree, the packaging is a bit sub-par. The disk carriers are glued to a piece of thick printed stock which fold over. In time, this will not hold up to any sort of regular use. The product managers should be fully aware how discriminating Sci-Fi fans can be when it comes to product delivery.<br /><br />If the packaging had been better and video quality where it should be, no doubt five stars.<br /><br />Overall, I will enjoy the extras and deleted scenes as well as continue to enjoy Baltar's perpetual self-delusional state of mind. :)
B00335EQ0E|5.0|The movie came as described and in a timely manner.  Alice in Wonderland is a family classic and we are happy to have it in the movie library.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|I love this movie with its special effects, underlying moral of the story and the transition the guy makes throughout.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive I love this game. Its better than temple run. This game is the greatest game on the kindle foregone my choice
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I love the intuitive play...the ending is fantastic.  Non-competitive, delightful...  Gentle guidance very nice.  Beautiful and very nice music.  Wonderful!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book as much as the first one in the series.  I cant wait to find out what happens in the third one.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Hi guys.  Is a point missing here?  I love \\"Borat,\\" \\"Bruno,\\" not so much.  And this movie didn't hit me til the end, in which all the brutal dictatorial tactics the Dictator renounces are....US foreign policy.  This is way smarter than any rant on NPR.  Seriously.  It's not about some sleazy Middle Eastern dictator, not when you get to the end.  It's about the global corporate takeover.  The whole point of a pointless UN reflects this.  Listen to the Dictator's speech, pure hypocrisy, but it is a litany of US sins against ethics and humanity since the rise of the military-industrial complex, which Ike so presciently warned us all about.<br /><br />Smart film.  The \\"crude\\" humor wouldn't shock an average middle schooler.  I don't know what world some people inhabit, but there's only so much disinfectant one can rub upon oneself before one becomes so non-resistant to bacteria that one catches anything particularly virulent.  Such as US foreign policy.  Drones are, after all, a kind of airborne pathogen.<br /><br />Watch this movie until the end, when it pays off brilliantly.  No lie.  And then watch \\"Hugo,\\" where you realize how great an actor Baron Cohen is in every way.  I don't fan easily; I'm a Cohen fan.  Particularly after \\"The Dictator.\\"
B00846REIS|5.0|Very erotic and captivating.  I could not put it down.  I cant wait to read the rest of the series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. just wish it would load every time, sometimes I have to reload ir a couple of time before it will start.  other than that it is quit fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|it is becoming so dramatic that is is too much like a soap opera. With actors and actresses who are so well trained and can speak so well, they should be given better scripts to work with. They need to find some other way for actors who are leaving to disappear than a quick, unexpected death.<br />It is still good enough to watch one more season to determine if the writing can once again excel.
B003H9MSPG|4.0|Doesn't seem to jam like a lot of the others and isn't too heavy for my 7 year old son.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swift Key has revolutionized the way I type on my smart devices.  It has probably saved me from getting carpel tunnel of my fingers.  Excellent purchase and would buy this today if I didn't have it.<br /><br />6/5
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the best weather app.  Clear, concise and up to date info!  And very easy to navigate the app.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|It was just ok but fell short of my expectations. It seemed to drag in certain parts of the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is even better that the Coin Dozed Seasons one... the shake point helps a lot and you don't have to buy coins you just have to wait...
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|It met expectations and really enjoyed this movie. Action packed the whole time and didn't seem to drag at all.
B002DS3982|5.0|We are in the process of collecting Denzel Washington films and although this is one that has moved into the past it is definitely worth watching. Washington does an excellent job of portraying the boxer and the telling of the man's story is riveting, but heartbreaking. A true testament to our perverted legal system.<br />This is a film that we will watch regularly and tell our friends about.
1433524619|5.0|Got this copy for a new believer who wanted to go deeper and understand more about the history and context of Biblical events and persons. Great Bible!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|This book is everything I expected and wanted.  Characters are very developed, and I'm happy to hear that there might be more books!
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I was really disappointing the first couple times i listened to this CD. Her fist two were SO great and her last two have seemed so SLOW. Don't get me wrong, I don't think all songs should be sung fast. I just really wish those in control would just back off and let the lady sing. It's like someone is holding her back, changing her voice and passion. I really felt like her first two CD's were reflections of her and you could feel the passion, her last two CD's really feel like someone is holding her back.<br /><br />Having said that, I will admit that the CD has begun to grow on me and I do enjoy listening to it, though her voice is amazing singing \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" it is so painfully slow it's almost hard to listen too.
0307477479|2.0|With many characters and narrators jumping around in time, the book can be somewhat confusing, but I actually found myself captivated by the writing and the story.  It was very much a page turner.  Ultimately though,  the entire premise of the book left me confused and unfulfilled.  Maybe if I would not have skipped over the power point presentation, the book may have been clearer, but I did not care to sort through dozens of slides (this coming from someone who has built hundreds of powerpooint presentations.) The final chapter uses lots of text message slang, which was also extremely odd. To each his own, I guess.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I had not heard of The Weeknd but saw the disc on sale and saw the stellar reviews.  Figured folks were over exaggerating.  At first the songs and his voice all sounded the same (lol) but I gave it some more time and actuallly sat down and spent some time with the music and it is now my favorite CD.  I listen to it every chance I get.  He is one the best singers to come out in a long time, I am super impressed with him.  I am somewhat taken-a-back by the drug use references, not sure what's up with him and other rappers so casually mentioning drug use (not weed) but that aside, you really should check him out!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Good plot, lots of action and mystery. Corey and Mayfield make interesting work partners. They work well covering each other's backs.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|This movie really captivated me. On later viewings I can see some of the lower budget flaws. However I loved the cast and the technical plot line really worked for me.
B001JNND9W|5.0|I remember watching this movie countless times at the drive-in when it first came out in the seventies. Brings back old memories. Wouldn't want to fall in the cactus on the honda.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Ian McEwan is one of my favorite authors, but this wasn't my favorite novel. Although the plot was interesting, I had a hard time believing in the main character. I'll continue to look forward to his next work.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|A little more violent than I prefer although I like the moral victory outcome. I love the soundtrack. word word
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I am enjoying this game. Truth is I've enjoyed all the G5 games. The graphics and story are good but all the games inside especially make it worth the price.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|awesome season two!!! very different from the first season which i also loved!!! i liked that they used some of the same actors and actresses but playing completely different types of characters. it really gave them a chance to show their range of acting ability. each character was played perfectly and there was more than one storyline going on at once which added depth to the series. not too sure how i felt about one of the storylines (which i won't describe so i dont spoil it for others), but other than that one small thing, A GREAT SERIES!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this series and fantasy is usually not my style of reading.  I hope I can find something else to read that hooks me like this series did.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|One hundred years ago Count Dracula lost his beloved wife to the hatred and fear of Mankind. To save his daughter Mavis from suffering a similar fate he commissions a palace to be built. The palace becomes a hidden sanctuary for all the things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />Fast forward to the present, Dracula's daughter is on the verge of her 118th birthday and she is starting to feel cabin fever. Dracula allows her to explore a nearby Romanian town that turns out to be a ruse meant to scare her against humankind. It works and Mavis abandons her quest to see Paradise Hawaii.<br /><br />As famous guests (including the Wolfman, his wife and kids, The Mummy, and The Frankenstein Monster) from all over arrive Dracula is pleased to see everything going smoothly...that is until the human world arrives.<br /><br />Jonathan Van Helsing a 21 year-old backpacker discovers the hidden Castle and thinking that it's a costume party....until he discovers it isn't. To prevent a panic Dracula disguises Jonathan as a monster (a relation of Frankenstein's right arm). A introduces him as a party planner.<br /><br />As Jonathan becomes the \\"death\\" of the party Dracula begins to lighten up to the human and Mavis begins to fall for him. But when the Hunchback of Notre dame spills the beans as to Jonathan's true nature he leaves claiming he hates monsters, Mavis included.<br /><br />When Dracula discovers that Jonathan was Mavis's \\"Zing\\" (love at first sight) he as long with the Wolfman, Mummy, Frankenstein Monster and Invisible man leave the safety of the Hotel and venture into Transylvania...which is right in the middle of a Celebration of all things monster.<br /><br />With a large crowd blocking the road and John's plane due to take off the Monster reveals himself in an attempt to scare the crowds away. When the crowd cheers the real monsters, Dracula pleads with the crowd to disperse so he can reunite Mavis n with John.<br /><br />Using a line of Dracula capes to shield from the light, Drac flits to the runway just in time to see that plane take off. Transforming into a Bat Dracula gives Chase and catches up to the plane. He takes control of the pilots mind and apologizes to Jonathan.<br /><br />The movie ends with Mavis and Jonathan a couple ready to leave and explore the world.<br /><br />I was very surprised by this film, the animation was very good as was the acting. However like many others this movie hit upon my pet peeve, of calling the monster Frankenstein. Frankenstein was the name of the Doctor who made it and not the monster itself. Also the Invisible man isn't technically a monster but....whatever.<br /><br />This film works for both kids and adults and is good to watch especially around Halloween.he light, Drac flits to the runway just in time to see that plane take off.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|I'm a guy that loves guy movies.  I did everything I could to talk my wife out of making me watch this movie.  Obviously, I didn't win that argument, but I was surprised how entertaining it was.  Though the plot is just ok, the subtle humor and interesting ways they are able to use some 80's and 90's tunes kept me interested.  My advice, give it a shot!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|By far the best of the trilogy.  The many unexpected plot twists makes this a fast and enjoyable read.  Left me wanting book four.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i do like the game , but there could be a little more response from the horse.  this is more about getting things and competing than the affection and bonding.  not much free play. but it keeps me playing!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Pretty good for a sequel.  Not as predictable as I would have expected it to be.  Plus you have to read it to get to book three.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I have been a big T&S fan for years and I must admit I was a bit worried when I read that they were going in a \\"pop\\" direction with this album.  (Train did the same thing with their last album and it was mostly Top 40 garbage).  I absolutely love this album.  There is only one song that is too much pop fluff(Drove Me Wild).  Every other song is great.  I have been listening to the album on repeat ever since it became available to stream on the Rolling Stone website last week.  I can't stop listening.....so good!!!!<br /><br />Now I would like to give ZERO starts to Amazon.  I pre-ordered this album on Jan.17th.  It came out 3 days ago on the 29th and Amazon has not shipped my cd yet.  WTF?????<br /><br />This is the last time I will pre-order a cd.  I could have bought this  $2 cheaper at Target for 3 days ago.  I want my cd!  I can't even do the free auto rip yet.  I guess when they finally ship it I will have access to that function..

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is just excellent. The easy to grasp mechanics, graphics and flawless coding make this game a no brainer to buy. 100% completion of the game takes some time but it doesn't feel as if you are playing for completion being so fun and all. Buy The Game Already!
B004NSURT4|5.0|Aside from being a socking great story, over and above a darkly edifying one, the Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an informative post script by the author in which he touches on how, and under what conditions, the story came to be written. This is useful since the world of spycraft is perplexing enough without our being left entirely to our own devices. The author's afterword also places the writing proces in the context of the author's subsequent rise as a literary giant, relating it to his own future develpment as a writer as well as to his readership's better appreciation of, not just the ideom, but the creative process itself.<br /><br />Stuart Day<br />PARIS
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Cool graphics, good missions. Much easier to navigate if you use a stylus pen.
0062238868|3.0|A well written first person account of a patriot, soldier, husband, and SEAL. I like the fact the book is an easy read and not a laborious jungle of footnotes. Kyle's description of 'killing' to save American soldiers is riveting. There is just enough background information of Kyle's life to make the story interesting.<br />Inclusion of his wife's written thoughts adds depth to the book.<br />Description of BUD/S training and 'SEAL fun' provides a view of such training few of us will ever realize, nor survive.<br />Waterboarding, various forms of hazing and, indoctrination into the 'warrior' culture is described in detail.<br /><br />Fire arms used and preferred by Kyle is of interest to those of us who like guns.<br /><br />The book depicts Kyle as a human being, not a mindless robot, who kills without reason. A 'good ol boy' from Texas with values all of us Americans should embrace.<br />Some may be put off by Kyle referring to 'Yankees' but, no slight is intended.<br /><br />Chris Kyle indicates he recieved permission from the Navy and \\"their request\\" for changes to the book \\"were honored.\\"<br />Kyle discusses GROMM, Marines, SF, Rangers and does so with respect and admiration for those branches of the military.<br /><br />There are truly some poignant moments in this book and, Kyle does have a sensitive side to his personality, which, is refreshing given his duty as an American Sniper.<br />Some losses described by Kyle during his service to our country are sorrowful indeed.<br />Taya, Kyle's spouse, provides insight into the difficulty of marriage to a SEAL, and, multiple deployments into very hostile territory.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed how the book is broken into smaller segments.<br />I would have liked more images of various countries, and weaponry.<br /><br />American Sniper is an enjoyable book, not scholarly nor for the intellectual, but, a vivid first hand story of  americans at war with a dangerous, fanatical enemy.<br /><br />Almost 4 stars for the book. Definitely 5 stars for Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.<br /><br />Sadly, yesterday February 2, 2013, Chris Kyle was shot here on American soil (Texas). Kyle died from the gunshot which, allegedly, was committed by another veteran soldier at a Texas gun range.<br />Condolences to Mr. Kyle's family.r the book.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's an awesome and amazing game, don't get me wrong. But, it had a few bugs loading when I first got it, and it crashed when I used 'save me', which pretty much stole a Gem from me. So that's one star gone. It wouldn't register my jumps as jumps, it registers them as slides or turns, another star gone. And lastly. The thing that brought my rating down to three stars is that it doesn't load anymore. I uninstalled it, reinstalled it and it still wouldn't load.<br /><br />~Stephano.

B004P1JEXE|3.0|It was always going to be hard to follow book 3 which was outstanding, but book 4 missed the mark for me on a number of levels. Firstly, too many new characters and plot lines were introduced which had me scratching my head to keep up. Secondly, some key plot lines and characters were completely abandoned in the book with no explanation given until the end of the book which was very frustrating. It takes a dedicated reader to keep with the overall plot and to recall plot lines from literally hundreds of pages previous...

1401225756|4.0|In this classic graphic novel, Dream (The Sandman) is captured by a sinister magician and remains trapped for decades. While he is gone, his kingdom falls apart and dreams on Earth are disrupted. I'm not very experienced with graphic novels, having only read Satrapi's Persepolis before this, so reading Preludes and Nocturnes took some getting used to. But I'm glad I decided to climb out of my comfort-zone for a while - I was REALLY enjoying the book by the time it ended. Neil Gaiman's mind never ceases to amaze me. He's so darkly creative. There are a few issues I had with this book, though. I thought the tie-in to DC superheroes was a bit cheesy - though I recognize that this cheese was do to the development of the graphic novel as a genre. I hear these elements disappear later in the series to leave only the good stuff. Also, I found one incident at the end of the book darkly depressing. It made me very sad to see the dark insides of humanity (as Gaiman and his illustrators see them)...but I guess my emotional reaction is exactly what Gaiman was going for. So, points to him.  Overall, this was a promising beginning, and now that I am more used to the graphic novel style, I'm looking forward to enjoying the rest of the series much more - after all, it's only supposed to get better from here!

0451450523|5.0|When a unicorn realizes that she may be the last remaining unicorn, she leaves her peaceful home on a quest to find out what happened to all her brothers and sisters. Along the way, she picks up bumbling magician seeking his talent and a dour cook looking for her lost innocence. The unicorn soon discovers that the world has changed since she last ventured out. Humans have lost their youthful innocence, and they are no longer able to see things as they truly are - humans have excelled in the art of deceiving themselves.<br /><br />When I originally picked up this book, I'd expected a cute young adult tale, but never expected such depth. The Last Unicorn is a multi-layered allegory: about lost innocence, self-fulfilling prophecies, and self-deception. But these cynical themes aren't the main point. The main point is that only in fully understanding humans can the ethereal unicorns save themselves. Only by sacrificing a piece of their ineffable essence can they form a closer bond to humans. And this closer bond can lead humans to do wonderful things.<br /><br />Yes, it is a Christian allegory by my interpretation. But I think it's amazing the way Beagle didn't just throw in a Christ Figure and be done with it....The allegory of Beagle's unicorn isn't uniquely Christian - it defies religious boundaries. It is a story of love and innocence that mixes cynicism and hope. Quite extraordinary!<br /><br />I was also a HUGE fan of the bumbling wizard Schmendrick who (in my opinion) was only fooling himself into believing he wasn't a capable wizard. He's like the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man in Wizard of Oz - just the fact that he wanted so badly to be a wizard made him into one. He could laugh at all the people who deceived themselves, as he unconsciously deceived his own self. He reminded me of myself when I'm in a glum mood thinking I'm not capable of anything when, of course, I'm quite capable if I'd stop expecting so little of myself.  This book was a good reminder to have faith in yourself and think about the consequences of your beliefs.to have faith in yourself and think about the consequences of your beliefs.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|Characters are interesting, complex, and somewhat flawed.  Key characters tend to experience some growth from beginning to end.  The magical abilities represent a twist for me, and mark this as a very imaginative author.  I wouldn't call this book a real page turner, but from start to finish, always looked forward to my nightly reading session and immediately bought book two.  To me this series ranks with Robin Hobbs trilogies and also is as delightful as the R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt series.

B00AG51V8E|4.0|The Cold Light of Day(released Apr/12)stars Henry Cavill as Will Shaw,Sigourney Weaver as Jean Carrack,Bruce Willis as Martin Shaw and others.The film is an intriguing drama with good performances all around,and that includes Cavill,the lead character,who I think has a promising career ahead if he keeps up the good work I witnessed in this film.<br />The story finds Cavill visiting his family in the Costa Del Sol region of Spain,from San Fran.He and his father Willis seem to have a strained relationship and Cavill is in not such a good humour,as he receives a phone call telling him his business has gone bankrupt.Next day the family goes out for a cruise in their sailboat.When a mishap on board occurs Cavill swims ashore to get some antibiotics.When he returns for the swim back,the boat is no where to be seen.He climbs a promontory and spies the boat sitting in a cove not too far away.Getting aboard he finds it to be deserted.He returns to shore and the police take him to a deserted area and introduce him to a man who asks him to come with them.He refuses,commandeers a police car and flees for his life.The pursuit ends when Cavill is run off the road and into a tree.As a cop puts a beating on him Willis pops out of nowhere and subdues the cop.Both father and son flee and Willis comes clean as to his real profession.It seems he works for a secret branch of the CIA,but can tell him little more.Willis has a rendezvous with Weaver,a fellow agent.They talk of a suitcase that Willis retrieved for her,but now he wants back to give to the people that he took it from,to save his family who are being held captive.Weaver is reluctant buts says she will see what she can do.As Willis gets back in the car,shots ring out and Willis falls dead.Retrieving his fathers gun and cell phone Cavill takes off.<br />Cavill is chased through the Madrid streets in car and on foot.A cop is killed by the sniper which looks like Cavill did it,so he is also wanted by the cops.Cavill manages to get to the US Embassy where he meets up with Weaver and the sniper who tried to kill him,in a car outside.He gets in the car but realizes if he stays he is going to end up like his father.He feigns imminent sickness to get out then runs for it.Cavill uses his dads cell phone to call a person called Diego that pops up on his screen quite often.A girl on the other end, directs him to her location but the sniper is there waiting.A tussle ensues and they flee to her uncle Diego's apartment.They find her uncle dead,and Weaver and the sniper are awaiting his arrival,and the convo isn't going amicably.The girl enters and starts blasting which gives she and Cavill a chance to escape to the rooftop.From there they land at a local club whose owner is friends with Diego.Cavill has been wounded in the escape and they help patch him up.<br />During their brief time there Cavill learns that the girl is actually his sister!He also gets a phone call by the kidnappers of his family demanding to talk with Willis.He tells them what has happened to him and he arranges to meet with them.He finds his family still alive and these men all Israeli agents.Willis took the briefcase from them,and they thought he was a rogue agent.It turns out now Willis was just under orders from Weaver,who is the real rogue.The trick now is to retrieve the briefcase,because if they don't Weaver and company will keep hunting Cavill and his family down until they are dead.Right now the family is safe under Israeli custody.<br />At the nightclub the sniper comes looking for Cavill,and the owner and his men are waiting for him.They subdue and beat him but he won't confess to anything.However he escapes and they follow him right back to Weaver who has the briefcase and the sale of it is going down to terrorists in a parking garage.Cavill and an Israeli agent argue and Weaver hears their commotion.She and the sniper shoot the terrorists and flee.The sniper is killed in the chase through Madrid streets and Weaver triesto first outrun Cavill and his\\"new\\" sister.Along the way the tables are turned and all three end up in a terrible crash.Weaver manages to get out of her vehicle first,suitcase in hand,and is about to deal the coup de' gras when she is hit behind and killed by an Israeli agent.The film ends as Cavill and his family are reunited.A US agent offers Cavill a job like his dad but refuses.Cavill's mother and brother go on to introduce themselves to their new daughter/sister.<br />Admittedly there is alot of story to tell here but the pace,editing and drama keep you interested all the way through.I found very few slow ups and just enough twists and turns to keep it all interesting.Mention just has to be made for attention to details in this film,which you rarely see anymore in movies these days.When someone has a vehicular accident in this film,bystanders actually see it,react to it and come over to help.Most films a crash occurs and bystanders,if they are even see,react with little or no emotion let alone actually come to help.Another thing is as little as a car door being opened and left open.In reality your key causes a dinging sound to be heard.In this film you actually hear it,but in most movies you usually hear nothing.I LIKED that aspect of the film.It just made it seem more real and relevant.Bruce Willis is again on game in his relatively smaller part,as is a wonderful appearance by Sigourney \\"Alien\\" Weaver,whom I do not see enough of these days.Also watch for a too brief appearance by one of my favourite DS9(Star Trek-Deep Space Nine)folks,Colm Meaney;yet ANOTHER actor I see too little of.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.<br />All in all a quite good action drama,whose pace,attention to detail and and good solid acting by all,will have you riveted the whole way through.Kudos to Cavill for bringing it to the table.Recommended.to first outrun Cavill and his\\"new\\" sister.Along the way the tables are turned and all three end up in a terrible crash.Weaver manages to get out of her vehicle first,suitcase in

B0050PYNO4|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, but it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  I'm here on Amazon to buy it. :-)  It is not only funny but also has a lot of heart.  The characters are relatable, it is witty and charming, and it has an awesome cast.  :-)  I'd seen a couple Simon Pegg movies and this is by far my favorite, though I'm looking forward to seeing more.  I know this movie isn't for everyone, but I really enjoyed it.  I wish it was more well-known because it's awesome! :-)

B0015D3YQI|4.0|A young girl helps to track down a sadistic killer after discovering that she has the ability to communicate with insects in Dario Argento's PHENOMENA. PHENOMENA lacks much of the stylistic flare that can be found in the director's earlier efforts, save for a few beautifully-shot yet brutally violent death sequences. Although it cannot technically be classified as a Giallo, many of the traits do resemble this Italian form of suspense thriller. Jennifer Connelly plays our young heroine in one of her earliest starring roles. She is convincing enough as Jennifer, but not nearly as enthralling as she could have been in the lead. Donald Pleasance also appears in a small but vital role as entomologist John McGregor, who provides several key pieces to the puzzle. PHENOMENA's greatest misstep is in its arbitrary ending, which really has no bearing on the events that preceded and hardly answers any of the motivations behind the first several murders. This detracts from an otherwise engaging and suspenseful murder mystery. PHENOMENA does provide a fair share of revolting gross-outs and shocking deaths, and while it may not be the best representation of Argento's work, it has certainly earned its place as a fan favorite for many Italian film buffs.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B007549W62|4.0|THE DIVIDE opens with the end of the world. The tenants of a high-rise apartment complex escape the nuclear devastation by hiding out in a bomb shelter beneath the building, but hunger, fear, and paranoia soon begin to tear them apart. This new post-apocalyptic vision follows the same running theme of societal breakdown that is present in many of George Romero's early films, only it is taken through to a much nastier conclusion. Just as we have seen in DAY OF THE DEAD, the trapped survivors quickly descend into the darkest depths of depravity once the veil of civilization has been lifted. Although it is very strongly executed by FRONTIERE(S) director Xavier Gens, THE DIVIDE pushes too hard, making the actions of its characters intolerable to watch. Many tangents are created but then never fully explored, leaving a number of questions unanswered as the film attempts to pick a direction. The timing of events also comes into question considering how quickly things fall into chaos. Still, there is a power and intensity behind THE DIVIDE that borders on madness, giving it a nihilistic edge over other 'End of the World' thrillers.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B009GENZ12|3.0|Over the past decade, children have been disappearing in the downtrodden town of Cold Rock, but now, one mother is fighting back when her son becomes the next victim of the Tall Man. Pascal Laugier, writer and director of the controversial shocker MARTYRS, returns with THE TALL MAN, a suspense thriller that marks a dramatic shift in style and tone from the director's previous film. THE TALL MAN echoes the writings of Stephen King in many ways, but mainly in its small town setting, the monster of legend that plagues the town, and in the narration that is provided by one of the town's young children. Jessica Biel stars as Julia Denning, a nurse whose selfless attempts cannot save the dying community from itself. Biel's performance carries the film, but despite her best efforts, her character simply isn't compelling enough to garner our sympathy or support. While the final reveal may seem like a cheat to the many viewers who set their sights on the supernatural, Laugier still surprises with an altruistic message of hope that few could have anticipated. THE TALL MAN will hold a certain appeal with fans of both Stephen King and M. Night Shyamalan.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B006Z00R1Q|3.0|In 2007, Katie and Kristi were haunted by a terrifying spirit from their past. Now, tapes of their childhood have been discovered that reveal their first encounter with the evil entity. Like the first two films, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 is a long and drawn out waiting game that has very little story to tell in between its shocks and surprises. The characters are none more convincing or likable, and even the little girls are painted as minor annoyances. With enough patience, however, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 provides some of the most frightening moments the series has to offer. It is always more unnerving when children become involved in the supernatural, and CATFISH directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman play this up for all it is worth. Writer Christopher Landon also adds an interesting new element to the background of the haunting that ensures the series' perpetuity. Other than that, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3 varies little from the proven path, so fans of the series will find plenty to love. Others will just be outright bored.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0027V6AL8|4.0|In the future, the government controls all forms of communication, and uses television's most popular game show as a means of public execution for its prisoners. Ex-cop Ben Richards becomes the next unwitting contestant on \\"The Running Man\\" after being set up for murder, forcing him to face off against five of the show's most notorious gladiators in a battle to the death on live TV! Now a cult-classic, THE RUNNING MAN still holds much appeal after nearly 30 years of bloody entertainment. Featuring memorable villains such as Subzero, Buzzsaw, Dynamo, and Fireball, THE RUNNING MAN is a lot like watching a super-powered version of the \\"American Gladiators.\\" The combatants are unleashed into four deadly quadrants that are filled with traps to add to the fun and excitement. Arnold Schwarzenegger is given some of his all-time worst one-liners as Ben Richards, though his presence in the film only adds to the overall camp. Despite its out-dated effects and goofy performances, THE RUNNING MAN ranks highly with fans of other dystopian post-apocalyptic thrillers like THE ROAD WARRIOR, DEATH RACE 2000, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, while it bears much closer resemblance to more modern survival epics like BATTLE ROYALE or THE HUNGER GAMES. Science Fiction fans cannot afford to miss THE RUNNING MAN!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000QE1U9K|4.0|A jettisoned space pod comes crashing down to the prison world of \\"Fury\\" 161, leaving only two survivors: Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, and an alien stowaway. Now, Ripley faces twice the danger on a planet filled with murderers, rapists, and another deadly alien creature. ALIEN 3 is, by far, the darkest film in the ALIEN franchise, surpassing each of the earlier entries only in its apocalyptic vision of the future. A young David Fincher gives us no hope whatsoever on this wretched planet. \\"Fury\\" 161's facilities are rusted and inoperable, its caretakers comprised solely from the dregs of society. The devout prisoners are swept away in a religious fervor as Ripley's arrival along with the alien is interpreted as their final judgement. This drastic shift in tone and overall design can be a bit jarring at first, but repeat viewings create a newfound appreciation for the film when looking at it as a sort of alternate universe or split timeline from the original series. Given the production hell that David Fincher was cast into, it is a surprise the film even came out as well as it did. Studio interference both during and after filming resulted in bad blood and a complete reworking of the film, although the original \\"Assembly Cut,\\" which is widely considered to be the definitive version, is now available. This version restores over thirty-minutes of vital character development and improved story structure that are missing from the theatrical release. Underappreciated and often overlooked, ALIEN 3 is a unique but welcomed entry into the series.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B003GX5CWY|5.0|Arnold is back in one of the biggest and baddest Action/Sci-Fi adventures of all time: PREDATOR! A team of special operatives are sent on a rescue mission to save a group of American hostages, when they quickly discover that they are the ones being hunted by an unseen foe deep within the jungles of South Ameria. By combining the wall-to-wall action of RAMBO with the otherworldly terror of Ridley Scott's ALIEN, PREDATOR has become a universal classic that brings together fans of Science Fiction, Action, and Horror. The plot is simple yet effective, and leaves plenty of room for the bloody set pieces to follow. The key casting creates a powerhouse of memorable characters, led, of course, by fan favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger, but backed by equally enjoyable performances from mean man Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, and Carl Weathers. PREDATOR plays out like your average shoot 'em up, until we hear the unnerving clicking of the alien creature as the screen shifts into infrared, warning us that our heroes are not alone. Armed to the teeth with futuristic weaponry and light-bending armor, the Predator is the perfect hunter. It is smart, resourceful, and equally deadly. With reptilian skin, sharp mandibles, and a defining set of dreadlocks that reach down from beneath its battle helmet, the Predator is one of the most unique and interesting creature designs ever caught on film, adding to Stan Winston's impressive collection. Alan Silvestri's primal score also adds excitement and intrigue to the fast-paced action and violence. At the time of this writing, PREDATOR has produced two sequels and countless spin-offs in all forms of media spanning over the course of the last two decades, which proves the lasting impact of John McTiernan's classic film in pop culture.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B006RED4GA|3.0|The two remaining innkeepers at the Yankee Pedlar Inn get more than they bargained for when they set out to capture evidence of the hotel's legendary ghost in THE INNKEEPERS, Ti West's highly-anticipated followup to HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. Once again, the director moves to impress with his incredible talent for balancing a slow, deliberate pace with clever characters and spooky suspense, though the same can't be said for the plot, itself. Sara Paxton and Pat Healy couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the two awkward leads, bringing their own dry wit and innocent charm to the characters. For all West's skills as a writer and director, however, he is found lacking as an effective storyteller. He simply doesn't know where to go with his films, and as a result, they typically fall apart in the final act. THE INNKEEPERS is no exception. While we have fun sitting back and laughing with his two bumbling hotel clerks, the questions set up in the first several chapters are left entirely open-ended, and the mild shocks do not compensate for the lengthy build and anticipation. Still, it is impossible to deny the man's skill behind a camera. Even the most trivial scenes are made interesting through his keen visual style, which keeps the audience glued to the screen despite the overall lack of action. Fans of the slow burn will appreciate the many redeeming qualities in THE INNKEEPERS, and it is sure to receive a cult status amongst other subtle haunts like THE CHANGELING, THE SENTINEL, or BURNT OFFERINGS.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B007I1Q4W2|4.0|Amidst the ravages of the Civil War, a strange outbreak of living death has spread across the fields of battle, causing the dead to rise up and consume the flesh of the living. A lone warrior is left to carve a new life in this twisted new world, but he will find even more to fear in the other surviving humans than in the walking dead. John Geddes' ambitious period piece reshapes the history of the walking dead in EXIT HUMANITY. Not only is the film beautifully shot and finely dressed in its best wartime attire, but it also provides powerful performances by its leading cast members Mark Gibson and Adam Seybold. Geddes spends his time carefully crafting his characters without feeling the need to rush either the action or gore, an encouraging trait that is shared with television's The Walking Dead. This allows for a clear emotional rapport with our lead that is carried on through the end of his journey. Bill Moseley joins the cast as the disillusioned General Williams, along with Dee Wallace and Stephen McHattie in other supporting roles. Rich in character, atmosphere, and mood, EXIT HUMANITY is never to be overlooked.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B005LAIHCM|3.0|Elissa becomes enamored with the neighbor next door despite his family's bloody history, but Ryan has several secrets of his own that he plans to keep hidden in the HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET. Mark Tonderai's new thriller loses itself in tired old cliches that have long since lost their appeal. The film is terribly miscast, forcing Elisabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence into an awkward mother/daughter relationship that feels very unnatural on screen. Max Thieriot's mousy performance is rather unconvincing as well, and lacks the impact needed in order to leave a lasting impression. The supposed twists offer few surprises, especially for audiences that have already seen the same story played out in a hundred different ways. This drains the film of any suspense, while the lapses in logic and poor decision making by the characters are sure to infuriate viewers. It would be better to just lock HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET away in the cellar with the countless other PSYCHO-spawns than to have anyone else suffer through another uninspired copy.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B00005JLEU|5.0|Prepare yourself for a magical journey in SPIRITED AWAY, the acclaimed Japanese animation by renown director Hayao Miyazaki. Chihiro finds herself lost in the spirit world after her parents are transformed into pigs by a malevolent witch, and she must gather her strength and courage if she hopes to save them! SPIRITED AWAY transports us to a fantasy world that is filled with strange and magnificent creatures who are brought to life through Miyazaki's captivating animated style. Chihiro's journey is a timeless story of self-discovery and the coming of age, where a young girl first discovers love and compassion by acting outside herself. Miyazaki uses traditional storytelling techniques to paint a unique new fairy tale that children of all ages can relate to, while keeping with its Japanese origins. The sometimes horrifying creatures that Chihiro encounters each represent a stage of childhood that she must overcome, and bring with them valuable lessons that she will use in her budding adolescence. SPIRITED AWAY provides childlike wonder for kids and adults alike, and is a masterpiece of modern animation.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

Those pesky pre-historic piranhas have found their way into a new lake, but unfortunately for the locals, the lake also serves as the source for the the new Big Wet water park! If you thought PIRANHA 3D was in poor taste, you ain't seen nuthin' yet! The creative team behind the cult-classic FEAST takes over in this direct-to-video sequel, and they have really nailed it this time. PIRANHA 3DD shoots way over the top with its crude humor and exploitative fun, throwing political-correctness to the wind along with plenty of limbs and bikini tops. Don't let the 'R' rating fool you... This film has more gratuitous nudity and violence than any Uncut DVD on the market. All contextualized, of course. Where PIRANHA 3D never struck an even balance between the humor and horror, director John Gulager and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan keep the pace moving a mile a minute as they shock, entertain, and completely disgust along the way. If that weren't enough, PIRANHA 3DD unleashes the one-and-only David Hasselhoff in a brilliant self-parody for the final act.

Specifically targeting the unintentional humor and camp of Travel Channel's \\"Ghost Adventures,\\" The Vicious Brothers play up the over-the-top nature of the show's hosts and the sensationalism of their so-called \\"evidence.\\" These gimmicks pay off in the first third, where the stupid actions taken by the idiotic characters actually serve to disarm the viewer against the initial scares. Trouble comes later, when the subtleties of moving objects and slamming doors give way to a ridiculous special effects show.

B00471TLZS|5.0|\\"They're here!\\" Steve Freeling and his family move in to a beautiful new neighborhood, only to find that their home is infested with evil spirits in the 1980's Horror classic POLTERGEIST! POLTERGEIST presents an image of the ideal American family turned upside down by the supernatural forces at work within their home, but one who manages to find strength in one another in order to overcome all obstacles. The film is perfectly cast as such, with JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson playing the loving, down-to-earth parents who live in a quiet California suburb with their three kids (and Golden Retriever, of course). We instantly relate to them because they are heartfelt and real, but also because they are imperfect just like the rest of us. These small town vibes can largely be attributed to the involvement of writer/producer Steven Spielberg, who has long been rumored to have taken over the director's chair while filming with TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE creator Tobe Hooper. Using state-of-the-art technology from Industrial Light and Magic, the spirits in POLTERGEIST were brought to life on screen unlike anything audiences had ever experienced in the past. The scares are softened by the film's light-hearted mood and Jerry Goldsmith's gentle score, making it enjoyable for all ages despite a few startling moments. Although her life was tragically cut short, POLTERGEIST will forever hold the legacy of Heather O'Rourke intact thanks to her endearing performance as Carol Anne Freeling, the family's youngest daughter. Carol Anne has since become one of the most recognizable characters within the genre, while POLTERGEIST is commonly cited as being one of the greatest Horror movies of all-time.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Hammer Horror returns in full force in the 2012 film adaptation of THE WOMAN IN BLACK, starring Daniel Radcliffe. A lowly young lawyer is sent to prepare the sale of a grand old estate, the Eel Marsh House, but unbeknownst to him, the house carries with it an ominous curse that has been plaguing the children of the small town for years. After settling in, Arthur begins experiencing horrific visions as the ghosts of the past return to haunt him! THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an excellent revival of the Gothic tradition that echoes the works of Jack Clayton and Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar in their retellings of the classic novella, The Turn of the Screw. A constant sense of dread befalls the viewer as we are drowned in mists and shadows. Director James Watkins takes a timely approach to storytelling of his own which pays off entirely, and allows for many long, drawn out sequences to incrementally heighten the tension and suspense as we await the final shock in the end. THE WOMAN IN BLACK also focuses heavily on eerie effects which can be achieved in frame rather than destroying the fantasy through computerized scares. Daniel Radcliffe is amply equipped for the role as the grieving lawyer Arthur Kipps, and plays perfectly in to the Edwardian setting. One can only hope that this will continue to spark more ghostly haunts in the terrifying tradition of the Hammer House of Horror.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

If that isn't enough, drop a PG-13 rating on the film and hire a middle-aged hack to play the lead character as a final slap in the face to all of the fans.<br /><br />In GHOST RIDER, motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze makes a pact with the devil to save his father's life, but in exchange, he is tricked into becoming the devil's bounty hunter. As the Spirit of Vengeance, Ghost Rider must take off across the American Southwest to recover an ancient scroll for his new master while battling the forces of evil along the way.<br /><br />GHOST RIDER is a comic fan's worst nightmare. It demonstrates everyone's darkest fears when it comes to studio involvement tainting our most beloved characters on screen. Watching GHOST RIDER is like watching a competition for \\"World's Worst Actor.\\" Eva Mendez must have breathed a sigh of relief when she was cast beside Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze's love interest. Even her stunning good looks cannot distract from her talentless performance. Nic Cage, on the other hand, can. Somewhere along the lines, Nic Cage must have mistaken the script for a comedy just as he had done in THE WICKER MAN remake, since he certainly makes a fool of himself the entire film. This version of Johnny Blaze is nothing but a disgrace to the tragic character in the comics, and Cage takes it upon himself to ham it up at every turn. And that still leaves out Wes Bentley, whose flamboyant take on the villainous Blackheart is laughable at best.<br /><br />Try as he might, Mark Steven Johnson simply cannot pull together a major comic book adaptation. He makes the same mistakes in GHOST RIDER as he had in DAREDEVIL, placing far too much emphasis on comedy and cheap romance in place of the violent action, pathos, and quest for revenge that are inherent to the story of Johnny Blaze. While there are several winning moments in the effects department that bring classic comic panels to life in a stunning display of fire and brimstone, the visual success of the film cannot compete with Johnson's failures in the scriptwriting process. Poor decisions regarding the uneven tone of the film and the absurd actions taken by the characters only serve to drive a deepening wedge between the audience and the events on screen.<br /><br />Why Columbia would gamble away a major movie franchise on such a pitiful combination of writing, acting, and directing, the world may never know, but the complete and utter failure of the film's first sequel will hopefully prevent the studio from doing any further damage to the character of the Ghost Rider.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesst for revenge that are inherent to the story of Johnny Blaze.

Ridley Scott returns to the Science Fiction genre in a major way with PROMETHEUS, a spiritual prequel to the 1979 classic ALIEN. PROMETHEUS falls very closely in line with the look, feel, and overall mood of the original ALIEN, following a similar structure that includes many familiar characters and settings. Where the two diverge is in their actual storytelling techniques. ALIEN tells a simple yet effective story that comes to a conclusive end after the rising tension found in the first and second acts. The unavoidable plot holes that frequent PROMETHEUS raise more questions than answers every step along the way, leaving the audience to question the writers intentions more so than the grandiose theological discussions that are being proposed. If one thing is for certain, however, it is that Ridley Scott has lost none of his command over this visual medium, creating a mind-blowing display of visual effects that take us well into the next century and beyond the farthest reaches of space. With the suspension of disbelief held high, PROMETHEUS can surely be enjoyed as an epic space adventure in search of far greater meaning amongst the stars.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B002GHHHG0|5.0|George Romero and Stephen King team-up for the first time to bring us five sordid tales of terror in the classic styling of the EC comics! A crazed Aunt Bedelia meets up with the ghosts of her past when dear old dad returns from the grave in \\"Father's Day.\\" Nunkhead Jordy Verrill discovers a meteor out on the old family farm, but his dreams of riches are dashed when the stone cracks open and begins to envelop everything in a deadly green moss in \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill.\\" After burying his wife and her lover neck-deep in sand as the tide slowly draws in, the conniving Richard Vickers thinks he has gotten away with the perfect crime, but the torn lovers return for revenge in \\"Something to Tide You Over.\\" Henry Northrup finds an interesting way to get rid of his loud-mouthed wife, Wilma, when a ferocious beast is discovered hidden beneath the stairs of the local university in \\"The Crate.\\" Finally, loathsome businessman and germaphobe Upson Pratt is overcome by a swarm of filthy cockroaches in \\"They're Creeping Up On You!\\"<br /><br />CREEPSHOW is indisputably the best omnibus feature to come out of the 1980's, rivaling even the finest efforts put forth by Britain's Amicus Productions throughout the 1960's and 70's. Romero adds several nice touches to give the film the look and feel of a living comic book: unnatural blue and red coloring, odd angles, animated transitions, and framed paneling, all of which contribute to the unique aesthetic in the end. He has also assembled a fine cast for each of the stories, with wickedly entertaining performances from Viveca Lindfors, Leslie Nielsen, Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, and E.G. Marshall.

B007H7XJD4|3.0|Long ago, a battle raged in the heavens. The victors took the name of the gods, and cast the defeated titans down into an earthly prison for all eternity. Now, the vengeful King Hyperion looks to find the weapon of the gods in order to free the titans and wage war against all humanity! Our only hope lies in a young warrior, who must rise up to lead the Hellenes against the armies of Hyperion. Tarsem Singh delivers another stunning visual experience that owes as much to Zack Snyder's 300 as it does to the Neoclassical paintings of Jacques-Louis David, contrasting its vibrant colors and surreal landscapes against the bloody violence. For all of the incredible style seen in IMMORTALS, however, it is mostly devoid of character and emotion, streamlining the plot in a rush to reach the over-budgeted action sequences. As truly awesome as these scenes may be, they are spread far too thin, and the final battle lacks the epic scale promised by the opening act. Henry Cavill plays a competent hero alongside another wildly over-the-top performance by Mickey Rourke as the sinister Hyperion. IMMORTALS packs enough mind-blowing imagery and memorable movie moments to win over fans of 300.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B004742Y40|5.0|From 1985 comes the classic coming-of-age comedy, TEEN WOLF, starring Michael J. Fox! As if homework weren't already hard enough, high school loser Scott Howard starts noticing some odd changes as he is transformed into a teenage werewolf. His enhanced abilities and scary new look quickly make him a star on the court and the most popular kid in school, but as Scott begins to lose himself in \\"the animal,\\" he must learn that with great power comes great responsibility. Michael J. Fox gives another entertaining performance as Scott Howard, whose shy apprehension prior to his literal and figurative transformation makes him a lovable dork. TEEN WOLF is clearly a product of its time, following strict standards that have been set forth by other teen comedies of the era. Memorable moments like Scott's trip to the liquor store and the van surfing scene have made this a fan favorite for decades, however, and for good reason. Despite the obvious 1980's cliches, the humor is well-written, the lines are perfectly delivered, and the monster make-up used to turn Fox into the wolf couldn't be more suitable to add a soft horror edge. It's time to take a trip back and rewatch TEEN WOLF today!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0047SF41G|3.0|A group of warriors and weapons experts from all across the world are transported to an alien planet to face off against an elite band of otherworldly hunters in PREDATORS, the long-awaited third entry in the action-packed series. While director Nimrod Antal strikes many successful chords in the look, sound, and feel of the film, he somehow misses the mark in the overall production. There is no subtlety to be found in the bold references to the original. Instead, PREDATORS shows more imitation than appreciation for John McTiernan's film. The poorly chosen characters are awkwardly assembled, making it difficult to accept that they would work together as a team when there is no sense of camaraderie between any of them. It is also impossible to take Laurence Fishburne and Adrian Brody seriously in their ridiculously over-the-top roles. What is worse, the contrived dialog has Brody's roughneck leader spell out the Predators' plans every step of the way. Despite its many flaws, the lush jungle setting and steady action beats help to drive the film forward. KNB EFX Group comes out the winner with their excellent redesigns on the all-new aliens, referencing the classic appearance that they had helped to create alongside Special FX wizard Stan Winston in the late 80's while revamping them with all-new weapons and modifications. PREDATORS may be pretty to look at with its big explosions and loud noises, but its lack of originality and weak storytelling make it a bland sequel overall.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B005FJ7DOM|4.0|The world has been ravished by despair after a deadly plague has transformed most of the population into bloodthirsty vampires. Martin and his mentor, Mister, set off through dangerous territory in the hopes of reaching the safe haven known as New Eden, but in order to do so, they will have to fight their way through hordes of the undead, let alone an army of crazed religious fanatics that have embraced \\"God's wrath.\\" Nick Damici and Jim Mickle follow up their vastly underrated feature debut, MULBERRY STREET, with another powerful post-apocalyptic vision of hell starring Damici as the mysterious vampire slayer, \\"Mister.\\" The scope of the picture feels all-encompassing, transforming the entire world into an undead nightmare on a relatively small-scale. Damici creates an excellent new anti-hero in Mister, with his brash behavior and uncaring attitude amounting to a memorable performance overall. Connor Paolo comes as a much bigger surprise, however, as Mister's argil apprentice, Martin. His sincerity and vulnerability are what draw us in to their unfortunate predicament as they race for survival. With the human element already in place, we turn to the unbridled terror of Mickle's vampires. The creatures function on a level of base instinct, and attack with the ferocity of an untamed animal. This makes for many frighteningly intense moments as Mister and Martin find themselves in inescapable situations against overwhelming odds. STAKE LAND succeeds on almost every level, and is a refreshing change of pace for vampire fans.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B007WULJ5G|4.0|Sick, twisted, and disturbing are inadequate terms used to describe Srdjan Spasojevic's notorious new Exploitation picture, A SERBIAN FILM. Reprehensible, ultra-violent pornography is much more accurate, but in a world that has become numbed to sex, violence, and gore in a film, is this not what we crave? Spasojevic brings us the next generation of shock, working off of similar themes to those found in Pier Paolo Pasolini's SALO and Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES. The only world in which A SERBIAN FILM can be made is a world in which it can be sold and consumed, and the record number of reviews for this film show that viewers the world over are ready for this extreme form of entertainment. For those of you who have watched this film and protested its graphic content, you must ask yourself \\"Why did I watch this film in the first place? Was it not my own morbid curiosity that drove me to see it?\\" A SERBIAN FILM is easy enough to avoid just in reading the film's synopsis:<br /><br />Milos, a poor and retired porn star, is offered the deal of a lifetime to return to his previous profession for one final film. The catch is that he is unable to read the script, a fact that he will soon live to regret as he and his family are pulled in to the director's horrifying new vision...<br /><br />Drugs, rape, incest, torture... All of the things that a proper society looks extricate or ignore are prominently displayed on screen in graphic detail, and for no better reason than to disgust. The fact that this film has been censored and re-released in several edited forms in a day and age where 'Uncut' and 'Not Rated' have become huge selling points can speak to the film's power. Its continued sale, however, only serves to prove Spasojevic's point: That there is a market for everything... 'Newborn Porn' not excluded. A SERBIAN FILM is only softened by the fact that it is so professionally made and cleanly shot, placing the filter of fiction over the characters' actions and the audience. Had Spasojevic employed a hand-held approach and bought in to the \\"found-footage\\" trend, we may have been faced with dangerous and potentially criminal results. We must then ask ourselves, \\"What's next?\\" Who will be the one that takes that next step, and when they do, will we watch? It is difficult to justify a film with such explicit content, but, if for nothing else, A SERBIAN FILM becomes a valid form of art when it forces us to confront alarming issues such as these in any medium.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror MoviesHad Spasojevic employed a hand-held approach and bought in to the \\"found-footage\\" trend, we may have been faced with dangerous and potentially criminal results.

B00006G8K0|5.0|Following the overwhelming success of their first Gothic Horror revival, THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Hammer Films quickly moved on to their own bloody retelling of the Bram Stoker classic, Dracula, known internationally as the HORROR OF DRACULA. In this version, Doctor Van Helsing is left to defend the Holmwood family from the virulent Count Dracula after his associate, Jonathan Harker, falls victim to the vampire's wrath. While the characters and events differ greatly from the original novel, Hammer has placed their own unmistakable stamp on the horror legend. Having only appeared briefly in THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN as the abominable, Christopher Lee received his breakthrough role in HORROR OF DRACULA as the titular Count. Lee embodies Dracula's more eloquent and aristocratic mannerisms in the film's opening before transforming into the ferocious beast of a man that would dominate the remaining sequels. Peter Cushing, on the other hand, had already solidified his standing in the genre with his phenomenal portrayal of the twisted Doctor Frankenstein the previous year, but here, he also establishes himself as the definitive Doctor Van Helsing in another impeccable performance. In true Hammer style, HORROR OF DRACULA displays a heightened sense of sexuality that goes hand in hand with the increased gore, shocking audiences with a generous dose of crimson blood along with the film's horrifying finale. Terence Fisher roams every inch of Bernard Robinson's lavish sets, instilling a constant sense of dread as he traipses through the misty graveyards and imposing castle walls. HORROR OF DRACULA is as equally responsible for establishing the dark Gothic resurgence of the late 1950's as THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and serves as a vital piece of cinematic history within the annals of Horror.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B005JE7WKI|4.0|Two simpleminded hillbillies head for the mountains to fix up their new vacation home, a dilapidated cabin, when they fall under attack by a group of college kids that have mistaken them for psychotic serial killers! Move over, Jason, Horror has a new mascot... Two actually, in TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL! Eli Craig's brilliant satire of the Slasher genre has all of the same sharply-written humor as SCREAM minus the pretentious overtures, turning Horror on its head by playing off of every major movie trope with hilarious results. Simple misunderstandings give off sinister appearances, as the college kids confuse Tucker and Dale's good-natured acts as attempts to kill them! When one of the girls slips on a rock, Dale heroically saves her from the lake, but the teens only see an unconscious body being dragged from the water! As they attempt to rescue her, Tucker accidentally saws into a beehive, and comes charging into the woods with a chainsaw, causing one of the kids to impale himself on a tree branch! Bits like this only cover half of the humor, because the real smarts come out in Craig's witty dialog. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk downplay their roles for maximum effect, providing plenty of laughs and keen comedic timing along the way. TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is bloody good fun from start to finish, earning its place right beside other modern revisionist classics like BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON and LONG PIGS!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B002SSBD6W|4.0|I went into this hoping I'd find a reasoned, neutral-perspective narrative about how some guy decided to be a vegetarian/vegan, and indeed this is how the author kind of lays out the book in the beginning.<br /><br />This is not what happens.  It's clear early on that this isn't someone that's been on the fence about whether he should eat meat, this is a man who has always at some level been disgusted with the idea, but has been inconsistent.  So this book is mostly propaganda about how horrible the poor animals must feel etc.  Which isn't to say this is trash, just that there's a clear agenda.<br /><br />Worth reading nonetheless I'd say, as a meat-eater.  There are some good points he makes buried underneath some nonsense metaphors and logical leaps of faith
B00000K3D4|5.0|Following the success of THE DARK CRYSTAL, director Jim Henson set out with collaborators Frank Oz and Brian Fround to bring another magical world of myth and wonder to life in LABYRINTH. Our story begins as young Sarah accidentally wishes away her baby brother to the kingdom of the Goblin King, whose castle lies beyond a great labyrinth. Sarah must gather her courage and join forces with a group of unusual allies if she hopes to overcome the maze and win back her brother! Jennifer Connelly stars as the headstrong Sarah, whose grand adventure serves as her own coming of age tale. Sarah must learn to put away her childish toys and accept the responsibilities of adulthood if she hopes to save Toby. David Bowie makes for an enchanting villain just opposite of her as Jareth the Goblin King. The memorable musical numbers that he has written and performed for the film capture a softer side of the artist's unique style. But it is the world of the Labyrinth, itself, that deserves the most attention. The fanciful creatures and elaborate designs make this one of the most imaginative creations in Fantasy cinema. Borrowing from Alice in Wonderland and other traditional fairy tales, it forces Sarah to match both wit and strength in order to succeed. Like THE DARK CRYSTAL and THE NEVERENDING STORY, LABYRINTH is a timeless classic for the both young and the young at heart.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000R7HY0K|3.0|Eight sexy young women are about to take the ride of their lives when they are stalked by a predatory stunt driver who uses his car as a weapon in Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF! DEATH PROOF is trademark Tarantino: Overly long, pretentious strings of dialog that are aimed at indulging the director more so than progressing the plot. The exhausting speeches that these broads deliver never make up for the overall lack of action, and are far less amusing than the director intended them to be. This is especially true when they are coming from a collection of characters that never would possess such finely-tuned powers of articulation. Tarantino is simply setting us up for his now-expected action beats that place an exclamation point at the end of each drawn out piece of exposition. With the exception of a big-name cast, Tarantino comes far closer than Robert Rodriguez in emulating the Exploitation experience during his half of the GRINDHOUSE double-feature. He achieves a gritty realism using fast-paced and explosive car chases that have been have not been tampered with using computer enhancement, which amplifies the excitement and danger. It is in these moments that Tarantino succeeds most, creating the modern equivalent to his own personal favorites VANISHING POINT and DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY. It takes so long to finally get to these last-minute thrills that most of the audience has likely checked out already. DEATH PROOF does provide enough momentary satisfaction to make it worth sitting through to the end, however, and the final chase at least adds a heart racing grand finale to an otherwise dull movie.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000FA57US|3.0|After the traumatic events that occurred last Halloween, Jamie Lloyd has been sent to live in a children's psychiatric clinic, but Dr. Loomis is convinced that the girl now possesses a psychic link to her murderous uncle. Loomis attempts to use young Jamie to bring Michael out in to the open for a final confrontation! HALLOWEEN 5 is the first major lull in the series. Although it uses many of the same devices from HALLOWEEN 4, they produce much lesser results. The character of Jamie that audiences had fallen in love with from before is now left psychic and mute, as if she had been ripped away from some poorly-scripted B-Movie. Michael's motives seem much more muddled here, as well. He is reduced to being just another faceless villain from any old Slasher film as he takes off after drunken, sex-crazed teenagers at a local party. The suspense is minimal, and the deaths provide little satisfaction or significance. Danielle Harris still succeeds despite the flaws that have now been written into her role, but Donald Pleasence is forced to call in a cold and considerably darker performance that seems unbefitting of his character. The one scene that truly stands out in this entry is shared between Michael and Jamie, where Michael momentarily forgets his murderous rage when confronted by his young niece. HALLOWEEN 5 points the series in a regrettable new direction that would continue to spin out of control in the next installment.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

1559408855|4.0|Criticized for being one of the most disgusting and depraved films of all-time, SALO certainly lives up to its reputation. This Exploitation classic is set in Fascist Italy during World War II, and follows a group of corrupt politicians who have used their power and influence to kidnap twenty teens so that they can subject them the most unimaginable acts of psychological and sexual torture. Pier Paolo Pasolini keeps with the themes of voyeurism that had previously been explored in PEEPING TOM and PSYCHO by directly involving the audience in the deplorable events that are occurring on screen. He achieves this through his dry documentary shooting style, and by placing the viewer behind the eyes of a binocular in the film's closing scenes, where we witness several victims being raped, castrated, beheaded, or worse. Pasolini boldly lashes out at the viewer, asking \\"If you find all of this is to be so disturbing, then why are you still watching?\\" Man's voyeuristic tendencies and morbid curiosities are pushed to the veritable extreme through these striking images of exploitation, which also include ritualistic orgies, sodomization, and fecalphilia. SALO is more than just a comment against power and corruption, but a complete attack on the senses that can be neither unseen nor forgotten. It is years ahead of its time, prefacing the controversial works of Michael Haneke by over a decade.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B000002LK1|5.0|Without a doubt, Violator is Depeche Mode's magnum opus. This was my very first DM album and the one that got me hooked on their music. Although I was only 11 when it was released, I recall hearing \\"enjoy the silence\\" on pop radio stations everywhere in late May/June of that year and immediately fell in love with Depeche Mode. But the song on this album that truly struck a chord in me was \\"policy of truth\\"; which at the time was unlike anything I had ever heard before. When you hear that song, for the very first time, you will never look at the World the same way again. I like to think of Violator as the quintessential album of the 1990s: Dark, sinister, and evocative. Pop music in 1990 was pretty much a continuation of the late 80s trend. But Violator was so different from other mainstream music and it really stood out as a sign of what was soon to come. Talk about great timing! Much of the early 90s was dominated by gloomy, nihilist music on all fronts and after hearing this album I pretty much ceased listening to popular music entirely. Depeche Mode did most of their work in the 80s, but even then they were far ahead of their time and Violator is an album that NEVER gets old no matter how many times you listen to it.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|Charles Addams' kooky characters from the classic comic strip and television series return to life in their own feature film, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, from 1991. THE ADDAMS FAMILY is a macabre masterpiece of comic horror, and one of the finest of its breed. The refined humor is both witty and intelligent, but equally matched with entertaining sight gags and physical comedy. While no one could ever truly replace John Astin, Carolyn Jones, and the rest of the original stars, the casting is simply inspired. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are worthy successors as Gomez and Morticia Addams, losing themselves in the morbid characters. A young Christina Ricci steals the show in her wicked performance as Wednesday Addams. If any one thing succeeds over the acting and writing in THE ADDAMS FAMILY, it is the incredible production design that brings the Addams household to life and gives it a playful character of its own. THE ADDAMS FAMILY is nothing short of a modern classic that lives up to (and often succeeds over) the original series.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B005OK722U|2.0|The stakes turn deadly for four friends when their bachelor party lands them in a seedy nightclub off the Las Vegas Strip that is run by the secretive Elite Hunting organization! With creator Eli Roth out of the picture for the third film in the popular HOSTEL franchise, Scott Spiegel seemed like an ideal candidate to take over in his place. After all, Spiegel has worked closely with childhood friend Sam Raimi on numerous pictures, and even directed the cult Slasher INTRUDER, a film in which he deployed the same twisted sense of humor that is often found in the HOSTEL series. Despite these facts, Spiegel turns out a painfully stupid and uninviting sequel that is completely devoid of the most entertaining elements of the original. The dark, Eastern European setting has been exchanged for the bright lights of Vegas, only the majority of the film takes place off of the strip, making the location of the events irrelevant. None of the characters are perceived as being heroic or even remotely likeable for that matter, making their prolonged deaths a matter of celebration. And if that weren't enough, the inventive torturing devices for which the series has become notorious are reduced to the same tired methods of dispatch that you could find in any dollar bin DVD. With SAW already on its \\"final chapter,\\" it seems that the Torture Porn genre has finally run its course, so HOSTEL may be closing its doors for good after this disaster.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

As she attempts to settle in to a normal life with her sister, she is haunted by horrible images from the past, where she had become part of a hippie commune led by the persuasive and charismatic Patrick. Martha's nightmares, fear, and paranoia continue to build until she is unable to separate her dreams from reality. First-time director Sean Durkin has struck immediate success with MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE, the award-winning cult drama from 2011. Durkin delicately interlaces the past and the present as he retells Martha's chilling experiences using an organic story structure. It is terrifying to think just how easily an impressionable mind could be manipulated and controlled in such a way, but Durkin takes all of the right steps in disarming the audience in the same way that Patrick has disarmed his followers, perfectly illustrating the power of coercion and the psychological lures that draw people in to such a group. Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal as Martha, and commits herself mind, body, and soul. There are moments where Martha makes contact with the viewer and causes them to turn away in shame for intruding into her thoughts and emotions. John Hawkes is deadly as Patrick, coming on with a subtle charm that effectively seduces the other characters under his spell before corrupting their minds.

B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|What would you do if you had super powers? Would you use them for good, or for something else? Andrew and his friends discover an object hidden deep beneath the earth that endows each of them with extraordinary abilities, but as they soon learn, with great power comes great responsibility. CHRONICLE is their story, as told from Andrew's camcorder. The use of the first-person perspective in this is both a blessing and a curse, as always. It is often difficult to accept the footage as fact when it is so cleanly shot and scripted, which prevents the complete suspension of belief. As a work of pure fantasy, however, it pushes the concept to its veritable extremes, exploring the psychology of the super hero from an entirely new perspective. Andrew, Matt, and Steve take us through their daily lives, the challenges they face as teenagers, and show us just how thin the line is between good and evil. Little pranks have costly results, and without constant restraint, their virtually-limitless abilities quickly grow out of control. What director Josh Trank achieves in camera and through the seamless special effects is nothing short of amazing. Any of the believability that is lost in the storytelling is more than made up for in the clever camera work and the super-charged ending.

Now, Death has returned to reclaim the victims that escaped their fiery demise... FINAL DESTINATION: The ultimate excuse for contrived screenwriting! The FINAL DESTINATION series gave the typical Teen Slasher an all-new angle that moves away from the hockey-masked killer and into the realm of the supernatural. The films are always about surprise and anticipation, not so much in regards to who is going to die, but when and how. The first FINAL DESTINATION provides thrilling shocks in every death that defy audience expectations. Clever clues are laid out for both the characters and the audience to determine the next method of execution, and yet each death arrives with a sudden jolt. Director James Wong puts together another clean-cut cast of familiar teen faces, with Devon Sawa in the lead as the paranoid Alex Browning and Ali Larter chasing closing behind him as the stereotypically strange and misunderstood Clear Rivers. As silly and absurd as the series often may be, it provides plenty of mindless entertainment as we anxiously await each bloody new death.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

Now, Charley must enlist the help of famed vampire expert Peter Vincent to track down the fanged menace before he can sink his teeth into the rest of the neighborhood! FRIGHT NIGHT returns to the big screen in the 2011 remake, which unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Unlike Tom Holland's 1980's cult classic, which modernized the vampire mythos while paying homage to the films of the 50's and 60's, the only things this new version seems concerned about is looking cool and selling copies of the soundtrack. The plot has been slightly restructured in the first half to provide enough surprises for returning audiences as to keep things fresh, but the unnecessary escalation of action and computerized effects leads to a major let down in the second half. Careless screenwriting also leaves us with countless questions, since there do not appear to be any consequences for any of the characters' actions (particularly when no one can be bothered to investigate Charley's house fire or how and why he arrived at the hospital in a car that was stolen from a dead man). Filmmakers Craig Gillespie and Marti Noxon appear to have no interest in telling a convincing story or building suspense, and instead focus on being teen-edgy and hip. Colin Farrell hams it up in another over-the-top performance as Jerry the vampire, though he does fit the part of the handsome and seductive stud next door.<br /><br />FRIGHT NIGHT is to the original what DISTURBIA is to REAR WINDOW: a trite, soulless retelling of the same old story used to capitalize on the teen dollar. Where the original is revered by fans, this version will quickly be forgotten.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B00000JPH6|5.0|Somewhere, in a world beyond imagination, a young Gelfling sets off on a perilous quest to save his dying planet by returning a missing shard to the planet's power source: The Dark Crystal. An evil race of bird-like creatures known as the Skekses look to stop Jen, but with the help of his newfound friends, he will gather the strength and courage needed to overcome all obstacles and free the world from their tyranny! THE DARK CRYSTAL is one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments achieved through the combined talents of Jim Henson and Frank Oz. It is the first feature film to be constructed out of an entirely inhuman cast, using the advanced methods of animatronics and puppetry that the directors helped to conceive throughout the late 70's. With the help of artist Brian Froud, this creative team has developed a fantasy world unlike any other, complete with its own unique creatures and wondrous landscapes. It is, however, a dark and terrifying film as well, much unlike the cheerful children's programs for which the directors had previously been known. Along with LABYRINTH and THE NEVERENDING STORY, THE DARK CRYSTAL is a cult classic when it comes to dark Children's Fantasy and Horror.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

0767817664|5.0|Charley Brewster has a problem... It seems his neighbor may be a vampire, so he has enlisted the help of his friends and local celebrity Peter Vincent to oust the fanged fiend from the neighborhood, but his toothy adversary won't be going without a fight. \\"Welcome to Fright Night!\\" Tom Holland brings us his own hilarious homage to the traditions of Gothic Horror in the 1985 classic. The clever plays on genre conventions are pleasing to any Horror fan, as Holland exploits the vampire mythos for maximum effect. Cloves of garlic, crosses, holy water... All of the standard rules still apply, but it is how Holland uses them that casts such a sharp reflection on the Universal and Hammer films. FRIGHT NIGHT is filled with wonderful performances from the entire cast, beginning with William Ragsdale in a coy lead as the paranoid Charley Brewster. Roddy McDowall's campy portrait of Peter Vincent, vampire hunter, is a wonderful caricature of the characters played by both Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. The homage to DRACULA in which McDowall discovers that Jerry is truly a vampire is a shining moment in the film. Stephen Geoffreys is just as amusing as Charley's eccentric friend, \\"Evil\\" Ed Thompson, whose shrill, nasally voice and wicked sense of humor have made him a fan favorite for years. And then, of course, there is Chris Sarandon as the vampire Jerry Dandridge. Sarandon brings all of the same suave sophistication and courtly manner as his Gothic counterparts, yet he never feels out of place amidst the modern setting. The film's wit is only matched by its incredible special effects, which give a horrifying new look to its vampire hosts. With the help of NEAR DARK and THE LOST BOYS, FRIGHT NIGHT helped to reinvigorate the vampire film in the 1980's, and it has since endured to reach a cult status in Horror.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0053TWV46|4.0|George Romero and Stephen King return with three more terrifying tales to keep you up at night! Well... Sort of... Although they are based on more of King's short stories and adapted into a screenplay by Romero, this second collection is headed by George Romero collaborator Michael Gornick, director of photography for DAY OF THE DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and the original CREEPSHOW. Their work in the past unfortunately hasn't rubbed off well on Gornick, who turns out a routine shocker that would have been better suited for television. In the first story, three would-be thieves are stopped by a vengeful wooden Indian in \\"Old Chief Wood'nhead.\\" Four friends face off against a carnivorous oil slick when they board \\"The Raft.\\" Finally, a woman pays for deadly her hit-and-run accident when the corpse of \\"The Hitchhiker\\" returns to torment her! The first and third tales are, again, routine revenge stories with a splash of blood and a touch of the supernatural. Outside of character actor George Kennedy, the performances are rather goofy in \\"Old Chief Wood'nhead,\\" with moderate effects used to bring the Chief to life. \\"The Raft\\" tends to be the most memorable, a veritable BLOB on a budget that offers several surprising moments. \\"The Hitchhiker\\" is, by far, the most horrific of the three, mainly thanks to the gruesome costume designs by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. While it is nowhere near as witty and fun as the original, CREEPSHOW 2 is still a worthwhile sequel for genre fans.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0098VYCCE|3.0|In this dark re-telling of the classic fairy tale, Snow White escapes the grasps of the evil Queen Ravenna after her father's kingdom is thwarted, and it will be up to the young Princess who is pure of heart to amass the forces of good against her wicked stepmother. Or so it would seem... It is difficult to tell exactly what is going on throughout the threadbare plot in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN. Sure, it looks pretty, but the big-budget special effects cannot hide the fact that SNOW WHITE makes very few attempts at telling a compelling story. Kristen Stewart stars as our slack-jawed and angst-ridden heroine (if you can call her that). Snow White spends the majority of the film fleeing through the woods with the aid of The Hunstman (Chris Hemsworth), before suddenly and confusingly becoming the leader of a major rebellion against The Queen. The term 'contrived' receives a whole new meaning in the film's brisk 2-hour run time. Charlize Theron is given a few moments to shine as Ravenna, but if any praise is due at all, it must be given to the set designers, who have brilliantly dressed everything from the brooding castles to the enchanted forests. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN provides enough eye-candy to 'wow' most fantasy fans, but THE LORD OF THE RINGS this is not.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

6304712499|3.0|The devil Malebogia tricks a skilled assassin from Earth into becoming a general for his evil armies, a Hellspawn. Spawn is sent back to Earth with the task of collecting enough corrupt souls to wage a war on Heaven, but instead, he learns to masters his new powers in order to defeat the devil at his own game. This generation's hottest comic book hero leaps right off the page and on to the big screen in the 1997 film adaptation of SPAWN! Visual effects artist Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute; holds true to the dark characters and themes of the comics, while providing audiences with a concise retelling of Spawn's origin story that is relatively faithful to Todd McFarlane's ground-breaking series. Dipp&eacute; enlists the help of the industry's leading special effects teams to handle the film's ambitious action sequences, using KNB FX for the costuming, and Industrial Light & Magic for the computerized imagery used throughout the film. The results are very mixed. KNB's costume redesigns are bulky considering the character's sleek appearance in the comics, but Spawn's burnt face and necroplasmic shell hold up to the company's high reputation. The computerized vision of Hell and Spawn's trademarked cape, on the other hand, look cartoony at best and have aged poorly. With the comic at the height of its success, however, it was the opportune time to release the film, even if the technology needed to do so properly did not exist. Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, and Martin Sheen are forgiven for their ridiculous and over-the-top performances given the extreme nature of their characters. While it is certainly flawed, SPAWN is entertaining and action-packed, and holds an equal appeal to both fans of the comics and newcomers, alike.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000IZXR20|3.0|\\"You know the part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid, and everybody hates them for it? This is it.\\" Trish and Darry are stalked by a terrifying man-eating creature while on their way home for spring break in 2001's JEEPERS CREEPERS! Victor Salva directs from his own original screenplay, which is lazy, messy, and misguided from the very start. JEEPERS CREEPERS opens as a suspenseful thriller, before revealing that the killer creature is actually rooted in the supernatural. Whenever the action lulls or our interest in the characters begins to fade, Salva throws in some desperate new gimmick to try and gain back his lost momentum without ever actually attempting to improve upon the story itself. The creature goes from being an axe-wielding maniac to being a cannibalistic ghoul to then tranforming into a cannibalistic ghoul with wings and mandibles which serve no other purpose than to show off the flashy special effects. At one point, Salva writes himself into a corner when attempting to explain the creature's origin or why it only eats certain people and parts of the body, and hence \\"Jezelle the Psychic\\" is born out of convenience and necessity. If we are to believe that the creature can only replenish its limbs and vital organs by eating the flesh of its victims, just how is it supposed to grow back those wings, anyway? As annoying as they often can be, Justin Long and Gina Phillips are goofy enough to keep us entertained as the unfortunate brother and sister team, while Jonathan Breck adds a frightening new villain to the modern Slasher genre.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B005LAIGW8|2.0|The accursed Ghost Rider is hired by a secret sect of religious monks in the hopes of rescuing a young boy from the devil's grasp in exchange for his soul, a battle that will rage across Eastern Europe as The Rider takes on the forces of Hell atop his fiery motorcycle! CRANK directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylorn attempt to inject the same high-energy aesthetic in to the GHOST RIDER reboot, with disastrous results. SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE comes off looking like an unscripted mess, almost as if it were shot as an amateur music video for some no-name rock group. Nicolas Cage is as awful as ever. Why even bother rebooting the series only to bring back the single worst element from the original film? SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE takes a darker approach to the material that falls more closely in line with the comics, sacrificing the kid-friendly attitude from before in lieu of the increased action and horror. Ghost Rider has received a major overhaul as well, his charred skull and blistering costume being the only welcomed changes to the character. When standing before his enemies or blazing down the highway on his hellish motorcycle, he is an awesome sight to see. The remaining effects are uneven at best, and take a dive during the ugly transformation sequences. With a pointless excuse for a plot is hard to ignore, GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE offers little more than the occasional eye-candy.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0067QPVJ6|3.0|Paleontologist Kate Lloyd is asked to join a Norwegian expedition in the Antarctic after they uncover an ancient alien spacecraft deep beneath the ice, but when one of the shape-shifting creatures awakens from its icy tomb, she will be forced to determine friend from foe in a battle for survival atop the frozen continent. The 2011 prequel to John Carpenter's classic Science Fiction film THE THING is surprisingly well-made, and serves as a valid companion piece to the original film by filling in the events that preceded it. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and his team of set designers have taken great care in recreating the Norwegian base camp and following the frightful events just as they had been described in the previous film. The one major disadvantage that anyone would come to expect falls in the special effects department. Rob Bottin's ground-breaking make-up designs have terrified audiences since 1982, but the computerized monstrosities found here lose much of their effect despite their nasty appearances. Although THE THING presents several new twists on the plot points from before, the plagiarized ideas border quite closely to making this a direct remake. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and her supporting cast do maintain the proper amount of fear and paranoia to make this a successful sequel/prequel/remake, whatever it may be.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B001JIHGO0|2.0|The unfortunate success of Stephen Sommers' disastrous THE MUMMY RETURNS awarded him an unrestricted creative license to meddle with the remaining Universal Monsters in VAN HELSING. The legendary monster hunter embarks on his greatest adventure yet, as he tries to stop Dracula from using the Frankenstein Monster's seed to create an army of fledgling vampires that will soon take over the world! How Frankenstein's monster dong ever got involved in this story, the world may never know. Sommers continues to show a complete disdain for logic, reason, and reality, preferring instead to create the most over-the-top and ridiculous action sequences imaginable. Normal is never good enough for Mr. Sommers; every scene must be taken to the extreme, no matter how unnecessary the shot may be. There can be no suspense when impossible feats are being performed by unextraordinary heroes. VAN HELSING is not only a trial in excess, but also in bad acting. As if Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were not bad enough with their preposterous accents and overblown theatrics, Sommers brings on character actor Richard Roxburgh in one of the most flamboyant portrayals of Dracula that audiences have ever seen! For all of the millions of dollars that Universal invested in state-of-the-art motion capture technology, greenscreening, computerization, and compositing, the film looks like s***. It is unconvincing and instantly dated at best, cartoony at worst. The updated monsters fare no better, and pale in comparison to their former selves. None of this even addresses the brainless script that haphazardly ties everything together. VAN HELSING is nothing but an over-budgeted effects show laid out over poorly drawn characters and a harebrained plot.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Book I've ever read, I read this in a single afternoon. The love story is one that will make your heart flutter and keep you turning page after page...
0307463745|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, this book reads like 50 or so blog posts strung together in a book.<br /><br />While I don't have a problem necessarily with this approach, the end result is that the book really has no overall message.  It has a number of small tidbits of information for very specific aspects of business.  While most of the tidbits are useful (some are not though), this book is not as useful in my opinion as ones like '4 Steps to the Epiphany' by Steve Blank, or 'Business Model Generation' by Alex Osterwalder that present an overall strategy.<br /><br />I'll review some of the essays that I particularly liked or disagreed with...<br /><br />1) Learning from mistakes is overrated - Disagree. This is one of those very strongly opinionated essays that basically says, failing is for suckers, you won't get much out of it.<br /><br />The authors don't seem to get that there are different levels of failing.  You can fail because the overall business goes bankrupt after 1.5 years, and $30k of savings (huge failure, overall not worth it), or you can fail to reach market segments in your first iteration of a minimum viable product.  The latter is what I commonly think of when I consider Edison's quote, \\"I failed my way to success\\"...  Making a product or value proposition that doesn't work right away is a learning opportunity.  In the second sense, I would say embrace failure, be ok with making mistakes, learn from your mistakes, and iterate fast.<br /><br />2) Workaholism - also disagree.  I'm not saying that everyone should be a workaholic, but some of the most successful people work smart AND work hard.  In the early days, I think it's necessary to put in 16 hour days to build a successful business.<br /><br />3) Scratch your own itch - Agree, basically argues to start from a known problem that you, yourself, are experiencing and build a product or service to address it.  This is a good starting place, but should be followed up as soon as possible with engaging with early customers.<br /><br />4) Outside Money is Plan Z, You Need Less than you think - Agree 100%.  When you take money from someone else, no matter who, you are basically reporting to that person.  Obviously family and friends is different than professional or semi-professional investors, but if at all possible start with what you can personally afford.  There are serious trade-offs involved in taking outside money, and although people tend to flock to VCs, I think bootstrapping is the way to go.<br /><br />5) Making the call is making progress - Disagree, this essay argues not to waste too much time on making decisions.  You won't know that much more tomorrow than you'll know today, so make the call they argue.  I personally think this advice is toxic.  If you don't have the right information today, devise an experiment, interact with customers and GET the information needed to make the right decision.  If you have the information, but need more time to analyze the information, take your time.  Making decisions just for the sake of crossing them off a list is stupid and dangerous.<br /><br />6) Tone is in your fingers - Basically you don't need the best gear to start working (i.e. Jimi Hendrix doesn't need the best guitar to sound like a virtuoso).  Agree 100%, focus only on what you need, and not having the nicest computer or the best office, etc.<br /><br />7) Sell your by-products - An interesting story about how Henry Ford realized that wood chips from his car manufacturing process could be turned into charcoal.  He started a charcoal company that today is Kingsford Charcoal - largest charcoal company in the US.  I agree with this, look for so-called waste that can be packaged and sold as another product.  One of the better essays.<br /><br />8) Meetings are toxic - Disagree... Some of the best ideas come about when people collaborate in person.  Also for certain types of products (i.e. complex electro-mechanical stuff) it's necessary for the hardwareguy, software guy, and mechanical engineer to meet.  Meetings allow for the most complete kind of communication, and prevent other people in an organization to waste time working on the wrong thing, because an email message wasn't clear.  I see it every day.<br /><br />9) Out-teach your competition, Go behind the scenes - Basically, the authors argue that by having a blog, launching their book, and explaining to people how they made their product (Basecamp), they were able to start an interesting dialogue with their customers.<br /><br />This concept could be taken further.  Say you are a patent attorney... You could launch a website, where you explain in great detail how to lay out a background, specification, claims and go into some detail on each specific part with diagrams, and examples.  Would-be inventors would find your site, some would take you free material and never contact you, but many would read through it, understand that you truly have expertise in your domain and attempt to hire you to draft their patent.  Two great essays, and an interesting philosophy.<br /><br />10) Simplicity - There is no essay with the name 'simplicity' but a constant theme through the book is to keep things simple.  Keep your product simple but not bloating it with too many features.  Keep your work environment simple by not having unneeded work policies and bureaucracy.  Keep your planning simple by estimating at most only a couple weeks into the future.<br /><br />For the most part I agree with all of this.<br /><br />Overall I'd give the book 3.75 stars... I can't justify 4 stars, because some of the advice I genuinely disagree with and think would hurt people starting out, though most of it is good.  I particularly liked the advice regarding not to take outside money, the idea to make your by-products into full fledged products, and the idea to teach potential customers how to solve their problems on their own - thereby winning their respect and earning your recognition as an expert, in which case many would eventually come to you.<br /><br />Those three points in particular is not something I've seen in many other books.  The rest of the essays were ok, but I didn't find them particularly memorable.<br /><br />Also couldn't justify giving the book anything close to 5 stars, because all that is presented is a smattering of tactics.  No overall strategy for launching a business, which in my opinion is necessary before getting too far into the details.<br /><br />I'd recommended this book, but only after reading Steve Blank, Alex Osterwalder, and Eric Ries.

B009AJDDQU|1.0|I gave alot of thought to reviewing this film. I think the \\"Scientist Survival Pop Quiz\\" really said it all, but one of the things this movie has managed to do is spark alot of discussion & debate. It's still going on, so I thought I'd add my 2 cents...  The stunning visuals within this huge-budget piece will take your breath away. The sets & computer generated scenics/effects are pretty well unmatched in our time. That being said, it seems as if all that cool & beautiful stuff distracted the film makers from everything else. They ignored the fact that the characters were becoming more senseless & unlikeable as the film progressed. as was the script. In fact, it seemed at times as if they were making it up as they went along. For a movie to look so beautiful & have such annoying characters doing idiotic things throughout, is unforgivable...<br />  I watched the short documentary \\"Direct Effect\\" to try to gain some understanding of Ridley Scott's creative vision. Unfortunately, I found him to be just as ambiguous & contradictory as the plot of Prometheus. In fact, he seemed like he was a bit drunk...<br />  The only other good thing I can say about Prometheus is that it has a great trailer.  The film itself is a potential grand work of art... ruined by knuckleheads.

Although I wanted to embrace something new and exciting from a man who has had quite a ride, the book is woefully commercial and pandering (facts forgivingly denoted on other reviews).  I do not doubt the feelings and experiences are real, but am left with sort of the empty feeling I had when I first encountered the band in the shadow of Bowie back in the 1970s.  Most recently, Bowie grabs headlines for putting out a single and Taylor and the boys alternate between crass pop (rappers?) and trying to emulate 30-year-old glories.  Good if he can make a buck off the 40somethings that pine for their reckless youth, but beyond that, little of merit can be found in these pages.

Some sellers have even been honest about theirs and said there may be some slight scratches and wear and tear however I haven't seen any on mine and find nothing to complain about so far they all play just fine no skips no stopping no pixelation just fine playing.

White Boy Blues *<br /><br />Originally founded in 2011 by former Whitesnake members Micky Moody and Neil Murray, the Snakecharmer super-group includes the perfect mix of calibre musicians with Laurie Wisefield, Harry James, Adam Wakeman and Chris Ousey. With members gigging record breaking tours, earning double platinum selling albums and playing to crowds of 100,000.<br /><br />Snakecharmer's members have an unbeatable history through their work with Whitesnake, Wishbone Ash, Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Tina Turner, Gary Moore, Magnum, Thunder, Michael Schenker Group, Brian May Band, We Will Rock You and Heartland.<br /><br />The band is now releasing their first album at the beginning of 2013, self titled \\"Snakecharmer\\" and is looking forward to a worldwide tour in support of the album.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|all of the reviews that I saw said this game is awesome. but on my kindle it downloads so slow... so be aware kindle users. this might just be my kindle though.

1843794411|4.0|I only bought this so Richard Armitage could read me a bedtime story. In the end, I very much enjoyed the romance and I thought the characters were well-voiced. With the intricate dialogues in some scenes, RA's distinct and often humorous characterizations were very helpful. I didn't much like Horry; I prefer my heroines with a bit more art and a lot more intelligence.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|The biggest challenge on a lot of the levels is getting the timing right!  I loved the game but thought it would be too challenging for my 8 yr old.  She tried it last night and LOVED it too! Giggling just like I wss!  Thank you for making more levels!
0470638842|1.0|The arguments in this book are completely without merit and have the structural soundness of my middle school persuasive essays. This book is seriously biased and is so out there it's not even a worthwhile read just to hear another's opinion. For instance, he makes the claim that social media makes you more productive. Susie could read a magazine while waiting to check out at a store, or she could hop onto Facebook where she then proceeds to learn that her friend's daughter is having a birthday party (so she buys a gift card), her husband just used the last of the butter (so she buys some more), and her niece is graduating college (so she buys a card). Wow, she could've read a magazine but instead she learned all this really important information and saved SO MUCH TIME! Dear god. Unless you're looking for a book on how not to structure persuasive arguments, stay the hell away from this book.
0061900656|5.0|My son loves it, It helps him to prepaper for her new sister. Good quality and nice picture. I recomended...
B001NI24OI|5.0|I looked forward to watching each episode. The storyline keep me interested and I like the different characters. Will watch it again.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It wasn't in the box but Amazon was great and helped immediately. It was a new cable and worked just as it should. Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game works great with the kindle touch screen and the limited time specials available in the character shop make coin collecting a priority. Similar to temple run but in my opinion better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a nice game, but comparing it to other games I would enjoy more board designs and deck backs. But I like the classic play of the game very much.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I have watched episodes past season 1, then watched season 1 again. Good set up of characters, and good job pulling you in to the story-line. Even after watching a second time, I was glued to the computer/TV. Can't get enough of Walter. Noble portrays his character perfectly! Fringe season1 is better that X-Files season 1.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a lot of fun to play, but can be a challenge.  Works well an is a great way to pass time.
B007KQ6XYY|2.0|I have no idea when I bought this so be cREFUL IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME THOUGH i'm gonna check out my kindle later good lck
B0076DELIG|5.0|As fresh as the earlier BOSCH novels .  HARRY is still the damaged, brilliant cynic with the desire to serve justice and protect the underdog . As usual he cannot deal with his own emotional need with his daughter and woman friend in an open fashion.  The basic story was well conceived, was excellent in plot and contained several exciting scenes. I look forward to the next HARRY BOSCH novel and hope he doesn't retire soon
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book makes you realize that we are all here for a purpose and are lives are not over.  Very inspirational!

0765325950|5.0|From the series' beginning, Jordan's Wheel of Time has struggled to address the challenge of destiny versus individualism.  When Sanderson took the helm after Jordan's death, The Wheel became less fatalistic and more reactive - a change which comes vividly to the forefront in A Memory of Light.<br /><br />Beginning two books back with Aviendha's vision of the future and questions of whether it could be changed, the foreshadowing Final Battle moved from the mid-series conclusiveness to a much less determined ending.  Prophecies became vaguer in Sanderson's hands, and many became more interpretive than definitive.  Like Obi Wan's \\"from a certain point of view\\" dismissal of his verbal slight-of-hand in Star Wars, Sanderson ends the Wheel of Time series with conclusions to many storylines, but does so in a way that is sure to satisfy some readers and enrage others.<br /><br />Furthermore there has been much criticism of the scope and scale of AMOL, with its following of once-minor characters and ignoring other major ones.  Personally I liked it.  This purposeful prose gave a sense of the scale of The Final Battle, one in which we already knew certain characters would fight and their presence need not be expounded, but in which we also meet again many passing characters who once graced passing verses thousands of pages ago, here also to be found at the end of all things.  These minor character dalliances, though never long, provide the sense that the whole world is here.  That Rand, as a ta'veren, has drawn to this place and time each life he has touched.  They are all here for a purpose: every character big or small, loved or hated.  To not have included each would have been a loss to this satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />And so it ends.  The world at the end of A Memory of Light is a very different world from the one we started with in [[ASIN:B002U3CCYM The Eye of the World]].  We are left understanding the world and the people in it better, the powers and principles and players that shape it, and the humanity at the root of all history.  The characters we first met two decades ago, and the world and Age in which they lived is dead... from a certain point of view.  But it is not the end, just an ending.and players that shape it, and the humanity at the root of all history.

1612183956|5.0|I bought this book because it was on sale and it has had a ton of good reviews.  Well I'm happy to add to them.  I couldn't put my kindle down!  Every chapter adds to the story and the mystery, you'll find you'll fly through the book and start another one of Blake Crouch's books in no time!
1427210241|5.0|If you know the book series, you would know why it's a  GREAT ending to the story<br />I hope they never try to make a movie a this book series  they would never be able to do the series justice<br />Just Read it
B007SUW24W|5.0|Great lyrics, music, ambiance.  Hopefully I'll get to see Ed Sheeran when he tours with Taylor Swift on the Red Tour.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This was a must have in my collection. It is a interesting piece with a hidden chamber for the actual dvd, Great product.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book as really good considering thAt I am a freshman in high school!!<br />You should definitely get this book!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I went back and forth between eh, this book is boring and wow, it's really good. I liked Amy for a while, but didn't like Nick much at all until the very end. The ending was different than what you may expect, but it fits the characters and the stories well.
B008MEM24S|4.0|It's great for teaching my son fluid physics in a fun way. Great story and bonus levels. When it's been completed it can be reset.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|although I enjoy watching Game of thrones on TV, the book (as is usual) is so much more in depth. With charaters, and story line. could not put it down, and started book two immediately after finishing book one!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a well written book for young adult readers. It handles the difficult topic of adolescents dealing with terminal cancer realistically and honestly. The young characters are &#34;totally-teen&#34; in the way they interact with humor and sarcasm, roller coaster emotions and love as they handle the unique struggles and losses of their friends, their families -- and coming to terms with their own ticking-clock.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Just finished reading book two and immediatly started book three.  I love this series, and recommend them to everyone who enjoys a great story.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|This is probably one of the best reads this year...however, I was crushed to see cursing, worse yet, taking the Lord's name in vain.  With all the high level, rich vocabulary...why?  So, to all my Christian sisters and brothers, I can't give this book five stars, which it would have had, due to the &#34;one&#34; slip, but a HUGE slip of the vernacular.  Sigh!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|When I started this series I was impressed with the story line and how the author keeps the story fresh and fluid. I can't stop reading!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I purchased this movie for my 9 year old daughter to watch New Years Eve on the I-Pad.  I started watching it with her and was hooked in the first 5 minutes.  The previews on TV did not do this movie any Justice. Or maybe it got lost in the whole Tim Burton Franken Weenie fuss.  It is a sweet, funny, feel good movie a bit scary in some parts for younger kids.  Its about Norman a sweet but different kind of boy who is lost in his family and he see and speaks to his dead Grandma.  The movie teaches kids about being tolerant to all different kinds of people, it touches on being bullied by scared kids who have no tolerance for kids who are not &#34;normal&#34;.  it was one of those surprise I love this movie and I loved that it was just as entertaining for me as it was for my daughter to watch.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|As I have been reading through this series I am happy to say it keeps getting better and better.  It keeps me reading all the time to find out what will happen next!
0897502027|5.0|The book was in excellent shape no writing, no pages missing or anything like that....just a high quality book. Shipping was little long but I can overlook that.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Just like the first four books before this one, the story just keeps getting better.  I am hoping to see a book six in the future, still a lot of unanswered questions!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|When I saw this in the app store I thought it would be a simple way to pass some time while waiting for appointments. Once you get past the first few levels it can be pretty challenging.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I keep the the app on the top shelf so it's quick and easy to activate.<br /><br />This app is without equal among the battery monitors that I've tried.<br /><br />KUDOS to the developers for a well made tool.<br /><br />'NUFF SAID
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so addicting. A coin multiplier would be AWESOME to have as a feature on this game. Love this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a ridiculously fun source of entertainment. It has a good concept and the influx of constant new limited items makes it interchangeable.

B00190OHD6|5.0|This show runs the gamut...it made me laugh, then I cried, then I got angry, then started all over again.  My ex-husband recommended it, then sat and watched it with me till the end, even though he'd seen it before.

B0020BUWX2|4.0|Thought provoking and an easy read.  Enjoyed getting to know the characters through her previous memories and how it unfolded.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am so glad I read the book!  All the movies I see after I have read the book never live up to my imagination or the writer's talent.  I really enjoyed reading all three in this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Iove this game. I believe I'm addicted to playing everyday. I'm getting better each time that I play. I will recommend this game to anyone, your age does not matter!

B0083P1QUM|4.0|I didn't like the way Kay was portrayed in this book. Lucy was Lucy and Marino was the same.  Still a good story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so so fun if you like to play games that require you to concentrate. It goes slow in the beginning but then gets really fast!!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I thought this movie didn't miss a beat from the previous Men in Black movies.  Josh Brolin nailed his impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones and the chemistry between Jones and Will Smith as well as Smith and Brolin was great.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderful!  One of the best I read in months.  The words and thoughts were so honest.  One of the greatest perks of being a human is our ability and capacity for friendship and the fact  that we could hold to it dearly.
B008B92U32|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. My first try had my whole family laughing. If you have pictures of two or more people it is very easy to swap the faces. You need to adjust the face sizes for the best fit which is very easy. Get this and you will have lots of fun!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|nice and effective.  I really like the white noise. The choice of alarms is helpful too. thank you for a great app.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I really enjoy Boardwalk Empire. I really had not heard about it anywhere and I do not have HBO. I honestly cannot recall how I stumbled upon it, but I was happy to find it in amazon's online library so that I could purchase instantly. The show is filled with great depth of characters and scenes of prohibition era underground mixed with mainstream politics. Great entertainment.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I got one for each of my brothers.  My older brothers wife said they watched it and it was a great movie and several tissues were used because it was so sad.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Best movie I've ever seen? No. A couple hours of entertainment for my 4 yr old and myslef? Yes. I would recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very easy to use solitaire game. Plus you get options to change the background with any image you want.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is awesome it really does keep you entertained and gets you mind off o things.I love all of the different levels I really recommend this game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The characters are so flawed and twisted, it is kind of like watching a terrible crime scene.  Still, You cannot stop reading.  The twists are well written, and the ending is great - you really hate them all by the end, which is how it should be.
0765350386|5.0|I just finished reading Mistborn, and I can tell you that I'll definitely be reading the other books in the series. What a book!<br /><br />I had never heard of it before I noticed the cover in a local bookshop. I was just browsing, picked it up, read the blurb on the back and decided to give it a shot, despite being disappointed in quite a few of the fantasy books I've read (or tried to read) recently.<br /><br />For a while, it languished on the 'to read' pile, but once I actually got down to opening it, I couldn't put the damned thing down.<br /><br />Sanderson's prose is clean and smooth, blessedly free from too much heavy description and obscure vocabulary. He strikes the perfect balance, giving you enough to see his world in your mind's eye and yet keep the pace moving forward at a blistering rate. The action is excellent, as is the world-building. It's easy to suspend your disbelief and accept Allomancy. It's such a credible magic system.<br /><br />Unlike another reviewer, I found the dialogue snappy and enjoyable, and I came to care about a good number of the characters.<br /><br />It's not as predictable as a lot of other fantasy either. There are enough compelling mysteries to keep you reading right up to the end. And the ending isn't rushed. It's exactly as long as it should be.<br /><br />I can't think of a single reason to downgrade this book to four-stars, so it's getting the full five from me. I only wish someone had recommended it to me so I could have gotten into it sooner.
B000JIHP88|5.0|It has lights, movement and sound, all of which I was looking for in a mobile. The light is only on the base. The music goes for a long time, which I like. And my son likes watching the animals go in circles and the leaves flap. Mounted easily to two different cribs, although only to one side of my first son's crib. If you have a thick decorative ledge, you may have some issues.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|After releasing the Mickey Haller series I came back to the beginning. It has not disappointed. I only wish I would have started here first
B004UFEJVW|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. It has a unique and heartwarming story as well as a big adventure and great scenery.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|Do not get this. IAnd yhis form sucks too. yhought it would help delete cloud apps. Instead it filledmy cloud  MORE. SCHEISTERS.

B0065GC0BA|4.0|I didn't know if I wanted to give this one star or five stars. This book took my heart, tore it to pieces and then handed it back to me on a little plate. A very emotional ride.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|A change from Oscar Wilde witha  touch of the fantasy and the pursuit of eternal youth. The character lack depth in description,but one always has the immagination. There is a homosexual relationship if one sees it and probably the reason for eternal beauty for strong relationships.Romatically macarbe!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Although disturbing, this book really delivered. Another story that touches all your senses and really makes you feel deeply about the characters involved. Well worth a read!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Just what I would expect of Tom Clancy.  His books are always spellbinding and keep you going until the end.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|i love this dvd when it was on starz. i love the actors and actress, part of history with some twist and turns......plus i love the price even better....39.95 the whole complete series...WOW!!!!!! Thank you jesus christ and thank you amazon your are amazing.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I really like this app! It does everything an alarm clock should do! It works great.. I've never had any trouble out of it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Everything is ramped up in this sequel!!! Love everything from the graphics, to the new challenges and missions thisis an excellent game!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW I don't know how to put it In words. I loved it so much. You have to read this book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir's book about a NASA Mars mission member is a cross between The Swiss Family Robinson and The Perils of Pauline, but updated to the 21st century and set on Mars (but also in Houston and in various -- some surprising -- other places).<br /><br />When Mark Watney, botanist-and-engineer-turned-astronaut, is believed dead and abandoned on Mars in an aborted mission, he must figure out how to stay alive, regain contact with Earth and work with NASA on getting himself rescued. How he does so -- told to us in a combination of narrative, diary and e-mail form -- makes for an exciting read. While it is obvious that there will be a happy ending, many of the plot wrinkles along the way are quite unexpected.<br /><br />I finished the book at 3 a.m., woke up at 7 and started it again over coffee. It was that good. Nonetheless, I debated cutting the rating to four stars because of the inexcusable quantity of typos, dropped words, extra words and other such annoyances. (I've been a translator and editor for more years than many Amazon readers have been alive.) In the end, however, I decided it was worth five stars. But please, Amazon! Get yourselves a copy editor!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely worth reading but very disturbing at the same time!  A great read for book clubs.  Not sure how comfortably I'll sleep tonight.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I got this app for my mom cause shes has been trying to lose weight and I think this app will br a good app tot her to get her motivated
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great blessing. Just now getting started with it, but great so far. I hope to use this app on a regular daily basis.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I like this game, quite a lot. Though minor, it lacks a feature that I seem to remember in an other Freecell game. That game had a unique number assigned to each deal.  You could then work and record your way through the deals. DON'T, however, view this as a significant issue. My memory is suspect AND this is a well-made game.<br /><br />PROS Clean Look, Easy Interface, Fun Game<br /><br />CONS A Bit Large(15 Mb)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addictive can't stop playing I've got of my friends caught up on this game, excellent graphics heart pounding there's no other to compare not even T_m_le  _un 2 keep up the good work. Ps. still playing.
1451695195|3.0|Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander is the latest in a long list of books about near death experiences (NDE). What's different about this one is that it was written by a skeptical neurosurgeon about his out of body experience while being in a meningitis induced coma for a week.<br />Doctor Alexander, the son of a surgeon, was on the faculty of Harvard Medical School when a spinal infection sent him first to the emergency room and then to the universe. His book has two parts: what happened to his family alternates with what was happening to his soul during the coma.<br />Alexander claims he heard strange sounds and then he went through an opening into a completely new world of physical beauty where a girl guided him and told him three things: \\"You are loved...\\", You have nothing to fear\\" and There is nothing you can do wrong.\\"  Afterwards he identifies the guide as a sister he never knew existed.<br />His NDE is told in vivid detail of lights, color and sounds. Completely free of his bodily identity, he claims that he traveled deeper than any person with a NDE before and gained a new sense of consciousness of the nature a scope of the universe. He compares it to a chimpanzee being a human for a day!<br />Proof of Heaven, A Neurosurgeon's Journey Into the Afterlife was written because the author found difficulty trying to explain his NDE to others, especially fellow surgeons, because he described it in quantum physics terms. He concludes that consciousness is the great and central mystery of the
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|As a fan of all her Outlander series, I enjoyed this one very much.  I found I learned a lot about American history, too, from the lives of ordinary people just trying to survive.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This has it all,humour,pathos ,action and some terrific acting.This surpasses my other favourite series,including Six feet under,Justified and even the Sopranos.
B000001EPB|5.0|I can't believe I never thought to buy this before now. It's so fabulous. Makes me happy and wanna dance every time I listen to it!!
B001CEE1YE|4.0|i love the matrix movies but these blu-ray discs are a little strange. the quality is great but there is not title menu or extra content you expect in a blu-ray.
0446560073|5.0|My kids love Simon's Cat. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she has read it over and over!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|i have always been a star wars fan so having all the movies on blu ray is awesome. plus the extra 46 hours of content satisfied my inner nerd.
0525457585|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK! Inspirational, beautiful and soul stirring. Better than the movie.  I cried though parts of it. Great read aloud with your kids. This edition is gorgeous. The real world chapters are printed in red ink. The Fantasia chapters in green. Highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual, this author has created another wonderful book. I could hardly put it down. Sometimes I got so caught up in the story that I felt like I was there and knew the characters personally. Great book.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|This album embodies all the light and inspirational singularity that makes Annie Lennox such a treasure. The arrangements to old favorite carols and hymns are fresh, heart warming, beautiful and emotional. Highly recommended.
1616550414|5.0|This product is great for the coffee table of any serious Zelda fan. While it's very heavy on the Skyward Sword, the entirety of the package is great. I look forward to reading and flipping through this one for years to come.
0553212419|5.0|I am very happy to have this on my shelf. It's a tremendous find and picking it up to read a case or two has been very delightful. Doyle's characters have a life all their own that you're sure are going on without you when you're not reading. ;-)
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric Burdon's new album is awesome.  Great Bluesy Rock and Roll.  He sounds great  The songs are wonderful and he really mixes it up!  Get it !
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Got this for my husband and he loves it. These discs have a comprehensive collection of tunes on them from the most popular to some of the more obscure *were the BEEGEES ever obscure?* . We love it!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|you are home now so you do not need to werry now.take care and be good love you more.iloveyou,love,love i
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This movie is fabulous. Much better than I expected. For story telling/emotional punch, it just might beat out Polar Express. The voice talent is incredibly funny and well played.
B00000K3D4|5.0|My children would watch this movie over and over again.  We consider it to be a classic.  Great entertainment for kids and kids at heart.  My only regret is not ordering it in blue ray.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Who doesn't love the Harry Potter theme? John Williams does it again!!! My kids will listen to this on repeat for HOURS.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I think this is so cool! I highly recommend this app. There are many different noises on White Noise, try them all, I did.
0890090572|5.0|This edition is fabulous, a great complimentary book to have with any of your other Doyle as it includes tales not featured in other books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a fantastic app!!! It's so adventurous and a very kid friendly game!!! All the players u earn are so cool, they do awesome tricks too!!! :)
031606792X|5.0|This was the culmination of a great investment of time and heart. Probably the best in the series, I would consider it Stephenie's masterpiece.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an absolute must have. I rate this game a five. It has trains that you have to jump over with the super shoes. Or you can go around them.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|That was a really good book it was amazon and better than all of the others combined in a sac of nut s had had that
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this, Ive wanted to read the last book for a while, definietly did not turn out the way I thought it would though, Catching Fire is by far my favorite Hunger Games book though!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game ever I think it's even better than the first one. I love it. I play it all the time all I can say is &quot;GET THIS GAME&quot; you  Will not regret it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is has a lot of action and great graphics.  It is easy to learn, but hard to master.
B002DQFHKM|5.0|I first saw the show in the theater back when I just was out of High School. It was great! The songs were even greater!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was fast-paced, exciting, page-turning, realistic hard sci-fi.  A book like this is very rare these days, when everybody is writing about the undead, zombies and vampires.  I really look forward to this author's next book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and all but it needs 0.6.0 all of my friends have the ipod and they have the update but i cant play with them because they have iupdated and i dont. Please update it I feel left out!!!!!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I like the app.  I currently use it on my Xoom.  The only issue that I have with the app is that I want to change the default document location to an SD card, however it wont let me.  It may be user error.  Still very handy app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed the viewing. Quaility was good. Of course, all was enhanced by the fantastic acting and landscapes ... and of course, the Abbey it's self.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|This is fun but you must be quick to keep up.  Have fun playing this game. My 6 year old is better at the game than I
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I was drawn into the life of this book and I had trouble putting it down! Good read and it followed nicely with the series.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|We do enjoy her music so when Amazon had a great deal on the CD (digital download) I jumped at the purchase.  Amazon is the greatest.
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and never get tired. The best part is it's a true story. The overall acting is fabulous too. I think everyone should see this movie even if you aren't a football fan. very inspirational.
B006LSZECO|2.0|reviews I found I just didn't like this book especially the ending, the two main characters just too disfunctiional, bizarre.
B004W48QFG|5.0|Most user friendly. No installing anything to your pc. Easy to use. Problem free! I would highly recommend this app.
0525952926|1.0|I LOVED his books. They are giant. Well written and I cherished every word. Then he wrote, \\"Winter of the World\\". It's not anything like the writing in his earlier books. Ghost writer? I pre-ordered this book and everything!! It remains on the table...not sure I can even finish it. So sad!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It's difficult to find a tv show that I'll actually go outside of netflix to watch, but this is it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I've read. I couldn't even begin to describe it without giving everything away. That's how extremely passionate I am about it. Even if you're not into romance, I would still recommend you read this because there's so much more to it than your typical love story. That's probably because it's not typical at all. Beautifully written and had me gaping at every chapter.<br />This book deserves to be read and deserved to be a best-selling.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This Kindle edition is well formatted and free - what more could you want? Anne Elliot is my favorite JA heroine; she has the most sense and stoicism of any of them. How odd to consider that 27 was thought to be over the hill....
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I meek it is pretty fun but I just didn't really like it. it is fun for like 25seconds nut then it gets boring. if I were you I would not waste your time with this game.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Mostly my hubby plays this and I am entertained watching him try to attain the different levels...no wonder the kids love this game
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love that you can now buy movies in all 3 formats ( Blue Ray, DVD and Digital Copy) Great idea.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!! It is really fun and its for free!! I would definitely get this game it is a really fun version of  temple run!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I've never played a puzzle game like this one. I'm pleasingly surprised. Down loaded a lot of crap, but I'm thrilled to discover how fun this game is. Thank you for creating a game that FINALLY lives up to it's hype. Fun, fun, fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If I could I would read it over and over until I went crazy. This is a book that I would love to invest in when I get the money. Loved this!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|finally I love this game (1&amp;2)I thought they would never have it :( . it looks like I'm running on the great wall of China.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Hard to put down very addicting :) game to play when your traveling or on a day when the weather is to bad to go outside
0316069434|4.0|This novel definitely made up for the awful failure that was \\"The Drop\\".  The investigation was very interesting and I really liked the relationship he's developing with his daughter.  The new chief is a great ahole, but I liked Irving better.<br /><br />I don't care for the girlfriend.  She really doesn't complement Bosch's personality like Wish did.  Connelly needs to write Rachel Walling back into Bosch's life.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It's pretty easy. It's very cool of a app and I would pay more than what I paid for and that's how good that is.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|most of there expansions packs are around 2-6 dollers OUTRAGOUS the game is .99! needs to be cheeper for 5 stars
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have this game for my kindle fire and it is just amazing!!!!! It is a little more challenging than the first one but is better that way. GET THIS FRIKEN GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the book! What ever happens to Gale? I see another book!!!!!!:) the thing I didn't like is the fact that she didn't talk about the real wedding..
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing story. Truly enjoyed the characters and the way the author described them in such a way you felt like you knew them personally. Loved the ending, didn't see that coming!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft but i cant get the update right away like apple users can it takes it a little longer than apple but all-in all it is a fun game and very creative
B00B2V66VS|4.0|There's a lack of explanation on how powering up boosts works and the game can close unexpectedly when using the &quot;save me&quot; feature, which really sucks. Other than that it's a great successor to temple run and is everything I would expect.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love all the bones movies, I have up to season 7 of course, but each season gets better and better. I don't want to see the series stop
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I already love twilight and it was cool with all the extra stuff! I wish i would have got the three disc cause I know they at least have that is Twilight one but its still really good!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Good game when you just have a few minutes and want aomething to do. Otherwise can get really boring after awhile. Match elements to make new elements.
0984999302|5.0|This is a really good book. One of the top ten books that all entrepreneurs should read and use. Highly recommended!
B008VBYN80|5.0|I recommend this game to anyone who likes to build cities and armies to demolish your enemies. It is very fun. I play every day for hours! The best part is it's FREE!!! You can play with friends, you just need to create an account (It's free too). Build markets to trade with friends and much more!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome but not as good as subway surfer. It is 2nd best game ever. It is awesome. If you like temple run 1 you love temple run 2.
039480497X|5.0|Bought this book for my nephew. I loved it as a child thought he would too. Nice and neat book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game .i love to learn how to play with my own horse .this is a good thing to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Kindle updates slower than Apple but it is still one of the best apps ever especially with two new updates adding armor and the nether reactor.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Nathan is still the sexiest man on tv - perhaps the sexiest man anywhere! But kudos to Stana for serving as his near-perfect foil.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has everything I like I love how u can update it and it be a different city this game is a great game!!!!!! ;)<br />I recommend this game to everybody!!!!;):)
6305128952|5.0|An old movie that is worth revisiting. An excellent drama. I was surprised to note that Scarlett Johansson plays the little girl. She is much prettier as an adult.
0689835604|5.0|This is a very cute little book.  Fun to read to baby, fun for baby to copy the baby in the book & find parts of her body.  Good to teach baby about her body parts.  Lots of fun to read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice little game with graphics that are probably the best and most realistic I've seen for a horse sim. The horses are, for the most part, anatomically correct with identifiable large muscle groups and movement. Even during photo sessions your patience will be rewarded with a buck or a rear, similar to what excited horses do in real life.<br />Gameplay itself, while occasionally monotonous, is pretty enjoyable. Like I said in the title --- it's a good time waster, though it could do with a few more activities other than basic horse care and jumping events. At this time it's similar to a horsey-themed Farmville.<br /><br />Only con that I really see is the gem system, which requires real money or can be obtained through leveling up and daily challenges. Though you can get by on using the default horses and gold, eventually it becomes impossible to accomplish some of the challenges without spending those elusive gems or devoting 24 hours to clean horse poo for a measly reward of a single gem.<br />Also on Kindle Fires it has a start-up loading issue, where it can take forever to get to the game or it simply won't load at all. Though this might be fixed in future updates.<br /><br />All in all, good free game. While gameplay is like every other horse game out there, it has good enough graphics to warrent at least a trial download.
B004QBL4R2|5.0|Enjoyed Jeff Beck's and  Darrel Higham's great guitar work.  The band and Imelda May brought new life to Les Paul and Mary Ford's music.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|So clever and funny. Full of action. Ritchie, Downey and Law do not dissapoint.<br />So glad its mine to watch whenever I want.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely in love with this book! Beautifully written. A bit predictable but nevertheless WORTH the read in every possible way!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted to this game!I love it so much. Good game to purchase!can't get nothing done for playing this game.
B000FC130E|2.0|Neverwhere, like most of Gaiman's fiction, to my mind, seems very scattered. I always enjoy the worlds he creates, but the actual denoument leaves much to be desired. No matter how much his work matures, he always reads like a young Stephen King to me -- great ideas, but the endings are so godawful as to ruin the entire book.<br /><br />Neverwhere has a crappy BBC made-for-tv movie version. It's only slightly worse than the book, and it will save you a slog through the original text.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|fairly slow play. would b nice to have more free or low cost options. good realistic detail and fun to play if you r a horse lover
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was the best thing to happen to me.<br />My husband read and has brought a new life to our marriage after 18 years.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every bit of this thrilling love story -- quite a page turner!  Anyone who enjoys an exciting novel will love this read.
0307352145|2.0|I wanted it to be more useful for everyday living.  Too mush of this book was based on research and that was not what I was interested in.  Elaine Aron writes much better books on this subject.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway subway surfers is a really good game for everyone so try it out you will see how much fun it is
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Decided to purchase because I loved the beginning and wanted to finish.  I'm glad I did! I enjoyed the storyline as well as trying to figure out what to do next. I recommend this game.
B003L45JLW|1.0|Nothing against Amazon, or the seller (Rasputin_Music_DVD) but this packaging shouldn't exist.  I brought this on Blu-ray because the CD came in one of those stupid cardboard envelopes.  Who would have thought that a $35 Blu-Ray would also come in a stupid cardboard envelope.<br />This is disgraceful, and Amazon needs to start clearly stating the packaging method which has been used by the record company.<br />No wonder people aren't buying physical music anymore if this is the contempt we are shown by companies.  We might as well download, by the cheapest method possible, as the packaging is no worse!<br />The music is OK (3 stars) but, with respect, Tom Petty needs to put his foot down!
0765325950|5.0|and it didn't disappoint. I have been waiting on these books for years--very glad sanderson took over after Jordan's death. A
B009GEFXLC|4.0|They just keep getting better.  Castle and Becket are keeping the sexual tension going.  Good going to the writers and actors.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I really wish it didn't force me to rate it, but still its a great app.  Nice alternative to my ambient noise machine that just broke.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I literally could not put this book down or stop reading. It's a love story full of mystery, suspense and trust
B005OHSD3A|4.0|This has a lot of the same info but a little bit more than the old books.  So if you haven't read the old ones this will be helpful but not so much for us old readers. Still good info to keep reading over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game can't get enough all day surfing, need to get pass my friends on Facebook just need to pass my cousin
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I got this book after I saw the Jack Reacher movie.  The main character is a great creation and simple to understand.  The progress of the book is easy to follow and you can see where the story will end up, but it's an enjoyable ride there.  The best past though is reading through Jack Reacher's deductions of a situation.  Very nice and detailed.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Dan Pink explores how we are all in sales in one way or another.  Some have the job title, but everyone spends significant time at work and at home in their efforts to influence other's opinions, attitudes and actions.  In this book Dan anayazes not only those facts but also many of the honorable and ethical methods that we all use when influencing others.  He gives practical advice on how to improve your effectiveness with an understanding of human nature.  This is a well researched and well written book you can put to use immediately in your life and business.  I bought 50 copies gave them to everyone in my organization!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great book!. I could not put this one down! I highly recomend this book....tweens and adults will enjoy as well.
B00B0NF4L6|5.0|Gritty, high energy pop punk. An american version of Arctic Monkey's Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. When I'm sitting at my desk, working my life away, I put this on and remember the carefree skateboarding days of my youth.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This the best game in the world I admire this game this is my favorite game in all the world
1616550414|5.0|I highly recommend this for any fans of the Legend of Zelda series.  The cover and the pages are both of very high quality and contain lots of concept artwork and background information on the games and their mythology.  I'm only about 20 pages in (out of about 260), and this has been well worth the wait (I preordered it back in November 2012).<br /><br />The book also includes the official chronology of the series to help put some of the debates to rest.  This is a great addition to any Zelda fan's collection!  You will not be disappointed.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow! Captivating read, strongly recommended. Story is engaging, it's an enjoyable and interesting read. Makes me wish I was an engineer and botanist.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|Love listening to this in the car.  Such versatile music. Truly a classic.  One of the best bands ever.  Totally recommend it to anyone who dreaded 90's music.  Nirvana, Pearl Jam, REM, and Smashing P's!  Great stuff.
B0055S348W|3.0|This is certainly better than not being able to print from my tablet at all, but is frustrating to use when printing from the web.  Once you find what you want to print on a web page, you have to copy the web address over to PrinterShare and then print.  Some web pages don't seem to replicate properly and so I have to copy what I want from the web page, paste it into Word, then print the word document.  Bit of a pain.  I would love to find something that works better.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Excellent read! It's definitely a page turner. I look forward to reading Walking Disaster when it comes out this Spring.
B0007LGCB8|5.0|Most comfortable, protective, &#34;healthy&#34; pair of sandals I've ever used. Had a pair that lasted six years of rough use before purchasing this replacement pair.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is awesome but there are still some glitches . Its addictive!!!!!!!  these people need to make sure that these games don't freeze up on our devices!
B008S8PPPG|5.0|I had never heard of this singer before read a review about her in a magazine and thought I would roll the dice and give her a chance.  Absolutely no regrets.
