B0000CG3K6|4.0|Reviews I've read this is one of the favorites from Muse.  I'll have to agree as I enjoyed this compilation
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love her books. I like how it ended. Happily ever after suits me just fine! Yay Sookie! Finally got it right
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great story line and presented with a great balance of suspense and prose.  Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read this book and I feel like this is the best of the series. The author did a great job and I can't wait for the movie
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|When watching this movie, keep in mind that 1) This movie is a a Kickoff to a series and as such is not meant to stand alone. 2) This series (at first) is meant for children and contains some simple child-humor but decreases in amount as &#34;The Clone Wars&#34; series progresses, it matures greatly and the stories grow immensely in depth. 3) The type of animation used for the series was not yet perfected when this movie was made (it was for the series) and at times the detail for the trained eye is lacking slightly, however this is not to say it is overly noticeable. This movie was very good for what it was set out to do. If you or your young geekling are going to watch the Clone Wars series than I recommend watching this movie. It is constant action and keeps your interest with no problem. DEFIANTLY WORTH GETTING for any Fanboy!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|what can i say, ign rates this as one of the best vita games. I thought it would be dumb but I bought a vita and love RPG's so I figured why not. First time I turned it on I only played maybe an hour.<br /><br />Second time I played for 6+....the story starts off very slow but it gets going after a little bit. even at 15 hours I feel like I am hardly into the game
B00CW665VI|5.0|Wow! So funny and witty! And such a great story with a no nonsense heroine! It's so refreshing to have a heroine most woman can relate to. Most of them are 18, virginal, meek ,etc. Kate is a tough businesswoman who doesn't take s*** from anyone.    Plus the story was all told from the funny hero's POV. And at times it was hysterical.    So good I truly can not wait for more from this author.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|it is fun but challenging at the same time. it also give you mind a work out thinking of how you can make yourself not flip. the game also has plenty of vehicles to choose from
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Great game. I bought the movie and it came with a code for the human spider outfit. The code is N58nuLUs or N58n uLUs and if it is not right then buy the movie and find out. Overall a great game and you should buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am sooo hooked I need to read more!!!! ...very descriptive...i can really imagine very single scenario ..would definetly recommend ir ...
B007V2UGPE|1.0|Cant get pass the whole game without glu credits and a rip off this game sucks wth glu then you cant attack without a zombie coming to you
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Based on the ratings I assumed it would be a good movie but it was a complete waste of time.  The story was disconnected, the central theme of the movie was ridiculous.  Just glad I didn't pay for it given it was free on Prime.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a very intense and gripping read.  It made you want to pick it up and keep reading right to the end! You didn't know how it would finish and kept you guessing. Would it have a \\"happy\\" ending?
B0017U7PT6|4.0|The service was great im completely satified with my purchase. The movie is what I wanted and it was delivered in great time and was in the condition as discribed.
B00B6QXN56|3.0|As far as technique goes you probably aren't going to hear a better guitar player. But there is no soul here. In a few years when the Muse figures Bonamassa has paid his dues there won't be anybody that can touch him.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|This is a very clear and concise description of how technological progress has reshaped the global economic landscape.  The authors make several salient and interesting observations about the effect of digitization on the employment. Their perspective is well thought out and is a valuable read for all people involved in innovation -- creators and enablers.<br /><br />The only point that I would add to this work is the causal relationship between energy and technology. As technology continues to undergo these doublings, more and more energy will be consumed to power this 24/7 network. While the relationship could be sublinear, the increase in power consumption may prove impossible to satiate, even with fossil fuels. Energy availability may eventually limit the exponential growth mechanism.
B008C20TDG|4.0|This book has a very disciplined approach that aims to change the way you think about food. It also makes the very good point that while it is uncomfortable and inconvenient to stick to the plan, at the end of the day, it is just not &#34;hard&#34; compared to a real life trial.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i like this game it is a good filler for just a little bit of time while i wait for the water to boil...
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Nothing special about this movie, but if you are looking for a brain dumb style of movie, this will fit the bill. Too similiar to his Mission Impossible movies.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've been working to apply &#34;The Goal&#34; theories of constraints to my IT career for years.  This book has same excellent mini-novel approach that the &#34;The &#34;Goal&#34; uses and it's story it right on target with what I've lived in the IT world since I starting in 1989.  I've seen several organizations successfully implement some of the solutions presented here with the same positive successes told in the story. While this book doesn't give you a &#34;30 days to guaranteed business nirvana&#34; sensational recipe, it does provide a way for a dedicated team to transform their  company IT, and therefore the entire business, from and organization of headaches and delays into one of rewarding challenges implementing fast and timely customer oriented deployments
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I learnt all about planetary science and that it's Ok to swear when your marooned on a desert planet.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B008602KQI|4.0|it was alright. the quality was  good as well as the graphics, but they strayed from the book. and yes I know they can't include everything, but some stuff was just too wrong. like how she got the mockingjay pin.

1451668945|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark always captivates from the first page on! This book is no exception. A definite page turner! A great book to add to your collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season of surprises and Walking Dead &#34;stuff&#34;! Looking forward to the fourth season and what new mischief Rick and the kids can get into as they &#34;cycle through Georgia&#34;. Gee, I spent many years down there and never once saw so many carnivores!
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I got this album because it was Clapton AND Stevie Winwood at Madison Square Garden, a concert I couldn't afford tickets for. So this is the next best thing. These men haven't missed a beat from 45 years ago.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Aside from the fact that the movie's graphics are superb, the story within the story (or was it an enveloping story), underscores how the human brain interprets the close environment and applies the necessary components to make the story about the environment palatable. A great deal of research (see Michael Gazzaniga's works), has gone into the ability to understand why the brain sees such illusory components in order to make sense of the real world. This story speaks volumes about the resilience of our brain. Thank you evolution.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I enjoyed playing minecraft pocket edition and recommend this game to every body thanks for the awesome game mojan np
B001DM1VXE|2.0|Gritty but only really partially clear if you have ever lived in Brooklyn, near a Jewish community or actually had a close neighbor who harbored such illusions! Clearly a art house film.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Enjoying it so far. I like the fact that you still make money even if you are not playing at the time
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have always loved Kathy's books & am just amazed at this intelligent,sensual, author who lets us into her life! God Bless,Kathy!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This was a fun film and then to see all these well known actors pulling this one off, was a real surprise.<br /><br />I'm not into the &#34;Hollywood ideals&#34;, but over all, this film was fun to watch, had surprises through out and I was extremely impressed with the music presentations.<br /><br />I have to say, Tom Cruise really surprised me with his singing.  I never expected it from him, but he is really good singing rock and roll.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's latest book is marvelous.  After reading his two earlier novels, I've been anxiously awaiting his latest AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED. I was not one bit disappointed.  His ability to develop his characters is amazing and there are certainly many of them in this novel.  It was a book that only took me a few days to read as I made extra time to sit down and absorb the novel because I was enjoying it so much.  Hat's off to Khaled and many thanks for the hours of reading enjoyment you have provided.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|This was a good movie.  Not exactly what I expected, but it was still worth watching.<br /><br />Just as a warning to some with delicate stomachs, there are some things in here that I didn't expect to see and they were graphic, so just keep that in mind.  It's still a good film, but even I was caught off guard with some of the graphic detail in the shooting scenes.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Good examples for everyone! It has a lot of examples of how to use the RBpi's programs. The configuration, the hardware and a little history too!
B00866JL96|5.0|Some may not care for it as it seems to be a little slow with the story line, but once you get to the end, you will be glad you saw it.<br /><br />It is beautifully done and I was really surprised by the performace of Zac Efron.  I knew a little of him from the television series he was on, through commercials, but in this film, he really surprised me with his performance.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Family movie with values. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would look at it again. Would recommend it to someone. Got it for my mother
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The filming was very well done and the story line filled in the blanks of a lot of questions from the previous films, but there are some things in this film that were very disturbing to discover, with all the tragedy's that happened.<br /><br />In this film, relating to the shootings of Aurora, Colorado and then Sandy Hook, it is just too close to ignore.<br /><br />While the film was panning the city sky line at night, on one building, in big red bold lettering, it says &#34;Aurora&#34;, that was the first thing that bothered me.  Then, when the map of the city was being shown with the targets marked on it, Sandy Hook Elementary was marked as the very first target on the map.  Commisioner Gordon even points to Sandy Hook and the camera zooms in on the map and show in all caps, &#34;Sandy Hook&#34; and the school is circled and marked as target 1.<br /><br />When I compared this to the real Sandy Hook map, it is the very same, with the movie map being changed by only adding water around it, but the streets and the elementary school are marked on the movie map exactly like the real map of Sandy Hook, N.J..<br /><br />I have watched this film only once and it was very well made, but with the things I pointed out here, being shown so vividly in the film, I won't be watching it again.  Too many reminders.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|It Didn't last 2months. This item was Cheaply made, looked like a knockoff. I would not recommend buying this item!!
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I got this film because of the very interesting blend of the cast.  Excellent acting.  I have watched this film over several times already, only having it a few days now.  I just don't get tired of it.<br /><br />It is very well written and very intriguing as to the outcome of the film, only to be surprised by the ending.<br /><br />Some won't like it, but those of us who love a good mystery and romantic story line, you will enjoy this one.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book was a mixture of fiction and wise truths that make you think and appreciate the time God has alotted and not to waste a second. Again I recommend this book for those over the age of twelve.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This one will be one that is a little hard to follow, until you get to the middle of the film.  Then after that, you really connect to the story line.<br /><br />Just as a warning, there are scenes in this film that you want to consider before letting any children see it.  There are also some very graphic scenes that were a bit disturbing due to how graphic they are.<br /><br />It is a very intelligent story and the cast really pulled off a very tough job of portraying these characters, but keep in mind, there are some topics in this film that might be disturbing to some.<br /><br />A very good film to see, once you get past the &#34;upsetting&#34; things that come about unexpected.  Again, do not let your children watch this, until you have viewed it yourself and you decide if you want them to see it or not.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote. It's fast becoming my other brain! With so many things to keep up with in this world, it's sort of hard to keep up with all of it.  Evernote helps me do it all and much more.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Channing Tatum is an amazing dancer and I love to watch dance films.  This one, I felt, held him back.<br /><br />The story line wasn't what I thought it would be and Matthew M., (I can never spell his name right), this wasn't one of his best works.  I can tell he had a lot of fun making this movie, but I was left a little disappointed with it.<br /><br />Again, it's not a bad movie, but I may or may not watch it again.  It just didn't ring any bells with me and that says a lot, as I am an avid movie watcher and watch all sorts of films, but to not like it, that's rare with me.<br /><br />Overall, I really didn't care too much for this one.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It's good but I got really sad when Octavian killed Percy's stuffed animal. :'( other than that it was really good.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I used to play the games when I was little, centuries ago... LOL.... but when I saw this film, I REALLY enjoyed it.<br /><br />The special effects are just amazing and the story line, I laughed, I tensed up and I was surprised all the way through.<br /><br />This is one that I will watch again.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I got this game for 99 coins and it was worth it I played the game my first time and could not put it done. I am sure it is the best of 2013
B00338QENI|5.0|Awesome book. Very captivating from the beginning. A must read. Very educational. I also downloaded so I could listen on tape.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun game that challenges your wits and patience. I would definitely recommend this game to any one looking for mental challenge.
B00AAKVXJM|5.0|Weird with this going on while the cd is dying a slow death. But what I can tell you is that even though it uses the SAME master tape as the American 'ReMasters' From 1993, on a good Stereo system, if you listen for it, the sound comes across 'cemented' the way it should be. Very hard to quantify what I mean but again, on a good system, the whole sound comes across much more solid and defined, although there is NO difference in EQ or Bass as far as a real remastering would sound like, where you could say, 'the cymbals sound much more real', nothing like that. But it IS a difference I heard comparing this disc with the American release. Is it worth the extra money???? Hell NO. But if you have the ears and can hear the difference, you'll never go back. It is that good.<br />Gerard Masters

B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled is the debut from author Emma Chase.  By the third page I was laughing out loud and completely hooked!! This book was deliciously AMAZING!<br /><br />This story open up with Drew Evans, über successful investment banker and ladies man extraordinaire, complaining to us about his awful bout with the flu....or so he is trying to convince us (as well as trying to convince himself).  Turns out Drew is the newest member of the Broken Heart Club, something he's totally unfamiliar with.  You see, Drew is a wealthy, handsome, successful, young and single playboy.  He loves his life.  Working hard and playing harder.  It's a new girl every weekend and that's how he likes it.  He has no desire to be tied down...well, at least in the whole relationship sense that is *wink*.  It's at the start of one of those bachelor weekends that he meets a stunningly beautiful brunette who turns him down flat....a concept he's also unfamiliar with.  Naturally he can't stop thinking about her...and as luck would have it, he won't have to wonder about her for too long as she is the newest member of his family's investment firm.  Drew isn't sure whether to curse or thank the fates for this little surprise.  Kate is totally off limits...not only does she work with him, she's engaged to another man and there's also that little problem of her shutting down every advance he makes.  Drew has never wanted anyone more than he wants Kate.  Ever.  Will he be as successful with Kate as he is in every other aspect of his life? God, he sure hopes so.<br /><br />So as I had said, by page three I was HOOKED!  This book is effing HILARIOUS!  I will say, I have never read a romance told from the guy's perspective, but Emma kicked ass!  Drew is seriously a guy any gal would be lucky to have.  He is funny, charming, handsome, the whole package.  He's loyal to his bro-friends.  He loves his family, even if he has a colorful nickname for his sister and although he's pretty much a womanizer, he does it in the cutest way!  What's most enjoyable about this story is that he talks to the reader.  Actually speaks to us.  It plays out like a Ferris Bueller movie!  Like, in the middle of a scene, Drew stops and makes side notes to the reader.  I LOVED that! It was such a different reading experience and will be really hard to beat.  I loved Kate as well.  She is a perfect match for Drew.  And she knocks him to his knees...hard and fast and it is delicious to watch play out.  Oh, I should probably mention there are some of the hottest and well-written smexy scenes I've had the pleasure of reading and had me drooling! Damn, Emma can write a sex filled weekend like no other!  Over all I LURVED this book and devoured it.  It was one of those take-your-ereader-everywhere-you-go-in-case-you-have-a-mesely-five-minutes-to-spare kind of reads.<br /><br />If you've started your summer reading list, move this one to the TOP!  And if you haven't started your summer reading list, who cares....buy this book and read it now!  You will not be disappointed!  Thank you, Emma, for a kick-ass, fresh and addictive read....I will certainly be looking for more of your work in the future!
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|The Last Stand is a classic action movie. It takes place in a little town in Arizona called Sommerton Junction. Arnold plays the sheriff of the small town, who used to be in the LAPD narcotic division, but after a botched operation he decides to take on a job that has a little less excitement, but all that changes when a drug cartel kingpin named Gabriel Cortez escapes from FBI custody a heads straight for his quiet little town. Cortez's men take up shop in the small town and begin working on building a bridge over the narrow canyon, so that Cortez can get across the border and out of the reach of the FBI, but once Owens (Schwarzenegger) pieces together what is going on gathers up what deputies he has, along with deputizing the town drunk/war veteran Frank Martinez played by Rodrigo Santoro and the owner of the Dinkum Firearm and Historic Weapon Museum Lewis Dinkum played by none other than Johnny Knoxville, and make a stand against Cortez and his men.<br /><br />There is plenty of speed, crazy driving stunts and bullets for any action fan, with some humor thrown in to wrap it up nicely. Arnold may not be in tip top form, but he still has absolutely no problem carrying a movie, and it is great to see him back in action. For any fan of action flicks or Arnold this is a must see movie.So get your popcorn and soda ready than strap yourself in for The Last Stand!
B006LSZECO|1.0|What starts out as an intriguing mystery novel quickly falls apart. Be prepared to suspend disbelief-- nothing in this story is even remotely believable. Big disappointment after all the good reviews!
B00B04NJLW|1.0|When I first read about this movie I was really excited to check it out. The idea for the movie sounded really cool. 26 different directors, each get their own letter, complete artistic freedom, 26 different horrifying shorts. Sounds like a Grandslam, but boy oh boy this popped this one straight up in front of home. Nearly all of the shorts aren't even in English, and to be completely honest I could of lived with that, if any of them would of actually been good. Most of the shorts don't even make any sense. To be truthful there is only one that actually stuck with me and that is letter T. So out of 26 shorts only 1 made a decent impression on me. I have read that they are planning a sequel, hopefully they will get some better directors. A movie like this with directors like Carpenter, Raimi, Coscarelli, Romero, etc would be freaking awesome. Unfortunately this one is a huge dud and you should really pass its not even worth a rent, hell I don't think I would even watch it for free.

B00AEBB8BK|5.0|I purchased this DVD while staying where the film was made (Seaside, Florida).  It was great to compare the movie with the surroundings.<br /><br />Good movie, once you understand the story line.  I didn't get much out of it when I saw it years ago, but enjoyed it much more when I got a better understanding what they were trying to convey.  It is amazing how this movie represents what has come to pass in our society, in relation to &#34;reality TV&#34; and &#34;big brother's&#34; role in society.  It is prophetic, and a bit scary.

B005HE5J7I|4.0|If your eyes glazed over while reading history books or in class, this may be just what was missing while you were in school.  Author Edward Rutherfurd painstakingly presents us with the development of London through 2,000 years of history.  While Rutherfurd is a scholar, this is not a scholarly work.  Nor, is it a dry accounting.  Interwoven through the centuries are the generations of fictional families that give us the human interest element. You might even think of it as history delivered soap opera style.<br /><br />A work of this scope cannot dwell for long on any single period of time.  The early story includes  the Ice Age, Vikings, Druids, Caesar crossing the Thames, and the Roman occupation of (then) Londonum.  Despite the many hundreds of pages, major historical events receive a smattering of attention.  This novel presents us with Medieval times, brings us into the Renaissance and into our present day.  While doing this, Rutherfurd includes architecture, the royal houses of Europe, literature (even Chaucer is a character), theater, the Catholic Church and Protestantism, politics, wars, the beginnings of guilds, and the development of London's sprawl from a primitive settlement to a modern city.<br /><br />There are a few points to mention.  The first one has nothing to do with the story but rather, reading this book on a Kindle.  Obviously, it is far easier to lift/carry/hold than the heavy paper version.  But the downside is that, it is impossible to see the maps that are so helpful in the hard copy version.<br /><br />Sometimes it was difficult to remember characters.  If you don't read for a while, continuity may be lost.  There are so many characters it's hard to keep them in mind.<br /><br />While I applaud the author for writing an engaging historical novel, character development was lacking.  But then, how could he possibly have included such a scope of history if he had not curtailed his characters in some way?  True to the times of sons following fathers in their line of work or being apprenticed out, Rutherfurd's history is accurate.  However, he used specific trans-generational traits that just didn't ring true.  Characters imbued with strength, honor, or simplemindedness for example, made them less believable.  Conversely, it could be seen as the author's device for helping the reader keep track of the many characters.<br /><br />Is it worth investing your money and time to read LONDON:  A NOVEL?  Yes, if you enjoy (re)learning history.  Yes, if you like seeing how climate, politics, wars, illnesses, and human frailties have forged into creating our past and (hopefully) appreciating how they impact our future.  And yes, if you relish seeing places you've been or, plan to see for yourself.g fathers in their line of work or being apprenticed out, Rutherfurd's history is accurate.

0671027387|4.0|Similar formula to his other books that he's better known for but its still a good entertaining read.  Buy it!  :)
B008BU75IQ|4.0|have read and enjoyed two of the Clifton Chronicles.  Complicated family relationships and find it helpful to make some notes as I go but still think both books are well worth one's time.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Was a download and it worked as stated.  Have been loading movies to my kindle for free  Works okay  and did load easily
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a good book but not as great as the first two. I do like the unexpected turns the book does take and really enjoyed the series. I felt this book tended to drag in parts where the first 2 did not.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I liked this book because I love mythology. And this book overflowed with gods and goddesses. I thought maybe it would keep on going, with the magic of the story carrying  me away. To say I love Shadow, would be true. He will continue the story maybe, somehow.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is so interesting to try! GET IT!<br />I love it because it is so interactive to children too!<br />Again get it
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|House at The End of The Street is another ambitious, low budget, Horror film, that tries to make a name for itself by using star power, but how much was I really expecting from a PG-13 Horror film? The story begins when Elissa and her mother move to a new house in the country, a house that is across the street from the scene of a grizzly double murder four years earlier. The house and story is surrounded by rumors and still occupied by the son of the victims, who Elissa quickly befriends. Once again we have a common theme that has been done to death, but the producers of this film were hoping that by spending big bucks on Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games) and Max Thieriot (Bates Motel) that they could get people to watch their film and it worked, but I suspect most people were sadly disappointing like I was. The acting was terrific and everything you would expect from these actors, but the story was so simple and predictable that it really wasn't worth watching. Being a PG-13 film didn't help either as there wasn't really anything too horrific or creepy to really catch your attention. If that wasn't bad enough, the first hour of the film was so slow, that I almost turned it off. The only thing that kind of gave me a laugh was that there was a lot of scenes with Jennifer Lawrence in the woods and I couldn't help but think that Katniss wished she had her bow. House at The End of The Street is a film that has the star power, but not much else, as it's a slow, tame, predictable film, that's been done and it leaves far too many unanswered questions. If you're a die hard Jennifer Lawrence fan, check it out, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time on this one.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The whole series is excellent and the actors were top quality.  I looked forward to seeing it and sad when it finished
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really connected with this story. It bought me back to a time when I too was a lonely and introspective teen trying to find somewhere to belong.  I think just as influential as first love is our first group of real friends. It's intense and everything is wrapped in a bittersweet sense of transients. I love this book for reminding me of that feeling.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Excellent movie not for everyone but I loved it. Great movie if you believe in strange things happening but always possible
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I started using iOS but as some of my devices migrated do android I was pressed to find a solution where I could have my music anywhere. Amazon MP3 is it.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Good scary fun! I enjoyed the story line and the kids were the best part. I loved the ending and i was glad when Lily went with Mama cause she was just too weird. Lol.
B0045ODPKY|5.0|I love every movie Angelina Jolie has been in...I especially enjoyed this one because she didn't use a &#34;body double&#34;  for her stunts...she really is fearless-not just another beautiful face!

B0064MGU98|5.0|Had seen incredibly positive reviews of this show many times, but just didn't have the chance to watch it. After watching the pilot episode, I finished the entire 1st season in several quick nights. Love it, and highly recommend!
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Michael Buble is my favorite artist! I love is voice so much that when I heard about the new album I had a countdown going for a month! I was so excited and it came out awesome! Love the old and new songs he sings.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|A beautiful medley of previous levels and new content, Remix delivers one of the best mobile experiences to date. With the expansion you'll have over 100 levels, plus the 4 sandbox zones, all for a mere $2. The DS and PC versions are far more costly; I can't believe you're reading this instead of purchasing the game. Impressive puzzles with solutions limited only by your imagination will leave you in awe of what this game can do. Need to cross a ravine? How about riding a fast flying firebreathing goat? Pretend you're in Middle Earth and fight a bunch of giant angry trees! The game has infinite replay-ability so long as you have thoughts. I can safely say this app is the most &quot;worth it&quot; game out there.
0547258305|4.0|I expected a fluffy read, not much content but enough action to keep the pages turning, when I picked up this book. I was wrong; I fell in love with the world and was left wanting more. I can't wait to reread this book, knowing what I know. A great read!<br /><br />This world really sucks you in. I very much appreciate the realistic writing. Life isn't just rainbows and sunshine, and neither is travel a relaxing one day horseback ride through flowering meadows. Cashore agrees with me. There are long journeys, tough decisions, and real consequences.<br /><br />The characters have distinct personalities and realistic interactions. I did feel King Randa was missing definition as more than just the bad guy. Furthermore, Katsa's sudden rebelliousness seems forced but progresses nicely throughout the rest of the book. Overall, no big complaints and I'm thankful that Po and Katsa didn't fall prey to love at first sight.<br /><br />The plot is interesting. It is constant but also transforming and growing, and it drags you all over the seven kingdoms; you won't be bored.<br /><br />I very much recommend this book.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I've been a lifetime Deep Purple fan and I'll simply say that it's wonderful to hear a band compose together as a band!<br />Jon Lord has to be in heaven applauding the heavy keyboards of Don Airey! Ian Gillian is in superb voice, Steve Morse still plays with power and enthusiasm. Roger and Ian pound out solid bass and drum lines!<br />These are new tunes that I would love to hear live! Bravo guys!
B003XME83W|5.0|I bought this RAM and it has worked beautifully to speed up my computer.  I play hidden object games that I needed more RAM for and this product has been an excellent addition to my system!  Was easy to install and worked without a hitch.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I love the show and the movie, while being different in several respects, has just as much power and emotion.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Perfectly written story, funny and lovely. Great prospective from a man's point of view. You'll fall in love with the characters
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I tried to get this app but it says that I cannot get it on my Kindle fire so if you have one don't bother getting this app it will be just a waste of your money
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy playing temple run it takes your mind off of things so play this game and enjoy because if you do not enjoy this game you are crazy
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a addicting game and has most of the qualities of the PC version.  There is one glitch that doesn't let you pick up blocks sometimes
B00785P2QC|5.0|Virtual city is awesome and i love it ot makes me feel like i have control over a city i just love it
B009NY43NY|2.0|I gave the book two stars . Was too short for these iconic characters. SPOILERS ALERT I always knew Sookie would end up with Sam.<br />I felt Eric and Bill should have got more time in the story and I also felt that Eric shouldn't have gotten dissed by Sookie.  I felt the book had a good plot, but it was too short where other characters could have been more involved in helping the plot of the story by showing more of a bigger battle where some of the major characters would've  lost their lives, it would've made an easier transition for her to be with Sam instead of her breaking up with Eric and being with Sam in two weeks..
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game is horrible compared to the real minecraft. On this app you cant hardly do anything and you are so limited that its immpossible to even be the slightest bit creative.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This album has broad appeal.  I'm a married physician in his 40's and I enjoy it along with my staff (early 20's) while we work.  I get quips like, \\"Ya its got a lot of disco but its a COOL disco!\\" The younger ones seem to love it for what it is; good beats with a funky groove.<br /><br />For me it feels like the natural evolution of the music I grew up with.  Let me be clear. Random Access Memories is unlike anything I've ever heard.  It stands completely on it's own as a body of work.  There are tips of the hat to disco beats of the past but it's done in a modern way that respects the advance of technology and our collective evolving palette.  But besides the obvious disco I hear several other influences(?) including the Grateful Dead, Gypsy Kings, and New Order.<br /><br />This is a fun album to listen to while you are driving alone along a long stretch of highway.  As you can tell, I don't do a lot of reviews but I thought enough of this album to write this one.
B001F12J0C|3.0|Good movies, fun to watch all three back to back... smart fight scenes and slick get-away action too. Very enjoyable
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Richard Dawkins carefully and clearly outlines the absurd, contradictory, and ambiguous claims and beliefs of most major religions. By using their own scriptures and history, he shows that religion is just a bunch of ancient nonsense that most people are still trying to hang onto even though we've discarded the most ridiculous and inane aspects.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When word came out that Google as shutting down Reader, I started looking for a replacement.  I chose Feedly. It's similar to Reader in its structure, but with a nicer look. Also, it is more stable.  Reader would always quit working, but Feedly has never stopped. Feedly syncs with Reader so that all of your news feeds will transfer over.
B00915G6YE|5.0|This season is by far one of the best seasons! Can't wait for the final season.<br /><br />That being said, has anyone else experienced any problems with the English 5.1 HD sound track? In the audio set-up, I found that the first choice, being the English 5.1, and the second choice, which is the 2.0, play the same. This is really noticable when switching between the four audio options. The French 5.1 plays perfect. And just to be clear, I have tried EVERYTHING to get it to play right. NOTHING works. All my other blu-rays play fine.<br /><br />Anyone else experiencing this? Is it possible that this is a Blu-ray defect?
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is what a good app looks like because you dont have to buy anything, you dont have to have any skill already in it because it shows you step by step how to win each level and will tell you or require you to use the best character for each level which is proof that you dont have to pay money to buy anything. I highly reccomend this game to all video game players
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Miyazaki has a unique twist that make watching any of his movies a joy. This isn't my favorite, but still very enjoyable.
6303160344|5.0|The more you watch this film, the more certain things become clear, but not everything! \\"Jamais de la vie.\\"<br />It begins with a car wreck in which a family of three is trapped.The action quickly leaps to the hospital where we come face to face with Julia, the sole survivor, who cannot speak.First we learn that her husband died. But more important than the loss of Julia's husband is the loss of her daughter Anna. This becomes apparent in the early hospital scene when her face changes on hearing of her daughter's death. This is the more devastating news to her.<br />  We learn that her husband was a composer involved in writing a symphony on the new European Union. It becomes abundantly clear that Julia wrote some of the most innovative parts of this symphony about the unification of Europe, and, by the way, was to get no credit whatsoever for it. Her husbands betrayal is even clearer (as blue crystals that prevail throughout the film) when Mistress/Attorney turns up as not only an amorous lover of her husband, but the illegitiment mother for his secret baby. All of this is not surprising so much as it is a full realization of things Julia had denied and suppressed long before the car accident occurred.<br />  Anguish over death and betrayal goes on in her mind throughout this film. And why is it so capivating?<br />  The answer to this question goes on more in each viewer's own heart than it does in any dialogue. What we witness is the speechless unfolding of the human heart. Julia is a person whose deepest motives and aspirations had always been sacrificed for the sake of others. Now, in the midst of tragedy, she rises out of the ashes of her ruined life into a baptism and rebirth of her true inner self. The old person is pushed aside  as if by the thrust of her hand, and a new person emerges. This all becomes clear when she hands over the keys of the old family estate to the new mother. What does she want for this? \\"Rien,\\"(means nothing)she says! Now she has discovered how to express her deeper self for the first time. Her rebirth as a person is almost complete.<br />  When she inserts the flute solo into the  symphony she at first tried to destroy, she makes her ultimate triumphant declaration.<br /> Of course all this is internalized. The dramatization is expressed through surreal imagery, exalted music, subtle background sounds, and most intensely through Julia's eye movements and facial twitching. Following the back of the head profiles through dark rooms is a movie in itself. And we ask why? Very few words tell us what is happening. It is intentionally left to the viewer to surmise what these symbolic acts mean.<br />  If you never suffered some deep personal grief, you probably cannot understand any of this. Beauty here is suspended from a very thin thread. Life is suspended on a bungee strap. The meaning rises out of images and music buried deep in the soul of this determined young woman.overed how to express her deeper self for the first time.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Without doubt one of the finest dystopian EOTWAWKI novels I have ever read.<br /><br />The story is set in silo 17 which is a multi level underground bunker in which remnants of the human race have endured for the last few hundred years.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal any of the story because I want readers to discover the Woolverse for themselves but go and buy the book now, sit down in your favorite chair and you will find yourself immersed in a new, disturbing and very plausible world.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has created a world which will I hope will be somewhere I am visiting for many years to come.<br /><br />I normally do not like books that do not explain the apocalyptic events or refuse to divulge how the world of the novel came to be and Howey does this in wool but the story is packed with little nuggets of information about the apocalypse, the social structure, the history of Silo 17 which satisfies yet at the same time makes you yearn for me.<br /><br />The story itself is riveting and I literally could not put my kindle down.<br /><br />In my opinion this novel is worthy of classic status alongside Earth Abides, Alas Babylon and A Canticle for Leibowitz.<br /><br />Just buy the book and enjoy a damned good read
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I missed this season on TV and had to catch up before the next season came. Is there a better series out there?
B000FA675C|5.0|I have no doubt to say this is one of my favorite books. Since I first read it on its launch and now again on Kindle, it keeps my attention on it through every page. Dan Brown has a perfect way to narrate the story that feels even better than to watch any of the cinema adaptations of his works.<br /><br />The book has led me to research on many historical subjects that were used as background to the plot. I learned many different things beyond the books fiction realm. I truely recommend it for beginners and advanced readers.

B0081BU42O|5.0|It is to different degrees, but I love every one of Bank's Culture novels. I want to live there, so bad.

0988936402|3.0|In [[ASIN:0061575593 Being and Time]], the German Philosopher Martin Heidegger warned us against becoming a part of what he called \\"das man\\" (translated into English as \\"the they\\").  Das man was delineated by, above all else, apathy.  It is where people thought & cared as little as possible about those around them & life in general.<br /><br /> In [[ASIN:B00BCOQSSQ Everville: The First Pillar]], Roy Huff tinkers with this motif as the enemy is simply known as \\"Them.\\"  Like das man, it is an ambiguous name for an adversary that is determined to siphon off all joy from every realm it conquers.<br /><br />Such is the outline of a universe encountered by the persona in this book.  His freshman yr @ college is filled with unseen dangers that the rest of us who went through freshman algebra never had to deal with.  Come to find out, there is a realm of peace known as EVERVILLE which is trying to fend off Them;  it is a sort of buffer point to keep Them from getting to the earthly realm.  It is an unseen war, kind of like the invisible war that some Catholics believe is waged between the Seraphim / Cherubim & Lucifer's top lieutenants in the spirit world.<br /><br />The book switches back & forth from 1st person to 3rd person, and I found this to be somewhat annoying.  It is particularly frustrating in parts written in 1st person where the persona can nonetheless know what is going on in other people's minds.  If that is all part of the \\"fun\\" then it was not explained very well.  Also, the author tends to use the word \\"rather\\" far too often.  Inserting it as a modifier every once in awhile is fine.  Over-doing it makes the word seem like a cop-out.<br /><br />There are obvious traces of [[ASIN:0061992887 Chronicles of Narnia Box Set]], [[ASIN:0544003411 The Lord of the Rings]] and [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]] in EVERVILLE.  That said, I did not find this book to be of the same caliber of those books mentioned above.  Still, if you're wanting a quick read & an escape to a hidden place, then this book is worth a look.ng a quick read & an escape to a hidden place, then this book is worth a look.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This season was awesome.  After watching the past seasons, I was starting to get bored with the show until they went back to basics.  Season 9 is taking so long to get here!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Yet another charming tale by Ms. Harris. This one is all Sookie in peril with vamps only in the background. I loved it!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book is full of nostalgia.  If you grew up as a geek in the eighties then it will take you back there.  At the same time it gives a glimpse of a future where the virtual world called the OASIS is more real than reality for most people.  I recommend taking a journey to this world.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sandberg provides her own thoughtful perspective on the challenges women face in the workplace, successfully blending her own personal experience with a wealth of references. I found her suggestions on how to be Howard not Heidi particularly helpful - how to ask for promotion nicely and still be liked.  Definitely a book for every aspiring woman leader

B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was awesome, along with any other Suzanne Collins book. However, I don't think this book was as well written as the first hunger games. Still a great read, but just not as good as the first one.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Hard to give a good review without ruining the plot.  Therefore, the movie kept my attention, had interesting plot twists in the right places and to boot, a great ending.  One I didn't see coming.  For me that's very unusual.  All actors did really well and was a twist to a Love Story.  A good one.  If you don't like romance and small towns - then this movie isn't for you.  If you love the type of movie that has you crying (for a good reason) then this one IS for you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent story but I only wish the epilogue had been more fleshed out. I spent a lot of time with these characters and would love to have more follow up. Great trilogy. Glad my daughter convinced me to read.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|it was good but not as good as i have hoped. It felt a lot like Sleeping with the Enemy only that movie was better.

B003N0XDT4|3.0|I had this product for about a year. When it worked it was great to use. The volume was a little loud for me. I usually had to keep it on the lowest volume setting possible or else it would blow my ears out. When it gets turned on sometimes it would be at the highest volume, such a surprise.<br /><br />The reason why I don't have it anymore is that one day it just stopped working. I had this for about a year.

1476733953|3.0|It hasn't happened very often, but this book shows the possibilities of self-publishing in the digital age.  Originally a short story that developed a wide fan base, Howey's novel was ultimately picked up by a mainstream print publisher and became a national bestseller.  Though it's not a perfect novel, it's easy to see why it became popular.  It is based on a compelling premise.  All of known humanity lives underground in a silo nearly 150 floors deep.  The external air is deadly, and the world outside the silo is known only through bleak images of the landscape and the decaying city beyond the hills.  These images are projected onto walls on the top level of the silo.  As the novel progresses, we learn of various methods--some subtle, some less so--by which social and political order is maintained: division of labor, constraints on communication and contact, population control, and so on.  In cases where a person is found guilty of posing an extreme threat to the established order, he or she is sent for \\"cleaning,\\" a euphemism for banishment to the surface world outside the silo.  In this bleak landscape, the miscreant does two things: cleans the lenses that bring the view of the outside world into the silo, and then dies in the toxic atmosphere.  Cleaning, in other words, is a death sentence.<br /><br />Howey explores two primary themes in the book.  First, he looks at the social and political structure that develops in a completely enclosed, self-contained world.  This is not examined deeply, and some readers may want more, but this is not the author's main concern.  The second theme is the question of what would happen if someone did something so audacious, so unexpected, and so unprecedented, that it challenged every foundational assumption of the silo society.  The author takes too long to get around to this, so as a result the working out of the consequences is a bit rushed, but it is nevertheless an interesting exploration and Howey is able to provide enough material to create some tension between order and chaos, group and individual, duty and humanity.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an awesome game, but I think you should be at least 5 to even watch it. If you crash the truck (or whatever you are driving) the neck of the man cracks. He might also land in a position that small children repeat, and they could get very hurt.<br /><br />The game has two petals, a brake and a forward. This not only makes you go forward and backward, it controls your flips.<br /><br />There are different stages and vehicles to unlock using coins you earn while driving.<br />There is a monster truck, motorcycles, race cars, etc.<br /><br />Have fun!
B005COO1X6|3.0|way too short, but good, hope there is a longer version of this, I think Mr. King could really make this into a novel, it could be the  new Christine

B00821OX98|2.0|I want SciFi  not a war/action movie. I will continue for a few more episodes but do not have high hopes. Acting is OK, plot a tad plebeian.<br /><br />Overall, I am not sure yet. It can turn into a decent scifi or become another action horror (they be monsters) flick.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Having a lot of fun with this game.  I like that you don't necessarily need the in app purchases to keep playing the game.  I would definitely recommend it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I downloaded several different mahjong games, I only like this one and have delete the other ones. By far it is the superior game to play if you like mahjong. It is peaceful, challenging and a great exercise for the brain.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What an amazing story. To be in the head of the lead character, Pat, throughout the entire story as he worked through his mental illness was an eye opener for me, extremely educational and heartwarming. Such a powerful storyline. I give major props to Matthew Quick for sinking himself fully into this as I cannot fathom what that took to become Pat. Highly recommend!<br /><br />~Literary Junkies Online Book Club Selection

B008OOYALE|4.0|A very fun game to play. The graphics are excellent and I love that you can create mystery dragons. The only thing I dislike is the option to pay real money to buy things to advance. I would recommend this game to kids and adults alike.

B009IJJ712|3.0|Although the series is one of the best new TV dramas of the season, there is for me one notable absence. Victorian England.  The setting for Sherlock Holmes does as much to inform his character as does his eternal struggle against his arch Nemesis Moriarty. Missing are the gaslights, the dark interiors (with the notable exception of Holmes New York flat), the Victorian class system, a society wrestling with the benefits and plagues of the nascent modern, industrial society. It is a world before the Nazi rallies of Nuremburg, before Chernobyl and Fukushima, before microwave pizza and cable TV and the Tea Party and electricity.  A time when people like Holmes naively believed that science and logic could solve the problems of their time. A visit to the world of Sherlock Holmes is a journey into our past not our present. Watching the program which is well acted, with interesting characters and snappy dialogue succeeds on the low bar of modern, TV drama but ultimately fails as a Holmesian adaptation.  Watching the new, modern Sherlock Holmes is like watching a fish flopping around on Times Square.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz returns better than ever.  Every now and then Boz resurfaces, and each time he does, I'm glad he made the effort.  No disappointments here.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I have become an absolute Tremor Fan!  I really love Tremors and Tremors 2, and now that I've seen Aftershocks/Tremors 2 and the 4th movie, I can honestly say that I am hooked.  It's great having all four movies in one package, so if you have not purchased any of the movies yet, this is the way to go!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love the ability to check weather for both at home or where I am going. A wonderful app on the cell phone,.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is awesome! The graphics are cool. I love the speed of this game and how easy it is to control. It works great on my Kindle Fire HD. What an awesome up grade of the Galaga game which I love to play still. Thanks John for creating such a cool game!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|This is a fun show to watch. It is the same kind of show as Prison Break or 24. Very suspenseful and eventful.
B009GENZ12|3.0|When I saw the previews of this film I thought it was going to be really good. Dont get me wrong the storyline is a really cool one, but the film does not hit the mark for me. It is still worth watching though because of the twists in the film.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Reading about women and the culture and their stories was an amazing story which was compelling and a learning experience.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|One of his best. Saw Joe in Nov and he performed 5 acoustic numbers before moving to electric. Excellent. Plan to get the DVD soon.
B001JU4S44|5.0|Is one of the best movie ever from Tom Cruise,I never get tired watching it,his performance is fantastic!!!! is a classic....
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Downton Abbey overall has been hugely addicting.  Season 3 continues to be as full of twists and turns as the first 2 seasons, however, I find that I prefer the first 2 seasons.  I think this is only due to the stage of life these characters are in (which does not interest me as much) rather than any declining talent or script.  I don't regret buying this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Overall, it is a great game, but I have it on both my older kindle fire and my new ipad,  and it is much easier with the larger screen
B008GXHOFW|3.0|Good game could use better graphics and Spiderman needs to be easier to control<br /> Otherwise it's a pretty good game for a tablet
B007O4XZFW|2.0|Yes, I'm the dumb butt who bought this for my sister for Christmas without reading that the subtitles are in Italian. Yeesh! I love this movie and my sister enjoys it even more, so I felt pretty bad about this mix up. It was completely my fault. Just don't make the same mistake I did. Reading is good :)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game.  You will too.  I love the challenges and so does music 81year old mom.  I highly recommend this game.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I had hoped for so much more. The music is beautiful and the lessons are well illustrated visually however, the actors really leave much to be desired; they are 2-Dimensional, unbelievable and stilted. Nonetheless, I would encourage people to see this film because of the richness of its message.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded many books from amazon.com and I must say that is a very useful application. you can read everything clearly, and everything is fast. what more can you ask for?
B005LN5UOC|5.0|a very good headset, works as expected. the only gripe i have is when the headset is on, a controller or two of mine don't seem to work, im not sure if this is so much a fault of the headset as it is a bluetooth interference issue, all in all very pleased with the quality and performance
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I Think that this game is awesome and you should keep adder nc s.d adding and addi g new things on to it it is so awesome!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book. Although the first quarter of the book is not that special, it reaches a certain point where the unravelling of the events hooks you. Be patient if you start thinking this is getting nowhere: you'll be surprised how it grabs you!
B005OK725M|4.0|I have seen the movie I just wanted to own a copy but the copy I ordered was on the west coast and I live on the east coast and it would work on this side of the country.  But the people I ordered it from were really nice and I tried 2 DVDs and had to send both copies back.  I would do business with them again for something other than Blue Ray DVDs.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The only thing that could make this app better is to update the current radar image sooner.  Sometimes it lags up to 90 min behind.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Even in the most trying circumstances, the will to endure to the end often prevails. The author of this book found out a lot about herself during the unbelievable adventure she carved out for herself. There is some strong language used throughout the book and also various descriptions of Cheryl's casual life-style episodes.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|From start to finish, this story has it all. A classicly deep Star Trek Next Generation novel. This one doesn't conform to the standar, but surpasses the standard. Amazing.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I just loved this movie & it was such a good story.....Richard Dreyfus & Holly Hunter are so good together just like in Once Around.......they are a great team together & you should watch this movie...Always was really good........
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I love Daft Punk! This was a delight to listen to sending back to all of the reasons why I am glad to be born when I was! This is a mix of the best of the 70's and 80's sounds. I am always glad to be able to find something to share with the younger people who don't know what it was like to grow up in a time when people wanted to have fun and party without the hater nation things we unfortunately have now! Although the world seems to be changing for the worst at times; music like this from bands like this brings the happiness of love, laughter and dancing like you just don't care and back then we didn't! We just had fun!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|service an delivery was excellant, unfortunately it did not solve the problem as I am still unable to charge Kindle seems loose connection, occasionally with a lot of jiggling it will fire up takes forever!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|What an amazing book, incredibly funny, sexy and romantic. I love the way the author has written this story from Drew's POV, it's like you are there in the story and he is telling it directly to you. It's also nice to read a book that makes you laugh out loud (people will look at you funny). YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. I loved it!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Quick, action packed read. Great for the beach or to pass the time while traveling. I like the relationship between Rook and Heat.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|You think you figure it out and then you realize you don't .  Lisa Gardner weaves a web that is intricate and constantly changing.  I have read most of her other books but this was the firs DD Warren book I read.  No doubt this is her best work in my opinion.  I cannot wait for the next one!
0767827791|5.0|This is such a classic movie & William Holden & Kim Novak are great in this..I only wish it were a longer movie because I hated to see it end............
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|movie/flick.Was very interesting,great storyline,AWESOME graphics,animals,stars,fish.Kept me intrigued throughout,family oriented&fun for the whole family.I totally recommend this movie if you haven't seen it!
B00338QENI|4.0|I was afraid there would be too much science and it would become tedious.  Skloot kept enough of the personal side in it to keep my interest.  I have recommended it to several friends - especially those in the medical field.
1616550414|5.0|Beautiful cover, beautiful artwork and quotes/descriptions within, and the official timeline. Also a manga at the end. I recommend this to anyone who's a Zelda fan. Love it!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|don't like that this is reality, but expect 90% is. Acting is very good, some likeable characters, others are well developed, if not so likeable-- not one dimensional at all!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids (ages 8 and 3) loved this movie! So did their dad and I. Great story and cute characters. We watched this one 3 times before it expired!
B004LZEV4Q|3.0|I got this for my grandchildred and for most of the time it works as it should but sometimes when they turn the page it says nothing
B00AAX68HG|4.0|But who cares? This is another very addictive puzzler from Zeptolab. Great graphics, a fun game mechanic and I cannot get enough of &quot;pudding-speak&quot;! Well worth a try, even with the ads.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|It's hard to imagine the kind of life these people have had to live when we live in such a spoiled society. It is a real eye-opener & I recommend it for a good book club discussion.
B00CW665VI|5.0|The best book I've read in a long time. Funny, sarcastic, romantic all rolled up into one. You will fall in love with all of the characters and not be able to put the book down until you've finished it and then you'll be begging for more!
B007NPZLSG|5.0|I have been a Yanni fan for a number of years and this CD is no exception to his haunting, beautiful music.  Wonderful!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|An awesome zombie movie, totally different from other zombie movies. So good, I wish I had gone to this one while it was still in theaters. Check it out!
B000001GAJ|4.0|The positive endorsements by collectors herein is understandable.  Mendelssohn wrote brilliant music, symphonies, chamber pieces, showing early musical maturity.  Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, (always brilliant) at the time under contract with DG along with two prominent DG artists, Kremer and Argerich do in fact explore the more dramatic and intense elements with Mendelssohn.  This is part of some of the negative features of the performance.  Mendelssohn is definitely \\"quicksilver\\" musical writing in many cases, and he did specify Allegro Molto.  DG is definitely cheap here too, as an entire additional piece could have fit comfortably.  One of Mendelssohns 700+ pieces could have been added.  What disappointed me is Argerichs often thunderous keyboard contribution and Kremer not emerging from the general dry texture of the recording.  The Orpheus Orchestra, recorded somewhat dry, like Orpheus' splendid Haydn recordings of inconsistent sonic quality, tonally somewhat thin, is again present here.  A more relaxed, but no less energetic \\"atmosphere\\" here would be most welcome.  Better, clearer recorded acoustics, more space, more instrumental differentiation.  A recent NAXOS recording may have the sonic edge here 8.553844 - but still comes up short at only 58 min, with DG giving a scant 59 min.  An older Philips recording sonically superior with ASMF/Marriner and Mullova in the non-piano concerto is no longer in the current catalog.  So 2 comparatively rare pieces, with nothing fully satisfactory readily available, but at least acceptable on this DG paring.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|It looks like you can set only one alarm settings. Wish it allowed multiple settings.  Would not recommend. Try other ones.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I get that everyone wants only mini Brads and Angelinas to tell a love story. You like to imagine yourselves as one while the other hottie just can't get enough of you. I get that you go to the movies to escape your \\"too real\\" lives. But for me... well that is what I loved about this sci-fi total fictional story. It took place in a small town with a boy you could have gone to school with, a leading lady who was by no means prettier than the main queen b of the school and yet the things that made these characters different are what brought them together.<br /><br />It's easy to love the hotties... but is it really love? It's also easy to love \\"normal\\" families but again - who hasn't come across someone they love enough to oversee their crazy family? The way this doesn't have a predictable fairytale ending is refreshing. The true definition of sacrifice - not being a poor me but owning up to and taking pride in loving someone/thing bigger than yourself is refreshing. And taking control of your destiny and not letting it ramrod you are all the things I think any good teen movie should have.<br /><br />No, it isn't Twilight. Twilight teaches it's ok to be in a relationship where your life is always at risk and it's ok to lie to your parents. Twilight is pure fiction... and while this has its fictional elements there's a bit of truth telling to it as well... True love isn't always happy endings at no cost - it's sacrifice.<br /><br />So stop the comparison (thanks to the movie companies that tried to peddle it that way - epic fail) and just watch it for what it is - a sweet movie about a boy and girl next door who are growing up and trying to figure out who they are, what love is and learning from it all.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|Love it.  Have converted a friend to love it too.  I mean, who wouldn't love it? She will be buying a copy as well.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game harkens back to the days when I went to the arcade with a pocket full of quarters! Kudos!!!!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|its a good game. I play. it in my spare time.I think we could earn moneys a bit faster though.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is an amazing read, like Kite Runner, only more beautifully touching. I read it in 24 hours- couldn't put it down. I loved it! The characters are real and their emotions and stories painfully true to life.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is fun and all but totally out of date.armor was just recently seed lava dont follow and the are no dungeons.No enderman etheir.mojang needs to update this soon.other wise save the $7 and go buy somethin else.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone interested in romance, time travel and beasts that are out of this world.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Good movie, good music, great acting for  sure..........i have watched it 3 times...still laugh at the same parts..... language wasn't  as bad as i thought it would be. I am not entertained by listening to actors dropping the F bomb..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow subway suffers is definetly better than temple run but I just think subway suffers should make a part 2 but it still amazing ham
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Plasma Sky is a great game and great fun. I played if for about an hour today and it takes me back to playing in an actual arcade except that I didn't have to pony up any quarters to keep playing! Great graphics as well as sound. I like how it just shoots without me having to hold a button. Again a great game.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching it at the beginning of Season 3 and wanted to see if from the beginning, what a great show!
B001H1OUUC|5.0|Better than expected. Analog version is more organic and natural sounding. Slightly warped on arrival, disappointing. Still sounds great though
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Since I am not a techie I probably do not utilize all of the Adobe Reader capabilities but it's good to know that I have it and that it worked on my IPhone, computer and now for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9!  Thanks.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book, or series of books has an extremely complicated plot and cast of characters, but still is very engrossing. We bought the audio version and the ebook. It good to have the ebook as well, to review parts that are unclear. I would highly recommend it. We've been traveling extensively and it has kept us on the edge of our seats as the miles roll past.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Really??? Why do this game needs internet? Hope that they can change that y'know... Nice movie should have a better game!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This is an excellent product. It's made of metal, very durable for both in and outside. My four-year old grandson is very happy.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Took me a while to get through, but I liked it very much! Sometimes I forgot it was the dog telling the story.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I got this game because it was the &#34;free APP of the day.&#34;  I had never played Mahjong before, but quickly learned how by trying different moves and by using the help button to see suggested moves.  Although I've only had this game for about a week, I find myself playing it several times during the day, sometimes for an hour or so.  There are about 26 different games boards and I am still riveted to the first one.  I guess I'll be enjoying this APP for months and months to come as I branch out and try the different boards.  The game has worked perfectly on my kindle fire.  The tiles are very aesthetically pleasing - a very pretty game.  On the downside, I did have a little trouble getting used to the perspective of the game board at first.  The game board is 3-D and it was a little hard to see which tiles were on top and which were covered.  After playing for a while I got used to the perspective.  I love this game - it is a new addiction for me.  Try it!
140009688X|5.0|I would recommend this story to all who love detective stories.  But I particularly enjoyed the descriptions that allowed me to picture the African countryside.  The characters are richly developed and are easy to imagine. I am continuing with the series and am enjoying the further development of the main characters and their various adventures.
B000HF6XV8|3.0|I rented this movie for my students.  They were no impressed.  Although it is a classic that I love it wasn't the best choice for my third grade class.
1449437524|4.0|This is a cute little book, but it's not for children.  The pictures are very cute, and the book is quite funny.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I shall be sleep deprived tomorrow because I stayed up into the wee hours just trapped by the words spilling out with drama and hope. I cannot wait to see what happens next!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This game is just challenging enough to not be boring and the music is very calming.  Try to get a perfect score on each round before advancing.
B00005QW5X|5.0|For the price and fast shipping, I was very happy with my purchase. The movie was just as described and was able to play it.
B00015YVD6|5.0|This movie brings me back to my childhood and I love it! Tom Hanks at his best. I love most of the movies from His early years and this one is just great!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I found it to be predictable and did not care for any of the characters.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Amazing from sart to finish! Can't wait till the next one comes out!!!  Everyone should see this, you won't regret it!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|My husband and I have started doing this program two weeks ago. I'm finding it so easy and already I am seeing weight come off, I feel healthy, strong, awake and alive!  I feel like I've finally been set free of diets forever!
B000SEI230|4.0|I like to read books that movies have been based upon.  Sometimes I watch the movie first, as in the case of this book.  I liked how the story line was slightly different from the movie, but it wasn't completely different as to where I couldn't follow it.  I love how the characters are the &#34;bad boy&#34; and the &#34;preacher's daughter&#34;, two total opposites, who come together to teach each other  about goodness and love. Of course, it made me cry.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is a great movie.  Although it does stretch the actual physics of railroading, it is an excellent movie with some great scenes and great acting.  Love it and have watched it several times.
B009MYARIK|1.0|Too awful to waste time reading this book.  Really sad that she can't come up with any new great material.
B00CFA227C|4.0|I liked this film and together with my 12 years old daughter we spend a nice moment watching it. It is however definitely not recommended to little children, like 10 and younger. This review contains limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />This retelling of old tale of Jack and the Beanstalk is pretty well done, with many key ingredients of fairy tales well in place. There is a brave and ultimately quite clever farm boy (Jack), a cute and quite likeable damsel in distress, a noble king, his brave knights, a vilainous treacherous scoundrel, powerful magic items, a really REALLY BAD giant alpha (and beta) and a whole batallion of other giants, almost as dangerous as their two-headed leader.<br /><br />Past the first 10 minutes, the film is rather quick paced and visually it is very pleasant: the sky domain of giants, the giant beanstalks and the mighty royal fortress are really impressive. The desperate fight of royal army against the giants besieging the great royal castle is a particularly well done thing - I certainly appreciated that both humans and giants fight in a rather logical way and human army is definitely not a push-over...<br /><br />The best character in the film and a scene stealer is Elmont, a sarcastic noble knight commanding royal guard, played very VERY convincingly by Ewan McGregor who seizes this occasion to remind the public, that he once played Obi-wan Kenobi and that after all he killed Darth Maul and General Grievous and defeated and mutilated Darth Vader... Frankly, I almost expected Elmont to finally use his light-saber and I was very surprised when he didn't...<br /><br />Stanley Tucci who plays the main villain Roderick is another scene stealer, with his quasi Monty Pythonesque style - it is clear he had tons of fun playing in this film. Ewan Bremer, who plays his slightly deranged murderous sidekick Wicke, is another delight to watch.<br /><br />Compared to those three characters and to all the gallery of giants, both Jack and the Princess seem a little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.<br /><br />But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available. Although not a masterpiece, this is a nice, easy, visually very impressive film.ittle pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.<br /><br />But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available.

6305428352|5.0|This music catalogs the change in American education in America for the early 60's through the 90's ; the changes in dress, culture, music and lifestyles and the effect of politics, war  a changing society and values and the decline in the funding of our schools. Richard Dreyfus deserved an oscar for his performance as music teacher Glen Holland where he, like Tom Hank's Forrest Gump act as our guide to show all that his right with America !!!
B005LJETYI|4.0|This would be the perfect book for a movie,I hope they spend the time with cg as location is basically in one place....I have seen some pictures I truly hope they do this story justice as they picked it for film and can so easily make this a great visual experience.<br />The diff\\"tier of suits and tech should fit right in, also continue the genre of films that Tom cruise has been making.<br />I think effort should be directed towards New ideas and other novels rather than sequels or for example same story \\"spider man\\"  use the many novels and take a chance!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Set arrived on time, perfect condition.<br />This is a great tv show, and I am so sorry they ever cancelled it.  Next best thing is having this box set so i can watch the show anytime i want.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|give some good advices to build your book<br />there are many others books about this topic<br />I advice read this first
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Just the right amount of time to play and enjoy I liked this game because it was not to hard but easy to remember should you want to stop incase you need to other errands.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was too funny... One review wrote that it reminder the reader of the movie Hitch and I can see it because this book is told from Drew's POV.  The thing is I can see the truth in his flawed theories, his constant preoccupation with thoughts of sex, and the hilarious way he screws things up.<br /><br />No cliffhanger here, it's all wrapped up tidy by the end.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Got it for my wife liked it a lot more when I was younger. It's good movie for kids though.
B005J2UM9S|2.0|The film itself and it's premise is a great idea!  Most of all, it's entertaining for the first 30 minutes because it makes fun of all those ghost hunter shows.  What happens next isn't too hard to guess and their is PLENTY of foreshadowing that does a great job at giving away many of the scares and mystery.  Really, there wasn't a whole lot of other ways to go about making a film like this.  Everything ran in the direction that it should have but the problem was the execution.  The film is creepy in many parts, but it's scares just aren't as effective as they could have been.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film, it's just not a very effective film.  Most horror fans will appreciate it but there are certainly better \\"footage\\" horror films out there.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book was good if you wanted to know words it was kinda useless for other things though. Some of the words were confusing but that's a dictionary it was good but long yet hard to remember
8184776217|3.0|I thought that everything about this book was fine except the ending.  I found myself checking to see if there were pages torn out of the book I was reading.  I didn't even really care that much about the whole love triangle but I found myself incredibly angry when she concludes it in ONE PAGE at the end.  There was no conclusion to any major theme in the entire series.  The book just goes \\"climax, climax, climax.....welp, I've run out of pages.  Oh btw, she chose Peeta. The end.\\"  I don't know if this was just poor writing or the editor's fault, but it was incredibly disappointing.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I find it is entertaining to a degree. My son is just happy collecting the coins. I would like to have better instructions. It is difficult to figure out all the nuances.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This is not what I expected. My original Kindle cord became worn so I decided to order another. Keep in mind the original cord was so long that I could have it plugged up while reading while lying on my bed or sitting at my desk reading. But with this cord I ordered its so short that I can only charge it because if I lifted it away from my night table it would unplug. I expected the same length cord. Next time they should advertise the length of the cord so customers are not fooled into thinking it will be as long as the Kindle cord. Very misleading.
B00005JKNC|3.0|I didn't really care or it. Not his best work. Worth watching at least once though. Give it a try.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I found it hard to put down. Nicholas Sparks writes with great descriptions and details. I was even scared of the ex-husband.  The fire of the grocery store made me feel as if  I was there with Sarah. I would recommend it my friends. Lovely romance with a little reality mixed in.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It keeps saying it has an error downloading it! Same with PvZ! No matter how many countless times I TRY TO GET IT! And it bought it for me! Goodbye waisted 7$
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Could not put this book down for long.  Had to read it. I had to finish it. The story line was compelling. I loved the honesty and the down to earth portrayal of a hero who &#34;had warts.&#34; I was extremely moved by this man's battles, both in his soul and on the battlefields of the world. I am a nurse at a VA hospital. This book will help me to  better serve my patients. I also appreciated the open and humble way this man shared his conversion to faith in Christ and his struggles with his demons.  I would enthusiastically and without reservation recommend this book to anyone who loves war stories or biographies.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|For everyone complaining about no 2D version, all you have to do is play it on a non-3D television and you will have 2D. If your television is 3D and you want 2D just push that little button on the remote that says \\"3D\\" and your movie will be magically transformed back into the second dimension.<br /><br />Was a decent movie, not sure I will watch it more than a few times.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Brilliant fun free game that will keep you entertained for hours and hours. Always something new to build, trucks buses buildings and can upgrade them all.
B00CATSONE|5.0|excellent book! Truly fascinating and opened my mind to new and different things. This has taught me to continue to dare to be different.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Addictive and fun. I felt like I stepped back in time. Although much more sophisticated technology. I would recommend  this Gama highly.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the pace if the book and the twists and turns that the characters faced. This book really helps you to understand Christian  and Ana. The ending is so romantic; it made me swoon!<br /><br />I didn't like Ana's inner goddess or dialogue, it was distracting from the story and didn't offer any new angles.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I loved all her books except this one, AND NO, it's not because she didn't end it the way I wanted it.  I watched and read and loved the way Sookie grew and changed and her adventures.  This book was the end of her story.  Instead of a bang she went out on a whimper.  It was almost like Charlaine Harris was just burnt out and wanted it to end already.  The plot was lame...the characters had no fizzle...they just seemed there on the pages, like former shells of themselves.  This whole series up to this book it a must read.  Thank you Mrs. Harris for the wild ride.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Great movie with great music!  Arrived quickly with no problems.  Great love story but it is a tear jerker. So have tissue ready.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|A fantastic release that shows what a remarkable band Mad Season were and what a great loss Layne Staley is to music
0895260131|1.0|As an academic I have read Mr. Spencers book in hopes that it would offer a new perspective on Islam. Maybe it is due to the fact that I have a PhD in Ancient History and Near Eastern Studies that I find that Mr. Spencer has created a lie. He attempts to bash Islam and Muslims in order to play off of general American fears. He eloquently paints a portrait of the \\"Muslim terrorist\\". This book is not worth reading if one is truly trying to understand the teachings of Islam.

159463176X|5.0|Story Description:<br /><br />Penguin Group Canada May 21, 2013 Hardcover ISBN: 978-0-690-06751-0<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini is one of the most widely read and beloved novelists in the world.<br /><br />His novels have sold more than 38 million copies worldwide.  Now, six years after A Thousand Splendid Suns debuted at #1, spending fourteen consecutive weeks at #1 and nearly a full year on the hardcover list, Hosseini returns with a book that is broader in scope and setting than anything he's ever written before.<br /><br />A multigenerational-family story revolving around brothers and sisters, it is an emotional, provocative, and unforgettable novel about how we love, how we take care of one another, and how the choices we make resonate through generations.  With profound wisdom, insight and compassion, Hosseini demonstrates once again his deeply felt understanding of the bonds that define us and shape our lives - and of what it means to be human.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />In 1952, Pari, 3-years-old and Abdullah, 10-years-old were told a story at bedtime about how divs and jinns and giants used to roam the earth.  A farmer named Baba Ayub lived in a village called Maidan Sabz and every day he toiled hard to feed and care for his family of 5 children: 3 sons and 2 daughters and his wife.  His favourite child was his 3-year-old, Quais.  Quais was a little boy with blue eyes and charmed anyone who met him while he worked his devlish laughter.  One day a div came to their village from the direction of the mountains and the earth shook with each of his footfalls.  The villagers dropped everything and ran.  Whichever home the din tapped his fingers on the roof of meant that family had to give up one of their children to him.  If they didn't decide by the following morning, then the din would take all the children in the house and return to his moutaintop home.  Baba Ayub was beside himself with grief on how to decide which of his children to give away in order to save the other four.  He finally wrote their 5 names on stones, deposited them into a bag, reached in and pulled out one stone.  It bore the name of his beloved Quais.  He cried, shook, and bellowed at the sadness and injustice, but the din took, Quais away to his mountaintop home never to be seen again.<br /><br />Father had never hit Abdullah before so when he did, tears of surprise came to his eyes.  They were walking across the desert from their village of Shadbagh to Kabul.  Abdullah had lost his mother 3 years ago while she was giving birth to Pari.  Now they had their stepmother, Parwana and Abdullah wished he could love her the same way he loved his mother.  We learn they are taking this trek across the desert so father can sell Pari to a childless couple who were wealthy.  The deal was brokered by his own brother.  Abdullah took this especially hard for Pari was the very essence of his soul.<br /><br />Parwana had a sad life too, she has a 1-year-old son, Iqbal, but her second baby, Omar had died of the cold winter before last.  He was only 2-weeks-old.  Parwana and Abdullah's father had barely named him.  He was one of three babies that brutal winter had taken in Shadbagh.  He knew Parwana loved her own children better than she loved Abdullah and Pari, but most parents loved their own children first, and he didn't blame her for that, as to her, Abdullah and Pari were another woman's leftovers.<br /><br />Father was getting tired of pulling the wagon across the desert sand so Abdullah took over for a while.  They were going to Kabul too, so father could work.  Uncle Nabi, who was Parwana's older brother, was a cook and a chauffeur in Kabul.  Once a month he drove from Kabul to visit them in Shadbagh, his arrival announced by the honks of the big blue car he drove.  It was on his last visit that Uncle Nabi told Father about the job.  The rich people he worked for were building an addition to their home - a small guesthouse in the backyard, complete with a bathroom, separate from the main building - and Uncle Nabi had suggested they hire father, who knew his way around a construction site.  He said the job would pay well and take a month to complete.<br /><br />Abdullah new baby Omar's death bothered him constantly.  If he'd had more money then he would have been able to buy the baby warmer clothing and keep the house heated.  He poured everything he had in him into every job he got as if this would help atone for his lack of being able to properly provide for his family.<br /><br />Pari, settles into her new family with the wealthy couple, Nila and her rather strange husband, Suleiman Wahdati.  Nila is a wild and provocative woman and Suleiman is quite introverted never having much to do with Pari.  Suleiman eventually suffers a stroke and Nila picks up Pari and escapes to France where her mother was born and leaves Nabi the chauffeur behind to care for him.<br /><br />There are other characters we meet in this story and each one is has a broken bond with someone.  It is a story of family and what families can do to each other and how those disasters can reverberate down through the generation to come.  And the Mountains Echoed gracefully unravels how tradition, culture, and sense of place affect the human heart, it celebrates the joys and boundaries of storytelling.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini is one of the most joyful and expansive writers around!  I'll be keeping this novel as part of my permanent collection.throom, separate from the main building - and Uncle Nabi had suggested they hire father, who knew his way around a construction site.

B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|Lets you remember the movie & escape the crazy world around you for a while & think just how bad things could be
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I was expecting a lot more from this movie, especially with all of the talent that was featured in it, but it started out so slow that I had to force myself to pay attention. I understand that making a movie is a hard thing to do, but they should have really went over the action sequences again before they released this. For this to be a movie about witches and their awesome power, it was just not that good or believable. And the love story really didn't even give itself a chance to develop enough for you to actually believe that they were truly in love with each other. The best thing about the movie was the fact that the main character's southern accent stayed true to the southern sound. That was what stood out the most to me, which is not saying much about the movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|You log on your account through kindle, you have to verify through text message, which cost me $3 because I don't have text. Then if you play a game that uses facebook almost everytime you switch between email, each game or web access, they see you as someone else using your account and you get locked out if you can't identify pictures of people you do not know because they are in your game.<br /><br />Back on facebook now, with this app it has a code generator which lets you in if you get locked out. After quitting for a few weeks and complaining, I haven't had to verify my account yet, it's been a week.<br /><br />Update - now do not seem to have a problem with verifying. I have tried all free apps for Facebook, all have there own problems, pick your poison.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I bought two of these based on the the previous reviews here. I don't know about how other people are using theirs, but I bought mine to use with my Zoom H4N digital recorder and my Canon XF100 professional camcorder via the XLR inputs on both. The mics worked but I had to practically eat them to get any sound to record, and that sound was so low it was almost inaudible even using professional monitor/mixing headphones during playback. I took my time reading through the manuals for my equipment and still no luck. The battery WAS inserted into the mic properly; there's a diagram on the battery housing.<br /><br />I'm returning for a refund tomorrow. I'll just have to rely on my Rode NTG-2 shotgun mic with a Rode Dead Cat windscreen, and my H4N with a Rode Dead Kitten windscreen for backup audio. One thing is for sure, though - these lav mics are NOT for use with professional level equipment.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I Love all of QT's movies & productions, but I wasn't sure he could pull this one off! I was wrong! Stellar cast & great plot make this a true QT flick! It's very long, so be sure you hve the time to devote... It won't disappoint!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is a summer read book and you need to start and finish in order to get it clear who is who.  A bit like Carnival tv series in some ways
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Much better than the default Samsung keyboard.  Absolutely love it!  Much easier to type on,  especially when coming from iPhone.
B004H2ZFPW|4.0|buy it for my friends so can't give too much review. the package is  good. the cd cover is beautiful.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! I have beaten all the others and this one is just as good! I love the bright colors!<br />Thanks for the new game!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't write reviews but had to give credit where credit is due. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so many times in one book. Witty, Charming, Amazing. As the only girl with an older an younger brother and a mother of four (that's right 4 boys) I can tell you that is was a delight to read something so spot on. Having a couple of Drews in my life wasn't easy but a welcome reminder down memory lane (As both of them have found their Kate's). Love the way Drew's character just flows through the pages. Emma Chase what can I say? Read it in less than a day, couldn't put it down. Keep up the great work and I'll be keeping an eye out for your next book and spreading the word.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This is the last Sookie Stackhouse and very sorry to see the end of the long story.  It was an easy read from beginning to end - some might not like the exit of certain characters but it makes sense that Sookie is ready to move forward to avoiding death threats and vampire politics
B000O76T9U|5.0|This a awesome steelbook, and this a good movie if you enjoy this type of movie. Steelbooks are the best to have.
0393342212|2.0|I found it contains a lot of fluff and very little in terms of solutions or prevention. Most of what I read I'm sure most parents already know. A lot is common sense, nothing truly new or out of the box. I would not recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway suffers is a great game to play is you always want to beat your level and get all the people to play with.

B00000J7JO|1.0|A lot of one star reviews of this album cite the terrible mastering....and while I am an audiophile and agree that the mix and loudness mastering of this record is absolute garbage, the music hidden underneath is equally and amazingly bad.  You can spit-shine and polish a turd, but it's still a turd.<br /><br />  The instrumentation is often good to pretty good...I think Flea is a good bassist.  What ruins this record and every record after this one is Anthony Kiedis's lyrics and vocal delivery.  I've heard people complain about his flat-ness in live shows.  I read a blog that had the poster flabbergasted at how off key Kiedis was live...as if he'd never known or heard that before.<br /><br />  When I hear Kiedis sing, it's like nails on a chalkboard.  The laughably awful lyrics only add to the pile of crap.  Around The World has to be one of the absolute worst songs I have ever heard...if I was Chinese, I'd be more offended.  As a music lover, I'm already offended.  Faith No More and Mike Patton did the funk/rock thing a thousand times better.  Listen to FNM from The Real Thing forward, then try to take TRHCP seriously.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I didn't think it was possible that it would be better than the first but Abrams delivered. An absolute must-see this summer.

B003D8KH9A|3.0|Although it covered the top of the pool, it did not cover all of the pool as shown on the cover.<br />The drawstring was easy to install, but did not fully secure the whole pool.
B0099114WO|5.0|Meryl Streep and her co star did a great job showing that people their age can still be stirred by romantic feelings.
B003YBUSMW|5.0|Upgraded to this wireless racing wheel from a wired one.  My husband likes this very much.  It does have a sense of a &#34;stop&#34; in the center of the wheel when turning, but he said that he got used to that quickly. The only thing that he misses about the old wheel is the bigger gearshift.  He says this shifter feels more &#34;toy-like&#34;.  All in all, a great purchase!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very helpful and clear. Like the large keys. The advanced functions keys are unique and helpful as well.  Overall, a very nice app.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great graphics,smooth combat style, real fluid. Love this installment of the series better than the rest. I have this on the IPhone but my kindle won't let me get free gems by watching ads unlike on my IPhone. Great game overall. :) add me &quot;capnteemo&quot;
B007TNS6JI|4.0|And why? Because shortly after this was released Gameloft took some sort of a big turning point and went after all the money they could get. Legit every game after this was nearly impossible to complete without spending some cash. Overall, this game isn't half as well done as number 4, yet it is still so much more fun not being lured into spending money every two seconds.<br /><br />Graphics: 3/5 ehh, I mean this came out a few years ago so yeah, PS2 was still popular back then. But for the effort they're actually okay.<br /><br />Plot: 2/5 there isn't a plot really. It's just going through level after level kind of like an angry birds game.<br /><br />Sound: 4/5 there's no voicing in this one but the sound effects are great<br /><br />Combat: 5/5 being how &quot;old&quot; this game is, I'd say it's a fairly awesome system. I actually like combat in this one much better than in the next one. There isn't blood squirting everywhere unrealistically, or stupid sounds every second.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 No it's not the greatest, if you want a smooth game that won't hassle you for money though, go with Dungeon Hunter 3 . Hope this helps!!
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I knew I'd like this. Had the vinyl and CD--wore them both out..Frank Lloyd Wright is one of my favorites.
B003QJME5G|5.0|I looked for a long time to find a fan controller that DIDN'T have just a blue display, as most lighted PC products tend to do, as my case has a black and red color scheme.  Once I saw this little beauty, I knew it was the one for me!  You can choose what color you want with a simple jumper setting, and does a spectacular job keeping the fans at a consistent RPM rate.  I use mine to control the radiator fans in my liquid cooling system, and it works wonderfully.  I'll definitely be using this controller in future builds!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked this book because it had a creative storyline, and it had a lot.of action and it had some great cliffhangers
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A rollicking, good spirited adventure over the 20th century--pokes fun at politics, religion, and serious people!  A very good read.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Like every &quot;free&quot; game you will purchase from Gameloft... it's basically impossible to get anywhere without spending money. And I mean MONEY . The game itself is incredibly awesome and overall a good game. But Gameloft needs to see if they want good ratings they need to make real free games that don't force you to spend cash every turn.<br /><br />Graphics: 5/5 I have to hand it to ya, Gameloft by far does the best job with details (as in the Iron man game) and it looks awesome on the kindle fire .<br /><br />Plot: 4/5 It follows a basic story line, although a very animated one, where an extremely talented hero (you) sets out to rescue a kingdom from disaster. The only thing I didn't like was all the blood flying around and demons and stuff. I mean, it's cool but there's a lot of violence. Fair warning to parents.<br /><br />Sound 5/5 The music is pretty well done and voicing is superb.<br /><br />Combat: 3/5 .. okay, at first it was really fun, but after awhile it's actually really simple.<br /> Unless you spend dollars and dollars on potions and repairs, it's basically just tapping the screen over and over. The bosses can be challenging though, once you've finished a few hours of grinding down small fry.<br /><br />Overall: Yes, this is a pretty awesome and fun game. But I ended up deleting it just because I didn't want to waste so much time on something I could beat for a few bucks. So beware, be prepared for either hours of combat OR spending some cash. Hope this helps.

0385349947|3.0|interesting account of woman and how we made leaps and bounds 20 years ago by all going to college and work etc but we havent done much since. my favorite 'awareness' was when she spoke about how when a guy gets complimented or acknowledged for something, he owns it and says thanks and owns responsibility for his success whereas chicks tend to qualify it by giving credit away. i recently lost weight and when someone tells me i look good i say, i have been going to a nutritonisit-like its her that did the work to lose weight! now i say, &#34;i have been working on it-thanks for noticing!&#34;

B00338QENI|4.0|Everyone needs to know about the information in this book.  After you reading this book you will not go to the doctor again without wanting to know what they do with your blood samples or the other lab test they have you take.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Very nice movie.  Different pacing from the Lord of the Rings - more fun and more details.  Visually rich and as always with PJ, every detail taken care of.  Very seamless - takes you back into Middle Earth.  If you have ADHD, as too many people have today, or have no patience with fantasy, then you may feel that this is too long.  On the other hand, if you loved LOTR, you'll love this return trip to Middle Earth - and look forward to the next segments!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Quite a story, quite a life.  It really is amazing what he was able to accomplish in his life and how he did it.  He was definitely a complex guy and I don't know how I would relate to his management style but he got a lot done.  A fascinating and well-written tome.
B009EEOQIU|5.0|A typical love story portrayed by a movie is often predictable and rarely unique. Ever After gladly broke the mold. Performances by Barrymore, Hutson, and Scott are flawless (with the exception of a few accent slip-ups). Barrymore plays an non-traditional role as the female lead -- she is independent, intelligent, strong -- never needing a man to come to her rescue. Absolutely enjoyable!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I usually devour Dan Brown's books, and this book was no exception.<br /><br />The truth is, I really enjoy the historical facts and anecdotes he throws around every now and again, and the way he explains the origins of modern words and other frivolous information, and since The Lost Symbol had a lot of this I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />He also knows how to write a shocking twist, so when you think you have it all figured out you realize you got it all wrong and the characters aren't all you thought they were.<br /><br />People criticize Dan Brown for overusing the same basic plot over and over in each book, and although I agree that this is true, I say that this hasn't made Brown's books dull at all, and other famous authors tend to do the same thing too in a few of their books (e.g. Ken Follett) and yet I've never read or heard people criticizing Follet over that.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is a truly entertaining read, so try it if you enjoy getting sucked in by a book's plot.

B002YCVX5S|5.0|Great Quentin Tarantino movie. As in most of his movies expect some gore and blood and bad language although the plot with turns and twists was very good.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really made me think about how far I would let my judgements about right and wrong be swayed for the protection of my own children.  This book also requires the reader to evaluate the importance of your marriage compared to the freedom of your child.  In the end of the book once a feeling of resolve occurs only then is the true twist unveiled.
B000FC13Y0|3.0|I hate to say it, but this was a rare case where I found the movie to be better than the book. Perhaps that's because I saw the movie first? There are parts where they are very different, and I found myself to have a preference for the movie's way of putting things.

The time apart when you can't think of anything but the Loved One. It's all here.<br /><br />But it's more than that. Eleanor & Park is the story of two don't-fit-in teens find each other and fall hard for each other. Eleanor has a miserable home life and a miserable school life, and Park is there to save her.

B0026OR1UK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but like many books of this type it seemed like the information could have been conveyed in many fewer words. On the plus side, though, it's a really useful book for both teachers and learners.
125000098X|5.0|It you enjoy Jeffrey Archer, &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34; is a good read.  I have loved his books since I read &#34;Kane and Able&#34; and can recommend this new series of his.  I have to say I prefer the single books with a finish so I can move on to the next.  I haven't ever cared for the drop at the end of each book in a series and this is no exception.  It is not my favorite format, but still very entertaining.  That being said, I hope he will go back to his one book stories when this series is finished.

B00COHAUD4|3.0|Mama is a 2013 supernatural/horror film directed by Andres Muschietti.  Starring Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Mama tells the story of two young sisters left alone to fend for themselves in a small cabin in the woods.  They're found there five years later having apparently survived on only cherries and the love of a violent ghost.  Plucked and transplanted into the home of their father's twin brother, Mama follows.<br /><br />I had a blast watching this film for the first eighty minutes.  It offers a solid nod to the classic ghost story and does so effectively.  I jumped in my seat a few times and I haven't had that happen in a LONG time.  It made for a fun experience and for that reason alone, I recommend at least renting the film - the bulk of it is worth a ride.<br /><br />But the last twenty minutes didn't do it for me.  Dramatic and a bit cheesy, it just felt awkward and that made me sad.  The ghost started getting more screen time and the longer she flew around, the more attention was given to her facial expressions, movements.  CGI started taking over at that point and it was too much.  Not that I'd have ever been fooled into thinking they cast a real ghost for the part, but it was overwhelmingly fake and difficult to parry aside.  This, for me, rapidly depleted the suspense from Mama.  And it had such momentum!<br /><br />The director seemed to take some inspirations from Japanese ghost horror and when it worked, he went yard.  But it seemed like he tried to build UP from that recipe and, in my amateur opinion, he'd have done well to keep it simple.  Everything from the black spreads on the walls with moths popping out to the hair flowing across the floors were genuinely creepy, but after that, I couldn't hang on.  Still, as I said before, most of Mama is done really well and I'm looking forward to Muschietti's future work - he's clearly talented.<br /><br />As for the performance nuts and bolts of the movie, the children were cast well, Coster-Waldau was a win, and Jessica Chastain saved the day.  I think the scene movement here was clunky from scene-to-scene, rushed, and these folks did a wonderful job keeping everything glued together.  Especially Chastain.  She's worth watching here and I'll be following her career because of it.  Good stuff.<br /><br />But again, I'd recommend renting this before committing to owning it.  Guillermo del Toro is the executive producer for the film, not the director, and I think the fact is notable.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br />- t-Waldau was a win, and Jessica Chastain saved the day.

B000FBFMFW|5.0|Robin Hobb is one of those few great writers who make you feel like a part of every story.. She creates a broad and sweeping landscape full of characters you actually get to know! From the spoiled princeling bereft of his mother, and conspiring to be king to the lowest maid she gives every single one a personality and emotions all their own. I am truly amazed by these books!
0307460444|5.0|My wife bakes cupcakes - not all the time thankfully, but has made some for my co-workers, and they have been a huge hit. It is hard to believe that there could be so many variations of a simple little cupcake. A must for parents who wish to treat their children with an occasional treat.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I liked a couple of the characters and the movie was visually appealing, HOWEVER, I found this to be a complete snoozefest.  Ready to stop watching.  I did not believe the chemistry between halle berry and tom hanks.  I didn't mind the various sub-plots and transitions between the present, future, and past. I didn't mind the weird language \\"tru tru\\".  There was a point to this movie, but it could've easily been made with one plot and less characters.  One of the worst movies.

B003L77G6K|4.0|One of the reasons for the popularity of The Big Bang Theory, is the program's ability to constantly evolve and introduce new elements and dynamics, while retaining the same quirky sense of humor.  The fourth season (2010-11, episodes #64 through 87) features a number of changes, and sees the development of a number of key relationships.<br /><br />Sheldon (Emmy winner Jim Parsons) and Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), become an unconventional couple, complete with a signed agreement, while Leonard (Johnny Galecki) begins torrid affair with Raj's sister Priya (Aarti Mann).  Love blooms for Howard (Simon Helberg) and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch), as the couple become engaged near the end of the season.  Penny (Kaley Cuoco), Bernadette, and Amy become very tight, partially due to them uniting against Priya.  While Raj (Kunar Nayyal) has difficulty coming to terms with his sister's romance, and briefly has feelings for Bernadette.<br /><br />Overall, there's quite a lot happening, and the various new wrinkles generally make for some lively viewing, as Amy, Priya, and Bernadette, assume larger roles.  Having a very special chemistry, it seems a bit odd for Penny and Leonard not to be on the best of terms, as Leonard's romance with Priya, does create some significant waves, particularly concerning Leonard's dealings with Raj, Sheldon, and Penny.<br /><br />The Amy/Sheldon relationship finds its footing, becoming less mechanical and more human, as the initially cold Amy, has her female parts stimulated, heightening her interest in sex.  Based on his past history, Howard finding a woman willing to accept him and his substantial baggage, is quite remarkable, as Melissa Rauch proves to be a most talented comedic actress, as things quickly head toward matrimony, and Bernadette becomes an integral character.<br /><br />\\"The Boyfriend Complexity\\" features guest star Keith Carradine, as Penny's father Wyatt.  There's some of the old magic between Penny and Leonard on display, as he pretends to be her boyfriend.  It's a fun dysfunctional time for all, when the entire gang heads to a conference in Big Sur, in \\"The Love Car Displacement\\", which features an appearance by Bernadette's old boyfriend (Rick Fox), and more instances of musical beds.  Priya's strong influence on Leonard, is clearly evident as the season closes, putting a different vibe into the Big Band universe, heading into season five.<br /><br />The changing dynamics in season four, opens new doors, as BBT continues to evolve.  It remains a quirky program beloved by millions, but while mostly light and fun, there are bumps along the way, when things do not flow as smoothly.<br /><br />The  two disc Bluray edition may not be as pristine as you would expect, and might not be worth the upgrade over the standard DVD.  The various bonus features however,  do look fabulous in high definition.  Of particular interest is the Bluray exclusive, \\"The Big Bang Theory Live\\", an insightful and energetic featurette, showing the taping of an episode before a live audience.e pretends to be her boyfriend.

B00CRW2066|4.0|The National's one of those bands where you listen to their new album and all the songs sound the same until you've listened to it enough times to uncover the subtleties of the songs. Trouble Will Find Me is no different. For the songs that were circulating post-High Violet, a wonderful studio version of &#34;I Need My Girl&#34; made it onto the album whereas &#34;Rylan&#34; did not. What we did get are gems such as opener &#34;I Should Live In Salt&#34;, &#34;Humiliation&#34;, and the beautiful album-ending &#34;Hard To Find&#34;. Thankfully, this album doesn't have High Violet's first-half string of sleepers (&#34;Sorrow&#34;, &#34;Anyone's Ghost&#34;, &#34;Little Faith&#34;) but it also lacks stand-outs such as &#34;Terrible Love&#34;, &#34;Bloodbuzz, Ohio&#34;, or &#34;England&#34;.<br /><br />What works, however, is a consistency that permeates all the songs, no matter how deep in the sorrow they do get. The trademark National parts are all there: repetition of lines, references to water and alcohol, wonderful guest appearances, and timing/drumming changes that only they can do. Still, there's a few steps into uncharted territory, especially on songs that begin to rely less on guitar or even piano, such as the album's best song, &#34;Humiliation&#34;. All said, it's most definitely worth exploring The National if you've been a fan up until this point, and there are enough accessible songs for the masses that it would also be a good start for getting someone into The National (although I recommend going back a ways to either Alligator or Boxer for that).

B008JFUO0Y|4.0|It's Back to \\"THE CABIN\\" in \\"THE WOODS\\" kids go to a cabin, read the Book of the Dead, then things get Necrodiculous(tm)!  I've been to many a Evil Dead midnight show, while a remake of the 1981 Cult Classic seems blasphemous,  even the first Evil Dead was a remake of Raimi's 1979 Super 8 film \\"WITHIN THE WOODS\\" ... Evil Dead 2 was remake & sequel rolled into one. But, excluding Bruce Campbell as Ash the S-Mart slayer seems appalling, but if Bruce won't be in, this removing the character completely is the right move.  I'm optimistically cautious about the darker direction of the trailers looks INTENSE & Campbell has given his approval calling the new film \\"Fabulous\\" saying that although there will be references to the originals but it is a \\"whole new ball game.\\" Good news Creator Sam Raimi  is producing this one (with Bruce and Rob) but it is scripted/directed by Fede Alvarez. Although the promised darker violence will earn the project an R rating, for now.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I was surprised that the Hobbit which is only a small book would require three movies to present but I'll be very happy to watch them all as they come out.  The story moves along at a swift pace and the special effects are great.  I think that Martin Freeman is an excellent choice for Bilbo Baggins and I found myself admiring him for leaving the life he loves behind to help perfect strangers regain their home.  As with the Rings trilogy, I think I will be watching this movie and the others in this trilogy many times over the coming years.

B007REV4YI|4.0|One buys a Bond movie for the excitement factor and Miss Dench and Mr. Craig do turn in fine performances as does Mr. Bardem as the villain of the piece.  If one is pretty much on the edge of the seat most of the time and marveling at the imagination of the chase scenes, then the movie is pretty much a success and thus I think Skyfall is one.  I think I will enjoy watching this movie a number of times.<br /><br />Why just 4 stars?  Because an action movie, in my view, will never deserve 5 stars because a 5-star movie is one that tells us something important about ourselves and that is not a Bond movie priority.  I would give 5 stars to a movie like To Kill a Mockingbird.
B00BDSRER0|3.0|Liked 4 songs for sure.  Considering that most CDs have only one or two hits, I guess this was a good buy.  Bonus disk not bad either.  Hate the tri-fold cardboard packaging.

0451219597|5.0|Ken Follet may have written historical fiction which he's more proud of, but Pillars of the Earth and the Fall of Giants (which I think are formulaic and repetitive) can NEVER compete with Eye of the Needle and Jackdaws!  Follett is a master thriller.  No one makes you care so much about the characters in danger or feel the anxiety and distress of their plight.  After reading Jackdaws, I've sworn off thrillers until I've recovered from this one.  Don't worry.  The good guys win, but at such a price!  A fabulous read, and, in my opinion, Ken Follett at this best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and interesting . The horses are so life like a d are sure to love you as much as you love them. Take care of them by feeding; grooming and cleaning up after them. It is so enjoyable to train your horses and compete for coins.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Overall I thought the filing of the movie was on the dark side.  Some scenes were difficult to follow because it was so dark.  I enjoyed all the action.  However, I didn't like the ending.  I enjoyed Judy playing the part of M.  I will missed her.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Solid read and a very interesting topic. Made me think a lot about business and interacting with people and making daily decisions.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Old-school adventuring! The game took about 5 hours to complete, I'm guessing. For someone like me that plays games in small bits and pieces, that's ideal--long enough for you to sink your teeth into, but not so long you lose interest in playing before you can finish.<br /><br />You don't just try to clear boards of tiles, advancing from level to level. Instead, it's about good old fashioned adventuring. Your character fights monsters, collects items, unlocks doors and treasure chests, gaining experience and leveling up. You also gather resources and upgrade weapons, skills, armor and rooms in your headquarters. You play by making matches; keys to unlock, weapons to attack and so on.<br /><br />It's very fast paced; you're frenetically trying to make matches, trying to make the right kinds of matches, trying to keep an eye on what situation your character is in and deciding when to use the items you've gathered.<br /><br />A few minor qualms:<br />- There's no way to know which enemies are armored and which are not. You need different strategies for each.<br />- It would be nice to have sound cues for the situation your character runs into--door, chest, monster, boss monster. This would make it easier to focus on making matches without shifting eyes between piece board and adventurer area<br />- I know it's meant to be \\"old school\\" style, and I'm all in favor of that, but I don't think it would hurt anything to have slightly better graphics. I'm not talking about 3D constantly animated super-high-resolution characters, but it would be nice to be able to be able to tell what a creature is supposed to be just by looking at it<br />- More variety in monsters would be nice, and should be extremely easy to add.<br /><br />Still, those are very minor concerns. This is great for casual gameplay... each run takes about 0.5 to 3 minutes, so it's perfect for those moments when you have nothing else to do. It does require your complete attention in those moments, however.<br /><br />Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable game, one I would recommend to others.><br />Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable game, one I would recommend to others.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|This is the first album of new material for Deep Purple in eight years. I really really love when classic artists make new albums for a variety of reasons. First, there is very little money in it, so they are doing it for the love of the art. Second, I get bored of back catalogs easy and want to hear new music, and finally, I want to hear what kind of frame of mind a band is in. By what I've read, the motivation to make the album came from the chief songwriters, singer Gillian and bassist Glover, the chief songwriters.<br /><br />Concerning the frame of mind, it seems to me that this album deals a whole lot with time, and in my opinion, mortality. Which, when you're in a band with a 45-year history, I can understand. Ian Gillian, who I believe is a very underrated lyricist, touches on a variety of other topics here as well though including the female figure (\\"Bodyline\\"), overwhelming love and devotion in booty call form (\\"Above and beyond\\") and horror (\\"Vincent Price\\"). Probably my favorite track is \\"Blood from a stone\\". Either a paean to the abandonment of the 60's or a hippie chick she devil.<br /><br />There is really a strong prog feel to this album as well. And that is a plus if you like prog (like I do) and a minus if not. \\"Above and beyond\\" is just spewing late 70's Ambrosia. The somewhat excessive three minute intro to \\"Uncommon man\\" is somewhat Floydish. The intro to \\"Apres Vous\\" really, really sounds like mid-70s Kansas. I'm not having too much doubt about what keyboardist Don Airey has been listening to in the last few years, but it's all good. \\"Apres Vous\\" does contain a little of the DP guitar/keyboard dual now powered by Airey and long- time guitarist Steve Morse. Morse's beautiful guitar work on \\"All the time in the world\\" is just brilliant (like most of Steve's guitar work), but coupled with the Ian's beautiful but fascitious lyric, really special:<br /><br />\\"No one ever held me back, no one ever put me in chains\\"<br />\\"No one ever saw me racing ahead, no one had to tug on my reins\\"<br />\\"As everybody knows, I may be slow, but I never quit\\"<br />\\"Sometimes mid day I sit and think, sometimes I just sit\\"<br />\\"Don't worry ... relax .. there's no hurry\\"<br />\\"Here we are ... we have all the time in the world\\"<br /><br />But, don't worry, there's a lot of serious Purple here as well. \\"Out of hand\\" sports a serious Perfect Strangers vibe, \\"Hell to pay\\" combines a rock anthem chorus with a verse vibe not unlike Fireball's \\"No one came\\". I'm sure this one will get much concert time on their upcoming tour. One of my favorite tracks \\"Bodyline\\" is very cool and very funky. Not Come Taste the Band funky, but it does swing.<br /><br />Of course, I have to say something about Ian Paice, the only original member of Deep Purple left. Besides being a great, great drummer, I'm damn impressed with his longevity, considering in most of these bands, the drummer is the first part that generally wears out.<br /><br />I would like to see DP's support of this album, but apparently, they aren't into playing the little venues that the US of A supports and are playing large festivals throughout Europe all year.<br /><br />If you're a DP fanatic, you'll like it, so just go get it. It's a worthy addition to the catalog.<br /><br />You can read more of my reviews and write your own reviews on epinionatedmusic.com!

B007HO392S|4.0|I was at a party a couple of years ago when the subject of reality shows / talent contests came up. A particularly musically righteous individual stated unequivocally that nothing worthwhile ever came out of the show American Idol. I brought up Carrie Underwood, which my musical protagonist basically said that she proves her point. I passed on her statement as youthful ignorance and moved over to the next topic. Although before \\"Blown Away\\", I had not really listened to too much Underwood, what I had heard was solid, professional and strong. None of that prepared me for this though. Blown away was exactly what I was.    Carrie really epitomizes the term \\"new country\\", i.e. a little country and a lot of pop/rock. The single \\"Good Girl\\" really fits that description to a tee. It's a very catchy hard pop tune that the only thing that could possibly classify it as country is Carrie's voice and some of the harmonies. The hard rock guitar solo really makes this one hit hard. Should be a big top 40 hit. But, the real feel of the album kicks in with the next track \\"Blown Away\\". This one kicks just about as hard and is even less country. But it is a beautiful sad (but upbeat) song dealing with abuse and revenge. Unbelievable, Carrie is even able to kick this up even one more notch with the song \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\", which is an all-time epic tune that I won't soon forget. It is one of the most powerful and majestic dark songs that I have ever heard. It takes adultery to a whole other level beyond petty vandalism.    \\"See you again\\" changes the flavor a bit, but the quality doesn't dip one iota. It is a beautiful uplifting song about loved ones lost:    \\"I will see you again, this is not where it ends\\"  \\"I will carry you with me\\"  \\"Till I see you again\\"    The album does have more traditional country on it as well including the charming tunes \\"Good in Goodbye\\" and \\"Do you think about me\\", the sentimental \\"Thank God for Hometowns\\" and country pop \\"Nobody ever told you\\".    I didn't like the whole album however. \\"Forever changed\\" just kind of bored me and \\"One way ticket\\", an upbeat calypso style tune was just horribly horribly out of place on this album. Of course, since most folks don't listen to albums as a whole anymore, it might not matter. Moving back to the positive side, \\"Cupid's got a shotgun\\" is a s*** kicking roller coaster romp of great lyrics and instrumental virtuosity with a great punch line. I don't have to check the credits to know that is is axe shredder Brad Paisley on this one. The album closes out with \\"Wine after whiskey\\" and the beautiful \\"Who are you\\". \\"Wine\\" which comparing among new country ballads is more than top notch and in fact, could be the best song on a lesser album.    It would be very possible that \\"Blown Away\\" could be the apex of Carrie Underwood's career.    You can read more of my reviews and write your own reviews on epinionatedmusic.com!

B0049U4INC|5.0|I enjoyed Enchantment. It is a quick read, lots of good lists of what to do to get ahead and work with people. But, it's a mistake to read this as a \\"breakthrough\\" book - it's not. Kawasaki has done a good job of research and organizing some good tips that we can all learn from, like how to make a pitch, the importance of our words, and how to think about the choices we offer clients.<br /><br />Valuable books don't always have to break the mold, or unearth the secret to weight loss (again), they can simply be a helpful guide, written in a light, easy-to-read style. That's this one.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|My one problem with this game is that it loads very slow on the kindle fire. Its a fun game, but just trying to get the app to work is a pain.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Truly enjoyable. I couldn't wait to get to the end, which of course left so many questions hanging in the air.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Don't waste your money on this one. The only good song on this album is \\"Get Lucky\\". The rest? Some of the most generic, flavorless, and yes, boring music I've heard in some time. Treat this album like a collection of cast-offs, b-sides. Do yourself a favor and listen to it for free (from your providers of choice). It is astonishing to read the wave of glowing reviews for this album. I think they've deceived themselves, hoping for something better than what they've actually been presented with. The group has been building quite a reputation, and deservedly so. The originality on display from their last work (\\"Tron Legacy\\") should have had people amped with excitement. Unfortunately, this is album is a massive disappointment. Maybe some outside producers can remix the hell out of it and turn the music into something resembling the driving emotion and power fans have come to associate them with. Until then, this album as it is, is for completists only.

B0095P3ULC|5.0|I enjoyed Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The special effects, sound effects and stunts were quite good! Look, lets face it, the plot is not going to be nominated for Oscar consideration. However, this is not what one expects or even wants from a Sci-Fi movie. Add the obligatory &#34;Transformer Babe&#34; into the mix and you have solid entertainment for the Sci-Fi addicted guy. Even the Sci-Fi addicted gal will be well entertained, but may or may not appreciate the the obligatory &#34;Transformer Babe&#34;. All things considered, I was well entertained for several hours. However, I will admit that I have been a sucker for celluloid robots since Star Wars.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this game. I appreciate the beautiful relaxing music.  Love how the levels increasingly challenge you.  I do pretty well, however like that you have a help option if needed.  Often I have meant to play for a little while, but this game is so much fun, the time flies, a few minutes turns into a few hours.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Hands down, the best VNC/RDP client for the Android.  Easy to configure, connect, and operate a remote session!  Very stable and well designed!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A life-changing account of NDE experience and its connection to God and its meaning for living<br /><br />today.  Will read it over again.
B003VANOFY|5.0|It's a great wireless headset, but it does bug out sometimes... very rarely. With the USB cable connected, sometimes it will cut the sound out for a split second randomly. Wirelessly, it's flawless.
B006M4F67A|5.0|There are a lot of different puzzles to solve and you are shown the amount of time you took.giving the opportunity to try for better times to complete the puzzle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is an outstanding social platform for seeing human artistry and ingenuity.  Beautiful, art sometimes whimsical.  I am usually amazed everytimes I use the Pinterest platform.

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Lincoln captures the final four months of the life of President Lincoln in a tangible and believable script with fabulous performances by both major and minor characters. The focus is on the political process of the time. Sally Field is Mary Lincoln. I like Abraham Lincoln more having seen him through the brilliant acting of Daniel Day- Lewis.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The end was totally unexpected, if you are not shure you want to get this book, get it. I now have  to buy the 3rd book
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|My only complaint is how long this game takes to load when you open it.  And I mean EVERY time you open it, it seems to take forever to open.  Otherwise it is a truly awesome and fun game.  It has great graphics and you can keep playing even if you get destroyed.  I have it on my Kindle Fire.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|this is a classic book you can't go wrong with treasure island i just get lost in this book so much i can read it again and again
B00CHILW64|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time! Emotional and compelling - I'd definitely recommend it!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Loved it in the theater and great to have it at home.  Plan on purchasing the next two in the trilogy.
0823003590|5.0|Very good instruction in drawing the head in 3/4 view. Do wish there were some other poses though, and I could have done without the creepy critters. Still, the artwork alone is worth the cost.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|This is another beautiful failure of a game by gameloft. Lack of beta testing has left it totally unbalanced and riddled with character destroying bugs.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend spending money on in app purchases because several times I've had my Crystal balance wiped to zero for no reason, or had my character reset to level 1 (at least 6 times) losing things like extra passive skill slots that I purchased with crystals. Customer service never responded. I've seen other bugs that make your character stats set to zero in multiplayer, or even weirdly change the class and gender of your character.<br /><br />The gameplay was never balanced... it is impossible to progress until you figure out to buy weapons from the store - no equipment that drops in game is ever useful to you past about level 5 - the stuff you can craft is all obsolete by the time you can actually craft it. Luckily you don't have to spend crystals to buy new weapons, the ones sold for gold are more than enough to remove all difficulty from levels, which in itself is just another problem.<br /><br />Multiplayer servers are a great idea, but you lose connections too often. This is a problem complained about on forums about this game everywhere. I haven't been able to connect to a PvP match in weeks, nor does it seem like the social functions work regularly, as the 'join friends game' and 'invite friend' option seem to work more than once in a blue moon.<br /><br />Skills in the game come too slowly and most of them are uninteresting, or not useful.  Most are duplicated by equipment anyways. The later skills come after waaaaay too much grinding. You can easily beat the game by level 40 but you're not even half way up the skill tree by that point. If you have the patience to play the game to the end and beat elite mode, there is nothing left to do but grind slowly to the level cap... No new rare gear to find, and the later skills are just moderately better versions of earlier skills.<br /><br />A disappointing realization of what could have been just as good of a game as Diablo, but falls far, far short of a game made 20 years ago.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I was a kid when this happened, so it was great to get the inside history of such an event. Great movie. Love, love, loved it!
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book has you \\"trying to figure it out\\" from the beginning. It's a page turner! I would definitely recommend it along with her other books.
1609611543|4.0|Although some of the book left me vaguely puzzled as to how to proceed, the information contained was very helpful.  But the Wheat Belly Cookbook answered any further questions I had, and helped me know how to proceed with eliminating wheat from my diet.  I cannot believe the difference in how well I feel already.
B004I744AS|4.0|I make it a point to build my vocabulary by learning a new word every day. I used to go through a dictionary alphabetically; however, this app makes learning new words fun via the word of the day as well as word games that a person can customize to the difficulty level best suited to them. The daily feature articles are also a great way to learn about a variety of topics one would not typically find within popular media outlets. You can also customize your page to include only your items of interest in a variety of languages. Overall, this is one of the most useful apps I have downloaded and would appeal to most ages. I highly recommend this app for students, lovers of language, those learning foreign languages, and anyone that is interested in broadening their knowledge. Very resourceful and well done without unnecessary permissions.
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|This is a stupid movie and a total waste of over 3 hours of your time. There is no 'hidden' meaning. It should come with a warning that says,&#34;Haha- get ready to spend the rest of your night trying to figure out the plot to a movie that doesn't have one&#34;. Suckers!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a great series, wish there was more to read. Gave it five stars loved it, I was unsure at first but then it captivated me. OMG!!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's a great game . Worth downloading . This is probably one of the best games i have played on my kindle fire . I hope they come out with a second version and<br />  hope to see more games from this company..
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great battles between men,women,creatures,and other forces. Graphic,tense, and suspense filled. So great to be taken to places,meet people, and feel like I was walking among all of them. Looking forward to the next book on kindle.
B00BAVJW8Y|1.0|I don't want to be overly critical, but if this really was made using service design, then damn.... you might want to consider some other career...  Of course I know service design works, but this book dosent. An example of a good written book using the theory &#34;prescribed&#34;,  to write the book: &#34;Running Lean&#34;. If you want obvious rambling and shallow descriptions of service design tools, then read it.!
B008B4KVS8|5.0|I consider that this bluray version of this classic film is an excellent version with very good image quality.<br />The sound in the spanish track could be better.... I have to raise very much the volume to understand the dialogs.<br />But in fact, I love it.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Good read. I was longing for more, I wish she gave me more at the end. The chapters about Obinze's stay in london was a snoozefest.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|the go-to source for flimic (is that a word?) renditions of the Bard. With Titus, & now The Tempest, she brings imagination & a powerful visual style that stamps the work indelibly on your mind's eye.<br /><br />The only thing I could ask for would be - more! A worthwhile add to your collection.
0307596885|5.0|I expect the best from Munro. This is not a review but a statment of my confidence in her art. She can not disappoint the reader. She and William Trevor are the outstanding short story writers of our time.<br />They are classics already.
B000JML90Y|5.0|It really makes you think about where we really came from and how society and our environment impact us on a daily basis over time!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I mostly liked this book and the journey to find herself. Enjoyed reading of her adventures and the people she met along the way  Did not enjoy the language (MF, ) or some disturbing memories ( horse, bones) but I guess  it is necessary to tell it like she experienced it.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|visually splendid & the complete work. I first saw this in an aging dowager of a theatre in Seattle. The Grand Dame was pretty run down but you could see what a beauty she had been in better days.<br /><br />This Shakespearean epic was the right film to see there, complete with intermission, a trip back to a different era in the movie experience.<br /><br />I'd say this is Branaugh's masterwork - marred only by the presence of American actors whose mastery of iambic pentameter is weak at best. Fortunately, their screen time is limited.<br /><br />A must-have for fans of the Bard.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Enjoyed this a lot. Great thinking game! Looking forward to new levels. Got it free, but worth the .99 cents if you have to buy it.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I love it, but then you probably shouldn't listen to me. I have all the soundtracks from the movies, and I find the song choices to be very unique and great to listen to, especially in the car.
B009R659L8|5.0|I haven't read Mary Higgins Clark in a while. After reading this one, I decided I need to go back and read a few more of her more recent books. I love her twist endings. And the fact that her books are not explicit. Not too violent, not too much sex, but suspenseful. Great read! I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|This is great! I use it for my line of work and I use the daily messages for my psychic site. For those that posted negative comments, you clearly do not possess the psychic gift. That is why the cards don't work for you. You are all trying to be something your not. Leave the tarot reading up to those that do possess the &quot;gift&quot;.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved gone girl and loved sharp objects! Gillian Flynn is a great author with a dark side to her. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a book you can't put down!
B0010X8NF0|5.0|The Dajeeling Limited is my favourite Wes Anderson film. Beautifully shot, written and performed, the film centers around three dysfunctional brothers and their joint quest to re-connect with themselves and each other on a trans-india trip. Andersons usual themes of heartbreak and despair are present, as too the subtle, hilarious humour. The film illustrates how funny our journey as flawed, surface dwelling humans with good intentions can be to the observer. Such a great, great film.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is fantastic. It is like the best shop therapy without the credit card bill at the end. I love pulling ideas up on my boards when I am ready to do a project .
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is awesome full of fun things to do u can battle and build your own kingdom I would get it if I were u
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Its another fast-runner. As always in Clancys novels the techno is good, the characters less so. However I like Clancy's style and read the books for adrenaline and relaxation. A good mix!
6301247485|4.0|I received the tape quickly, but when I put it in my VCR I noticed it had not be rewound to the beginning, which I had to do. (Reason for 4 stars, otherwise it would be 5 stars.)  I was apprehensive at this point, but the tape was in good shape and I did watch the whole movie.  I had seen the latest version in the movies but I wanted to refresh my memory of this one and I liked Robert Redford's version better.  Thanks.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I absolutely loved Thirteen Reasons Why;I was up all night reading it. It was one hell of a book! Five stars!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|A stellar, sweeping, multi-narrative, spanning over many times and pitting basic, old, entrenched ideas and philosophies against counterforces which create a conflict for the ages.  Most entertaining as well as enlightening.  Bravo.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Harry Hole is a crazy Norwegian cop gone astray on drugs and alcohol. This book brings us to the end of his days - or does it? After a long stay in the East, he returns to Oslo to help his ex-girlfriend and love for life and her son who has been involved in a drug-related killing. Harry battles drug barons, ex-colleagues, friends and foes - all in a desperate fight to save his loves son. Nesbø is a fine writer of Crime noir, and Harry is a dark specimen as good as any. I doubt we've seen the last of any of them.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Have to get this one.  The culmination of so many great movies.  This is a must for any action movie viewer.
B008KRBTU0|5.0|It's beautiful and of good printing quality. Suitable for kids and teens. It would be even better if the cards are thicker.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Love this movie it is so super cute. It has a great message to it also.  We have watched it in 3D and it was great.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|I love it.  Some of the best music ever. Much better than the movie soundtrack. I wish the movie had been with better music and unrecognized faces than big movie names and less than sterling voices.
B00C9G22R2|2.0|Sorry to say but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Good actors but most of the movie was people talking.  Very little Martial Arts action.  No wonder the dvd was so inexpensive.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Bought this for my &#34;boys&#34; who are huge Quentin Tarantino fans. They loved the movie. No wonder it won so many awards.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This story written from a Man's perspective is really funny and steamy at the same time.  This is difficult to accomplish.  Drew is witty, hot, kind, and a total douche all at once.  I enjoyed the manly pieces of wisdom he spied throughout his relationship with Kate.  I was entertained the entire time.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|He did a really good job on this CD! I wish there were more songs highlighting his deep voice. Most of the songs are really good and we enjoy listening all the time! Looking forward to more releases from Mr. McCreery!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America is a great movie.  Good plot and lots of action.  One of the best of the Marvel movie series.  I got the dvd because I liked the movie so much.
B0047WJ11G|1.0|A lot of pretentious twaddle. Remind me again why I'm supposed to care about what's taking place onscreen when it's a dream within a dream within a dream? The musical score's ominous blaring brass (bummm BUUUUUUUMMMMM!) kept telling me how incredibly important everything was, but all I kept wanting to do was hit the EJECT button on this masturbatory fantasy. The only explanations for the general enthusiasm for this movie that I can find are the star power of Leonardo DiCaprio and a boatload of glitzy special effects.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|A fabulously entertaining finale to an engaging series. Again I have no doubt that Jordan would have been proud that Sanderson honoured his characters and story so well.
B00005JN4H|4.0|Very enjoyable and fun to watch. I also liked Queen Latifah and Jimmy  Fallon. Very enjoble and a good story over all.
0061726834|1.0|I was very disappointed that I never received my package! My tracking ID said my package was here, but I never got it!!  I was told FedEx is not a very trusted because many packages were never delivered. I was very anxious to read this but, sadly I never got it. I tried re-ordering it. Hopefully this time I get my package!! :/
B00CL50KDY|5.0|This movie is one to consider..  Its a Romeo and Juliet remake with a twist...  Excellent music and very comical.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|I have not read the book. Having said that, this film is beautiful, different and a great story. I will make the time to read the book knowing there will be differences.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I have liked Oliver and Company since I was a little girl, and I love it now. It is my favorite Disney movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Once you start, you won't want to put it down. Only complaint is that it's short. Completed it in about 2 hours, but definitely worth the price!
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|Really good for a free game. Great graphics and a much better play than I expected when I downloaded the game.
B0063GORYU|4.0|My husband enjoys the game more than I do, but I enjoy it too. It is a challenging game for all ages.
B00CFITJKW|3.0|On mine at least I can't finish the May day mission because I land then there's know where to go. I go till the map says 0m and nothing happens. over all good game
B00BHU261S|5.0|We rented this movie for our monthly Sunday movie night.  This is a real winner.  I recall seeing Hitchcock movies years ago an this is a good followup.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Tough workout for me. And that is not a bad thing. I get most of my workouts by power walking. This video has been challenging.Three weeks in at about 3 times a week and i am starting to feel my body change. And i am just on level one.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This film, which is a follow-up to The Avengers is an action packed filled ride. With comebacks from favorites like Don Cheadle, Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow, they make this film so much fun along with newcomers Rebecca Hall, Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />So we now see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) going through a whole line of problems. Sure, he flew up into a wormhole in the Avengers to save New York. But now he can't really sleep at some times in the movie. And the villain in this film is the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and now Tony may need to come back and stop this guy to save the day again. In other news, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is trying to avoid the clutches of the Extremis project that was formed by her former lover Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who is trying to get her back. And Rhodey (Don Cheadle) is now dubbed the Iron Patriot. SOLID story!!!<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this film. But when I was watching this movie, I found that Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was a fraud and that Pearce's character was the actual Mandarin (SPOILER ALERT)!!! I found that this was the same type of story twist as Batman Begins and it's villain Ra's al Ghul with Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson portraying two versions of the character.<br /><br />Despite this twist, the movie was still a rocking great time with a villain in a twist, great action sequences, an excellent story and above all, more Iron Man suits!!! I highly recommend tbis movie!!!
0307887448|1.0|The phenomenal number of positive ratings makes me suspicious that the reviews were somehow gamed - perhaps by paying one of the services that promises ratings for a price. The novel is burdened by an overwhelming amount of exposition that violates a cardinal rule of good storytelling - show, don't tell. To make matters worse the exposition is adolescent in tone and weak in that it fails to advance the story. Further, the book desperately needs professional editing. The lack of editing is distracting and the storyline is predictable. Based on the many positive reviews, I tried to finish the book, but gave up two-thirds of the way through it. It's just too flawed to waste any more time with it.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|very good a real good sunday evening movie or great for kids too I liked this very much a new twist on an old idea
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I doubt there are many people who would need this on a day-to-day basis, but son-of-a-gun, when you need to figure out a problem with fractions without the risk of rounding errors that converting to decimals offer, then this baby is for you!<br /><br />It even gives the answer with the most-reduced fraction!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Different book but I kind of liked it would like to see movie and see how it's played out on the screen...
B001HN6EF4|4.0|Perfect for poolside or even IN the pool. Summer was approaching and the kids love poolside and in pool playing.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I liked this it was a little hard to keep track of the mulible story lines! but I knew it might be but it wasn't that hard and i enjoyed this movie very much!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|We let our 7 year old play this because she loves MLP.  Next thing I know there are over $100 worth of charges in our bank account.  You can't do hardly anything without paying money and they made it way to easy for little fingers to buy whatever they want.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have read a number of the Reacher novels but it was good to see where it all started and it was interesting to see him become distracted to the female lead, in the books I have read so far he doesn't really attach to them, so seeing him do so gave the ending a little more gravity.
1421527618|4.0|This one started off a bit clunky - poor translation choices and awkward dialogue that doesn't pass the ear test - but around 50 pages in things kick in and those previous annoyances no longer matter.  Overall a great tale of war and time-bending with very interesting and well imagined sci-fi elements particularly the nature of the enemy and the explanation behind the time glitches.
B009O07NDY|5.0|What a beautiful soundtrack!  I've almost worn it out listening to it in the car whenever I get in.  Howard Shore has another winner with this soundtrack!
B000000HRP|5.0|You will learn that Phl Collins is actually a great drummer, not just a pop vocalist.  The rest of the band does well with the interestng songs. There are aspects of some of Frank Zappa's finest work in this CD.
B0086213XW|5.0|The film is beautiful, its landscapes, décor, colour...    There's a shower scene at a swimming pool that juxtaposes the young bodies of the main characters with those of older women.  The scene has been described as \\"ugly,\\" perhaps deemed so because it was frank and not a male gaze POV.  The younger women daintily shower; the older women truly wash themselves.  The younger women gab about wanting to escape the humdrum of their lives, to which an older woman interjects: \\"New things get old.\\"  The younger women turn and gaze at the older women.  We are left to imagine their thoughts.  Watching the scene was uncomfortable, but it was a refreshing display of female nudity.    A recently sober character talks about the inevitability of their relapse.  We weigh the inevitability of the main character's adultery.  The character later says, \\"Life has a gap in it. It just does. You don't go crazy trying to fill it like some lunatic,\\" which is funny and strains belief given the scene.  Maybe that's heavy-handed, but the two quotations given seem to be the only saving grace of this film for reviewers who gave it 1 star, so maybe spelling things out is needed.    The scenes set at the Video killed the Radio Star (new supersedes old) ride were more telling than the quotations.  In one scene, the young woman takes this ride alone.  We can assume this is a ride that she has taken with her husband a long time ago.  In the other scene, she takes her neighbour there and they share a few minutes of exhilaration in the darkness, flashing lights and loud music.  The music stops and the lights come on: the ride is ended.  They, and we, are surprised and disoriented.  We know a ride always ends, yet we are surprised, resentful or seek another (which will also end).    The film is what its trailer, score, synopsis and rating suggest.  You have been warned.  Strange dialogue?  It fits the film.  Boring?  Well, you see the minutiae of a couple's life.  Boredom is the setting for discontent.

193700788X|5.0|The ending to Dead Ever After was an excellent way to wrap up the series.  It seems that a lot of the 1 star reviewers are upset because of plot inconsistencies and Sookie not ending up with Eric.  I have read the entire series and the ending makes sense and jives with what I understand the purpose of Sookie's life journey to be about.  She wanted to have a life where she is appreciated for her gift as a telepath and have a life that holds up her ideals and dreams.  This happens in the book.  She gets to stay in Bon Temps and ends up with a man who loves her for her.  He isn't trying to change her and she will not end up in harm's way or used because of him.  Eric was the choice, if Sookie wanted a life of excitement and an empty unfulfilled relationship.  Sam makes perfect sense.  The comments I have read where they think that it was the author's way to end the book quickly are not paying attention to the entire series.  The makings of a good solid relationship between Sookie and Sam has been there all throughout the series.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other comments regarding the series on HBO and the written book series by Charlaine Harris.  The books depict a Sookie that is much different than the HBO series.  As a result of that, Eric and Sookie on the HBO series looks more appealing than in the books.  Pam even said it best in the ending pages of Dead Ever After--Eric's actions were not him being nice to Sookie, but his way of protecting what he views as his property.  This was the way Eric viewed Sookie.  I do not doubt that Eric cared for Sookie and on some level loved her, but she was a means to an end and when he thought she betrayed him by chosing to save Same she had little significance to his plans.  A man who truly loves someone is able to let them go, not try to prevent future happiness for their beloved by what he did with Sam and the agreement for the bail money.  Eric showed himself to be possessive and controlling.  An attitude of if I can't have Sookie than no one can mentality.<br /><br />The way this booked played out was a good ending for the series.  Sookie chose her heart and not some fantastic dream of ending up with an egotistical and oftentimes manipulative vampire that would have been fine with her being a woman on the side hidden from life and away from all those she loved.  My advice for those that are not happy with the ending would be to read the series again.  This ending is there throughout the series.  I would also encourage you to ask yourself why you would want Sookie with a man that would mistreat her and toss her aside as Eric did time after time.  He could have fought for her in Dead Ever After.  He didn't because he only cares about himself.  I believe the 200 year marriage contract is the author's way of saying that you reap what you sow.  Eric did not deserve Sookie.  Sookie deserves to be happy and whether that is with Sam or by herself, she is happy with that.  That to me is the type of women worth looking up to.  Sookie is not some illogical and stupid woman that goes after a man and a life that is not following her truest heart.

B000I186FW|5.0|Great movie, Hugo Weaving's acting is mesmerizing and you don't even see one facial expression.  His dialog is perfectly executed.
193700788X|3.0|It just didn't feel like it belonged with the rest of the Sookie books. I had to keep forcing myself to finish it. Wasn't as well written as the others.  Kept asking myself: &#34;Was this really written by Charlaine Harris?&#34;

B0011N1WE8|5.0|DVD came as described (like new). It is entertaining and sweet, and it promotes self-acceptance despite adversity. It is an aesthetic and clean movie as well. Was a gift for a teen girl I know and she greatly enjoys it.
B005V20JKI|1.0|I got SO excited when I found out this game was finally free, only to realize the new update requires an in-app purchase to play the rest of the game. This was really disappointing. However, I should've known there was a catch to making the game free.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|It's a sad story that gets sadder and sadder. And when you think it can't possibly be anymore depressing it rips your heart out and proves you wrong. Loved the musical since high school. Was incredibly excited for this and was blown away in the theaters. I'm not an emotional person especially with movies but I teared up several time and finally cried at the end. Looking forward to watching it at home so I can bawl my eyes out. Talented cast. \\"I dreamed a dream\\" gets me everytime.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I'm reading the entire series and it's good.  Not as good as Twilight or Hunger Games, but it was a good read.

B0076DELIG|5.0|I like Bosch novels and this one did not disappoint me.  It is a real page turner, tough to put down..
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book Two in the Fifty Shades series is still a basic read for some frivolous entertainment.  I'm not sure if there was less explicit material here or if the first book was so overloaded, it didn't stand out in the second round.  Either way, the characters developed a bit more, which was welcomed.  At the end of the day, though, as stated---just a frivolous read for a little fun.  At least the end of this one tends to leave Book Three a bit more anticipated than in the previous transition.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Movie had a powerful message, but definitely had its share of nudity, drug usage, and foul language.  It was slow at times, but seemed to rally toward the end.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Very fun game. The visuals and music are impressive, on top of addicting gameplay. More musical tracks are the only addition I'd make.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Time is the best he has ever done.  To sing and write a CD/album of this quality at this time in his life is great.  Each song is written special for times in his life and they relate to just about a TIME in everyone's life.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very good book!!! When I read the first 3 words I was hooked!  Very action packed, I couldn't put it down!!!!  A must read!  I hope they make this into a movie!
B00CW665VI|5.0|What a fantastic book!! It was one of those books that literally grabbed you and did not let go until you finished the last line! I had to year myself away to perform my every day tasks and literally run back so I can read some more. I found myself actually in conversation with Drew. Whether I was  laughing out loud at his witty crazy remarks or yelling at him calling him names or swooning over him and his deliciousness I was there with him during. The. Entire. Book. It was one hell of a ride let me tell you. Not only did I love drew but I loved the type of person kate is and how she dosent put up with anyone's BS. The secondary characters were also just awesome and added extra flavor to the story. This was a refreshing story to read and I find I can quite start a new book yet because my head is still lingering with this one... When a book does that to you you know it was a hell of a book!!!

193700788X|1.0|I usually love the Sookie Stackhouse series and It's an need to have type of book for me.  The last one got me a little mad but this one was a total wasted of my time and money.  Let's stard with the issue about Sookie's love life.  First she was in love with Bill, then she has some flings with Alcide and Quinn but when the character started a relationship with Eric was like a perfect match and she loved him sooo much.  Then, the last book got out and it dismised Eric so fast that he just show up like in two pages.  She spent the last 5 or 6 books fighting for his love and in this one was like well it did'nt work out, ok. Bye.  REALLY!!!!  And to make matters worse inmediatly she started a new relationship that is supposed to be great for the beggining?  Give me a break!!!.  It's a really bad choice.<br />Then, the plot about amanda's father is just a little weird and it's not something that you expect especially if you're a fan.  That was a little far out.  It's like the author didn't have new ideas and try to reach some weird stuff.  Totally bad plot. Not a good one for Charlaine Harris.

B00BG4UWPC|4.0|Phoenix has long held the banner for accessible indie rock.  With tight instrumentation and ungodly pop hooks, the band has grown from indie obscurity to mainstream popularity in the last few years.  Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix is still regularly being featured on movie soundtracks and commercials, primarily because its songs are so solid and seemingly free from any 2009 musical fads that have long been tossed aside.  With Bankrupt!, the band has managed to push the boundaries of what constitutes a \\"Phoenix album.\\"  Adding heavy layers of synths and electronic drums, Bankrupt! will be challenging and jarring to longtime Phoenix fans.  But underneath all those new dressings remains the core of what makes Phoenix such a popular and entertaining band.<br /><br />With an Asian-inspired, synth-powered lead line, the opening moments of Bankrupt! immediately set the tone of the album.  First single, \\"Entertainment,\\" begins as a powerful, rousing pop song in the band's traditional style.  It is not until the chorus, where the band adds layers of string synths and electronic drum pounding, that Phoenix shows all of their cards.  Try to pick out the analog instruments in the background - it's tough.  The tight guitars and succinct drums are held over from previous records, but the added instrumentation makes the band feel larger than ever (and Phoenix was never really a group to be lacking presence).<br /><br />The band floats effortlessly between songs that sound like more traditional Phoenix and others that draw from more ancillary genres.  The chorus of \\"S.O.S. in Bel Air\\" has a dreamy, new wave vibe that is both hypnotic and catchy.  \\"Trying to be Cool\\" could have been a cast-off from one of the Apples in Stereo's more recent records, especially in the bridge, where Thomas Mars is essentially interchangeable with Robert Schneider.  Title track, \\"Bankrupt!\\" is a mostly-instrumental skipper that doesn't really get interesting until Mars finally opens his mouth just after the 4:30 mark.  The mixture of acoustic guitar and synth keys is very cool, but getting to that point can prove trying.<br /><br />Fittingly, a song named after a Wal-Mart cologne would be the album's weakest track.  \\"Drakkar Noir\\" has a lot of good things going for it, but it lacks the melodic hook that the rest of the album bears so effortlessly.  It's annoying arpeggiator slows down and continues into \\"Chloroform,\\" whose synth bass line gives it an immediate edge over its predecessor.  Here, Mars confesses, \\"My love, my love, my love, my love is cruel,\\" while describing the more careless aspects of his personality.<br /><br />One surprising feature of Bankrupt! is its relatively upbeat tempo throughout.  Penultimate track, \\"Bourgeois,\\" is the album's only real ballad.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why it stands out so much.  Everything about this song is amazing; from its beautiful chorus, to the brilliant lyrical work (\\"You bet your life on a cruise ship/bar tending crucial lies\\"), to its mostly subdued instrumentation.  The song serves as a great change of pace and leads perfectly into the album's final track, \\"Oblique City,\\" which is probably the best 80s pop song of the last five years!<br /><br />With Bankrupt!,  Phoenix has established themselves as a band unafraid of  innovating and changing in the face of absolute mainstream popularity.  It would have be easy for them to make Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix Pt. 2, sit back, and collect royalties.  And honestly, if that were to happen, I can't imagine too many people being upset over it.  But instead, the band has given its listeners a rich, new album that challenges preconceived notions and delivers a wholly unique experience.  Whether its songs will be used and reused commercially for the next four years remains to be seen.  But on a personal level, it will be a while before this one leaves the rotation.:30 mark.

B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|In the age of instant information, a band can rise and fall in no time at all.  Yesterday's hype can and does turn into today's afterthought more often than not.  Vampire Weekend is one of those bands who many had heard of before actually hearing, due to the plethora of acclaim and excitement that they generated before ever releasing their debut album.  But unlike most blog bands, Vampire Weekend actually made something to stay excited about.  Their self-titled debut and follow-up, Contra, are two incredibly solid albums that have helped to define the last 5 years of indie rock.  Their latest, Modern Vampires of the City, makes its mark by re-energizing the band's sound and imbuing it with a new sense of depth that may have been missing in the past.<br /><br />Lyrically, Vampire Weekend has always been hit or miss.  With pop culture references flowing in and out of personal accounts, things can get confusing and lose their meaning.  But on Modern Vampires, Ezra Koenig has refined his writing process and produced some of the band's most poignant lyrics to date.  On \\"Step,\\" he wrestles with age and commitment, singing, \\"I'm older now/I'm ready for the house,\\" before admitting, \\"I can't do it alone.\\"  Set to a beautiful melody, these words are the core of one of the album's most simple yet enchanting tracks.  On \\"Unbelievers\\" he tackles being a secular person in a largely religious world, but makes it into a song about love and affirmation.  This added depth makes Vampire Weekend's music more than just a catchy diversion.  This is art.<br /><br />Making infectious tunes has always been one of the band's strongest suits.  On Modern Vampires, they continue to impress in this respect.  Whether they're channeling Wham! on \\"Diane Young\\" or soundtracking the closing credits to a Wes Anderson film (\\"Worship You\\"), the band reassures the listener of their ability to craft some catchy music.  The former song is the band at their most experimental; utilizing cheesy synths and some ridiculous pitch-shifting vocals.  It works though, largely due to the band's confidence in themselves and their ability to keep tongues out of cheeks.  \\"Finger Back\\" is another standout track in the vein of Contra's \\"Cousins.\\"  Here, Ezra sings, \\"Break your finger back, snap!/ Oww/ Oww/ Oww!\\"  It's a fun song.<br /><br />Of course, as the band demonstrated on Contra, not all songs need to top 120 bpm to be good. Modern Vampires has several songs that slow the pace down significantly.  \\"Hanna Hunt\\" softly meanders through its first few minutes before exploding in a distorted, thrilling final chorus, where Koenig screams, \\"If I can't trust you/ then dammit, Hanna/ there's no future/ there's no answer.\\"  It's one of the more effective moments on the album, and it lingers.  Later, the weirdly composed \\"Hudson,\\" has the opposite effect.  It's creepy instrumentation and dark lyrics prove how musically diverse this band can be, but its placement on the album is unnecessary and really ruins the flow of Modern Vampires' final minutes.<br /><br />Vampire Weekend has always had \\"a sound,\\" but what that consists of has consistently expanded from the group's beginning.  It's as if they exist around their sound, rather than within it  Modern Vampires continues the band's streak of experimentation and expansion.  In doing so, Vampire Weekend has made what is undoubtedly their most exciting album yet.

B0067EKYS6|3.0|I watched this movie in 2D and in 3D.  First, I saw it at the Warren Theater in Norman.  The Warren is a beautiful theater in Art Deco style, which added great enjoyment to this film.  The screen used stunning color and I was hooked immediately with the film.  DiCaprio was excellent as Gatsby.<br /><br />The second time I watched it in 3D at a Carmike Cinema.  It was if I watching a totally different version.  The glasses gave it a grey caste to the film, losing all the lush color of the other theater.  Disappointing in contrast.  So skip the 3 D, you definitely won't miss it.
B000HF0ISC|4.0|What I liked about the video was: It put a face on all the characters who could only be described in the book. It also offered a visual description of &#34;Hells Kitchen&#34; andlife therein. Best of all was the videos emphasis on the incredibly strong bonding of the four boys, both as youths and then as young adults. That bonding was what the story was all about.<br /><br />What I had a problem with was. There were several discrepancies with scenes as shown on the video as compared to the same scene as read from the book.<br /><br />All and all, I thought the DVD was extremely powerful because it brought out the real storyline which was not the abuse the boy's suffered but the incredibly strong bond beteen them which gave them the strength to endure and in the long term to extract revenge although at at a great sacrafice by them all. The acting by all was teriffic.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It is such a good game, the price doesn't matter at all. It is like Black  Ops 2&trade; but still not a clone. And for children (which might not happen) there is a Gore option to turn off the blood.
B00CS65JS2|2.0|Be weary of hype.  At its best, it creates the right amount of excitement for an album, but at its worst, it will leave you feeling bewildered and confused.  Has there been a more hyped album in the last half decade than Random Access Memories?  Probably not.  Is it justifiable?  Somewhat.  Anytime an artist as influential as Daft Punk releases new music, there's going to be some hype.  But having now reached critical mass as a group, it seems like the hype associated with Random Access Memories has taken on a life of its own.  And that can lead to some mixed reactions from fans and newcomers alike.  With Random Access Memories, the French duo has created an album that most people would not have expected.<br /><br />True to form, Daft Punk remains at the top of their game when it comes to sheer production value.  Every song on RAM is masterfully produced.  But nothing here is revolutionary or even exciting.  The album's first track, \\"Give Life Back to Music,\\" does anything but.  It's a mildly catchy, vocoderized Bee Gees throwaway, that is so devoid of life, that one wonders if the title and lyrics were written ironically.  Like most songs on RAM, it comes off as elevator music for robots.<br /><br />The first sign of life on Random Access Memories comes in the form of \\"Giorgio by Moroder - 8 minutes into the track.  Here, some powerful drums and guitar-like synths finally distract from the monotony of an arpeggio that has been running for far too long. It sounds great, but getting there can be a bit tedious.  And then there's \\"Within.\\"  Let's not discuss this one in depth.<br /><br />The only song with any lasting appeal on the album is \\"Instant Crush\\" with Julian Casablancas.  The song is catchy as hell, has an amazing chorus, a decent guitar solo, and is sung perfectly by the Strokes front man (even through the vocoder).  Of all the songs on RAM, this is the one that I keep coming back to.  That's not to say that there aren't other good songs on the album.  \\"Doing it Right\\" is pretty good, and both songs that feature vocals by Pharrell are fairly decent pop songs.  The producer/singer has never really been a very talented lyricist, and that shows here, but the songs are still worth a listen or two.  Oddly enough, \\"Lose Yourself to Dance\\" is a much better song than than the album's first single, \\"Get Lucky.\\"<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about Random Access Memories is that for every song that's remotely good, there's a \\"Touch\\" waiting just around the corner.  The song begins with some cool, creepy atmospheric sounds, but quickly devolves into the worst disco song ever made.  Ever.  Paul Williams sings like Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, and without any of the typical Daft Punk vocal tricks added on top of him, it just sounds awful.<br /><br />Therein lies my biggest complaint with RAM.  Few of the songs from the album stand out in any sort of meaningful way, and the ones that do, usually stand out for being bad.  With the exception of a couple of tracks, there won't be much here that will keep even the most dedicated fan coming back months from now.  Thankfully, Random Access Memories is pure mash-up fodder, which leaves me hope that someone can take these songs and give life back to the music.  But as is, this is an album filled with dance music for people who like sitting on couches.  It's not very exciting.  It's not very good.

The high quality of this remastered show should be a lesson for similar attempts by other productions.<br />The writing(mostly) holds up fine, and it shows how far ahead they were back then. Definitely a must have for any fan of science fiction and classic TV in general.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|Good but violent.  British, during the time when Kings had too much power.  It was interesting though and I wanted to see it through.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the best books i have ever read it is a very suspenseful book with a shocking ending and i cant wait to read the next book
1455526959|4.0|I like the Harry Bosch books but this one seemed a bit of a letdown.  Good but not the best of this series.

0345803493|3.0|This book arrived before promised and in new condition as promised.  It was more of the same as Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|What can I say it is Andrea Bocelli, a wonderful DVD tribute to his one night concert in Central Park, all Bocelli fans should not pass this DVD up.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Great movie love it I watched over and over again is was so good cool love story i love the end so sweet cute guys very funny movie to songs are good the little boy in it is so cute and funny one of the best gay movies ever loved it I love the actors in this movie great ending
B009PNQUXO|2.0|UM this wasn't the best it took a while for it to let me watch my videos.plus it kept freezing so it took me like 5 minutes to watch a 3 minute video<br /><br />Wouldn't suggest
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is addictive as well as enjoyable.  Easy to work with once you get to recognizing the designs on the tiles.  Highly recommend it.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|non stop action, great cast, should not be missed, I do not think this film got major showing around the country, too bad it is a wonderful action packed film.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|What a great movie. It has all the elements you could want romance, a bit of action & suspense & some twist and turns. Everyone did a great job no one over or underplayed their part. And I loved the twist at the end very touching.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|When you spend over 300 dollars you'd better be blown away. And we were.<br /><br />wow… what detail! incredible!<br /><br />The manual is gigantic and it is intimidating but wow wow wow…  it's worth it. My 9 year old and I did this together ( he did 98 percent of the work!!!) .<br /><br />This shouldn't be your first lego by any means but if you've worked up to the bigger ones and you're ready for the monster, go for it! It's amazingly well done.<br /><br />summary: expensive, but excellent.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|Brilliant book. Couldn't put it down. Practical, empowering and well written. Recommended for people who are stuck, or leaders whose organisations are stuck
B00008RH3L|5.0|My favorite film of all time, too bad it never got a major release, a lot of folks missed one of the best films the Coen brothers ever made, they wrote it while they were working on &#34;Barton Fink&#34; because they had writers block, &#34;Barton Fink&#34; was one of the worst films I have ever seen, I urge anyone who has not seen &#34;Millers Crossing&#34; to get it as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|This movie accurately represents the bands and hijinxs of the times! Musicians actually placed instruments and the story line is hilarious!
147674355X|5.0|I've read all of Colleen Hoover's books, Slammed and Point of Retreat, and I gotta tell you, Hopeless did not disappoint.  This book was funny, gripping, made you cry, and just when you thought you had things figured out, she throws you a left curve that totally blindsides you. I LOVED this book. Sky and Holder remind you of your first love and the way you felt. I don't know how Ms Hoover does it, but this is another great read!  The only bad thing, I need to wait until this summer to get the second installment to this book! Don't pass this one up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is about time for the 0.7.0 update I love this game. I create a boat load of kewl things
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. It is so fun. I hope you enjoy the app. I love it. If you buy this app buy &quot;pocket inv editor&quot;.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|This series was highly recommended to me as a lover of historical fiction. I will say that the history and little known aspects of the war were very well done. I hated all of the characters. Except maybe Lloyd. There seemed to be an expected need to fill by the author of a ridiculous balance between the perils and horrors of war and the fact that every character must have sex or think about sex or look lustfully at every person around them. I would be reading a fairly interesting passage about some high tension situation in the middle of which the character would start day dreaming about feeling up someone they knew and i would literally roll my eyes. Undoubtedly many people enjoy that but it hurt annoyed me.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Boring  -- lacking of the seat grabbing suspense.  The finish was truly &#34;cliché&#34; lacking originality. Hard to believe it was an academy selected. Go figure!
B00A0HQ7H8|3.0|Pretty much see the title; it's not a terrible album, but it's one I'll just put on in the background. All the songs kind of blur in to one for me.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|good storyline with puzzles that you had to think about.  worth the small charge.<br />left things wide open for a sequel that I hope I can play soon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The entire season is full of eventful happenings.  The final episode left me speechless.  I am looking forward to next season.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|So far this product is showing me more promise than delivery.  The first pictures I took are great and I can revisit them with ease.  However, any attempt at further photos seems to show the picture in thumbnail form only until the next pix it taken and then neither can be revisited.  I tried to send an inquiry for help but got no response.
1603427244|4.0|The book itself is pretty good and detailed enough for even beginners to follow, but it did arrive a bit bent around the edges. Not the author's fault, obviously.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I`'ve been playing for over two weeks and waited to give a review until I had a feel for the game. Five stars for ease of use and hours of play!

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is cool.  It looks good, plays good, and lots of cool upgrades and enemies all packed<br />into a game that lasts only 5 or so minutes each time you play.  I like it.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. I enjoyed all of the twists and turns of the book. It made the plot exciting!
B00CW665VI|4.0|Love this short...it's all in the male character point of view. Refreshing ....I like the story...some times it could be a little drawn out but cute and funny. I really liked it and wouldn't mind reading other books by this author...
B000BJS4TO|5.0|John Williams does a masterful job of weaving Japanese melodies into a lush masterwork. Listening to it I can relive the story without pictures.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|The cd lives up to the single &#34;lightning Bolt&#34; which he performed on both Letterman and Leno. There could be several<br />hit singles on this debut disc.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|I was driving around listening to \\"Revolvovolver\\" the other day in my Lincoln Navigator, and then, when I stopped for refreshments at the Wawa, a snatch of death metal came over the radio when I turned my MP3 off. (Yeah, I have Beatless on MP3 ... don't be hatin'.) It occurred to me ... THESE GUYS INVENTED DEATH METAL!!!<br /><br />From the gruesome, guttural growl of George \\"Dark Horse of Satan\\" Harrison at the beginning, the absolutely tragic and horrifying story of Eleanor Rigby and a sick, perverted priest who ... does things to bodies ('The Lonesome Death of Eleanor Rigby'), to the terrifyingly gleeful song of the apocalypse, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (the 'yellow' in the song refers to yellowcake uranium; the Earth has become so irradiated, the only place left fit for human life is under the sea (Homer Simpson was right, as it turns out)) ... it's all there. A murderous doctor who injects his patients with mind-altering drugs ('Dr. Robert'), a tale of a jealous lover who plans to kill his ex ('For No One'), violent drug-fueled premonitions of death ('She Said') (which I'm told is dedicated to Jane Fonda) and two more songs by G. Harrison (both about death). 'I'm Only Sleeping' is about ...  the sleep of death!! 'Got To Get You into My Life is a genuine love/pop song, but they just threw that on to fool the censors. It's crap; it's the worst song The Beatless ever did. Ignore it. It's all there; it's all death, death, death. And more death (metal).<br /><br />And to top it all off, the final track, 'I Spit On Your Grave', is based on the Tibetan Book of... THE DEAD!!!!<br /><br />With some of the most gruesome black & white cover art imaginable (four corpses rising out of the ground) (hey, this was shocking in 1966) (where do you think G. Romero got the idea for his (BLACK & WHITE) movie (about CORPSES RISING OUT OF THE GROUND)?), \\"Revoler\\" is a true revolution of sound. While it would be over twenty years before you would hear death metal on mainstream FM radio, TheBeatless broke down the door. And for that, we are all grateful.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Reading the reviews confirmed one thing: If it weren't for the poor cord connection, these headphones would be incredible!  The fact that they were only $13...I figured I'd try them out.  I've had them for 3 weeks now.  I run 3x a week.  Like all of the other positive reviews, these things are incredible.  I'm amazed by their sound quality.  They are extremely light, and they stay in one place on my head virtually the entire run.  I've never had to fumble with them, or even worry about them during a run!  I've treated them like I'm carrying a raw egg on a spoon...so I haven't destroyed them yet by the dreaded &#34;accidental tug of death.&#34;  If you are willing to take care of them, the $13 risk is an absolute no-brainer with these!!!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Amazing story and intense drama which is all the better to watch because of the historical and real life experience. Wow.

1572814136|5.0|I purchased these several months ago along with the book \\"Seventy Eight Degrees of Wisdom.\\"  I am a novice, not an expert.  However, here is my opinion.  The book gives lengthy but helpful classical background on all symbolism on each of these cards.  Nothing is on these cards is for aesthetics; everything means something.  That is an education in itself. I took notes on each card that I will somehow compile into a reference I can refer to when reading cards.<br /><br />These cards, I believe, were created with rich symbolism that once understood, can easily apply to a client.  It gives each card numerous possibilities. Readings therefore involve much more than your intuition, psychic powers or whatever. (Although intuition, a mental health background and psychic powers certainly would not hurt.)  The symbolism clearly goes much further than the picture on the card.  I assume a reader knowledgeable about the symbolism  could be more confident and helpful to the client. Reading about the meanings behind the symbolism is an education in the roots of Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Wicca and probably more.  Many of the more \\"artsy\\" and \\"trendy\\" decks out there may have lost much of the richness that tarot readings were intended to give.  I never ever realized the breadth of knowledge Tarot covers.  This may be why this deck has withstood the test of time.  Have fun!

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|You need to get this app it is amazing<br />If you like iron man so that you can enjoy the game as much as I did
B005NFVZTM|1.0|Self-important, paint-by-numbers movie that someone picked (or invented) the lamest group of X-men, while creating derpy versions of established characters.<br />Making super serious, canon-hamstrung comic book movies is getting pretty dull at this point.<br />Skip this one.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|The movie is good and I was curious as to how the 3D conversion would work.  My Samsung 3D HDTV has a 2D to 3D converter and I must admit it is often right on.  But when it is wrong it destroys the illusion.  John Carter looks a lot like they let THEIR converter do the majority of the work and then touch up areas that needed it.  Problem is they left some areas of some scenes 2D which stands out like a sore thumb.  To make a conversion work, there has to be a consistency.  So buy it if you enjoy the fiction of Tarzan's creator Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Or you want some new experience of 3D it certainly is here.  If only it was ALL THERE.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Wildly improbable, but so well done! This book was recommended by a friend and I enjoyed reading it. There were many 'smiley' moments, when enjoying the ridiculous.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a great game and all but it's not as good as Survivalcraft. It also needs a slight update. Take my word for it, get Survivalcraft.

B001FB4VZS|3.0|Smallville: The Eighth Season was daring because it introduced the super-villain, Doomsday. I wasn't expecting that at all, since in the comics (as any true Superman fan knows), Doomsday \\"killed\\" Superman towards the end of the Superman comic book series (but later we're told, in the comics, that Superman was in a \\"coma\\" and later awakens from the \\"coma\\", so he really wasn't killed). Also, in the comics, Doomsday was never completely human; he was an experiment created by a Kryptonian scientist to be the ultimate being/destroyer/survivor. It's understandable, to some degree, why the writers/producers introduced Doomsday in this season; I'm guessing it's because they decided to play and have fun with the idea of Doomsday (aka Davis Bloome) being human and an EMT/paramedic who helps people and is unknowingly infected with the bug/virus that transforms him into Doomsday, since they ran out of ideas on who should take Lex Luthor's place as the main villain in this season 8.<br />What was disappointing is that towards the end of this season (I believe the season finale), Doomsday/Davis Bloome is \\"buried\\" by Clark, but the questions remain at the surface: How did Clark \\"bury\\" Doomsday? Is Doomsday dead? Why hasn't Doomsday escaped/resurfaced and killed again? What is holding/preventing Doomsday from surfacing? The questions go on and on.<br /><br />This season 8 deserves 3 stars because:<br />1. It was gutsy enough to introduce Doomsday so early on<br />2. Lois Lane reveals she's in love with Clark Kent<br />3. It shows Lex Luthor \\"dead\\" after being in a truck explosion (so it entices fans to guess what happened and is he really dead since, of course, Lex Luthor does not die in the animated series/movies/comics, etc.). This scene makes you wonder what really happened to Lex Luthor, when he's going to return to Smallville, and what he's going to do with Clark when he returns (maybe in seasons 9 and 10?).

1449433251|5.0|I ended up purchasing the paperback version just because I knew I would be reading them constantly.  I figured the hardcover was more of a collector type edition and I didn't want to feel guilty for enjoying this great set.  Overall the quality is nice and I really enjoy the thick gloss pages.  The slipcase works and is pretty sturdy...that being said I could see it wearing down with repeated use but it's nothing I'm too worried about.  In the end it really is a great quality product for an amazing comic series.

B009AMANBA|2.0|This movie protrays the primary reason for the civil war is slavery. This in fact is incorrect, for the primary reason for this war was States rights and economic status of the states. The prople of this country need to be told the truth.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|It came diligently. And it came in a nice package. Nothing too crazy and over done. The movie was a great price and just as expected.

My few favorite song in this album is One is Ain't No Mountain High Enough the first track, two is the new song Gotta Keep Dreamin and three is Track of My Tears. But overall I like all the song in the album, so I give the album to my mom, and she love it. So if you haven't listening to this album, try to listen the sample songs and see what you think of it.[[ASIN:B00AYJCEYC Ain't No Mountain High Enough: Tribute Hitsville]]
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great game love that it is free. Highly addicting. Simple to play. Very good. My kids love it too we compete and get really into it. Hours of fun.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Lots of action, some witty quips, a bit of comic relief, PG-13 eye candy, and witches on brooms being shot out of the sky by medieval style automatic gun fire.  It very much had the feel of Van Helsing (Jackman) but I enjoyed it more and it had far more re-watch-ability.  It won't ever be in the upper echelon of action movies, but it's worth a watch.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Somehow this author wove a story from the elements of loss and love as well as car racing and beloved dogs.  Well done but since I'm not such a fan of racing, I glossed over the descriptive racing episodes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think 101 games+ 31 is very fun but some of the games were so difficult like tornado  hockey it took me like 2 days to finish it other than that I would give it 4 out of 5 stars
B00AFROVQC|2.0|To sum up the review (and book), this story is very \\"Marty Stu.\\" Google it.<br />This review contains spoilers. You can thank me later.  (Not like it's not anything you can predict a few chapters in.)<br /><br />It was entertaining enough that I managed to finish the book.. but that's really all I can say about it. The main character is exceptionally special: though he fails to be chosen to join the Legion he wants to join, he manages to go out and defeat some fearsome beast with his hands. Then he leaves it there in the forest, no trophies.. why? Anyways, arriving in the city, he manages to impress the two most important knights in the kingdom. That same night, he saves the most important knight in the kingdom, earning a spot in the royal family, apparently. He also manages to catch the love interest of the princess that will inherit the kingdom. As another reviewer said, this is day #1.<br /><br />Day #2, he missteps and gets sent out on patrol - but of course, this turns out for the best, because everything does. He ends up saving someone, then earning more respect from the king and every knight, earning himself some sort of magic hawk thing that conveniently foreshadows everything dangerous.<br /><br />Day #3, after training, there's some great hunt where the main character saves the king's firstborn son and also finds a magical tiger, who on the next day day saves the main character and the heir princess, who decided to have a tumble in the grass with the peasant she met two days prior.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot to mention there's some sword called a Destiny Sword that magically protects the kingdom, and only \\"The One\\" can pick it up, and only kings are allowed to try. Gee, I wonder who that could possibly be, and I wonder if he will marry a certain heir to the throne? I probably should have stopped reading after I read that bit..<br /><br />Then some convenient magical foretelling happens and main character does something about it and the book ends.<br /><br />To the author: I apologize for being so harsh, but seriously, look up Marty Stu on tvtropes.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I haven't read any of the books by Lee Childs about Jack Reacher, but I know a few people who love this character and the author who writes him. Therefore, since I have never asked whether the movie captures the true nature of Jack Reacher or not, all I can do is review it from my own viewpoint. This was a very intelligent movie. When I say intelligent, I mean it did not fall back upon blood and guns and car chases to hold up the action and excellence of the story. The character of Jack Reacher is quite complex. He is obviously a very experienced ex-military member who has seen his share of bad situations and has been highly trained, as if he had been an Army Ranger or a Navy Seal. He also seems to have some significant holdover emotion of the experience.<br /><br />Even with the intelligent, complex storyline, what I REALLY liked about it was I didn't get lost as I do in a lot of movies that try to lay out a complicated situation and resolution. This, also, was a different Tom Cruise, more in line with Minority Report. Restrained and trying to find the heart of truth in a plot that is full of twists and turns. Others in here have already given the plot points, so I won't go there. However, I do want to say that the supporting cast, Rosamund Pike and especially Robert Duvall, are excellent in their respective roles and make this movie much stronger and better.<br /><br />I don't think this is Tom Cruise's best role to date, (being inclined toward Minority Report for that one), and I think his role in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is very, very good. However, I give him kudos for him not trying to look younger than his age. He definitely looks at least close to, if not right on, 50 years old. The media tends to make Cruise out to be a bit of a prima dona, but this role definitely showed his age, and for that, he won points with me. I deducted one star because it just isn't a 5-star movie. I'd would say, however, it is right on the mark at 4 stars, which is very good. It will be interesting to see if Cruise continues to keep his roles maturing as he is.<br /><br />This movie has something for everybody. As I said, a lot of twists and turns, there is a car chase that is somewhat heart stopping, and figuring out who the bad guy is was not easy (points given if I can't pick the bad guy a quarter of the way in!). Not having read the books, I can't equate it with Lee Childs intent of the story. I can, however, review it on the basis of whether or not it meets the requirements of a movie worth watching. And Jack Reacher is definitely worth watching. Highly recommended if you like a good action movie with smart characters and an involving story that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat without constant scenes of gun fights, lots of blood and gore, but quite still quite thrilling. Money well spent on Jack Reacher!good. It will be interesting to see if Cruise continues to keep his roles maturing as he is.<br /><br />This movie has something for everybody.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|There is probably a lot of skepticism around this topic but I have always been interested in NDE stories.  The difference here is that this man is a highly qualified and respected neurosurgeon.  His experience may test credibility but his expertise in brain function gives credence.
B007EZJKS2|1.0|This book I would rate 4 stars<br />For its art and detail<br />For its crafty words and riddle Peter Beagle is a very good writer
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I played the original Scribblenauts on the DS, and then Scribblenauts Ultimate on PC. I only picked this one up because I had a surplus of &#34;Amazon Coins&#34; that I was given by Amazon, likely to promote this new ( and in my opinion, silly) system they've established. Anyways, I noticed that you can't spawn nearly as many objects in this &#34;Remix&#34; version of the game, and you have to pay to unlock more of the game's features, as opposed to simply unlocking them as you play (this explains the low price). I wholeheartedly disagree with this, and I find it a devious tactic. It's sad that this version of the game was turned into another host for this micro-transaction system that is unfortunately becoming more and more prevalent within the gaming industry. And this isn't even a free-to-play game. You pay for the game, and then you have to pay more to fully enjoy it. Lame.<br /><br />If you've never played Scribblenauts before, I'd recommend getting one of the older versions (or Scribblenauts Ultimate for the PC) to get the full experience. This one doesn't do it justice in the slightest.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|The story is wonderfully preposterous: a cartel drug lord escapes the clutches of an over-serious Forest Whitacker.  He then kidnaps a female agent and takes off south in a souped-up sports car that can outrun a helicopter.  Naturally, the entire Federal Bureau of Investigation doesn't stand a chance against him.  Who does?  One old sheriff in a small border town, teaming up with some local misfits (including, for some reason, Johnny Knoxville, as well as Luis Guzman wielding an impressive broadsword, which is kinda cool actually).<br /><br />There was so much promise in THE LAST STAND.  It had all the trappings of the old Schwarzenegger classics: stalwart hero whose honor is impeccable; a nice array of supporting characters who get a bit too much screen time, but it's okay because they're weird; a deliciously evil villain (Peter Stormare, who's actually the second-in-command, but that just means he gets more screen time than his boss); and a relatively short running time that kind of crawls along at first, but picks up in the third act.  And, of course, there's Arnold himself, as charismatic as ever.  He doesn't get quite as many one-liners (the film is way too serious for its own good; more on that in a moment), but he's surprisingly still game.  Politics may have slowed the big guy down a bit, but that just means he takes his time before opening up a can of whoop-butt.<br /><br />So why only three stars, you ask?  Because director Kim Jee-Woon has taken a simple American action film and tried to stylize it like an Asian action film.  Don't get me wrong; the new wave of Asian/European action films are fantastic, and certainly deserve their place in cinema.  But that style doesn't mesh well with a Schwarzenegger film.  And make no mistake: from the terrible script to the predictable twists and turns, this is a Schwarzenegger action vehicle (the same kind that also sometimes stars Stallone, Van Damme, and, once upon a time, Seagal).  We expect violence, but we expect it toned down; kids find their way into Arnold films after all (I devoured all of them before the age of 12).  We don't expect artful sprays of blood and dismemberment; bouncing body parts do not belong in this type of film.  As for the tone...the film is WAY too serious.  Again, that springs from it trying to be too much...or, rather, from Jee-Woon trying to make too much out of it.  THE LAST STAND wasn't meant to be artful; it was meant to be fun.  It still is, in spots, but alas...it's a welcome return for Schwarzenegger, who probably doesn't have many years of doing this left to him.  But he deserved a better comeback vehicle, or at least a less ambitious driver behind the wheel.t it toned down; kids find their way into Arnold films after all (I devoured all of them before the age of 12).

1611761808|5.0|I devoured this book in 2 days, unable to put it down. I loved his first 2 books and this one did not disappoint. The story was far different and yet the interweaving of the individual character's stories brought a plethora of emotions. It reminds us that the twists of history of a profound affect on our inner self and how we see our individual ancestry. A mere flip of a coin can lead one brother to wealth and another to poverty. Distances may be great but the thread that connects us all is unbreakable. Brilliant, moving, pensive and redemptive. My only complaint is that I don't know when Dr. Hosseini will grace us again with his remarkable gift of storytelling. I can only hope the wait is not long.<br />-Catherine Kouchakji-
B00BESM14U|3.0|The movie is a coming-of-age story about a troubled young boy. The plot is well written and the acting of the two male leads was good. Emma Watson's american accent was atrocious and was distracting in every scene, which constantly ruined my immersion in the story. The high school scenes and actors were unrealistic and cliche, but there is a good story underneath it all if you are willing to look past the negatives.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|it is really good except for trying to earning coins that is the only hard part. This is an awesome flying game it is great!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I love Ken Follett's book, they are hard to put down, the ending was great! Can't wait until his next book comes out.
159463176X|4.0|I\\"ll admit that it's been a while since I've read Hosseini's last two books. All I remember now is that I loved both of them enough to preorder And the Mountains Echoed.<br /><br />In retrospect, this book is much different than the other two. The interweaving stories of this book cause some discontinuity that becomes hard to overcome. I would often finish one chapter, pause to think about what I had just read and how it connects to the rest of the story, only to find that perhaps it did not necessarily have much connection to the story at all. I suppose each chapter did have its individual theme, and that they could almost be read as stand-a-lone stories. However i would've much preferred something that was more continuous to make the story flow better.<br /><br />On the other hand, this method of storytelling through multiple perspectives did give the story more depth. Characters that I thought were mainly artificial characters used as fillers would end up having their own chapter that proved to be deeper than I would've imagined, proving that everybody has a story to tell. I also enjoyed the subtle connections between the characters in the chapters, making the story seem more real.<br /><br />All in all, it was great read. In my perspective, it seemed that all characters started out not knowing what their purpose was. They searched for this purpose without even knowing that they were searching, and in the end they would discover that their searches had brought them to something they weren't looking for at all. That probably wouldn't make much sense if you haven't read the book, but hopefully it makes some sense to those who have read the book.

160774273X|5.0|I own 3-4 artisan bread books, but this is the one I use again and again when I want to have great homemade bread in a reasonable amount of time. He obviously spent a lot of time developing the right techniques for the home baker -- I can't speak highly enough about the book.<br /><br />In terms of equipment, the only things I'd say are really important are the huge canister for mixing the dough and (even more importantly) the right-sized cast iron Dutch oven. This Amazon page has a link to it. All the recipes are designed for that pot, so when the bread comes out of the oven, it looks absolutely perfect. I've made dozens of loaves without the proofing basket (I let it rise on a flour bag towel). I'm finally going to pull the trigger on the bowls just because it'll be easier, but again, they are not critical to the process.<br /><br />When I say the recipes are forgiving, they really are. Sometimes my dough is a bit too wet -- I bake it for an extra 5-7 minutes and it's perfect. Sometimes the dough sticks to the towel I mentioned above and it deflates a bit as I am pulling it off the towel. It still turns out great, every time. The timing with my oven is different than what he suggests. I keep it covered for around 40 minutes and then uncovered for only about 5 minutes. Otherwise, the top gets too brown. These are little things you'll figure out for yourself. It's fun.<br /><br />If I want bread early in the day, I make the Overnight version. If I want it later in the day, I make the Saturday version. It's so easy -- and if you have guests, they are hugely impressed! No need for anyone to know how little active time you had to spend :)

I would love to see Maiden bring that song back into the setlist today, but based on Bruce's intro, I would say he probably does not like live instrumentals!<br />However, Bruce destroys the lyrics on &#34;Murders In the Rue Morgue&#34;.  He should have studied it better.
B00CW665VI|3.0|This is a fun summer read. I would not compare it to Wallbanger(which is awesome). For some reason reading from Drew 's PIC kind of lost something in the story to me. Just my opinion. But still a light, fun read.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|The movie was cookie cutter when I saw it last year, it played into the whole end of the world hysteria that people talked about non stop - all year long... THIS was the novelty movie to go with the fable...and the ending was beyond unbelievable, but here 2012 has come and gone, just like the Mayans, the movie amounted to a load of rubble..Like the prophecies of most religions... So, since we're in 2013, and I hear they even recently bulldozed one of those Mayan temples, let me just say, there's nothing worth seeing in this movie..unless you've always wanted to see Los Angeles go a block at a time... That's the first 20 mins., turn it off after that.. I hope all the people worshiping fanatical religions can see what's happened and apply it to their own delusional myths, nothing happened... You still had to go to work on December 22nd... as for my DVD, I traded it in long before December 21, 2012..<br /><br />The reason I'm being so harsh on this fantasy film, is because it played into the panic..and it actually half believed what it was telling. It was insulting to religious people and preachy to non religious people... Not to mention it wasn't very entertaining; the acting was average and there was way too much talking.. and since it was a croc and nothing happened, why would I ever want to see it again? It's already become a bad 70's sci fi set in a day that's already past & wrongly predicted.. Where's MST3K when you need it??

At times, I felt like the characters were all a little bit too obviously hip though. I felt like some of the songs they listened to and books they read were a bit cliche. Other than that, I have no complaints. It was quick and endearing. Very recommended. :)<br /><br />Kate.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Great game for all ages.  Love the graphics.  If you like animals you should try it.  Great for kids too.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Visually dazzling masterpiece, incredible colors, but that alone cannot hold an adult's interest for long. Acting is mediocre at best, and the plot is silly and very thin. In my opinion small children will love some of the fantasy characters, but some of the bad guy monsters may be too intense and menacing for little kids. One of the good guys, the monkey character, has a very odd, almost threatening face, although his behavior is always good. What could have been the saving grace for this film in terms of its value for parents watching it with their kids, never got off the ground. This was the introduction of the porcelain, miniature china doll character. This sequence started with a beautiful, heart-warming scene, but it fizzled out within five minutes, much to the dismay of all of us watching the film. The writers and directors could have done more with this porcelain china doll character but instead simply relegated her to the background as the story continued. When she initially appeared it seemed that she would be the embodiment of love, care, innocence, human warmth, and protection of the little ones, but, sadly, it never came to be. The film has a few truly magical moments here and there, yet not enough to make it worth watching. Something went terribly wrong with this Disney production.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Wonderful battery assessment tool. Helps improve the life of your battery. Works on rooted nook tablet. Lets you know how much life is left and what is using the most juice.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|I really had no intention of seeing this movie. I will admit that I only watched it because I found out a specific actor was in it (although barely). That said, I really like the movie.<br /><br />Not to get on some of the other reviewers too much, but this is a movie, not a documentary. Creative license is always taken for entertainment value. We should all know that going in. There doesn't need to be a multipage diatribe on all of the historical inaccuracies. Movies should be fun. Just let it go and enjoy it.
159463176X|3.0|I loved the Kite Runner and A 1000 Splendid Suns is one of my favorite books of all time. I could not wait to get my hands on this book. The first 1/3 of the book I was completely engrossed and then it took a sharp turn into different characters and locations, which made the story a bit confusing. I think Khaled Hosseini is a brilliant writer and this book there are some wonderful passages. The last part of the book makes up for it to not be a complete disappointment. Advice: Don't go into this book thinking you are going to get the first two books and you will appreciate it.
0312330537|5.0|This book literally got me immersed for several weeks. Totally recommended. It helped me as a writer too. This book played a major role in my decision to visit Mumbai and India.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Sometimes the bombs interfere with one's ability to slice fruit a lot of the time due to the path being the same as fruits so that the fruit get covered up and it's impossible to slice them without slicing a bomb. would be a better game if the bombs did not take the same path as the fruits at all... would provide a nice challenge without being impossibly frustrating.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If you like the zombie apocalypse genre you will love this book.  The depth of world is second to none in the world of zombie books.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Such a fun action packed tv series. I highly recommend everyone to give it a try and watch it. Team Daryl. &#60;3
B00BESM14U|4.0|I like it, but I didn't love it because the story telling did not allow me to become emotionally attached enough to any of the characters. I've read reviews that compare this movie to a John Hughes movie. Every single John Hugh movie is leaps and bounds better than this movie. My husband would glady watch a John Hughes movie because there is always something clever and fun within his stories. On the other hand, my husband would have gotten up and left the room halfway through this movie. I did not read the book, so I can't compare the two. I liked it, but I didn't love it.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is good acting by Denzel Washington. I don't like Goodman that much, but he did good too. Good story also.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This is a great movie and I was really happy to find It on here. I did have to pay much either.<br />I recommend it and for us who remember this how about passing it down to the next generation.<br />I was looking for, &#34;Drop dead Fred' and I noticed many people are but the price is crazy expensive and so far I have not<br />seen any person buy it. This is a shame because I know my girls sat in front of our tv and watched it over and over. This would really be nice to  pass on to our grandchildren. But Labyrinth is terrific
B000UJ48UO|5.0|This is a movie that I have already seen. It is very comical in the beginning (Jelly Donut private pile!!!!!?)
B00594XOZU|4.0|I think this app is great it's fast and east and free but the only thing is that sometimes it won't send! But if I were you I would buy it!!!! :)
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This was a movie wonderfully directed and produced. The storyline was filled with nostalgia and excitement from an unexpected plot twist.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This android app is stupid and won't do anything without buying the upgrade.<br /><br />I uninstalled after just a few minutes.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I thought it was amazing how you could see if they read your message or if they were on!!!! Its awesome!!
B004US4K2C|5.0|I love this app and I strongly recommend as it has so much to offer.  Try it you will love it.
1439102813|5.0|This book will linger in your memory for years. I read this when my mother passed it on after her book group (reluctantly, I might add).  However, it is a powerful book that lingers; not a happy read but moving and thought provoking.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good read with a nice twist at the end.  Not a masterpiece, but a perfect action novel that members bogs down.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|It's a fun dramatization of life behind a Broadway show.  Listening and watching the<br />performances of smash is having a show right in your living room.
B00338QENI|5.0|What a story, knowing it was true and living in the Baltimore Area made it all the more interesting,  The educational value was special especially since the medical area never gave this women CREDIT!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I've watched this movie a dozen times at least, but seeing it in blu-ray was an entirely new experience.  Everything was crystal clear, and sharp, and the sound was greatly improved over the original DVD.  I highly recommend this purchase.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|If you're the type that equates &quot;retro&quot; to &quot;old&quot;, please don't! This game is fun for any age! Whether you've played the originals, or if this game is new to you- just try it. It's a fast paced, all out, alien-snake-shooting, space war game... if those weren't enough adjectives to convince you; it's also just plain &quot;fun&quot;.<br /><br />My one qualm is that my score resets to zero every time I die... While it didn't take long before I got to level 64-65 (about 20 min.), my score is abysmal! Save your sanity and just keep the game on &quot;touch&quot; for its entirety or risk losing all your points half way through. Trust me, it's NOT worth tempting fate for.
0694003611|5.0|I didn't know what everyone was raving about regarding this book until I bought it for my grandbaby and looked at it myself.  This colors, objects, pace of the words are ingenius for babies and young children.  I wish I had had it for my own kids.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|This is an okay game - basically a normal Match 3 game.  Have only played a few levels but it is a good, relaxing before bed app.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|This movie was, of course, enjoyable. It's got Whedon's great storytelling, but it lacks a little bit of his original flair. Nonetheless, kids and adults will enjoy it equally. This was the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack. If you're like me, you have a blu-ray in the main living area, but maybe an old DVD player, Playstation, or XBox in another room that still plays DVDs, so this pack means the movie is highly portable around the house. There's no digital copy in this version, but who says you need one supplied, amiright? The extras include a lot of BtS featurettes, which I find kind of boring, but my husband enjoyed, and of course there's the highly enjoyable gag reel a la &#34;Smokey and the Bandit.&#34; I got it at the &#34;sale&#34; price of $19.99 with prime free 2-day shipping, which made it a pretty good buy for a two-disk set.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Not really a game but I like creating my own reef.  I've spent hours I should have been doing something else constructive playing this app!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee you are a fabulous writer.  You are able to keep the reader interested in your book as we read your life's story.  I look forward to reading more from you in the future.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game when I am in competition with someone other than myself.  My fav is Scrabble with Friends, this is definitely #2!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I have read several books in my life, many of them are dystopian... I must say out of all of them, this is definitely one of the best. It's different in how it brings in the king/queen system, rather than a dictator. Very interesting!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|We bought the first season after it was recommended to us.  Went on to purchase the second and pre-ordered the third.  Fabulous!
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Awesome cd. Came a little layer than my other packages but overall very satisfied. Six more words are required. Blah.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|I love Galaga and this game is just like it. It is fun easy to play but it has challenges. It only gets for stars cause you can't save. Works and looks amazing on kindle fire hd.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Fast paced page turner that keeps the reader wanting to know what happens next in this comtemporary distopian world.  Have to read book three now!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I remember seeing this yrs ago with my kids.  Got it and still great.  So funny and the grandkids loved it.
8184776217|1.0|What happened to the hunger games I knew and loved??? The third book ruined it all for me... And no it's not because their was no happily ever after. I ended up despising Katnis by the end.  I read it because I figured at some point it would \\"go somewhere\\" but it fell way short. Very disappointed with this one. I would have liked it better if Petta had died ( and I loved Petta).
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I chose this item because I love Josh's voice and all his CDs are excellent.  I would recommend it to everyone who is a Josh Groban fan.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I agree with another reviewer that the movement of the cards is pleasant.  They are easy to move and place, then they 'stick'.  I appreciate the Hint function.  It is teaching me moves that I would otherwise overlook or miss.  The popup ads between games Don't bother me.  They are easy to close.  A free game has to be paid for somehow.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I'll start off by saying that i hate giving perfect scores, but this album touches every element that an album is supposed to touch. There is not one song on this album that doesn't either invigorate the spirit, or make you ponder about your current or past situations and how things are/went the way the went.<br /><br />Buy it!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Watched this with my husband and my two boys (3&6) and we all loved it and laughed together. Great flick.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not much to say. I didn't know anything about this book and when i first picked it up i didn't expect it to go the route that it did. Very pleasant surprise to say the least. All the characters are realistic an although the protagonist isn't the hero type, or a braniac, or a martial artist, or a ladies man(you get my drift) he does very well for himself and he always has you rooting for him because he represent the everyman trying to fight against overwhelming odds to accomplish something colossal. His thought process and fears are all realistic and when he encounters a problem you wish he develops a supernatural way to escape or fight through it, but he can only rely on himself and that makes him all the more likable.<br /><br />The action well placed and generous, the characters are developed well enough to love or hate them, and the book is setup to make you at least believe its historically correct.<br /><br />Must read.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|water pressure.  while the graphics. are awesome, the overwhelming spurring to buy pearls to enhance and advance, is annoying at best.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Saw him first on the Queen's JUbilee concert and have enjoyed his music ever since 'Small Bump' is such a wonderful song
B00BESCJII|1.0|This movie is a snooze fest for at least three quarters of the way through. Then it has a corny after school special twist. I wish I had my $5 back.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Best game I have ever played. Definitely 1 step ahead of MC3. Only prob. Is I like campaign and when I want to start they level, it rewrites the campaign to start and erase it data. And u have to start again. Otherwise, best game ever, make sure u buy it
B006IYG5HE|3.0|I have read 3 Jo Nesbo books.  They are all complex and involve Harry Hole. The Redbreast was written before other books I has read. It turned out to be very confusing to me trying to keep the characters straight and the place in perspective.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It made my pictures better than ever I even said wow.i was speechless .now I took better pictures .now people around me say u should be a photographer
B0068THAGY|2.0|The special effects were that bad, the storyline sentimental and trope-filled... And the cars were period, too.<br /><br />All in all, not worth watching.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This story was great but the end was a huge anti-climax for me. First half of the book portrayed two characters, one sensitive and loving, the other weak and pathetic. Second half we saw two very different characters emerging. The plot was ingenious, could not have guessed anything that was going to happen next and just couldn't put the book down. Unfortunately once Desi re-appeared on the scene it  began to get a bit unrealistic.  By the last few chapters I was realising the ending was not going to tie up any loose ends and I felt a bit like the character Go who was crying and saying &#34;It's not meant to be like this&#34;. Most of the book was about one character masquerading as something they were not but by the end both characters were playing that game and it was a bit like watching actors in a play. I was disappointed that someone who could write such a great book could end it so pathetically. It's was like she suddenly got tired of writing and had to finish it off in a hurry.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett who did such a great job with Pillars of the Earth and World Without End has hit the mark again with his second in this trilogy. I can't wait for the final book. The reader is treated to solid research about the political agendas of the countries involved in WWII coupled with the impact on and horrors faced by the several families introduced in Fall of Giants. It is true to a life epic about the darkness of war.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|So far so fun. Haven't quite figured out the battlefield, but I will! Or someone will tell me. I hope! Need friends to help, will get them I'm sure.
0743289692|4.0|Infidel was an excellent insight into the Muslim religion and why their members dislike westerners. I have recommended this book to all my friends.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|this movie was a waste of time and effort and the original is the one to watch.  even the music was better in the first one.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every Flynn novel and cannot wait for the next one.  Have recommended to friends and family.  I could not put &#34;The Last Man&#34; down until finished.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtown or Downton it is still the best series.  i hate that i can never find the program to watch on Direct and have to wait about a year to see it on AMAZON OR NETLIX.  But love the story line and the characters.
1574216988|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my counselor for stress relief.  Boy, I needed that!  Great book, easy to follow directions, and a definite stress reliever!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|An enjoyable end to the wonderful series of films. Close enough to the book that I did not feel let down by the occasional story adjustment. Perhaps the need to cram in so many events means that the characters seem a little wooden in that they are almost props for the action but, for me, that seems to be inline with the original stories !<br /> For folks not familiar with either the books or the earlier movies this is not the place to start !<br /> For 'muggles' it is hard to imagine anything better :-)
0062073486|4.0|Even though my son had to read this for school, he enjoyed the book!  From ordering to delivery, it was an easy process!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Another great Bourne 'ride'. Requires a 'suspension of belief' WRT genetics (for a start !) but aficionados of Tony Gilroy's work will not be disappointed.<br /> In Renner and Weisz the film offers two protagonists who do a good job of conveying evolving understanding as their worlds are thrown into disarray and then, working together, the strength to try and survive. Norton is excellent as the adversary in what seems to be an unusual role for him.<br /> The many references to earlier 'Bourne' mean that it helps if you have seen 'Ultimatum' but in any event expect a top quality espionage thriller.
157421327X|5.0|Was told by my counselor that I needed an hour each day to just let my brain unwind.  This book did the trick!!!  Easy to follow and fun to do.  I LOVE this book!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This film brings the what if alive. This film keeps the littlest children occupied. The sounds the colours and also how much the film changes is great. The messages are also a learning experience.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Glee.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see this amazing show until the second season, so I purchased this set.  Now, I want every season on DVD so I can watch and rewatch!  Great from order to delivery!
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|This book is a wikipedia-like compilation of arguments against the existence of God, that doesn't show much original insight or thought. The argument can be boiled down to: &#34;a transcendent deity is a fiction and anyone who believes in him/she/it is stupid.&#34;
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is fun and interesting for all ages with great graphics. It has facts that anyone can use to learn more about reefs.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Loved the book....hope Mr. Archer has a new one coming really soon that gives the readers an ending.  Hate reading 300+ pages and be left like that.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|The writing was dead-on Austen and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting these characters again - old friends.  Beside the new plot of the murder mystery old gaps in the original story are closed such as the connection between Ms. Young and Wickham.  This should be read by all Austenites.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|The book is just brilliant. I like the way Eva comes to terms with important aspects of life such as marriage, parenthood, family, and career. How difficult it is to make the correct decision or so it seems.<br />In the form of letters to her husband, she describes her thoughts and feeling concerning her life. Where she feels her acts have led her son towards. She feels really guilty of what has happened and tries desperately to understand why.<br />I think her reflections concerning her life are gorgeous as she feels she has nothing to hide.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Very Sexy and heart wrenching.  Heathcliff is a great tragic romantic character.
B00CW665VI|5.0|WONDERFUL. I really enjoyed the way the story was told from a male perspective and the humor it sometimes injected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got it thinking that it wouldnt be all that great but it turned  out to be awesome. Best free app that I never spent my money on. What do you have  to lose?
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Pink Floyd's Greatest by far.  Could listen to this one again and again.  2nd only to Greatest Hits.  Have not stopped listening since it got here.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Far more entertaining than the standard point and click games. Did need to be longer. Will definitely get the next chapter
0783240287|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber is the one with the Technicolor Dreamcoat.  He is certainly the composer of prowess and musicality in my lifetime.  The story and musical numbers in this hit has something for everyone, from the classicalist to the rockers.  My grandkids loved the Elvis-like pharaoh.  The biblical nature of the story-line also made it quite fitting for the church crowd.
1449433251|5.0|A must for all us who can't get enough of Calvin and Hobbes! Nice format, and containing a lot of fun.
B000077VR3|4.0|Well done musical; Kidman does a nice job.  I wanted to see her in a something of this sort.  The rest of the show seemed well-directed, but the ending brought a much-needed bit of drama to the production.  I enjoyed it.
0399159347|5.0|Cecilia, the heroine of Liane Moriarty's 2013 offering, 'The Husband's Secret,' is a modern  Pandora.  While her husband's away on a business trip, she finds an envelope in the attic to be opened in the event of his death.  Is it a romantic last chance to express an undying love?  How sweet! A reminder of financial matters? So practical! Or a confession that he dared not make until now? How unlikely!<br /><br />Cecilia is intrigued by the unknown in an otherwise uneventful life, but she knows her mythology and resists opening the envelope.  Nevertheless, it teases her with its possibilities.  However, the busy well-organized mother of three equally busy girls doesn't have much time to ponder possibly romantic missives.<br /><br />Little though Cecilia knows it the unopened letter will link her  to two other women leading equally demanding lives.  There is the part-time school secretary at her daughters' school, Rachel, grandmother of a greatly loved little boy, who has rebuilt her life after the loss of her daughter and divorce from her spouse.  As her son and daughter-in-law plan a move to New York,  Rachel realizes that she must again rethink her life once again.<br /><br />Tess, the third, is the daughter of  Rachel's work share partner, the other part-time school secretary.  She has brought  her six-year-old son with her while she cares for her recently injured mother; she has also come home to her mother while she too contemplates major changes in her own life.<br /><br />The stage is set. Enter Pandora.<br /><br />Liane Moriarty writes with a deft hand; the characters are each engaging and believable; and the novel moves swiftly to a conclusion the reader might have foreseen, but given my own experience probably doesn't imagine.<br /><br />It was with great joy that I happened on the novels of Liane Moriarty.  \\"What Alice Forgot\\" is not to be missed - or, dare I say? - forgotten.  And now 'The Husband's Secret' allows Moriarty to remind her readers how well she can spin several threads into pure gold.  But that's another myth and another story.e can spin several threads into pure gold.  But that's another myth and another story.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It performs just like the description says. It holds the Kindle firmly, no worries about it slipping out. The rotating screen works well also. The only thing that would make it better would be a slot to hold a stylus.
034580404X|5.0|A absolutely adorable love story with kinky sex. Loved all 3 books of continuing story up until marriage and children.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it it is awesome  rocks terrific marvelous great good fantastic fabulous beautiful amazing cops I had a great experience with it GO SUBWAY SURFERS!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie is unlike any prison movie you have ever seen.  Tim Robbins does an excellent job as the prisoner who plans his escape<br />from prison.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie ordered for a friend.  Said it was super good, no glitches or hiccups, no stop/start traumas, good sound, good picture, all in perfect order.  I, personally have not seen this, since ordered for a friend, but he says it was great.  Many thanks.<br />Cecy Ivie]
B00464AVXW|5.0|The murders evolve around the seven deadly sins.  The story line keeps one guessing all the way through the movie.  The end is unbelievable.  You can't beat Morgan Freeman he is a superb actor.  It is gorier than I usually like but I still would recommend it, if you can tolerate the bloodshed.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|Perhaps, it was different from the book and frustrated me on some of the changes.  However, the movie still entertained me.  I love this story and will gladly buy the movie as soon as I am able too. :) I think most will enjoy this movie despite the changes that are made when converting a book into a film.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|And that is entertaining too, watching new narrative lines develop is fun. I'll keep watching because this series makes me giggle.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is ok I used to like it but now it gets all glitchy and freezes sometimes it make me go the Wrong way. It maybe my tablet but I don't know? I still play it allot.I would give it a 4 star
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I like the full site as opposed to the little version on the app . . . however . . .can't upload pics from my camera!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Not too bad, but you need real money to get far without grinding.  Potions are on a timer, and not findable.  If you like grinding or waiting for timers, its a good game.<br />Definately a large file, so be patient.
0767847431|5.0|I remember seeing this films in the movies when I was a kid!  Oh those were the days!  A great thing to show your kids the kinds of movies we watched when we were younger.<br />Good clean Sci-Fi fun.
B000056HE9|5.0|good collectors item
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game and good story. Good graphics for hidden objects. The map was helpful for getting around and for cleaning up missed clues. The mini games were fun, but pretty easy.
B00015YVD6|5.0|My spouse and I wanted our kids to enjoy a movie we did way-back-when. We forgot the &#34;Penthouse Forum&#34; reference by John Candy's character.  Whups.  Otherwise, a great addition to the family video library.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was fun and different from other games. Wish it was longer. Would play this game again. Nice graphics and process.
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|Brings back memories of classic 1970's hard rock that I so treasure. I hope they make a few more albums.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|The writer has, in other books such as Mirror Dance, planned her plots on unbelievable coincidences.  In Mirror Dance (a Hugo Award winner), there are enough of these in the first 50 pages to do for five books. I forgive her.  Her emotional and social intelligence (as understood by this psychologist)are way out of my league though I can follow her - mostly.  Maybe I will learn to be better at these.  She skewers people as well or better than Miss Manners, my heroine in matters of taking the puff out of puffed-up people.  I am afraid she will never get the credit she is due, despite many Hugo and Nebula awards.  Serious literature at present does not make room for happy endings, all frayed strings of plot neatly tied up, though never as hilariously as here.  I wish that I had taken her books in some order, but I have bought all of them and will have many happy hours.  I can only agree with Anne Mccaffrey - boy can this woman write.
B00A4B9A1U|4.0|It is good to read something controversial so long as one retains a sense of impartiality. This critical view if the modern history of the United States is interesting particularly as it confirms some of ones' worst fears about the amorality and ruthlessness of the political world
B003V6L94Q|3.0|My husband is still holding on to the cd option vs the online download and is a fan of Zac Brown. I chose this album as it had several radio hits and didn't waste my money for an entire album of unknowns. I like the fact that the cover isn't another jewel case and use a reinforced cardboard slip case.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I bought the game on ds and I loved it so when I saw this I immediately got it. It's really fun but it stinks that you have to buy characters and worlds and levels once you beat world five. It's still fun to replay the levels and use the sandbox. Overall I love the game but the creators kinda scammed the players.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I was expecting the standard Disney princess film with this film. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they used this film to illustrate the mother/daughter bond. This is a great story of a mother and daughter working out their different perspectives on their priorities. A lovely breath of fresh air from the Disney company.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|First off---I really enjoyed all of the previous Die Hard films.  A big part of the previous films was McClaine's sense of humor and quips, which were almost totally missing from the action.  Even the action wasn't that memorable.  Seems like the original writers were on vacation.
0307341550|1.0|Great writing style without much else.  Ridiculous ending and even more far-fetched characters, plot, and content.  Will make you feel like a manipulated fool for even reading it.  Not recommended. I want my money back!
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi Lovato did not disappoint with this album, her songs are full of pop and dance beats paired with fun, catchy lyrics. I feel that Demi brought more of a fun, youthful vibe to this album compared to her previous ones. It definitely shows a different side of her.<br /><br />This album will definitely be the soundtrack to my summer!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was an amazing book with so many twists and turns on what seemed like every page. Even with the SAD moments I couldn't help but love the book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always been a fan of Stephen King since about the age of 13. I've never been disappointed by his books, though I favor some over others. I can honestly say this book has once again set the bar for future reads.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to cruise around Pinterest and Pin from any website, all while on my Kindle. This app, with my Kindle make Pinning and searching effortless.  This is a must have for anyone who uses Pinterest !!!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I have never played the original game, but this one is great to play! It's just another game to play to pass the time. I have no issues playing this game on my kindle fire, either! I would recommend this game to anyone! I would also recommend putting a PIN on the in app purchasing for those who allow their children to play the game.
B008A1B5Z0|3.0|I think this app is making a bit of a difference in the speed of opening and running various apps, but honestly sometimes it is hard to tell to what degree.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I now know why this game is so popular! I got it as the free app, and I instantly fell in love with it. It's a great way to kill time. But, if you want a game with a lot of twists and turns; suspenseful events; etc, then this game isn't for you. I mean, you literally are JUST cutting up fruit.<br /><br />The graphics are great and very cute. The bomb effects when you cut them are fun to watch as well. I would recommend this to anyone!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book, unlike Locked On, was spell bounding the entire way. It got to the point I just had to read the next page & the next & so on. I would read until the early morning hours. This book will rate up there as one of his best in my opinion.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I have only seen enterprise so I can't compare it to the originals but Its awesome. I really like the plots.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Just WOW. Very refreshing and funny!!!!! GREAT NEW AUTHOR AND STORY LINE. Big 5 stars. cannot wait for more of her books.
055358202X|5.0|I love this book. It arrived in great condition and i cant wait to finish the series. Will buy the last book soon
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This was a gift for our grandson.  He seems to really like it.  I think it is quite educational for a seven year old.
055357342X|5.0|I love this book. It arrived in great condition and i cant wait to finish the series. Will buy the last book soon
B0014BQQYS|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed watching the blu ray version of this classic movie.  Unfortunately, I saw little improvement in the sound.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My 4 year old son adores this movie! He watched it over and over on a 1300 mile car trip and I didn't hear &#34;are we there yet&#34; once
B004AM5QT4|1.0|This was converted to Kindle format VERY poorly. The typos are everywhere and distract greatly from the narrative. Not recommended.
B005544V6A|4.0|Of the dynamic duo, neither Harvey or Mike are my &#34;type&#34; but the character development and layers of personality these two reveal each episode has me hooked!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Thrilled I got this book. Loved every bit of it. Written in a guy's mind made it different but funny. I never thought I'd laugh so much reading a romance novel. It's a must buy!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Why does this guy think we should believe him??  Because he has a medical degree - it's just his experience - like any &#34;regular&#34; person - neurosurgeon or not. You decide what you choose to believe.  He is quite the egotist.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This was a pretty good show.  I liked the 2 main characters and supporting roles were also well done.  Not sure if it's worth 5 bucks but the wife saw a preview and wanted to give it a watch.  I always compare it to going out to a movie and of course it's much cheaper to watch at home with my own popcorn!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Quick moving  plot.  I read in three days.  Loved the turns and twists.  Ending was too sad though.  A little depressing but overall a well written story.
0307951529|3.0|Some aspects of this book provided a guide to living cheap by way of building a business with very little capital investment.  I'm more of a nuts and bolts girl and would have preferred less narrative storytelling and more how to info.<br /><br />Overall, a decent read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love all of the British Dramas!  I look forward to the new season!  Well acted and true to the times!
0385512058|5.0|I have customers who now have a rule with me.  We can talk about almost anything at lunch except business or religion.  Anything else goes, and what is discussed at lunch stays there.  After that we talk business and usually I get a nice order.
0812993845|2.0|This story lacks the interesting plot concepts that marked prior books by Ms. Kinsella, particularly \\"The Undomesticated Goddess\\"  and \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\"  Those prior works put interesting people into unusual, indeed fairly unique, situations resulting in a light but enjoyable experience for the reader.  In contrast, \\"Wedding Night\\" has one dimensional, uninteresting characters in a situation that is actually grating on the reader's nerves.  All the other Kinsella books, especially the two mentioned above, as well as the Shopaholic series, are all worth reading, but I would pass on this one.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Very enjoyable &#34;sword and sandal&#34; movie which a different turn on the roman-pict  relationship.  Who survives and who dies is not really decided until the very end.
159562015X|5.0|Always enjoyed finding out more about myself. The electronic assessment is key. Buy new. Looking forward to utilizing the action plans.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|Excellent movie. I actually used this film to write a psychology paper on because it deals with right v wrong decisions and how a person can go from stable to unstable, it is also very entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun for kids of all ages but the only pesky thing is all the ads, and the prices.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|It's such a  cool game and I hold the local record my user name is awesomeness so I'll probably beat your score lobe the game but not enough lvls on conquest mode
076421120X|5.0|For this particular book, I had decided to do a few weeks of devotions in order to get a feel from it.  So on May 1st, I embarked on a discovery on who Jesus is in my life while reading the daily devotions included in the book.  Each devotions encourages you to dig in the Bible while reading the scripture at the top of the page.  The scriptures included are from different versions of the Bible.  I decided to check out the NIV and NLT when I read something that was different to what I am used too.  Then the author shares about the theme of the day in a one-page devotion.  At the end of the page, you will find a small prayer to help you connect with God.  This prayer can become a stepping stone for a deeper connection with your Father in Heaven.<br /><br />I have enjoyed going through this devotional during the weeks I used it.  The perspective of the author on various theme like requesting from God, Joy in our lives, worshipping and so on, gives you a fresh look on well-known scriptures.  Each month covers a new side of Jesus that we might have missed or forgotten.  This devotional book reveals various aspects of Christ and how he can be real in our lives even today.  I particularly love her fresh tone and openness in sharing in the devotions.<br /><br />Even though it's a year long devotional book, I think you can pick it up anytime during the year and discover Jesus from that part of the year.  Though I find that this book would make a marvelous Christmas gifts for women in your life - whether it's a mom, mother-in-love, sisters, sisters-in-love, friends or mentors.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so touching.  I'm speechless; well almost.  You care genuinely about the characters.  It is smart, well written and hard to find a stopping point.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Every time I pull this game out, half a dozen people decide to buy it. It's that fun and that hilarious, if you're willing to get into it. Like most games, if you can weave a story out of your game play, and goad the other players into pushing their luck too far, then you'll have a riot of a time playing this game.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about this game, and have an iOS device, then download it for free from the App Store. The game only allows you to play against a single AI, but that's more than enough to give you the experience of playing the game (and either become addicted, or realize that it's not for you). For $0.99 you can even upgrade the app to a &#34;pass-the-device&#34; game for up to 8 people.<br /><br />So, why not five stars? Because at the core, this game is all about luck. I tend to prefer games with a substantial element of decision-making and skill. Games of Zombie Dice are so short that your decision making really has very little effect on the outcome of a game (unless you have no clue when to stop rolling). It's like playing the lottery. Winning has almost nothing to do with you, and is almost entirely blind luck. That being said, it's still hilariously funny to play if you have the right group of people who will use it as a chance to brazenly interact with one another with trash talk, acting like zombies, laughing at each other, laughing at themselves, etc..
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I have always loved Asian history and most recently Korean modern history.  The Orphan Master's Son is a very compelling book that leaves you contemplating each paragraph.  Humorous and terrifying at the same time, a look into the evil that is.North Korea.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is user friendly, challenging, fun and addictive. Daily challenges keep me coming back every day and the missions are super fun. Plus you can compete against your friends' high scores and brag about your victories and accomplishments on Facebook.
B009R659L8|3.0|This book wasn't as good as her others. good beach read because it doesn't make you think. You can tell who did it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Google! I use it for everything. Searching for anything I want to know, my calendar, my email, Google maps, Googoe documents... it is great!
B009VL28W2|5.0|Can't go wrong with this blu-ray at the price it sells for. Maybe I like their Mexico dvd better, but this comes in a close second(& well ahead of their S&M dvd). Editing as usual could be slower paced, but audio & video are excellent.(though James' vocals seemed a little weak in the mix at times)I haven't watched the bonus features yet, but the 2 hour concert alone makes this a no-brainer for all Metallica fans.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|For a western, the acting is great and the story even better. A good movie to sit back and relax with, and forget all the daily news. I really enjoyed it.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|He never lets you down always a great voclaist and performer. The Moody Blues are a great band and all the members never let you down wheather Indivdualy or as a whole their just brilliant.<br />Whish they could come to Australial more offten.
0553579908|5.0|This series is in-depth, the descriptions long winded and the plots don't always come together very fast. Having said that, the world created is one I can get lost in, I love that in a book! I've laughed, grumbled and silently applauded these characters! I've found the narrative to be written in a mostly unbiased manner.  I couldn't decide if I liked Tyrion or if I wanted some sort of revenge taken on him. Mr. Martin is just clever like that, each chapter has you rooting for the character within it despite their role in the bigger picture. I love this series so far though, there's nothing better in a book than one who takes you completely to another &#34;realm&#34;.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|It was a really good book. I read this in less than 5 hours. I could not put it down I finished at 2 in the morning. I would recommend this book for ages 14-20. Maybe older than 20. Really good book!!!!!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I have always loved Blake Shelton's music and his personality. I guess because he is a bit of rebel but a great performer, would definitely recommend this album because it has great songs.
B001QWBM62|1.0|its to much background sound and noice, and its not worth the money, to expensive for what it does, if the price was half of what it is today it would be ok but still not good.
0345803493|5.0|Wow, this is another great book written by E L James. I have already purchase the other one so I can have it when I finish this one. Great book for those to love a variety of feelings.
B003MC5N28|4.0|The Giver gave me mixed feelings. The beginning and the middle of the book was incredible. I loved it! It was so cool to see the world that the characters lived. I disliked the ending though; it was kind of a cliff hanger that won't continue. Overall the book was worth the read, and perfect for people around the age of twelve.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I liked the build up throughout the book and the many twists and turns leading to a great and surprising ending.
B004JPJHME|5.0|The Criterion Collection has exceeded my expectations with every bluray purchase. This cult classic, great on its own merits, looks more crisp and solid than ever before. The special features give a lot of insight into Hunter S. Thompson, giving fans of both the movie and the book more bang for their buck. I've watched this movie countless times, it never gets old, especially with a bottle of Flying Dog on hand (Good Beer, No S***). Highly recommended.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young and the Horse are still going strong....another great album from the man who has been strong right through my musical listening life!
B00BXHE0CI|4.0|The fifth full-length album from New Jersey's The Dillinger Escape Plan, 2013's \\"One Of Us Is The Killer,\\" is another winner. Blending their trademark math-obsessed hard/grindcore with the more tuneful and progressive approach taken on previous efforts such as 2007's excellent \\"Ire Works\\" and 2004's watershed-worthy \\"Miss Machine,\\" Dillinger emerge with some more of the best material of their career. It also represents, while not much of a stylistic departure, another step in the band's always-evolving sound.<br /><br />All of the band's usual trademarks abound, here. Impressive drumming? Check. Inventive, unorthodox guitar figures? You betcha! And what about technical bass lines? Yep. And Greg's vocals, meanwhile, whether veering towards melodic cooing or brutal, larynx-stretching bellows, are always equally as impressive. Top it all off with intelligent lyricism, an odd yet undeniably amusing sense of humor, and some of the most sophisticated songwriting that you are likely to hear all year, and the end result is \\"One Of Us Is The Killer.\\" All of the band's usual trademarks abound, here. Impressive drumming? Check. Inventive, unorthodox guitar figures? You betcha! And what about technical bass lines? Yep.

Top it all off with intelligent lyricism, an odd yet undeniably amusing sense of humor, and some of the most sophisticated songwriting that you are likely to hear all year, and the end result is \\"One Of Us Is The Killer.\\"<br /><br />The eleven songs that comprise this album can be cut down into one of two categories: The brutal and the melodic. The record opens with a slab of the former, in \\"Prancer,\\" a frantic, frenzied set opener, and a raging slab of almost pure dissonance. It boils over with sharply stabbing guitars, manic drum fills, sludgy bass, and disharmonic, throat-tearing screams. \\"When I Lost My Bet\\" takes on a like-minded approach as a piece of chaotically frenzied death-jazz-spazz rhythms, including strong, flowing bass grumbles, and stop-start drum and pummeling guitar blasts. Later tracks, such as \\"Hero Of The Soviet Union\\" and the curiously-entitled \\"Magic That I Held You Prisoner\\" are two other pieces of brutal and breakneck, math-inflected, old-school-esque grindcore with more of the good stuff.<br /><br />And now let's move on to the melodic fare. The title track offsets Dillinger's punishing mathcore with harmonic hooks and dreamy, ethereal clean singing. The album's centerpiece, \\"Nothing's Funny,\\" seemingly takes a page straight out of The Mars Volta's playbook, with its high-pitched (and, at times, almost fairy-like) clean vocals, and menacing bass tone. It also has some strong, chugging guitar lines, but most of the song is centered around sunny spots of bright little melodies. And it also makes room for some weirdly progressive choruses, too. All told, it all makes for one extremely trippy and nicely epic, near ballad-esque tune. Then, a little later on comes \\"Paranoia Shields,\\" which fuses in some more bizarrely proggy, Mars Volta-influence, with its clean singing and vocal hooks. \\"CH 375 268 277 ARS,\\" then, is a mostly instrumental interlude-type of number, with interesting, sinewy, progressive-sounding bass lines snaking throughout. And moving along, \\"The Threat Posed By Nuclear Weapons\\" finds the band revisiting their \\"Miss Machine\\" days, as it opens with some very Trent Reznor-esque sing-speak vocals. And the song, the album closer, is also highlighted by some really deft, slapped bass lines.<br /><br />And there are two final highlights that round out the set: \\"Understanding Decay,\\" which features a deft drum intro, and \\"Crossburner,\\" the album's arguable highpoint/epic, which clocks in at over five minutes in length and features a noteworthy bass intro and some really portentous bass grumbles flowing throughout.<br /><br />\\"One Of Us...\\" is not quite a classic, as it lacks the life-altering innovation of 1999's \\"Calculating Infinity,\\" while at the same time coming up short in the infectiousness category that previous TDEP works like the aforementioned \\"Miss Machine\\" and \\"Ire Works\\" possessed. But none of this should prevent you from buying it. It is a thoroughly good and memorable album from a band that cemented their status long ago as one of the elite groups in the math/grind/hardcore genre. And this is also a band that never ceases to keep building their epic discography, which is already one of the finest in all of extreme metal.lassic, as it lacks the life-altering innovation of 1999's \\"Calculating Infinity,\\" while at the same time coming up short in the infectiousness category that previous TDEP works like the aforementioned \\"Miss Machine\\" and \\"Ire Works\\" possessed.

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game reminds me of grant theft auto San Andreas Really good game and its cheap for a awesome game and I always wonder if their are chat codes and I'm going to check right now
B001OKGV6W|4.0|I order quite a few movies and book downloads for my Kindle  Fire.  I ordered this from Amazon to watch on the 6.5 hour plane ride to Europe.  The download was, as usual, a breeze and I enjoyed the movie which I already owned as a DVD in my home library.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Poor graphics, poor gameplay, nothing interesting. There are many other solitaire games which are much more interested and have better graphics.
B00AK77WPE|5.0|This is a great CD and DVD (separate discs) collection! The concert is amazing! It is so exciting, it makes you want to stand up and dance in your living room right in front of the T.V.  If you are a Juan Luis Guerra fan, you should definitely get this. It includes his best songs (classics and new ones). I highly recommend it.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|This game has nothing new compared to old one. Just another time waster, I this better to play some interesting puzzle game to train your brains.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing but I think you should like give people more time to earn the special people thanks<br />For your effort bye
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Truly amazing. I seriously fell in love with this book. I was very touched by it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow there is so much going on and in your settings you can change to no monsters that helps so it doesn't give my son nightmares
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This is a great book. You really get to see what it is like to feel like nobody cares about you. This book is emotional and you should expect to feel sad after reading it.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I hate it when a movie wastes my time by not finishing telling the story. All of a sudden the final credits just appear. A terrible way to end what could have been a 3 star movie.
B00164GDD2|5.0|I love this movie. I've only seen it twice, but I love it. The humor is hilarious (the form of Destructor, \\"What floor are we on?\\", and \\"Yes, they'll be very discrete). It will fill a room in .001 nanoseconds. Poof! Your entertainment is here.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie was awesome.  I can see how it would have been a risk to make because of the content.  A lot of people would be upset.  I was ashamed that we could treat another human the way we did and many countries still do.
B0089Q1TPM|4.0|I don't have it, but my dad has. We saw it together and I loved it. Rick Moranis was funny. I am surprised at the uses of the \\"F\\" and \\"B\\" words in the movie, but it is funny.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Best game ever it is my favorite game on my kindle I have been waiting forever to see it in the Appstore now I'm happy
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The parts don't seem to mesh so you have a feeling of being jerked back and forth sometimes between several completely unrelated stories whose chapters were shuffled together and sold as a book.<br /><br />If you are a fan and you are going to stay with it (you know you will!), the new characters alone are worth it. That's good because you don't hear a lot about old characters.<br /><br />Let's see what happens next.........there are a million loose ends!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This subtitle of the video includes Japanese. It's very nice and very good cost performance. Then The old concert video is great, too!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|One of Grisham's best. Not the hard to put down thriller we're used to-but, a page turner, you'll laugh out loud on more than one occasion. Don't miss this change of pace legal story that presents the best and worst of our legal system in a style that make the characters come to life.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|What an absolutely deep awakening for me about the reality of our food sources and the need to make some hard changes
B003B02O14|5.0|The plot is a little over complicated, but it is hard to put down and keeps you guessing what'll happen next. Well worth the time-and it will take you away.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I believe the merits of this novel have been discussed enough that to say something truly original I'd have to claim myself the actual Kvothe and complain of a lack of royalties from the use of my name and story.<br /><br />Alas, this is not true. So I'll simply say that the critical reviewers may have a point when they complain this novel does the bare minimum of progressing the story. It does seem to bog down in places, but Rothfuss bogs down in a beautiful way. The man could write the story of a cow's life and I'd read and enjoy it. I wanted more progress but I will happily wait until the book before I voice outrage disappointment or curses on the author's family, friends and pets.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Rothfuss for another amazing read.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|After all the hoopla and awards, we sat down to watch this movie at home. Now I'll admit the cinematography and the 3 D effects on a movie theater screen probably were spectacular, not so much on my home tv. Since it is most times difficult to understand dialogue with Indian, English and Australian accents; we always use the close captioning feature. Since this is not a feature you get in the theater we could actually understand the dialogue. When you can understand the dialogue and without the special effects , we found this movie boring and unbeleivable with an ending that we laughed at.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so amazing and has so much suspense, I couldn't put it down!!!!!!! This book is a perfect twist of romance, violence, action, adventure, mystery, and suspense, you be dying to read the next book!
B009AMAGXK|2.0|If you've read the book series, this movie is just a huge disappointment. They took out characters, changed some of the characteristics of some of the main characters, added a bunch of stuff that never happened, and took out a bunch of stuff. This movie was completely butchered. I am giving it at least 2 stars because the graphics were amazing, but if it weren't for that, I'd give it 1 or 0 stars.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Avengers is action packed, entertaining, and fun to watch. If you love the other Marvel movies, you will not be disappointed in this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it's a good calculator for home, nothing to fancy. I wish there were a few more functions, but still, very nice.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie is depressing. It had some funny parts but it seems like a reality show showing how crappy life is at 40.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game. But sometimes it does not let you know how much things cost to upgrade yay
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual Michael Connelly did not fail to deliver a good read. Couldn't stop reading it. Looking forward to Maddeline as a heroine.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Easy going and a real page turner.  Perfect for the beach or holiday.  Could not put it down.  Looking forward to number 4.  Loved it.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Nikon supplies a cheap translucent slip-on cap with the low-end lenses.  Slip-on also means slip-off and that's the last thing you want to happen in your camera bag.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like this game! It's very fun, great graphics, educational, and pleasant music in the background. And it's free! I recommend getting this game.
0451528018|5.0|I've never really thought of reading a Sherlock Holmes book before, but when I saw that it was the May read for the Unputdownables book club, I jumped at the chance to read a book by this author. When I told my daughter I was reading it she said, \\"I love that book, it's one of my favorites\\"!<br /><br />I love the way Holmes picks up on the tiniest thing, things nobody else notices. Also, the language and humor \\"Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.\\", kept me wanting more. The story didn't have a dull moment from the first paragraph to the last.<br /><br />My favorite genre is mystery and usually I have an idea or two of who done it semi early in a book. Not so with this book. There are so many things that sound like they're clues, and there were a lot of suspects, but nothing solid enough that I could make a guess, let alone know for sure.<br /><br />There was a great mix of characters, each one with their own quirks and secrets and I loved them all, even the not so nice ones. I'm so glad I found this book club in time for this book! I liked it so much that I found it very very hard not to keep reading when I finished what we were supposed to read for that week.<br /><br />I would recommended this book to anyone who hasn't read it, and as a re-read for those who have!
B0091THRCU|4.0|Awesome!! Product is made well and protects phone great. Lost it once after about a year and reordered!  My favorite case for protecting from being thrown into pocket or backpack.
B00CW665VI|4.0|The only complaint I really have is that the main character, Drew had way too much internal dialogue throughout the whole book. I wish there was more person to person speech. I almost gave it three stars but the last 1/4 of the book was just too good to short change it. The story for me just shows that love is not perfect but when you know; you know...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very entertaining and stimulating. I enjoy it very much.<br /><br />Your &quot;world&quot; can be random or specific with the use of a certain &quot;seed.&quot; Then you may build, destroy, and mine!<br />There are monsters to battle, crops to farm, and animals to capture ( in pits ) or herd.<br /><br />You can make differnet tools of different qualitys based on what materials you have, and you can also create new materials to build a secret base.<br /><br />Friends can sync to your Kindle Fire ( HD ) and enter your world!<br /><br />Overall it is a very fun game!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|When I watch disaster movies like this that have really happened, it amazes me how removed we are from the suffering some people endure in the world.  I heard and watched on the news about the tsunami that killed so many just like everyone else.  Your heart can be saddened over the loss of life, but the suffering endured when the wave carried them off into oblivion could never be understood until I hit play.  This movie kept me gripping the seat wondering how in God's grace anyone survived such a torrent of water crashing upon them along with everything else slamming into their bodies.  Naomi Watts was fantastic in this movie, along with the young man who played her son. What an emotional portrayal of life, death, separation, and the love of family. Heaven bless the poor souls that lost their lives in this tragic event.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|It's not the seller's fault that Disney blows movies out of proportion and then we are left with a mundane story and poor plot. And I've certainly seen much better acting. Even the star is almost mechanical. They all need to go back to acting school.
0345529057|5.0|I was looking to buy the boxed set of game of thrones and I was originally just going to go somewhere and buy them individually but as soon as I saw this and for such a low price I couldn't pass it up.<br /><br />My books arrived earlier than I expected and are in great condition. Love the series so far. Going to buy the newest book ASAP
B000007MVD|5.0|You have to really like the Beatles. Once that's established, you will totally love these live performances. They are awesome.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Although this book had elements of a suspense/thriller novel, I wouldn't put it completely in that genre.  It's a combination of mystery and suspense told through a series of flashbacks to a relationship gone seriously wrong 3-4 years in the past.  I don't think I've ever read a book with so many chapters, but the use of brief chapters alternating between past and present seemed to work without leaving me dizzy.  Sure, this isn't the first plot where the protagonist can't convince anybody something is wrong and everybody else thinks they're nuts.  However, this was well written and kept my attention from start to finish.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|This has always been a favorite of mine. This is definitely not the Daniel Day Lewis we know; he's better in this than anything I've ever seen him in.
B001LIBRL6|5.0|Woody Allen earned his acting and directing stripes and many fans in his early films in which he played a Neurotic with a capital N.  &#34;Play It Again, Sam,&#34; is one of those.  But it adds the element of ending by paralleling the story line of Casablanca, a film favorite of Woody and legions of others.  He cleverly mimics the tale of a married woman who, though enticed by the novelty of a lover, nonetheless chooses to remain with her husband.  Watching Woody play Humphrey Bogart's role tickles the funny bone.  Diane Keaton's character's own neuroses does not reflect Ingrid Bergman's character.  But this is a humorous bringing of 1940's Casablanca from North Africa to 1960s San Francisco.
193700788X|1.0|****CONTAINS SPOILERS*****<br /><br />I will state right up front that I'm an unabashed Eric fan (as many of you may already be aware), and like many others, I had predicted a HEA involving him.  Boy was I wrong.  For the record, I have never once thought I was entitled to the ending I wanted.  I do think all Sookieverse readers were entitled to a book that brought a strong conclusion to this series.  I thought surely Ms. Harris could deliver that, regardless of the outcome.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Instead, I found Dead Ever After to be a lackluster installment in a series I had previously enjoyed.  Perhaps even the weakest Sookie book of the bunch, which is a huge disappointment for a series finale.  Why?  Here are 10 reasons:<br /><br />1.  After 12 books and numerous short stories told only from Sookie's POV, the author suddenly abandoned her style to include an omniscient narrator POV.  I know the author felt it was necessary to show events taking place outside of Sookie's purview, but it disrupted the flow of the narrative, and diminished the charm usually found in these novels.  I can see now that she was practicing for her new novel series, which will not be first person POV.  I think that was a bad decision on her part.<br /><br />2. The main mystery plot of the novel is convoluted, transparent, and the motives of the villains utterly ridiculous.  Claude wants revenge on Sookie because she wasn't attracted to him?  Really? Copley Carmichael makes a deal with the devil and, as a bonus, he wants control over Amelia via the cluviel dor?  Why not just ask the devil for control over Amelia?  I was excited to see Johan Glassport and Steve Newlin turn up (and to this reader, it was obvious from the prologue who they were), but in the end, they were little more than flunkies, and moronic ones at that.<br /><br />3. We're suddenly introduced to a devil - but not THE devil.  Huh?  Why?  And is this distinction important?  Well, who knows, since he neverappears again outside of the prologue.<br /><br />4. I don't know if I'd use the term OOC, but I did feel a lot of the characters seemed like shells of their former selves - Sookie in particular.  I found her to be surprisingly intolerant and unforgiving - two things I would have NEVER said about this character in the past.<br /><br />5. Characters from previous novels flit in and out, as if the author was following a checklist to be sure she hit them all.  Quinn breezed into town, made home fries and ate raw hamburger, made Sam jealous, and then drifted away.  Why was this necessary?  Amelia proves once again she has the world's biggest mouth and absolutely no sense, but she's got a baby on board, so let's all forgive her.  Bob seems to be her major accessory.  Poor Barry appears, contradicts the action of LDID, gets kidnapped, and Sookie can't even be bothered to help look for him.  I would have preferred a better plot and less cameos.  Only Mr. Cataliades and Diantha are used to good effect.<br /><br />6. Love him or hate him, there's no denying Eric has been a major secondary character in the series - Sookie being the lone primary character.  Every appearance (and there are precious few) he makes in this novel is horrifying to read, as I'm sure the author intended.  It read specifically like a fandom smack down - with the author leaving no stone unturned to be sure his fans (those awful \\"literary fangbangers\\") got the message.  Sookie said she couldn't wait for him to leave town, and I have to say that ultimately I agreed with her.  Get outta town before the Maker does anything more horrifying to you, Eric.  Run for your undead life, and never look back.<br /><br />7. The pace of the novel is erratic.  I found the first half a chore to read, and put it down several times - an absolute first for me with any Sookie novel - and though it does pick up towards the end, it sort of slides into an unsatisfying conclusion.<br /><br />8.  I used to really enjoy the little snippets of \\"real\\" life in Sookie's story, seeing them as a pleasant juxtaposition to the outrageous goings on in her forays in the supernatural world.  But this time it felt like a LOT of filler to make the time pass within the story - as if the author needed a few days to pass for what came next to seem plausible, but she just didn't have any story with which to fill that time.  And jeez, was there enough eating in this book?  I have to worry enough about that in my real life, thanks.<br /><br />9. Continuity has never been Ms. Harris' strong suit, even with an editor specifically for this purpose, but little mistakes with names, etc. have never really bothered me.  Adherence to previously established world rules, however, is job number one in any paranormal/fantasy book series.  This book tosses all that out the window in epic fashion.  Despite multiple instances of Sookie being able to read shifter thoughts with her telepathy scattered throughout the novels, suddenly Sookie tells Sam she can only get a general sense of his emotions.  Say what?  Funny how that little impediment to their relationship could just be rewritten, Just. Like. That.<br /><br />10. The sex scene in this book was the most uncomfortable to read of any in all 13 books, and that's really saying something when a lot of those other scenes have involved biting and blood sharing, not to mention \\"quivering puppies\\".  I thought the passion between Sookie and Sam felt forced, and the comparison to \\"seals\\" was a most unfortunate turn of a phrase considering the reader is well aware that Sam can shift into any animal.  Yuck.<br /><br />Positives?  As usual, Ms. Harris has a keen ear for character dialogue.  Bon Temps continues to feel like a real place, and she can certainly describe a unique character in a way that puts the reader right in the scene.  For those reasons alone, I give her one star.  Overall, it was a sad end to a previously enjoyable series - and one that left an awful taste in thisreader's mouth and changed my opinion of the series as a whole.  I had been spoiled (by choice) prior to reading this book, so while I was slightly prepared for the outcome, I figured I could find *something* to like.  Certainly Ms. Harris could be counted on to deliver a satisfying and exceptional conclusion for such an interesting heroine, right?<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.
B007XF4J70|5.0|I bought this for me and the education of my husband. No person should make it to 30 without seeing this movie.
0553328255|4.0|It's great to have the entire collection of Sherlock Holmes all together in a two volume set and for the price you can't beat it. My only complaint after getting it is not the quality, but simply the choice of putting the two volumes together into one enormous book and one smaller book. The enormous book is a bit unwieldy. If I was to do it over again, I'd prefer a 3 or 4 volume set all of equal size.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was another great book by Nicholas Sparks.  The characters were likeable.  Hard to put down once you start it.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I went into this movie the way I have found it is best to enter into one of the Wachowskis' movies: knowing absolutely nothing about it.<br /><br />The Matrix:  Knew nothing about it beforehand. Was amazed.<br />V For Vendetta:  Knew nothing about it beforehand. Was amazed.<br />Cloud Atlas:  Knew nothing about it beforehand. Was amazed.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the filmmakers to take a novel that was called \\"un-filmable\\" and turn it into a masterpiece like this. Most would look for lower-hanging fruit, but I'm glad Tykwer and the Wachowskis took it on.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a great book with adventure, happy endings, and an ending hang off plus a cliff hanger. I love all the hilarious adventures and your 'shape shifting' throughout the story. You leave suspicions to everybody who reads your stories. Demigod s are so in style!!!!!
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks is an absolute genius... and I love the way this book was written.... I'm not much of a reader, but this is definitely not one to pass up!
B00CBRADU2|4.0|I saw this movie on an airplane and decided to purchase it through Amazon Prime.  However, streaming the video provided a mediocre experience.  The shadows became too dark to see any details.  I went to Walmart and bought a blue ray copy.  I was disappointed that a good story was compromised by the video quality from Amazon's streaming.  By the way I regularly stream HD movies without this kind of problem.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I seriously LOVE this app!  I am a self professed pinning queen and this app helps me to productively pass the time by on my phone and my tablet.  There are so many great ideas on this site- it is amazing.  Kudos to the creators.
B00C7L8DM2|2.0|I expected so much more from this movie. It missing a lot to it. It is very dry and unexciting. The acting is great, but great acting does matter when the content is unfruitful. Even during the action sequences the story was always in a state blandness. I don't recommend seeing it in theaters.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|It's a great app!! Before my family and I stay in any hotel, checking out tripadvisor is a must!  I love the real reviews and photos from travelers and I really feel like it helps me to make a better educated decision when making reservations.

0446572985|5.0|The Innocent by David Baldacci. Worth the read as is most of David Baldacci's books. Will continue to read his works.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|My son reminded me to watch this one again, and when I did, I was not disappointed. It is always a good idea to watch, read, or write a work of literature more than once and this is always rewarding. I picked up on areas of this movie I had not seen before. Good movie.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Will not run on my Coby Kyros mid1125.  Initially allowed me to register and issued a force close immediately upon trying to open a book.  Uninstalled and reinstalled several times with all new downloads. Factory reset my tablet and did new download, installed.  Same results. I won't try again.  I cannot access my purchased books. I'm fed up.  Downloaded an earlier version 3.7 something from another site.  This version is running fine on my Coby Kyros.  I like Kindle for Android.  Obviously the app wasn't broke, but Amazon fixed it so that it was.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great game. The game play is challenging. Graphics are incredible. Game plays very smoothly on kindle HD 7.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|Fun game that's a little challenging. You have to build bridges and have them hold up to the traffic. Great time killer.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I stopped reading this book half way through Part 3, Casting Off, so can only speak about it through that point. I liked the mysterious elements in the book, the layers of the silo, the &#34;world&#34; that the author created that has so many possibilities to develop. What I found challenging was the characterization. I did not feel any of the characters I met through this point were believable. They did not seem deep enough to be real or human, and in this way I did not feel engaged or connected with any of them.  This is unfortunate, as the world in the novel was filled with potential, but without characters in it that I really wanted to care about, I just felt I was plodding along without a concern for what happened to them.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Just too complicated.  I almost put the book down many times.  I can not watch the movie. What a waste of time.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Jack Bauer has competition. I hope they make more Jack Reacher movies. Much better than I expected. We loved it!
B00CTII57Q|3.0|I gave it 3 stars only because of plot and writing.  I give it 5 stars for how much i love the show.  This will not be long. I went into the ratings.  It showed that season 7 was bad. Really bad. They were not sure about season 8.  This was no surprise to me and i wrote as much. They fell victim to the same fate that House fell to. The writers of  House decided to get rid of most of the cast and wondered why the ratings took a dive and never came back. But loyal fans like me stayed with it until the very end.  Supernatural is a miracle in itself that it has made it this long. Most shows don't make it past one season.  Take \\"Monday Mornings\\"?  I love this show. It's new. 11 episodes and they pulled the plug on it.  So we should all be grateful that Supernatural is still on. But they realized that you cant take away most of the characters that the fans love just cause you want to play an experiment in your writing. So in season 8 they brought back Bobby a little, and Castiel.  That was a start.  It was revealed in an article that many of the subjects in season 8 are all an arc to go through season 10 then end.  But season 8,they kept a close eye on and it started off well, dipped down, and they thought about pulling the plug.  The numbers went up enough anyway , just around the time some of our other favorite characters came back.  So they kept it on. I did enjoy the season although not even close to its best.  I do wish they would go back to having the brothers being really close the way they use to. they got rid of the other characters we loved because they said they wanted to get back to the feeling of Sam and Dean against the world.  But then they don't seem to write them where the two characters are comfortable with each other.  To me, it just did not feel the same or as good.  Just my opinion.  They really have to do better with season 9 or there will be no season 10.  Also the contracts up, so if they ask for a lot of money for their last year, which i think they deserve, and the station don't give it to them?  there might be no finish to the story we have come to love.  I really want the brothers to be close as family should be and one of the reasons we fell in love with the show, and they need to bring back some of the old characters we love.  just my opinion.  Lets hope they finish the story arc and go through season 9 and 10.ey deserve, and the station don't give it to them?  there might be no finish to the story we have come to love.  I really want the brothers to be close as family should be and one of the reasons we fell in love with the show, and they need to bring back some of the old characters we love.  just my opinion.  Lets hope they finish the story arc and go through season 9 and 10.
0307277887|3.0|I read the book Darkly Dreaming Dexter after having watched the TV series. Like the TV series the book got me interested and intrigued me. I know how it would end hasn't change anything. I can't wait to read the other book of the series knowing for sure I'm gonna love them.
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M IS ONE OF THE BEST BANDS AROUND. GREAT SOUND WITH UNIQUE HARMONY. A REAL SHOW STOPPER...CD SOUNDS GREAT. THE BEST
0786915749|3.0|My first real fantasy book. I've never read anything like that before so I didn't know what to expect and was quite worried about the flow of descriptions and the story going quite slow.<br />However I was very surprised to discover that none of my worries happened! The book is nice and the story is definitely well written and not slow at all.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite stage shows since first seeing it in New York.  The makeup and costumes, the story, the actors are all wonderful in bringing this poignant story to life.  From the thrilling dance scenes to some of the beautiful songs that bring a tear to your eye - it is well worthwhile seeing again and again.
0553386794|4.0|I read this book long time before the TV series. I really appreciated the idea of a different chapter for each main characters. For sure some chapter are quite slow and sometimes you don't want to keep on reading them. However, you can't stop reading it! If you start reading this book it is better for you to get the books all together... Unfortunately it is still uncompleted, so get the published books and... keep waiting like me!
0767840135|4.0|I have seen quite a few Cirque du Soleil shows and have always been in awe of the acrobatic skills of the performers - this Show was one I had not seen live, and it met my expectations of some thrilling ariel feats.  Also it was an engaging story line of a little girls wonder opening before her eyes.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorites movies ever.<br />The performance of the actors is great , the story is very deep .<br />Just love it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Not very well written as in there is some random evil devil trying to get back at sookie but this character seems lost in the rest of the strange happenings..LINE DANCING!!!! Really!? Sam is a whiner and so sad it is more than irritating. Hard to follow and very very very disappointing. it was as if you could tell the author was tired of this series and so she threw this ending together and called it quits. You could feel the boredom as CH writes. I really did not care about who she ended up with as long as it was a good book but this was pitiful.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I love hill climb racing. and now that it it is on the kindle fire it has made it even better. thanks fingersoft
B009AMANBA|2.0|I tried and tried to get into this movie.  I had been looking forward to seeing it and I found it so boring that my mind shut off and even though I sat through the entire thing with hope, I couldn't tell you one thing that happened.  Don't waste your money.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|awesome book! even though, i like, reread the story ALOT of times - the story is still exciting and fun! although, there is one thing about the book i DO NOT like. only the greek characters get to narate the story- only anabeth,leo, piper,and percy get to narrate.but still, it's a great book.i would advise people who are looking for great reads to read the series especially The Mark of Athena
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! Now that it's  been upgraded,  it's even better. I bought it and now I can't put it down. I  recomend this game.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Awesome game. Great sound effects and graphics. Just wish there was more scenery. I love the body armour suit  that you can change into I just wish there were new screens for each time  you level up.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This novel has a great and complex beginning, you can't stop reading, but the end is just bad. Terrible. which is a waste because the first part of the story is really well written.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|For a screen adaptation of a great stage play, the director did the job as well as it could have been done.  Overall, I can't get enough of Le Mis and the blu-ray quality is wonderful.  My chief complaint is that the digital copy promise is just false advertising.  \\"Ultraviolet\\" is an app to supposedly stream video from a website and it does not work at all.  No actual digital copy is provided. No download code.  Nothing functional at all.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A great read for anyone who likes Zombies. Thoroughly entertaining. I never wanted to put the book down. Great book.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Had to find a replacement for googlereader - boo google. Feedly does the job with great magazine like feel. Easy to learn - actually like feedly app better than googlereader.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorate game. You can build anything fly and have unlimited blocks in creative mode and collect and gather in survival. Go to options and put on peaceful mode so you don't have to put up with creepers in survival mode. I highly recommend this game for almost anyone. Worth the money.
B009OA57MI|5.0|a flight simulator and combat aircraft game all in one. it is very easy to play and I would highly recommend it!!!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Will when I first got this app I was like we'll this doesn't look very fun but I guess I can give it a try so when i played it I was really surprised so that was good then I got to looking at the price of the parts for the car to upgrade I was very overwhelmed with the price and when you go over big hills the truck is kinda floppy so that was pretty much all the problems I had with it so pretty much yaw could use a new picture for the app and that all I really like the game<br /><br />  Thanks gamer
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Was a good read very detailed and intriguing kept me interested and I love Stephen King anyways so I knew I would love this book!

B0095MVOMC|4.0|I absolutely love hide and seek type games, and when I saw that this one was with hidden numbers, I JUST HAD to try it!!! The layout is beautiful; scenery is spectacular.<br />Finding the hidden numbers was pretty easy, but some were a little tricky to find because they blended in so well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating, was because I felt that most of the numbers were too easy to find, and also there weren't as many levels as I would have liked to have seen. Of course, it just might have been that I loved playing it so much that it seemed shorter! LOL!<br />As for the price of this app, I would say it's pretty fair, but for the $1.99, more levels need to be added or maybe the price lowered to maybe $1.49??<br />All in all, this is a very fun, entertaining, addicting, game. Try it!!!!!
B00A83075M|4.0|Very good movie. I took my son, 9 yrs old to see it in theater. My daughter, 12 has seen it now. Bith of them liked it and I found it entertaining also.

B00BJ60LJO|5.0|I can't do Justin justice in words, go out and buy it yourself! The best work he's done. There's even some &#34;disco&#34; music at the end for the younger crowd, and a bit of Bluegrass for the Westerners. Highly recommended.
1846556007|4.0|This is the first of the Harry Hole books, but I didn't read it first.  I found it a bit confusing with all the Australian names and nick-names. This is pretty funny considering the Norwegian names are so out there for me.  That being said, this book is an interesting way to learn about Australian racism, history, folklore, and a detective novel in one. I do read Harry's name as &#34;Holy&#34; now after reading this book though, and be sure to read book number two &#34;The Redbreast&#34; as it is excellent.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Elementary is tied with \\"Person of Interest\\"  for \\"best show on network TV.\\" The stories are good, the relationship between Holmes and Watson is the best ever -- even better than the \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" recent movies with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law (I love those movies, too).  The character of Watson really makes the show -- so well written and surprising.  Lucy Liu is perfect as Watson.  I hope they keep this show going.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Like all of the angry bird games, once you start playing you can not stop. Lots of fun. Thank you.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|It moved well enough for an if fantasy. The subplots advance, and don't get lost. Martin certainly enjoys killing his characters.
B00006GO99|5.0|Thelonious Monk's output was sometimes stellar, sometimes mundane. In contrast to the disappointing Monk's Blues, this album is of the former genre. Monk's playing is both inspired and lively; his signature off notes are always right on. The additional tracks, although alternate takes, do not sound in the least bit redundant or out of place. This is an enjoyable album from start to finish.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|I absolutely love her books! Always something in her writing that makes me Smile. Perhaps it's the outrageous situations her characters find themselves in! :) looking forward to another one soon
B00000DMJF|4.0|This would have been better without Revolution 9 and a few others. Still a classic, but it lacks the magic of Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Nevertheless, essential as a third album in a Beatles collection.
B003J5UIRS|1.0|Unless you love page after page of dry analytical explanation, do not even bother with this book.  There are few anecdotes of the children and their stories, and this is what interested me, not the clinical data.  I understand the need for the researchers to explain their conclusions but perhaps they could have done it in one place rather than after each story.  But, if they had, the book would have been more of a pamphlet. Very little to hold my interest here.
B000002UDB|5.0|In many ways, this album is even more essential than [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band]], with the songs, I am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye and All you need is Love. Who's going to put an audio CD into the computer to watch a documentary (that you will likely only ever view once)? The enhanced disks don't deliver any significant bonus.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Interesting continuation of the five-part series. I like an unexpected ending, and this book delivered. Thankfully, it is not the end of the story!
B0012GMVXU|5.0|This is Leonard Cohen's finest and most consistent album. Not one track is filler. Sadly, he never again reached the heights he achieved here, when he really was our man.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|Great app. However, am I the only one noticing that the sounds are mono?! Feels like I'm listening inside a small box...
B005LNAG82|5.0|Tago Mago, Can's third album, originally released on two LPs, is one of the undisputed masterpieces of early 1970s rock. Impossible to adequately describe, the tracks are extended pieces of rhythmic jamming, drumming, sounds and vocals that bounce and throb in an ecstatic, primal frenzy that is entirely unlike the music of its time, or any other, such that the music remains fresh and undatable. This package includes a second disk of live recordings, making this set all the more desirable. This is an album to enjoy for years to come. It is great party music on endless repeat, either extra loud or subliminal and attenuated.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Found that weather channel forecast is almost the same as my favorite local weather forecast.  Sometimes it takes a while to load the radar screen.
B005T86J0I|5.0|Hugh Laurie was unknown to me until I heard St. James Infirmary on the radio. Although not a big blues fan, I had to hear more. The particular appeal of this album is that Laurie's is a more subtle blues than most, taking its time to work its rhythm into your consciousness, but once it has, it is impossible not to love. You get 18 blues standards, a live version of one of them, and, in this special edition, a bonus DVD of a live concert in New Orleans. Don't pass it up.

B001O1ADFQ|5.0|By today's standards, this era of Miles Davis' work sounds rather straightforward. The flowing and easy music remains a perennial favourite.
0385737955|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves thought-provoking plots centered around a character study. The feel of the glades is eerie and unlike anything many people have seen, and yet we can somehow relate to the fear, wonders and joys of each character. I can only hope that the movie lives up to this marvelous book!

B004UPAIDK|4.0|I saw the first Evil Dead after the 2013 remake. Although I think they did the best they could with the low budget I found it more funny than scary (especially the tree part). I'm guessing the writer noticed this because Evil Dead 2 is a comedy, and a pretty good one at that. Very dark wtf humor with one of the strangest endings I've ever seen in a movie. If you watch the first one and wanted another horror movie you'll be disappointed but if you want a wtf, dark comedy check this one out! Now to watch Evil Dead 3 Army of Darkness!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This is another Michael Moore eye opener.  He gets to the heart of any subject matter that he tackles.  I admire him and his work.  If you want an education this is a must see.
B009NY43NY|5.0|A friend of mine finished the book before I did & she was not happy with it. My reaction was the opposite. I couldn't put it down & hopebfor another soon! Great story with wonderful surprises!
