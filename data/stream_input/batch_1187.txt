1451629184|5.0|One of the things that really struck me was when Jaycee talked about the reason she didn't run away from Garrido.  I watched Diane Sawyer's interview with Jaycee Dugard, the 31 year-old woman who was kidnapped at age 11 and not recovered for 18 years.  She lived in squalor under the control of her captor Phillip Garrido, a convicted rapist.  Diane asked Jaycee why she didn't leave when she was out in public at a local county fair.  Jaycee said something profound that really turned a light on for me.  She said that Garrido had her so convinced the world was an evil unsafe place and something terrible would happen if she left and that she was safer with him, even though he abused her.     Some of us have things in our life that keep us captive, like past abuse or present battles with addiction.  I went to an abusive college when I was young and vulnerable.  Liberty University, the legalistic school I attended was under the control of a pugnacious preacher named Jerry Falwell.  We were banned from listening to rock music, going to movies, and single dating.  We were barraged with sermons about how we were headed for hell but we could be the righteous remnant if we repented.  They taught us the world was scary and how evil everyone else was who didn't believe and behave the way we were taught.  The angry bi-polar god we were taught about was out to smote and smite the people who didn't follow the old time Religion.  We were manipulated into supporting the political hijacking of Christianity that Fawell and Pat Robertson and others championed.  As time went on and I continued to think for myself, I made a journey away from this rigid religion.  Some Falwellian fundamentalists who are still defensive of the totalitarian environment we were in at Falwell's school respond to my story the same way that some do to Jaycee Dugard.  They don't understand why Jaycee didn't run away sooner.     \\"Hey, don't blame the school.  There were no bars on the windows at Liberty, Richard.You could have left.\\"     True, there were not physical bars.  But there were psychological bars, the fear that if you leave fundamentalism you will be damned and tortured forever in Hell.  Thank God two women at UC Berkeley picked up on what parole officers couldn't see and set Jaycee free.  And thank God for those who helped me get free.          In my new novel \\"Stick Man,\\" I share the lessons I learned about how to recover from rigid religion and reclaim one's life.  The story is about a young man named Jeremiah growing up in Pittsburgh who makes a journey from fundamentalism to freedom.  Jeremiah comes to believe in God as a loving father who heals him, rather than as a punitive judge who hurts him.  On the Amazon page for my novel \\"Stick Man,\\" readers are writing reviews about how the novel has helped them get set free.  If you would like to read the reviews of how the book is helping bring healing to readers of the novel, visit Amazon.com and search \\"Stick Man Richard Rossi\\".  If you want to read a longer and more in-depth article on my past in the Religious Right and my story of recovery, visit  [...] and you'll see a picture of me under \\"most popular\\" articles you can click.      And lastly, heed Jaycee's cautionary tale and don't believe people who control you through fear, be they politicians, preachers, or newscasters.  Get out there in the world and pursue your dreams and live.  Your dreams are like the stars, even if you don't reach them all perfectly the way you imagine, they will still guide you to your destiny.

B00006AG5N|5.0|ELVIS PRESLEY-30 #1 HITS: Forget the twinkle in his stare, the curl in his lip, the swagger in his hip...as if anyone who ever heard or saw ELVIS could erase the indelible memory. Never mind the stellar songwriting contributions of LEIBER & STOLLER, OTIS BLACKWELL, and MAC DAVIS...sweep aside the stirring musical colorings of SCOTTY MOORE, JAMES BURTON, and THE JORDANAIRES...what really mattered was the testifying richness, the ear-bending clarity, and the soul-bangin' passion in that one of a kind VOICE. A fan of almost all popular musical styles, ELVIS eagerly tackled RNB, country, gospel, rock, and tin pan alley...and did 'em ALL well. Revisiting JAILHOUSE ROCK, HARD HEADED WOMAN, CRYING IN THE CHAPEL, SUSPICIOUS MINDS, and BURNING LOVE is like hot-wiring your brain to the greatest jukebox on the planet. Despite a notable lack of early heat sinkers from his SUN label rockabilly beginnings, and a trash-dance remix of A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION that's a bit too hip for its own good, this is a timeless roundup that's truly fit for a KING.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE JUMPSUITS
B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a story about how a poor African American woman with a very aggressive form of ovarian cancer unknowingly changed science forever. Her doctor took cancer cell samples from her without her knowledge (which seems to have happened a lot back then) and found her cells to be very unusual. I don't want to give too much away but the amount of research the HeLa cells have been used for is simply incredible.<br /><br />It is also the story of how her family have remained in poverty this entire time while Henrietta's cells have become a hot commodity within the scientific community. There are many questions that remain after having read this book.<br /><br />I am astonished that this is Rebecca Skloot's first book, she has done an enormous amount of research and has spent years writing this very important book. I look forward to reading more of her work.

0439023513|2.0|Maybe I need to give myself some time after finishing this book, but I don't like it.  The first two books were good, but not great.  I understand why, but with Katniss not being able to consciously love anyone I felt like we kept going through the same old steps; even in this book it was just like going back to the games.  You had to keep fighting and everything got put on hold.  At the end of the third book I realized that Prim may be the true love interest, of course not in a romantic way.      I just feel so let down.  There wasn't a big conclusion where you say finally, there it is, that's what I've been waiting for.  Besides war is bad and people are not going to be perfect, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get out of it.  Maybe making every moment count?  Again, this is probably why I should give myself a little while before analyzing my thoughts.     *Spoiler* I don't know if anyone else felt like it, but even though I knew half way through this book that she was going to end up with Peeta, I feel like at the end she did just because he was there.  Not because she loved him, even though I think she did.  I believe she needed him, but the author did not convey this.  Had I been able to feel their combined love at the end, which we haven't had yet, I think it would have been worth it.

B003H3IOLE|5.0|Some good books are good because of excellent writing. Some are good because of engrossing storytelling. Some are good because of fantastic character development. One characteristic that I had always overlooked was the setting, that is, until I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. In this book, the author seamlessly transported me from my living room couch to the streets of pre-WWI Brooklyn. She made me nostalgic for a world that I had never experienced.<br /><br />A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a classic coming of age book. It opens in 1912 with 11 year old Francie Nolan scampering about the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It is a book about survival, overcoming adversity, and embracing life. Through her adolescent years, Francie Nolan copes with poverty, hunger, and her father's alcoholism. She is a strong, endearing character and you just can't help rooting for her.<br /><br />I have no doubt that the author herself lived through the same pre-WWI Brooklyn setting. No one could have created such a vivid setting without having lived through it. I was impressed by the incredible detail that she devoted to describing the setting. And I'm not talking about insanely boring details like the arch of every leaf. I'm referring to the little details about life that many authors overlook and don't even begin to think about describing.<br /><br />For example, I loved the author's inclusion of the milkman's horse in describing the times. At the start of the novel, the end of the horse-drawn carriage days was imminent, but it had not yet arrived. Milk was still delivered daily by a horse-drawn wagon. For some reason, the milkman's horse didn't like the milkman, but he seemed to like everyone else. In this detail, the author showed that horses had personality. For all the benefits that cars could bring, cars didn't have personality. This is the sort of detail that brings the pre-WWI world to life and makes you experience a world that has long past. Someone today imagining what life was like in pre-WWI might never think to describe horses in the way that Betty Smith did. Unless the story was specifically a horse story, a writer of today might just describe a horse as white or brown, tall or short, because for the most part, one horse would be just as good as another. Including details such as the personality of the milkman's horse was what made the setting of this book so realistic.<br /><br />In recent years, the young adult genre has gained quite a lot of traction. It's become popular and profitable. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a perfect novel for young adults, but I hesitate to call it a \\"young adult\\" novel. It doesn't obey by any of the characteristics of a modern \\"young adult\\" novel. It is not fast-paced. It is not plot-driven. And it is not part of a series. Instead, it is introspective, slow, and thoughtful. It is a book that any adult can appreciate without ever thinking that it is juvenile. And yet, it tackles the very same adolescent issues that everyone experiences in their transition from child to adult.never think to describe horses in the way that Betty Smith did.

1594744769|5.0|I read about this book in a couple of magazines and decided to check it out, mostly because I read that the author, Ransom Riggs, used real old photos that he found to supplement his story. I mean, the photos weren't REAL old like super old, but I mean like not fake. Just old. I'm a huge fan of building stories around things in real life, which is totally vague and probably only makes sense if you had to write stories from Chris Van Allsburg's The Mysteries of Harris Burdick in 5th grade like I did, so I really enjoyed that idea.    Besides the photos, the book centers around a boy named Jacob Portman (blogger's note - I had to look up his name and I just finished this book 3 days ago. You'll learn that I am passionate at books, terrible at remembering names in books and some descriptive details like how a character looks. I make it up in my head. It's the complete opposite of myself in real life which is interesting.) Jacob is very close with his Grandpa Portman, who has always told him fantastical stories of growing up in a children's home. This children's home isn't like any other children's home, at least not any I've heard about. He shows Jacob a select few photographs of his friends there, some of whom are invisible, can lift boulders, float, or even manage not to whine throughout an airplane ride. Oh, sorry, that wasn't one of them. Girl can dream though, amiright?    As Jacob gets older, he starts to question the stories his grandfather tells him and eventually stops believing in them altogether. An INVISIBLE BOY!? A girl who can FLOAT!? I mean, who wouldn't question that. (Me. Probably not until I was 20...er...16...12?) Something unfortunate happens to his grandfather SPOILER ALERT: there will be no spoilers in this review. I promise. Something unfortunate happens to his grandfather which eventually leads Jacob to need to visit the children's home, aptly named Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.    Now, I don't want to go further into detail because this is definitely one of those books I mentioned in my introduction that is a \\"just go read it. don't question it.\\" (Or as Nike formerly and awkwardly said, \\"just do it.\\") But I will say what I loved about this book in the general terms.    1. It was creative. I like any type of story that I haven't heard a million times before in one form or another. As I mentioned before, his use of photographs? Genius. I wish I'd thought of it for my yet-untitled-not-even-close-to-being-written book. That doesn't even have a topic.    2. It tied, loosely, back to World War II and is set in Europe which makes me feel like not only am I reading for pleasure, but I'm getting some history, too. I'm really bad at history. This makes me feel smarter. However, since I know close to nothing about history, I don't even know if any of the \\"historical\\" information in the book is correct or relevant. But it makes me feel smart and that's all that matters.    3. The characters are amusing and resilient. They're mostly kids and despite my airplane jab earlier, I generally like kids more than adults. After working at Disney World for way too long, I quickly learned the kids are never the problem. It's the parents. Parents are a-holes. Kids, on the other hand, are usually fun and probably smarter than their parents. How does that happen?    4. There is enough supernatural in this book to keep people who love Harry Potter books interested, but it's not overwhelming. I, as an avid fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, am totally cool with the supernatural, but I prefer it to be human supernaturality. That's not a word. But irregardless, this book has total human supernaturality. (I know, both not words. So fetch of me.) If you're not on the same brain pattern as me (aka, mostly no one), I mean that the supernatural business is woven nicely into the \\"real world.\\" It seems plausible and it makes you want everything to be real because it's so cool. In words you Potter-heads can understand, *exclaims slightly whinily* \\"I want to go to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children!\\"**    **I swear I'm not making fun of Harry or people who love him. I'll begrudgingly admit I love him, too. I just sometimes am bitter that I got sucked into it when it's so trendy to love HP. Now, excuse me while I continue typing on my new Apple MacBook Pro laptop and answer my Apple iPhone whilst watching reruns of Glee...    5. The story made me cry. I think. I cry a lot. It could have been the episode of Buffy I was watching...when Joyce dies...it's so... Right. This book did make me cry because of the idea of being torn between two places. I think a lot of us can relate to that. Maybe you don't feel like you belong somewhere, but you're obligated to be in that somewhere and not where you're truly happy. It could be familial obligations or work obligations or just comfortable to be there, but you're not where you're supposed to be. Your somewhere probably doesn't have peculiar children, but if it does, email me. I'm so down with that.    6. Lastly, this book was easy to read. I don't mean that it's in small sentences and easy reading, but I sped through it. I'm a fast reader as it is, but I definitely couldn't put this book down. It was bizarre and intriguing and I'm a sucker for a first-person voice. (Can't you tell?)    Now that I've kept my promise of being less articulate and more wordy than paid reviewers, I hope you find the time to read this book. If you're like me, your list of books to read is about fifty books long, but consider adding it. To the top. NOW. This review was clearly an excerpt from something else, which would be my new blog, where I'll be reviewing books that aren't boring periodically. you can find me at that title booksthatarentboring at wordpress!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I bought this book for my Kindle because the plot seemed interesting. Being a King fan it reminded me of his short story The Long Walk. Having read over 2000+ novels I am not easily impressed but I was. I read it in about 10 hours and was engrossed the whole time. The characters were well developed and believable. After later hearing that the book is geared towards younger readers I was surprised. The book moved along at a good pace and the author made you route for Kattniss. I'm eagerly waiting to read the sequel which I just purchased. An overall enjoyable read.
0316066524|1.0|This book is MISERY!  I tried three times to start the book (each time with an open mind) and all three times i never made it to the end of chapter one.

I should have read the reviews more carefully before I bought this literary nightmare.

Its true that the story kind of leaves you bereft but that's part of the fun of reading isnt it? when you are so wrapped up in a series that you feel everything along with it, and you just want more of it? And if the author had tied up everything up in a nice neat bow then people would have been on here saying \\"oh she just did that so no one else could write anything after it and try to cash in on her success\\" people are just negative! Not that this is my most favorite series but its up there and I think people should see for themselves if they will love this series and not take the reviews on here too seriously. well... except this one.   ;-)
0762439009|5.0|My husband is a huge fan of \\"The Big Lebowski\\" -- I think he can almost recite every line from the film! I've bought him t-shirts and books, but when I saw this, I thought it was genius. It arrived when he was in the middle of \\"one of those days\\", and it made him laugh out loud! The mug and mousepad were the reasons I bought it (the scene in the diner is on the mug and is one of his favorites -- plus, come on, the mouse  pad will tie the whole desk together, will it not?), but when he saw the plastic toe, well, that is just perfect. Whoever came up with the idea of packaging these items in this gift pack is a genius -- just the right complement of materials for Lebowski lovers! A++.

Dark of the Moon was EPIC.... see it immediately..
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Based on Stan Lee's comic book, \\"Ironman\\" comes to the big screen. \\"Ironman\\" seems as an appealing superhero movie inasmuch as it has action sequences, a genuine script, and a pleasant acting.<br /> \\"Ironman\\" is the story of this inventor/armsdealer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the inheriting owner of an arms company. He has a playboy personality, that's why he is always surrounded by women (most of them models). So, he was in Afghanistan testing his new weapon for selling to the U.S. Army, when suddenly there is an explosion and he is kidnapped by a terrorist group of this region. Then, while he is imprisoned; he creates a special metal suit, in order to get out of that place.<br /> On his way back to the United States, he calls for a press conference and informs them that his company is no longer going to manufacture weapons. After this swift decision, he gains some opponents. Another day, he was working in his lab when he saw on television how evil the Afghan terrorists were with innocent people; at this, he gets mad and decides to improve his suit, but now, he uses better materials and equipment, so he can fight against them.<br /> A positive element in this film, directed by Jon Favreau (Elf, 2003), is the special effects which we can notice in the engaging action scenes, also the locations where these fights are being held are fantastic, and the high technology used in the movie is amazing. The concise and accomplished script is funny and engaging, too, we can understand well the personality of each character, it has some funny lines (typical of Marvel's films) and there is a contrastive variety of scenes and situations that are going to keep you glued to your seat.<br /> The most remarkable point in this movie is the main characters' awesome acting. One of the best performances is Gwyneth Paltrow's, starring as Pepper Potts, Stark's lovable and reliable assistant who has a fresh look. She is always taking care and worrying about him. She also organizes his life; for example, she arranges his dates, his work, and his house. Pepper calls to mind Alfred, the majordomo on \\"Batman\\", because they both keep their friends' superhero identity in secret.<br />On the other hand, Robert Downey, Jr. can perform brilliant roles, such as: \\"The Singing Detective\\" (2003), as a superdetective, and \\"Tropic Thunder\\" (2008), as an Australian who plays a black man; for this role, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. Now, he is a super hero and it is a role that matches for him as well. The supporting roles are also remarkable: we got Terrence Howard as Stark's military buddy Rhodey and Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane. Director Jon Favreau has also one scene minor role as Tony's driver and the comic writer Stan Lee has a brief part, too, as an old man in a party with some girls around him (Hugh Hefner type).<br /> \\"Ironman\\" (2008), a Paramount Pictures movie, is rated PG-13 for action sequences and violence. Running time: 126 minutes.r example, she arranges his dates, his work, and his house.

0553801473|1.0|I think I have read my last George R. R. Martin novel.  Virtually no plot movement, every chapter ends in \\"mystery\\".  How many more years is Martin going to waste coming up with the next book, and how many more books does he really intend to release?<br /><br />I am done with this series. Martin clearly has no idea how to move the plot along, the only other thing dying besides the main characters in this story is Martin's professionalism.  Maybe we can talk Sanderson into finishing this series as well.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app works great on my Droid. It has been well thought out and is easy to maneuver. The videos take a while to download but are very informative and the recipes look scrumptious!
B004Y1USJE|5.0|This album sounds surprisingly fresh and pleasant to listen to... Geriatric yes? Not really.  Think of it as a more mature album where the playing is refined, and disciplined.  Steve Howe sounds at his best.  The lead singer is fabulous and has a nice, gentle voice with perfect pitch.  Some may argue the lyrics are a little different than usual.  But I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of Anderson's often nonsensical/enigmatic lyrics either...  I can't get off that 30-min long title track \\"Fly from here\\".  It's incredibly addictive.  The melodies stick into your head.  A sign of a good album.  This album definitely contains many \\"signature\\" Yes moments throughout.  So musically, the band is just as good as it's ever been.  This is unmistakably a YES album. I would say it reminds me a lot of the Drama album.  Quite different albums, of course, but somehow, this one has a slight Drama feel to it.  There are lots of \\"prog rock\\" elements, but the boys are more restrained, which makes the music easier to digest.  To be honest, albums like Relayer contain absolutely brilliant moments, but there are weird and annoying bridges that I would have left out of the mix had I been a producer.  This album doesn't contain these long, awkward moments, which is why I am giving it 5 stars.  5 stars isn't saying it's their best album.  It's saying it's a strong album in 2011, at the time of writing, compared to other albums that are coming out these days.  If you're a Yes fan, you'll definitely like this one, because Yes is catering to their fan base here.

B004WKOCP8|2.0|Did you like Adolescents when you first heard it?  Me too.  It sounded exactly like a return to form for a band I cherished.  It's a song you'd hear on your favorite alt rock station.  Now notice where it falls on the song list.  Second to last.  There's a reason for that.    It's not indicative of the rest of the album.  At all.  And that's what's disappointing.  That's where the low review score comes from.    No, this album isn't bad, per say.  It's just... mellow.  As James Hetfield would say to former bassist Jason Newstead, \\"you're too mellow for your own good\\".  I'd expect to hear the majority of this album on Star 94.  You know, the same place you heard that Staind song Outside (acoustic version) when it dropped way back when.    If that's what you were looking for out of Incubus's return, you're in luck.  The rest of us?  We'll just go back to playing the old albums, hoping this is something they just needed to get out of their system.

0545259088|4.0|Forever is the last installment in Maggie Stiefvater's The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy. When I heard Scholastic had copies at Book Expo America, I literally screamed with happiness. I got ahold of a copy at the show and kept it as a treasure. But I didn't read it. Why? I was scared. So I let the book run free to all my friends, until Ellen, my editor from Figment, sent me her copy. So...ta-da! Here is your July review from Kay!<br /><br />We all know that with Maggie's books there comes a feeling of angst married with the joy of reading. You get both or nothing. And believe me, you get a truckload of teenage angst delivered right to your front door with Forever.<br /><br />But seriously, Forever was the book of patience; the book where characters fight their own ghosts. Cole faces his desire to disappear from the face of the earth, Sam confronts his need to stay Sam, Grace struggles to embrace herself openly for the first time no matter what, and Isabel finally stands up for something other than new shoes.<br /><br />In this book, you get to live Grace's first spring as a wolf, Sam's first spring as Sam, Cole's first spring as a decent human being, and Isabel's first spring caring about someone other than herself.<br /><br />Forever begins after a girl's body shows up mutilated by wolves in the middle of the woods. Isabel's dad, that dear, stubborn Culpepper, plans to bring the big guns into the woods to take care of the wolf problem once and for all.<br /><br />Get the big picture? I'm talking about helicopters, guns pointed, and bullets shooting cold-blooded straight into the characters you've learned to love over the last 2 years.<br /><br />So Cole's evil genius plays a big role in this game. His goal? Be darn awesome. Specifically, try to reverse-engineer the mix that's allowed Sam to stay Sam. He's trying to find an actual cure for \\"wolfism\\", experimenting on his body over and over again. But that isn't enough; the hunt date is coming, so Cole, Sam, Grace, and Isabel need come up with a plan, take action, and learn to trust the unknown. Fast.<br /><br />Forever is the book of longing, waiting, more longing, and more waiting. You have the chance to be behind the scenes of what makes the characters be the way they are. You wait and hope for Grace to become Grace again. Wait for Sam to take action, wait for Cole to not kill himself doing something stupid, and wait for Isabel to not swear and be helpful for the first time in her life. You read and wait, read and wait--but the wait is well worth it.<br /><br />Within the book, there are these three brilliant scenes that broke me in half and that I will treasure until the end of my days. Key words are: \\"If I loved you,\\" \\"Dress,\\" and \\"Shower.\\" That's all I'm saying. These 3 scenes...They made me stare blankly for hours. They were like a good chocolate truffle. So well written, soulful, and worming their way underneath my skin to stay.<br /><br />I loved every little step of the way. Does it feel slow? Yes, but in a way  that builds the feelings of longing,of having no time left, of despair at being at someone else's mercy.<br /><br />Now about the ending. When I finished reading, my first instinct was to ask, \\"Where are the last 15 pages of this book?\\" I'm still thinking about that today; drawing conclusions in my head of what could have happened. Yes, Forever is one of those books you might want to discuss with people. I have this bittersweet taste in my mouth about how the series ends.<br /><br />Have you guys read The Time Traveler's Wife? You know that warm, fuzzy feeling; not quite happy, but with hope? That's how I feel about the ending of Forever. There's hope. Just enough hope to close the series, yet not enough to make a happy ending for everyone. Which is perfect, because ladies and gents... I don't know if you knew this, but life isn't fair.<br /><br />Maggie knows what she's doing; she knows what she wants her readers to feel and works backwards from there, at least that's my theory.<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone get ahold of Forever.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Formatted it then quickly copied my game saves for a back up, still working now. If your gonna buy a memory card for ps2 Id always go with a 8mb or 16mb, the higher capacity cards looks to be less reliable then the 8/16's.
B000K7MMP4|5.0|I was quite prepared to dislike this version.  The Colin Firth version has long been my favorite, but this comes so close...    It is kept quite close to the novel and doesn't rush through any parts of the story.      This comes recommended as a splendid addition to anybody's collection.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad is the greatest show ever. Sopranos was good, but self destructed in the last season, so did the Wire. Every season of this show has been 5 stars. The acting is phenomenal, the drama is intense, the violence off the charts. Vince Gilligan is a genius. Bryan Cranston is the best actor alive, how can someone be so funny and so dead serious too? Anyways, this season is my favorite of all three because it is a journey into the heart of darkness. Walt, the meth cook king,  becomes Scarface and ruins the life of many for the sake of his selfish reasons. Jesse has a sight at freedom but is pulled back into the abyss due to Walter's actions. Hank are on the trail of Heisenberg while Walt's family starts to pull away. the ending to the season is among the most shocking ever. Breaking Bad is addicting and also changes your thoughts on morality. TV should end when this season goes away because there will never be something as good as this. What the Godfather did for film, Breaking Bad has done for tv dramas.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Great visuals, clear pictures, and great tips. Beautifully designed. Only complaint are grainy videos on my 4.5 &quot; phone. Would be great to have higher definition videos. The current videos are still very watchable so it&apos;s a minor complaint.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Tried this today. I think I hit snooze instead of the dismiss button possibly, but when I went to shut off the alarm could not find a way to. Even after I installed the app the alarm did not go off. Had to restart my phone.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I am so happy I found this on Amazon.  I bought the disney version of Annie and regretted it!  It just takes away form this real, original Annie. My daugther who is 6, HATES the disney version. I have nothing negative to say concerning this dvd.  The shipment was very fast and well packaged.  The dvd  was brand new, as promised and we have already watched our beloved original Annie.  At such and affordable price, why complain?
0756404738|1.0|We waited so long for this sequel and it is so bad. I don't think that Patrick Rothfuss' sexual fantasies, as described per Kvothe's superhuman sexual adventures,add anything to what could be an interesting story. Only Kvothe's character is somewhat developed. All other, or certainly most other characters, are only briefly part of the story and serve only as props for Kvothe's actions.<br />I may pick up any sequel but without anticipation.
1936719010|5.0|Steven Pressfield writes with passion and force. This book will inspire you, and give you insight into what is holding you back. He talks about the fear of \\"shipping,\\" of putting your work out into the world. He talks about starting before you're ready. He talks about how the rational mind actually prevents us from taking risks, and that our family and friends, those people whom we love, are actually invested in us remaining where we are, ie: not growing. This is counter-intuitive, and perhaps even radical to some. I can see how it could be misunderstood and upset some people, and yet, it rings true. This book is a wake-up call for anyone who wants to create. Urgent and inspiring.
0345444051|5.0|There are only a few books that I've read more than once. And this is one of them. It's a masterful story. The characters aren't as strong as in other scifi and fantasy classics, but this was never Clarke's forte. He was a man of ideas and tantalizing concepts, and this delivers that in full. The arrival and mystery of the Overlords and their subsequent reveal is something that will always be with me. The book, unlike many sci-fi novels today I'm afraid, is a much more fulfilling read. I was surprised to see there's actually a CliffsNotes edition for the book (or maybe it's through another series called \\"Sparknotes\\"), and poring over it, it made my memory and understanding of the novel all that richer. A seminal work in the sci-fi canon, and one not to be missed.
0307279189|1.0|Christopher McDougall's book makes for a remarkable fantasy. Hidden secrets, runners who go on for miles and miles, and a hope that you can one day hold such endurance and speed. For any runner, such literature is encouraging. Unfortunately, the facts Mr. McDougall lays down seem to make his book just what it fits best as: fantasy. For instance, Christopher McDougall makes all these claims that the Tarahumara are hidden, wholly unknown, and that no one is aware of their secrets or generally, their existence. Then he goes on to say that they have been in much-publicized races and done extremely well. According to Wikipedia, Mr. McDougall's history of their races is indeed accurate. But according to his book, their existence was quite the well-kept secret until... you know... his book came out. Which just doesn't seem to match up with their participation in known ultramarathons and other races years before the book's publication.   My other beef with this book is that Mr. McDougall doesn't `mix words' as it were. While some think that the use of swear words and innuendo is an adult practice and completely acceptable, there are others who realize that it's a substitute for a shortened vocabulary, compensation for a lack of brain cells, and/or evidence of an askew moral compass. I tend to side with the latter, though I will not argue with the former that it is indeed an adult activity; one that is quite prevalent among the adult community at large, from which Christopher McDougall is apparently not excluded. Sometimes there are things that are either superfluous or irrelevant in a book. And while certain people find anecdotal innuendo IMMENSELY amusing, it completely takes away my personal respect for them. I intend not to trust Christopher McDougall or the person who recommended this book to me in the near future.   If the author wanted me to believe that this book was truth, he would have cited his sources, showing that certain facts he presented were in fact, recorded in legitimate publications. As he did not, I have my doubts about his story. I never finished the book. I got to a particularly nasty description which was a lead pipe substitute for \\"the last straw.\\" I have read a few other reviews on Amazon, and heard criticisms like, 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater,' which definitely looks to be what I'm doing. But I don't want to read the book, constantly watching for something which I don't want to read and which I can only feel good about blacking out with a pen. I will not be reading Christopher McDougall in the future, and most certainly will not recommend this book under good conscience. People will probably read this review and dismiss me as being a nut about morality and censorship. I won't make any disputations if you do. That's how I am. Best of luck to you if you decide to buy the book. Maybe you'll be able to get your money back.

031261246X|4.0|This was the July pick for our monthly bookclub - it is not our typically genre, but was enjoyed by everyone!  A few thought it was too technical but most thought it was just right!  A great thriller and adventure enjoyed by our group.  It's a quick and easy read, flows nicely with a good plot and storyline.  Thanks Mark for the thriller - we can't wait for the sequel.
0345529057|5.0|VERY interesting books, absolutely true to the HBO series!  Books came within a couple of days (WAY before estimated delivery date) and were in 100% perfect shape!
B00518HBD0|2.0|Well, let me begin by saying I'm disappointed I waited 3 years for this album.  I have no problem waiting 3 years when an album is good, but this album isn't so good.  The band was clearly just going through the motions throughout the recording process.  It almost seems as if the band was just writing and recording songs that fit the bill of your standard verse, chorus, verse, bridge concept.  There's no driving force behind many of these songs.<br /><br />I have to agree with some of the reviews I've read... there's one standout song on the album, \\"When You're Young\\".  There's really nothing else to write home about.  While this album isn't a collection of horrible songs, they're just a bunch of mediocre songs, that fail to reel you in.<br /><br />This album should have been called \\"No Frills\\", because that's exactly what it is.  It's a watered down, cheaper version of the 3 Doors Down we've come to know and love.  I was expecting much, much better than this.  I would give the album 2.5 stars if amazon's rating system wasn't so flawed, but it's certainly not a 3 star album, so I'll put it down to 2.<br /><br />I'm hoping this album can grow on me a little bit, but it doesn't seem too promising, given I'm coming up on double digit spins of the record.<br /><br />P.S. Who are the 5 crackheads that gave me a \\"negative\\" helpful vote?
B0041TM5OU|5.0|This is the best vinyl record I have in regards to Sound quality. It's like the band is playing in my living room.
0316098329|4.0|I'll have to admit, as a guy it took me a while to get into this book.  Once I got the idea and the flow, it was a compelling point of view to tell a story. My wife loved it and discussed with her friends. With similar stories in the news on a rather consistent basis, the book takes on even more life.
B001IF252M|3.0|Bought this to duplicate my iMac screen on a big screen TV for presentations.  Worked fine. However, you are limited to the resolution size you can select.  Stuck with 800x600.
B004RC8NXI|1.0|It is really sad when you get your expectations up with a new Ivan Reitman comedy only to be bitterly dissapointed by it. There is a hardly any chemistry between the two protaganists (Portman and Kutcher). All we get is a bawdy comedy with a slow moving story. Kevin Kline is simply wasted. Just oh dear, yawn.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Moon is definitely one of the more interesting films I've seen lately.  It's actually easy to understand from a storyline point of view, and that's not something I normally encounter with science fiction movies.  Normally while these type of movies roll along, I'm left sitting there totally confused and uncertain what's taking place on screen.  Not at all in this case.    Let me state that I'm by no means an expert when it comes to outer space-type movies.  Most of the time I ignore them because they make little to no sense to me (because they require too much patience to absorb the finest of details).  Moon is an obvious exception.    It's about a man who goes to the moon to gather enough resources (fusion energy) to bring back to earth.  However, he's apparently stuck on the moon for 3 years waiting for assistance to come, pick him up and take him back home to his loving wife and daughter.  A good portion of the storyline deals with his ability to accept being away from home for all those years.  It concerns the emotional side of him and tests his patience and level of frustration on numerous occasions.      A good chunk of the storytelling deals with this robot/computer that's capable of interacting with the man extremely well.  It constantly guides the man to make the correct decisions by floating up and down the hallways of the lunar base.   This robot plays a BIG role in the storyline- it's constantly around.  The fact it's able to show emotion and especially sympathy is another fascinating element to the storyline.    Eventually the storyline kicks in even more and the subject of cloning occurs.  Now THIS is when some obvious confusion will take place for the viewers.  Why?  Because the main character has a twin clone, and he shares the role of lead character.  The question then becomes \\"Which one is the man we've been seeing all along?\\"    I will say this- the storyline isn't as confusing as it seems with one glaring exception- the final 10 minutes.  I'm notreally sure what actually happened there.  It's not enough to encourage me to lower the rating, though.     Overall, the acting is solid, the storytelling is compelling enough to keep your interest the entire time, and it's just an overall solid movie.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Not sure I would have paid $7. 99 for it but it&apos;s a pretty nice little cooking App. I would say one if not the best I have seen for Android. Can&apos;t wait to try some of the recipes.
0439023513|2.0|I was really so disappointed with the ending to this trilogy.  The first two books were engaging, intense and beautifully written.  This last book feels full of the author's strong opinion that no good comes from war.  I get that, to an extent, but she destroyed her strong heroin trying to prove her point.  I was literally so sad with how stripped of power Katniss became that I can't bring myself to ever read it again.  I've read the first two books countless time but will have to stop there.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is a great app. Has some great recipes I can&apos;t wait to try. I love the videos too. I learned a bunch already. A lot of work went into this app and it shows. No issues running it on my EVO 3D.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The tragic story told in the author's words is most moving.   The questions of how to protect our children from preditors, as well as why people with such documented deviant history roam from are raised.    IT IS MOST DISAPPOINTING THAT THIS BOOK DOES NOT HAVE KINDLE LOAN FEATURES.   PURCHASE THE BOOK OR BUY A NOOK IF YOU LIKE TO BOOK SWAP!!!
B004TTZHBK|2.0|can&apos;t really say much about the app except that the graphics, layout and menu look pretty nice. however, the app crashes on my honeycomb tablet when tryng to watch the videos or when trying to see pictures of the steps by rotating the tablet in landscape mode.
B004Q3UL2O|1.0|I don't have time to detail everything wrong with this movie.  But, as someone who works in the pharma industry, I'll just say that the way Pfizer is portrayed in this film is completely false and insulting.  The pharma industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the world.  Many of the actions portrayed in this movie would have never been allowed in reality and would have resulted in heavy fines to the company, etc.  I've read that Pfizer had absolutely nothing to do with the production of this movie.  I'm frankly sick and tired of liberal Hollywood getting up on its holier-then-thou high horse with coporate America, making fun of successful indsutry, and some how trying to make corporate success seem criminal to the general public.  Here's a clue...Hollywood actors and film companies make millions upon millions of dollars and are grossly overpaid.  The only thing they offer to the general public is lame entertainment that in most cases (these days especially) is a complete waste of time.  I have yet to see any of these holier-then-thou baffoons stand up and donate all their money and profit to the betterment of humanity.  So please, spare us the attempt at making an industy you're clearly completely jealous of appear to be evil.  It isn't.  Get over it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is controversial now among fans.  Some love it, some hate it.  So I've decided to break down my review in a fashion that should be useful for someone who hasn't read it but is a fan of the series.  I won't provide any major spoilers, but there will be some minor ones alluded to (hopefully very subtley.)  I mainly want to talk about what I think is the best way to approach the book.<br /><br />In my opinion, some of the people who giving this novel one star are reacting to the fact that this is not the book they imagined.  This is not to say that there aren't valid criticisms to be made and issues to discuss, but I feel that many who are vehemently upset are a bit blinded by what they perceive to be the arc of the story vs. how it is now trajecting.  A lot of people had certain expectations about the direction of the plot, and Martin does what he always does - he subverts expectations.<br /><br />I feel as though many fans have fantasized / romanticized what this book was going to be like and instead of seeing what it is; they are only seeing how it is different from what they spent several years imagining it would be.  Things they wanted to happen didn't.  New and unexpected things did.  The scope of the world increases even more, with new characters and new locations.  If you come at this book from the point of view that the only part of the world you're interested in Westeros, then you aren't going to like Dance With Dragons.  In my opinion, you're also going to miss out on some of the most compelling sections of the entire series.<br /><br />The thing that separates Song of Ice and Fire from other fantasy series is that the scope of the world - the sheer size and the depth of the history of it - is beyond tremendous.  We've got HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of characters both in the past and present, who are all brought to life.  We've got not just one continent, but an entire world.  It is a world that is constantly growing richer and richer.<br /><br />With each book the series expands.  I've often found this to be the source of a lot of frustration for some readers throughout the series.  For example, people got pissed off about the Iron Islands chapters in the second book, and bored with Dorne in the fourth.  Honestly though, there is HUGE payoff for all of that in this novel.  Now I can't imagine not having the Iron Islands in the story, and I'm grateful he took us there in the second book.<br /><br />My advice is twofold - read this book next to Feast For Crows and also shake off what you think is going to happen.  Don't get married to the ideas you might have had about the direction of the series - but also don't be afraid.  You're in good hands with Martin.  Trust them.  He's giving you a story bigger in scope than anything else out there.  If you come into Dance With Dragons expecting him to \\"refocus\\" you're going to hate it.  Because it doesn't.  It does progress the story a great deal (despite people claiming otherwise - I honestly have no idea how to respond to people who say nothing happens in this book.  I wonder if we've even read the same thing.)<br /><br />By the end of the book I feel like we've gotten to a major crux in the story.  Not only has a TON happened, but the events of the final two books have all been nicely set up.  Knowing Martin, the obvious isn't guaranteed to happen, but the way the board is set up now is certainly intriguing...  The cliffhangers, though too numerous, are all on their own extremely fascinating and discussion-provoking.<br /><br />There is a love interest for Dany which isn't all that interesting or well written.  Aside from that, I think there is a lot to like here.  People have been howling about how Dany's entire arc is awful, which I disagree with.  I think of all the POVs, it is probably the least well crafted and to a certain extent Martin's struggles with \\"The Mereenese knot\\" are apparent.  But honestly, it is the type of the thing that immediately becomes more fascinating when you think about it side by side with Cersei chapters in A Feast for Crows.  There seems to be a deliberate comparison of what it means to be a good queen here and in many ways it is actually quite masterfully structured / thought out.  There are all sorts of echoes and clearly deliberate parallel situations occuring that each queen handles in a completely different way.<br /><br />Likewise, Martin is a genius at subverting how we feel about a character.  There is someone you probably hated throughout the series who you will suddenly be rooting for with every fiber of your being.  Not many writers can pull that off even once, but Martin does it time and time again.  He even takes characters we've cheered for throughout and effortlessly grays them.<br /><br />This is a masterful book, in the middle of a masterpiece series.  To enjoy it best embrace the scope, embrace the new characters (rather the bemoaning the somewhat abbreviated time you spend with the old ones) and let go of what you think you want to happen.  There are game-changers here, but just because you're invested in what the game was doesn't mean you shouldn't be invested in what it has become (if that makes sense.)  In other words, clear your head, sit back, and enjoy.  This one is a wild ride.<br /><br />I'd also like to take a moment to remind people that the question Amazon asks isn't \\"do you agree with the amount of stars I've given this book?\\"  They ask \\"Is this review helpful?\\"  What I've tried to do here is present a review that is helpful for someone who hasn't read this book.  If you disagree with my opinion in terms of the book's quality, I'd love to discuss if you're up for a friendly debate, but I'm not interested in bashing your amazon rating (or having you bash mine.)  Please be considerate to what the question is actually asking, and if you do find that my review is not helpful, let me know why it isn't and I'll do my best to adjust.<br /><br />Thanks everyone!  Enjoy the Dance!
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|If I had never heard any Eagles music previously I'd say it was good music and I'd probably not listen to it more than once. But, I do know Eagles music very well and this does not do anything for me, personally. The music is too careful lacking the unique edge that the Eagles are capable of, and the lyrics are unconvincing. Too bad... we probably won't see any more from them again...
B004TTZHBK|1.0|On my Xoom this app seems to rotate into every position except the one that is useful.  I am glad I got it for free.  I can&apos;t imagine how annoyed I would be if I spent 16 minutes trying to get it to work and couldn&apos;t get my money back....!

B004TTZHBK|5.0|The app works perfectly on my EVO. Superb quality, beautiful graphics and videos. The best free app of the day I have downloaded. After trying it I would definitely buy it for its full price.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Riggs has mastered the ability to create a believable magical world that coexists with our own.  Descriptions were excellent, characters were interesting and well thought out, and the narrator was likable in a snarky and teenager-ish way.     I am a middle school teacher, and I'd like to use this book as a model for writing based on a picture (or pictures.)  I have no doubt it will be an enormous hit!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I always enjoyed watching Peter Pan as a kid growing up and now me and my son can watch it together.  It's a great classic that never gets old.  The extra detailed features on the bonus DVD is quite entertaining.  What else can you say about this classic?  It gets two thumbs up from me.

0545128285|4.0|Firstly I would like to say that to those who were expecting this to be on par with the series: Seriously? Come off it!<br /><br />This is nothing like the books themselves; It is a collection of fairy tales characteristically similar to those of Mother Goose. They are quite enlightening if you are looking to delve deeper into the wizarding world itself, not necessarily the story of Harry Potter.<br /><br />There are many reviews who say \\"this is a disappointment\\"... and \\"J.K. rowling made a mistake\\"... Whatever.<br /><br />Personally I enjoyed this book. Although it was short (a bit over 100 pages), I found it highly interesting and amusing, especially the commentary by Professor Dumbledore (which helped explain some of the oddities very well).<br /><br />I must impress the fact that these are a collection of wizarding fairytales and are meant to be a sort of background read for the last book, where these stories play a part. They are not in themselves meant to be an addition to the plot. As such, it is no wonder that so many were disappointed.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to go beyond the books themself and do a bit of background reading. I feel that this added a new layer of understanding (especially in the last book) and in my opinion it is a valuable addition to any avid Harry Potter fan's collection.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I am befuddled why people choose to bash Jaycee for surviving an 18 year ordeal. Yes, she has children by that monster.  I hope they can come to terms with all their mom has had to endure.  Sure I felt the book could have been helped with a great editor or ghost writer but then that wouldn't have been Jaycee's voice we heard.  It would have been another's. Jaycee and her kids have been through enough.    I for one sincerely hope and wish the best for Jaycee and her kids.  I hope all of them can sort this whole sordid mess out come together as a family and leave the monster's that caused all of this in the dust. That monster doesn't define Jaycee and it shouldn't define her daughters. They need our love and understanding and compassion for all they've been through.    In the end, I hope Jaycee is able to pull this all together and move forward with her life with the sure strong steps of a woman who has beaten back the monsters who stole half her life. I hope and wish the best for her kids that know the monster who is their dad. That someday they can put him in the closet never to be let out. That their lives will be the best and happiest.    Let them move forward knowing that life is not just about the crap that's been heaped on your young head but its about the strength and wisdom you bring forward with you from all those trials.    Blessings to all of this family who has had to endure an 18 year ordeal for the sexual predator that took her young life from Jaycee and her family.
B00506NRBS|4.0|I read Derek's book slowly because I didn't want it to end.  This is a delightful read about the reality of business.  I found it affirmed my path as a business owner which I found comforting and inspiring.  There are also wonderful short animated clips of key concepts.  Nice package.  Thank you Derek.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I was incredibly disappointed by this book.  It went no where fast and anyone worth caring about is dead or missing for too long.  Don't bother telling me when the next installment is available.  I have moved on.<br /><br />This series started with so much promise and books one, two and three were fantastic.  Book four stumbled and book five crashed and burned big time.<br /><br />This whole series would have made a great trilogy with the right editor.  Sorry but giving this two stars is generous.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|As someone who's actually read Dashiell Hammett, I found this movie fantastic. Putting the classic 'mystery novel' language from Hammett's work into a film based in HIGH SCHOOL was so completely fun to watch. I imagine those who aren't used to film noir and the classic mystery/crime language might find it a bit difficult to follow, but GIVE IT A TRY! Just roll with it. I was surprised how much I loved this film when I first watched it, and now it's easily one of my favorite films to watch.
0060977493|1.0|Like so many others before me, by the time I stubbornly finished this book I didn't give a damn about a single character (maybe Velutha). In fact, I was so tired of the whole lot of them that I wished them ill!  I was upset with myself that I didn't give up on this book after my second try.  This book is a short story on steroids; freakishly larger than it should be.
B003HARV7A|1.0|I knew what I was getting when I bought this movie. What I Didn't know was the the picture quality of this blu-ray disc is horrific. It came packaged with a blu-ray disc and a dvd. The dvd's quality is actually much better than the blu-ray. The blu-ray is fuzzy and grainy at best. This was an absolute waste of money. Totally disappointed! Very poor job of transferring to blu-ray.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The kingdom of Robert Baratheon is in peril. Whitewalkers to the North of the Wall are massing, much to the oblivion of everybody in the South. The exiled daughter of the mad king is gathering an army of barbarians while cradling three dragon eggs, ready to take back the kingdom. And a family is broken up by the actions of a drunken king and an evil knight called the Kingslayer.<br /><br />I can't summarise the whole series here, it's too complex and why would I want to ruin it for someone coming to it new? I did read the books years ago though. 2000 I read \\"Game of Thrones\\" and \\"Clash of Kings\\" and utterly loved the story. I can say that a lot of what I saw in these 10 episodes had a lot of what went on in \\"Game of Thrones\\" and several casting choices were perfection itself. I'm thinking particularly of the Lannisters who all look exactly as I imagined, especially the best character in the entire series Tyrion - Peter Dinklage deserves an Emmy for his work here.<br /><br />I didn't think of Sean Bean as the likely star of the show or of the best person to play Ned Stark but he does well here. Nor did I think all of the cast would speak with haughty English accents or variants of the Yorkshire brogue, but it's better than having them speaking with American accents.<br /><br />To those who haven't read the books and are coming to this cold - it is a bit slow. It wasn't until the later episodes that I really felt the series took off. This is mostly because of the death of an important character which changes the situations for everyone involved and the story really starts to come together. It's with the conflicts of the various characters, Daenerys plotting her return, the Starks and the Lannisters gearing up for a fight, and the supernatural menace to the North, that the books really took off and where this series ends, so a viewer could be forgiven for thinking not enough happens. I think Season 2 will be outstanding as the action will be unrelenting and a host of fascinating situations reveal themselves. Season 1 felt like the setup where you meet the characters, understand the world, and then got a taste of what was coming.<br /><br />Not that it wasn't done well. Every episode features beautiful scenery, costumes, and sets. \\"The Eyrie\\" was particularly breathtaking, especially with the cell Tyrion is imprisoned in. All of the actors do a fine job and the writing was very loyal to the books. I think a lot of the magic and a lot of the fighting present in the later books will make this series even more popular but meanwhile this series did a fine job of prepping the audience for what this story is all about - good vs evil on an epic scale.<br /><br />It's absolutely fantastic to see fine literature translating into fine television. I cannot wait for Season 2 to explode when \\"Game of Thrones\\" returns next spring. Definitely a must watch for fans of great television.ascinating situations reveal themselves.

B0053F042G|3.0|Movie itself has an interesting, although completely unrealistic concept behind the guy sort of time traveling. Not realistic, but standard science fiction stuff. Also watch the government propaganda within the film concerning terrorist and who is shown as one. Military surveillance of citizens shown as a good thing. CNN advertisement as credible news source. Pure propaganda and advertisement.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|\\"Modern Family\\" follows Phil and Claire and their three kids, Haley, Alex and Luke; Mitchell, Cameron and Lily, a gay couple who've adopted a Vietnamese baby; Jay (father of Claire and Mitchell) who's married a Colombian woman Gloria and Gloria's son Manny - all part of the same family and all agreeing to be filmed as part of a reality show to showcase what family life is like in the 21st century.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the funniest family comedies out there at the moment, having some superbly written episodes and clever setups. Favourite episodes: Luke's birthday party where Phil reveals his phobia of clowns only for Cameron to show up dressed as a clown for Luke's present; The Valentine's Day episode where Claire surprises Phil with the bassist of Spandau Ballet to play them songs because she thinks Phil loves Spandau Ballet but he doesn't know any of their songs. The bassist is played superbly by Ed Norton whose English accent has to be heard to be believed. Elizabeth Banks is also in the episode as the party girl friend of Mitchell and Cameron's who resents that they have a child now; the Anniversary episode where Claire and Phil role play at a hotel and Claire gets her coat stuck on the escalator. She can't take it off as she's wearing nothing underneath; the Hawaii holiday two parter.<br /><br />There are some things that niggle:<br />The whole \\"filming a reality show\\" angle - there are some scenes that make you wonder how anyone could believe that. Like in one scene the camera crew is in Haley's room while she's sleeping, her boyfriend's on the floor, and Claire bursts in telling her to get up - but doesn't mention the camera crew in her sleeping daughter's room? Also when the family leave for Hawaii and Phil sets the alarm the camera crew is clearly still in the house - so he's just locked the camera crew in the house with the alarm on? Conveniently getting footage of Dylan locked in the house as well.<br /><br />Also it sometimes has that moralising thing at the end of the episode where it gets all gooey and has that after-school special kind of vibe, \\"Today I learned that...\\". \\"Scrubs\\" did this kind of thing to death and rendered most of those episodes unwatchable for repeat viewings but thankfully \\"Modern Family\\" doesn't have this all of the time.<br /><br />That said, those are small things that are vastly overshadowed by the quality of the writing and the brilliant comedic sensibilities of the actors. There isn't a poor performance in the bunch which is rare considering the cast includes 3 child actors while Ty Burrell who plays Phil is outstanding and never once fails to light up a scene when he's in it and it's great to see Ed O'Neill back doing great comedy on TV again. Julie Bowen is an actress I've never seen before but was very impressed with her work here as Claire and Eric Stonestreet who plays Cameron definitely has plenty of excellent moments in this series.<br /><br />There's too much to mention in one review so I'll leave it at this: \\"Modern Family\\" is a fantastic sit com that's full of funny jokes, great storylines, and wonderful performances. There's so much to love that even at 24 episodes you'll devour them all in a couple of days. Amazing TV, great series, I loved it and I can't wait for the second season!of the episode where it gets all gooey and has that after-school special kind of vibe, \\"Today I learned that...\\". \\"Scrubs\\" did this kind of thing to death and rendered most of those episodes unwatchable for repeat viewings but thankfully \\"Modern Family\\" doesn't have this all of the time.

0679746323|5.0|Just finished Mao hardbound (630p) and developed pain in my left shoulder blade because I held the weighty book in my left hand for hours. I couldn't put it down. Absolutely  fascinating biography of history's greatest tyrant to date. Why the left continues to mythologize this lunatic/barbarian in light of historical revelations makes you question their sanity. Oh well, they also continue to romanticize Che Guevara even though history has established that he was a murdering thug. I don't know if it is the result of the left being in the state of denial because of commitment to extremist ideology or simply not knowing or wanting to know historical fact. At any rate the Mao myth continues despite the best efforts of historical researchers, such as our authors, to present the myth-destroying facts. In addition the successor communist regime is waging a public relations campaign worldwide to preserve the myth of Mao. A part of that campaign is employing a group called the \\"Fifty Cent Party\\", to attack criticisms of Mao and the regime on the internet. A good example of their work can be seen on this site. They write comments giving the work one star and ridiculing the credibility of this work and of the reviewers who give it a high rating. Take a close look and you will see that their reviews are sophomoric and non-sensical. Another example of the FCP's work can be seen on \\"The Coming Collapse of China\\" by Gordon Chang, a work critical of the current regime and giving the reasons that it inevitably will collapse. I highly recommend both books. They are history and apparently the only justice the countless victims will receive.

0156711427|5.0|Reading \\"A Passage to India\\" this time, the novel struck me as surprisingly spiritual.  At the crucial encounter between  Mrs. Moore and Aziz at the mosque she tells him \\"God is Here.\\"  Part of the spiritual quality of the novel is found in the spiritual exploration of various religious points of view - from the Muslim, Hindi and Christians.  One example is between Mrs. Moore and her son, the City Magistrate.  For him religion is about keeping order, particularly important when you are in charge of \\"natives.\\"  While his mother has a deeply spiritual view of a Christian God, believing that \\"God is love.\\"<br /><br />There is also the interesting struggle for Aziz to embrace the spiritual but as a doctor not fall victim to the superstition.  For him superstition is the past and he worries that India will remain backward if it doesn't free itself from magical thinking.  Yet he doesn't embrace Christianity, the religion of the hated English who are not just the rulers of India but the exemplar of the Westernization, the form of modernism Aziz and progressives like him look to as creating a modern and even free India.<br /><br />Yes the novel grapples with colonialization and while sympathetic to the Indian cause - more than a generation before India frees itself from the British Empire - it isn't blindly sympathetic.  Aziz is not terribly sympathetic - desperate to please the English yet also rebellious and full of hatred for them.  He constantly shoots off his mouth and gets himself in trouble, particularly in his invitation to take the English ladies to the Marabar caves.  He had never been there and had no intention of following through on his invitation except that the ladies insisted on his honoring the invitation.  Hence we have the plot of the novel.  Other Indians are presented in even less flattering light.<br /><br />I like the ambiguity of the incident at the caves.  We see the events through Aziz and not Miss.Quested eyes.  And later we have to piece it together.  We never really know how she came up with the story that Aziz was to blame.  Probably Ronnie, Mrs. Moore's son and Miss. Quested's fiancee engineered the thing but we aren't told that directly.  Perhaps Fielding's refusal to stand when Ronnie came into the club room is some evidence of his suspicion and ours.now how she came up with the story that Aziz was to blame.

B001676320|4.0|Let's get right to the point. I'm a huge fan of both, and have seen both live several times. To put it bluntly, EWF was FABULOUS, while Chicago was really quite bad! Obviously both bands have various personel changes. There's only ONE Maurice White, but Phil Bailey is still mind blowing, and leads a still super band. Chicago on the other hand, was so painful to watch. Once was enough. What a shame. EWF fans should have this for your collection. Chicago fans... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

B001TH16DI|5.0|I don't understanding all of the complaints I have been reading about these movies, involving the DNR and the lack of director's cuts.  The picture quality is absolutely flawless, with no signs of grain or distortions.  None of the characters faces look waxy or glossed over in my opinion.  Maybe its because I am watching on them on a 42\\" 1080P set and it would be more noticeable on a 50\\" or larger set.  I don't know and I really don't care, all I know is I love these movies and I have the chance to relive all of the adventures again in high definition.  This is seriously by far the best these movies have ever looked.  As far as director's cuts, I am not dead set on having them unless it really adds a lot to the story or the running time.  No complaints from me.  Great job, Paramount!

B000002KB8|5.0|Indeed there was. Trying to put this album in its historical context is difficult (for me, since I wasn't born at the time) but it is definitely worth doing. It is quite unbelievable that it was recorded in the late 1969 and released in the early 1970, to say nothing that it was apparently taped in a single day and the mixing finished in another. Now, the heaviest and most aggressive music at the time was the glorious ''Led Zeppelin II'' (1969) and the almost equally stunning ''Deep Purple in Rock'' (1970). Leaving aside musical value, ''Black Sabbath'' completely blows away these albums in terms of sheer aggression and heavy sound. If the beginning of heavy metal can be simplified to one album, this is it. The fascinating thing is that it has a lot more to offer than mere historical significance.    The album contains seven songs, five of the Sabbath's own plus two covers (''Evil Woman'' and ''The Warning'', the latter epic 10-minute track with Tony in fabulous form). Two of the original compositions have become classics and concert favourites since: the slow, dark and brooding ''Black Sabbath'' and the only slightly more cheerful ''N.I.B.'' These are rather compelling combinations of powerful riffs, exhilarating solos, eerie bass and psychotic drums. The black magic and satanic stuff in the lyrics - for which Black Sabbath were immediately, and wrongly, associated with - may be inane and puerile, but with such music who cares? Less impressive but still greatly advanced for their time (at least as far as heaviness goes) are ''The Wizard'' and ''Behind the Wall of Sleep''.    Considering the time and circumstances of recording, the album is rather nicely produced and very well recorded. The balance between the instruments is excellent and so is the clarity of the recording. The only caveat - more of a surprise than a disappointment - is Ozzie's voice. It sounds much, much more different than in any of the later albums, rather lower and harsher, but it suits the music admirably.     It goes without saying that the album is indispensable for Sabbath fans - and let nobody who doesn't like it dare call himself a Sabbath fan. As for the searchers of Sabbath's ''definitive album'', they are just a little better, if at all. The most remarkable thing about Black Sabbath is that their first five albums were astoundingly different, ranging from the bleak and menacing ''Black Sabbath'' to the elaborate and sophisticated ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath''. Last but not least, lovers of more modern and/or more complex heavy metal definitely should avoid the original Black Sabbath in general and their debut album in particular. At best, try something from the years with Dio and Tony Martin, but please spare us, the fans of the old-time rock, comparisons with Korn or Limp Bizkit (whatever the spelling). For my part, the magic of Black Sabbath lies in the well-nigh unique combination of aggression and simplicity, spiced up with some of the most memorable guitar riffs and solos I have ever heard. That ''Black Sabbath'' delivers splendidly.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|Stories about amnesiacs are not new. The movies \\"50 First Dates\\" and \\"Memento\\" come to mind. But S.J. Watson's novel about a woman whose memory is erased every night is a new and different treatment of this theme.     What would it be like to wake each morning having to learn all over again who you are? And who the person in bed with you is? What would it be like for your spouse, friends, doctor? Or spurned lover? On the answers to these questions hinge this beautifully written tale. The heroine of the story seeks answers to innumerable questions about her life again and again, while finding herself at the mercy of those who know her story -- and her vulnerabilities -- far better than she could ever imagine. The key to her self understanding is some advice from her doctor -- a suggestion that is perfect for her, a skilled writer.     This sort of story could easily get bogged down in the tedium of the amnesiac's vicious cycle, and it felt something like that to me about half way through. Yet Watson's novel is crafted masterfully. He knows where he is going from beginning to end. The story builds relentlessly to a satisfying, terrifying, yet unpredictable climax.     The author has a marvelous talent for turning a phrase, and detailing a scene with such precision that it was a joy to read. Yet it is Watson's first published novel. In that regard he is now just like Christine in his story. I can only hope that HIS memory will NOT fail him. Because I look forward with anticipation to reading his next novel.

This is a book that you can sadly picture happening when it took place and it is done so well.  The antagonists are awful and real.  The protagonists are flawed and fabulous.  This is a story that so many different kind of people can learn from and relate to in some way.  Overall, a fantastic novel.

0061784788|4.0|It's been two years since the last SIGMA Force novel--The Doomsday Key--was released. Factor in a crucial cliffhanger at the end of that book in regards to one of the main characters, and I was doubly excited for The Devil Colony...<br /><br />There is a traditional structure to James Rollins' novels with the prologue occurring in the past--either decades or centuries ago--with the timeframe shifting to the present day for the rest of the book, followed by multiple plot threads and a crackerjack story. The Devil Colony is no different. Here, the prologue takes place in Kentucky territory in the year 1779, and involves a terrific discovery and a brutal fight. The action then shifts to the present day and a cave in the Rocky Mountains where there has been a new discovery. This discovery involves Professor Henry Kanosh, a  Shoshone historian and naturalist, Painter Crowe's niece Kai, and a focal event which literally and figuratively kicks the book off in explosive fashion.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Grayson Pierce continues to deal with family problems including his dad's dementia. Quickly complicating matters is the appearance of Seichan, who reveals potentially exciting information that has a strange tie-in to the Utah anomaly. Also thrown into the mix are returning characters Monk and Kowalski who aid Gray and Painter in their respective missions. Lastly, there's the secretive Rafael Saint Germaine who has his own plans for the SIGMA team and is the main mystery of the book. Another tradition found in James Rollins' novels is the way scientific facts/mysteries are combined with rollicking action sequences. In this case, the scientific facts/mysteries include the appearance of gold tablets in an ancient Indian burial site, Mormonism, and a third factor that I will let readers discover on their own.<br /><br />There are many reasons why I'm such a huge James Rollins fan and they can be found in The Devil Colony. For starters, the pacing is once again electric with events happening so quickly that the book will leave readers breathless. Secondly, the action sequences are awesome. From the poisonous piranha-frog mutant scene in Amazonia to the thrilling desert duel in Sandstorm, Jim has never disappointed, and that trend continues in The Devil Colony in the form of volcanic activity, cavern fights, and much more. Lastly, characterization is pretty solid, giving readers a deeper understanding of the SIGMA Force team, while the twists he has planned for the characters are shocking.<br /><br />Negatively, The Devil Colony can be predictable, especially if you are a long-time reader of James Rollins. This predictability is due to using basically the same formula and plot structure in every book, including the combination of science & historical facts/mysteries, cinematic action/adventure, and a story that is wrapped up by the end of the novel. This doesn't mean The Devil Colony is boring to read. On the contrary, it's always fun and interesting to see what new science/history James Rollins decides to explore in his latest book, but it would be nice if he would change things up a little. Another negative is the near invincibility of the main character cast. After seven SIGMA Force novels, it's becoming harder and harder to believe that the members of SIGMA are able to survive everything that's been thrown their way. In the past, Jim has shown a cruel streak with his characters and I believe he needs to find a better balance in the SIGMA Force series.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Even with all of the negatives to consider, The Devil Colony still does a terrific job entertaining and intriguing the reader. In fact, James Rollins is one of the best writers of his genre. So dive into The Devil Colony as James Rollins once again amazes and thrills readers all over the world...that the book will leave readers breathless. Secondly, the action sequences are awesome.

B003Y5H59W|4.0|The Review:<br /><br />Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell lead the cast of Captain America: The First Avenger and it's another great movie from Marvel. Captain America finishes the trifecta of this season's excellent Marvel movies that began with Thor and X-Men: First Class. It also sets the stage for next year's Avengers film, to be helmed by BtVS and Dollhouse creator, Joss Whedon. Captain America is a comic book icon, but until now he's appeared in terrible, low budget movies. Captain America: The First Avenger is the first film actually worthy of the icon.<br /><br />Captain America hits all the high points for a super hero movie, while deftly avoiding the many pitfalls inherent in bringing such an iconic character to the silver screen. It's an origin story, but it doesn't get bogged down in the comic book lore. In fact it cleverly makes light of Cap's hokey comic book origins in a brilliantly self aware bit of movie making. Captain America will be and already is a great success, coming in at number 1 in its opening weekend. This is because in addition to being an action extravaganza, it's very well written and character focused. I had my doubts when I heard Chris Evans was cast in the title role, but he is the perfect Captain America or more precisely he is the perfect Steve Rogers, the incredibly frail kid from Brooklyn who goes on to become a super soldier.<br /><br />The first half of the movie focuses on Steve Rogers' attempts to volunteer for the U.S. Army in order to do his part to combat the Nazis during World War 2. Steve Rogers is physically unfit for service, but goes from city to city trying to sneak through the army screening process. Even though Steve Rogers is obviously patriotic, his heroic appeal runs much deeper than that. He is the eternal underdog and he naturally understands that it takes more than might to make right. His moral strength is what enables him to stand above dozens of physically stronger men and leads him to be chosen for the Super Soldier program that turns him into Captain America. The writers took an incredibly hokey origin story for the prototypical square jawed action hero and humanized Captain America to the point where Steve Rogers' alter ego takes a back seat to Steve Rogers himself.<br /><br />As ever, every great hero needs a great villain, and Captain America's nemesis is Johann Schmidt, aka the Red Skull. Played by Hugo Weaving, who has proven himself an amazing actor even with a mask that completely obscures his face (V for Vendetta). The Red Skull is not misunderstood. He is simply evil. If you have been paying attention to the last few films involving Avengers characters, keep a keen eye out for references to the other films in this series.<br /><br />Captain America: The First Avenger is every bit as good as Thor. It takes a character who I did not think would translate well to the big screen and makes the transition flawlessly. Great action, a great hero and a sinister villain. Captain America will be enlisting for a second tour of duty in next year's Avengers.Super Soldier program that turns him into Captain America. The writers took an incredibly hokey origin story for the prototypical square jawed action hero and humanized Captain America to the point where Steve Rogers' alter ego takes a back seat to Steve Rogers himself.    As ever, every great hero needs a great villain, and Captain America's nemesis is Johann Schmidt, aka the Red Skull. Played by Hugo Weaving, who has proven himself an amazing actor even with a mask that completely obscures his face (V for Vendetta). The Red Skull is not misunderstood. He is simply evil. If you have been paying attention to the last few films involving Avengers characters, keep a keen eye out for references to the other films in this series.    Captain America: The First Avenger is every bit as good as Thor. It takes a character who I did not think would translate well to the big screen and makes the transition flawlessly. Great action, a great hero and a sinister villain. Captain America will be enlisting for a second tour of duty in next year's Avengers.
0811875040|4.0|This has got to be one of the most beautiful cook books that I have ever seen! I have not tried any of the recipes, however they look amazing! For this reason, I rated the book so high. Now for the bad news....I just received a disclaimer from Amazon with an attachment from the publisher. There are many, many misprints in the recipes!!! The recipes are wrong! This really ruins the book for me. So, the high rating is for how the book and recipes look, and the mistakes in the book get 0 stars.

B004VUP8WK|1.0|I was excited beyond belief when I found out that Morbid Angel was releasing a new album. Their album \\"Covenant\\" was the very first Death Metal album I ever bought. I immediately was hooked as soon as I heard it. It was dark, evil, and well.....morbid. I bought all of their albums and overall I loved every one of them (with the exception of \\"Domination\\"), and even then I still thought it was pretty darn good.<br /><br />I have never sampled Morbid Angel albums before I bought them because I knew I didn't need to. I could always depend on them to release some kick ass metal. But, for whatever reason, I decided to listen to samples of this album before I bought it. It is a good thing I did. When I heard the very first song, my immediate thought was \\"Is this some kind of sick joke?\\" Then I thought that maybe it was just a fluke and that was the only horrible song on the album, so I listened to the rest of the songs. That was when I realized that it was pure CRAP!<br /><br />The music is terrible and the song titles and lyrics are cheesy. It is like they are 12 year olds that started a metal band and couldn't think of any other worthwhile songs or lyrics. I asked myself \\"Why is this album so crappy?\\" Is it because they have been around for so long that they ran out of subjects for songs? Is it because they are trying to become more \\"mainstream\\"? Is it because they just don't care anymore? No matter what the reason is for them releasing this utter piece of crap, I hope it is only temporary insanity on their part and they can get back to what they have always done best......kick ass, dark, evil death metal.<br /><br />Basically, in case you are new to metal and are deciding whether or not to buy this album, if my scathing review and the many other negative reviews don't sink in, let me put it bluntly......DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY BUYING THIS ALBUM! If you want to get a sense of the TRUE Morbid Angel, buy any of their other albums. I wouldn't even want this album if it was free.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 1 star is because they don't go any lower.only reason I gave it 1 star is because they don't go any lower.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|This series is great. It caught my attention from the first episode to the season finale. The violence and adult material might offend some people but I believe it truly reflects this period of time.  It also adds to the captivation of this series. I can not wait for Spartacus to return.

1451629184|3.0|First, let me say that I give 5 stars for Jaycee the woman/mother/daughter.  She is a true inspiration for us all.  What she went through over those 18 years is just horrible.  I give this memoir 3 stars though because I do feel that the story is missing a tremendous amount around the psychology of why it appears that she did not attempt to escape and how she, to a degree, learned to live with her kidnappers.  I believe under the surface that Jaycee not having a true father figure played into how things played out.  I certainly picked up that she had very serious issues with her step-father (Carl) and she did not want to return to a situation with him in the picture.  The possibility of escape also became more complicated when she had the girls.  There is also the psychological history of her kidnappers which is not addressed here.  Thank god for her mom, sister, and aunt as it kept her hope burning ever so lightly over the years.    All in all this book was a way for Jaycee to help heal.  We learned a little as she continues with her reunification process.  There is a more detailed book to be published down the road but lets give her time to decide when or if she chooses to write that book.
B0056BMK6K|2.0|And John Locke knows who you are. You are an author who has a great story or unique idea, and Locke is trying to sell you a template that worked for him and has no hope of working for you.<br /><br />When one person implements a unique idea, it works for that person. But when everyone uses the same template, it becomes old and stale, and it is not going to work nearly as effectively, if at all.<br /><br />Locke's system, in a nutshell, is to set goals (always a great idea), write a book, get it into print, create a website, create a blog, build a mailing list of people who will buy your next book, and most important, get 100 quality Twitter followers. When you attain these 100 quality Twitter followers (about 3 months of 24/7 work, by the way), that's when you send out tweets filled with hashtags and links about your heartfelt, life-changing blog, and that's when everyone on Twitter will \\"discover\\" you.<br /><br />Forget about that ever happening -- so many of your followers are tweeting so many links and hashtags that your tweets will be steamrolled into oblivion. You will never be discovered on Twitter.<br /><br />The rest of Locke's book is shameless self promotion -- fully half the content are stories from his past, his current writing, his websites, how much his fans love him, how great it is to be a bestselling author, and more personal accolades. His system could have been summarized with a pamphlet, but he implores you to read the book cover to cover so you can read about every book he's ever written in the hopes you will buy his other books.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Locke! Game, set and match -- you've fooled us all.<br /><br />Save yourself some money and frustration, and Google \\"ways to promote an eBook\\" (using the quotes) and you'll get all the free advice you need from the 10,300 results. Unique advice is worth nothing when everyone's doing the same thing; that's the fallacy of a fad. You want a bestseller? You want to go viral? Work very hard and think of a unique marketing system, as Locke did. I applaud him for his sales numbers and his brilliance in marketing himself, which is why I am giving him 2 stars, but no one should expect to repeat his success.<br /><br />And to prove that last sentence, this is me shamelessly promoting my eBook on a heavily trafficked site: [[ASIN:B005DOSJRY Taking Conservatives Behind the Woodshed: The Right Has Never Been So Wrong]]<br /><br />Does it work?

B004UA8D1O|5.0|Over all this is a fairly good movie based on a true story line. Watching it in 3D was okay but nothing spectacular, 2D would do just as well. If you like these type of underground adventures you will enjoy this, not much excitement and alot of tragic moments. All I know is I wouldn't want to be underground trying to find a way out knowing your light source is limited, once that is gone so are you. It is worth seeing but not a great movie.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not a huge Scifi nut, but my wife and I were given Firefly as a gift.  I remember when it was on TV and I never bothered to watch because it looked like a goofy western set in space.     My mistake.      Like I said, we were given it as a gift.  We had it for at least a year before we bothered to watch it.      My mistake.  Again.      It was great!  The characters are incredibly likeable, the plots are a good mix of serious and silly, and the overall effect is great TV.  I wish I and others would have given it a chance when it mattered - then there would be more episodes to enjoy now.
0553801473|5.0|As some others have said, this book seems to be drawing a lot of negative reviews because it was not the book people had dreamed up in their heads. I guess that's what happens when you have 6 years to think about what is going to happen in the next book. But regardless of what these people say, it DOES progress the story, and it moves everything into place for the grand conclusion (I think). You have to remember, this book basically goes hand-in-hand with AFFC, which means that it's still dealing with the fallout from all the events in ASOS. But that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. All the storylines are interesting, and there are a lot of things that happen which we did NOT see comming, and isn't that better than a book that played out exactly as we had imagined? And of course, Martin's writing style is great, as usual. I couldn't put DANCE down, and the worst part about it was that it ended. In all honesty, I'd probably rate it 4/5 stars, but I'm giving it 5/5 in an attempt to somewhat counterbalance all the 1 and 2 star reviews.

0545259088|5.0|Reading Forever was bitter-sweet. You want to know the conclusion and have the reassurance that everything is going to be right in the world before it's over but at the same time, you don't want the story to end. At least I didn't. Maggie Stiefvater has an amazing gift. I think her writing is so fluid and beautiful. The way she can write the simplest of phrases is stunning. Many times I found myself reread a line over and over again in awe of the beauty of it. I see her writing like a contemporary dance routine. It's beautifully crafted, whimsical, and lyrical; able to convey a variety of emotion from a beautiful song or melody. When I thought of this analogy, I immediately thought of this dance routine that I saw on \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" television show that I love to watch. I think about how bad Sam wants Grace and how much he wishes he could fix her. And the wanting...there is so much wanting. Just reading the words on the page, I could feel the ache of wanting pulling at me.<br /><br />The story, as in Linger, is in Sam, Grace, Isabel and Cole's points of view. I loved reading the story this way. Maggie gives us just enough from each person to keep you turning that page to see what will happen to who next. I can't speak to the plot of this story much because I don't want to spoil a single moment for you. Twenty pages in and I already felt like I wanted to cry with the beauty of it all. I can't say enough how fantastic the writing is.  But I have to mention how incredibly sweet Sam still is and he is completely perfect in every way. The love and need he has for Grace in unmeasurable. Cole on the other hand became a fast favorite when he appeared in Linger and I can't say enough on how much I loved him in Forever. He became alive and driven and I enjoyed every minute seeing the change in him from where he once started out in Linger. It is truly refreshing to have a book with two main male leads that you love so much because they are after two separate girls. It's something I don't think we see much of in the books we have today.<br /><br />Everyone wants to know how it ends. Well you'll have to read that to see for your self. I actually thought I was going to make it through this book without crying since Shiver and Linger proved impossible for me to restrain my tears. I thought I was home free, no tears. ten or so chapters from the end and the bottom fell out. I was sobbing, trying so hard not to get tears and snot on my sweet little advanced readers copy; to keep it in the perfect condition it arrived in. All the while, asking myself, \\"WHY?! How Maggie?? How can you be so cruel to me?!! Then the end came and I flipped back to the last page and read it again and then one more time for good measure because that was it. I closed the book, ending the final chapter of The Wolves of Mercy Falls.

0525422943|4.0|My Thoughts:  WHERE SHE WENT was from my understanding, an unexpected sequel. How wonderful I thought it was when I found out that Gayle Forman was going to being giving up more and this time it's all from Adam's prospective. With If I Stay, the emotions of the story, what Mia went through with the lost of her family and the heartbreaking decision she had to make, had me sobbing uncontrollably once I finished. So when I read the synopsis for Where She Went and found out it was more or less what Adam when through since the three and a half years Mia left him, I was devastated all over again. Just the mere knowledge of knowing, that everything Mia went though, what she survived but they couldn't be together, really tore my heart apart.<br /><br /> In Where She Went, we follow Adam as he gets ready to leave from New York to do a tour over seas with his band. In a chance meeting, he and Mia meet up for the first time after three and a half years. Every other chapter alternates between either a flashback to the past or the present day. We get more inside information on what actually happened after Mia woke up and feel how the breakup affected Adam and the path his heartbreak led him down.<br /><br /> I really enjoyed this book. The inside turmoil that Adam is going through due to his breakup with Mia was so heartbreaking. I felt so sad for him and hated Mia for what she'd done to him. But there is a side to every story and I think Mrs. Forman left us with just the right amount of closure we all needed to be satisfied with the ending she gave us.<br /><br /> If I had to compare this to the first book, If I Stay, I would say that the first one better. Though I could feel the emotions Adam was going through they didn't feel strong enough when he expressed himself toward Mia. I just wanted more. I wanted to see him show his weakness physically toward Mia. I wanted to see him yell, scream and cry at her. Because that's what he had been doing on the inside anyway.<br /><br /> Overall, it was a fantastic conclusion to the story. Ms. Forman has a very appealing writing style and I look forward to reading more of her work.<br /><br />Definitely pick this book up if you've read If I Stay.lusion to the story.

B004SGWYW4|4.0|This Anime is not for the fan who are not ready for Bloody, Violent, and Mature situation. I personally love this anime. There are a lot of sex related jokes that you will think go too far, But will be laughing so hard that you wouldn't care until after the fact. The dubbing company is fairly new and unheard of, But they did a really good job with this one. Only real complaint I had with there dubbing job was that they added a lot of not really needed swearing. If you are into Mature animes, you will love this one. If you aren't, I would recommend something more like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I hope this helps.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|No spoilers here, because I hope you'll see this fun film!<br /><br />The title gives you the main plot.  Aliens encounter Earthlings, but they don't do it in the modern era, but back 125 years ago, perhaps 20 years after the Civil War.  And why not?  Do aliens wait until the present time to decide to take a side trip to good ole Earth?<br /><br />Playing as a straight Western, which is where most of the movie is set, Cowboys and Aliens is a pretty darn good one.  Based upon a graphic novel (fancy comic book), C&A has a great look.  It's dirty and dusty, and the small, dying Western town looks just right. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique uses the New Mexico locations to his advantage here.  The rugged landscape is forbidding, stark, and desolate.<br /><br />The plot as a Western isn't terribly original, but it's a decent one.  There are good guys in the town, and bad guys, with a ne're-do-well son of the town's richest citizen making trouble as they just seem wont to do.<br /><br />Then, the aliens show up.<br /><br />The special effects, some of which are done by Industrial Light and Magic, and as good as you'd expect (although why do aliens always have to be so complex looking?  They ooze mucus, they have body parts which open up and reveal surprises, and they just don't look as streamlined as, say, humans do.).  Anyway, the special effects are excellent, the flying craft excellent, and the explosions are very well done.<br /><br />Over all, the film gets four-and-a-half stars.  Harrison Ford is looking as craggy as he ages nicely.  Daniel Craig is as tough as they come, and Olivia Wilde (best known as one of the docs from 'House') is pretty, thin, and angular as you remember.  The pace never falters, and the action non-stop, and there are the predictable surprises that bring a big gasp from the audience.  There are a few plot 'huhs?', such as the reason for the aliens moseying down the space trail to Earth, but it is internally consistent if you buy why they are here.<br /><br />Recommended.  A good, solid, big-budget summer blockbuster from Dreamworks.udget summer blockbuster from Dreamworks.

Being a young adult during those troubled times, refuge and escape were found in the music..and what great music we had!  Of course, in 1972 a group soared onto the scene, introducing us to both country rock and \\"California rock\\"--those hitmaking Eagles.<br />This debut album contains all the elements that would eventually propel them into super-stardom.  Henley, Frey, Leadon, Meisner used tight vocal harmonies and an eclectic blend of songs to make this a stunning debut.<br />Who hasn't sung along at some time driving down the road with TAKE IT EASY?  Or done a slow grind dancing to WITCHY WOMAN.  Chimed in around the campfire with PEACEFUL EASY FEELING. Even the lesser known tunes on this album could have all been hit singles:  The rocking CHUG ALL NIGHT, NIGHTINGALE, TRYIN; the steamy TAKE THE DEVIL; the chirping EARLYBIRD; the lovely MOST OF US ARE SAD and TRAIN LEAVES HERE THIS  MORNING with those sumptuous harmonies.<br />Over the years, the band experienced lots of changes and discord but always delivered top-notch music.  Henley and Frey had successful solo careers and finally reunited when \\"hell froze over.\\"  One can't recall the 70's without a fond tip of the stylus to the EAGLES.

The characters are so dynamic and have good heads on their shoulders. Halfway through the book I thought it was over but I was very wrong-- so many more suspenseful moments occured. I literally found myself sweating like crazy after an 11 page long scene.     The romance in the book just got deeper and deeper. It rivals Twilight's romantic tension.    Please read this book. I promise you, you won't put it down.

This took about 12 to 15C off of my idle temperature with as good or better temp drop off while gaming.  My temperatures weren't completely terrible before install so in a situation where you really are running hot it may do even better.  As many people have posted, the directions that come with it are a complete joke.  I've never seen instructions so bad.  On my \\"setting up\\" rating, it gets saved with a 3 star rating because of the video that they posted on youtube.  Without the video, setting up would've definitely been a 1 star.

Mind you, this is an enjoyable book - but it is not academic.

Overall, the writing style is great and anecdotal research entertaining. But be wary of using this book as your guide to economic understanding.

Some are fear, lack of education, conformity and acceptance into our social groups, perceived threat to well being, jealousy.....to name a few. Hirsi explains some of the prejudices she learned against \\"infidels,\\" (non believers.)<br />Her story takes us on her journey as her mindset changes.<br /><br />This will give you insight.<br />Bravo to Ayaan Hirsi for telling her tale.

1401307787|5.0|I think this is the perfect beginner's meditation guide, and reference for the times one needs to get back to the simple basics of meditation. I have my own copy as a reference and buy it for any friend or family member who expresses an interest in meditation. Kabat-Zinn writes with wit and a smile, always keeping touch with the pitfalls that come with regular sessions of 'non-doing.' I have been through several well-known guides to meditation. Wherever You Go, There You Are is perennially useful to me and is my most valued book on the subject.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I bought the Kindle version of this book because, like everyone else, I wanted to know what happened to her and how she survived for all those years.  The book is what it is.....a book written by a young woman who survived a terrible ordeal.  It's pretty remarkable in that Jaycee only has a fifth grade education.  I couldn't believe that it had 288 pages.  It didn't seem nearly that long when I read it.  The dotted line under the book title on the home page of my Kindle didn't look like it could be a book of nearly 300 pages.  Would I recommend it to others?  Meh.....it's pretty predictable.  I'm glad she got back with her family and I wish her the very best.

B005AUWY2W|3.0|When one thinks about Pixar, the term failure is typically no part of the equation and indeed what the powerhouse pixel-pushing studio might consider a disappointment would have its hordes of imitators doing cartwheels in the streets.  Keeping that in mind, Cars 2 could very well be the first Pixar film to put such theories to the test.<br /><br />Generally speaking the first Cars never fully overcame criticisms that individuals outside of car culture (a group that naturally includes the children for whom the film targeted) were oblivious to much of the film's charm.  In that line of thinking, the sequel further isolates itself from mainstream animation audiences by continuing the tradition of references only a mechanic could fully appreciate but this time combining them with the international spy/ thriller genre.<br /><br />This fact is no coincidence as the script was written by Ben Queen (the creator of Fox TV's \\"Drive\\") from an outline dreamed up by John Lasseter and Brad Lewis.  The scope of this one is immediately much larger; ditching the backwater-feel of Radiator Springs for International flavor and manages to poke fun of a whole lot of cultural stereotypes in the process.<br /><br />The plot actually breaks down into two parallel story-threads, a spy drama and auto racing action.  The spy portion, believe it or not, centers on Tow Mater (again played flawlessly by Larry the Cable Guy) and involves the simple-minded tow truck's clueless meandering leading to all sorts of secret agent misunderstandings.  In the mean time our hero Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) agrees to partake in a grueling championship, The World Grand Prix, in effort to silence boisterous Italian Formula One car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).<br /><br />Like all Pixar efforts, there is some brilliance scattered throughout but it's highly unlikely the intended audience is going to pick up on much of it.  For starters some of the spy angles reference spy films from the 1960s (spoofed to death by the likes of Mike Myers and the Austin Powers Franchise).  Adults old enough to recognize such bits will likely get a chuckle but expect these nuances to go largely unnoticed by the kids.  Additionally, some of the better dialog exchanges once again involve internal combustion engine references that, although accurate and quite clever to boot, will likely be lost upon the hordes of soccer moms forced to watch to placate the children.<br /><br />Interestingly, the character roles have reversed this time around with Mater getting the lion's share of the screen-time and McQueen serving as supporting cast.  For fans of Mater (a group that includes your author), this is a good thing.  However, proponents of the rusty truck may find themselves cringing at the overexposure and oftentimes annoying behavior.  McQueen actually becomes a bit more difficult to like as a result of this setup as he's really presented as more someone who endures Mater's presence rather than enjoys his friendship.<br /><br /> A few new characters are entered into the fold (aside from the aforementioned Italian F-1 car) including Finn McMissile; a British agent voiced by Michael Caine, Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as Mater's love interest and a new villain by the name of Professor Z&uuml;ndapp (Thomas Kretschmann).<br /><br />While Disney is typically cautious not to integrate political views into their pieces, there is a bit of fossil fuel reliance danger/ Big Oil propaganda to be found here.  Of course it could be argued that these are simply current global issues and hence integrated as a sign of the times.<br /><br />The visuals are charming as ever with massive explosions, water effects, rich textures and so on.  Sounds are spectacular, on down to accurate engine roars amidst a pack of wide-open competition automobiles.  Pixar's attention to detail is as impressive as ever and as expected, Michael Giacchino's score is executed so perfectly as to be subliminal.<br /><br />In all Cars 2 will likely manage to hold the attention of its intended audience as kids will clamor at the intense onscreen action and the sheer satisfaction of seeing their favorite personified automobiles in action again.  Fans of the first film will likely find more to appreciate including a global setting and anything but a rehash of the same plotline but it's safe to say those moviegoers who were never quite enamored with the first film's niche-laced charms should probably avoid looking to the sequel to change their opinion.as kids will clamor at the intense onscreen action and the sheer satisfaction of seeing their favorite personified automobiles in action again.

0312427646|5.0|The Uncommon Reader of the title is none other than Queen Elizabeth II, one of the most recognized people in the world but also one of the least known.  Alan Bennett, who had earlier written some very funny and perceptive dialogue for the Queen in his play \\"A Question of Attribution,\\" here makes her the heroine of a short but profound story that gives her a life of her own.<br /><br />One day the Queen's dogs lead her to a mobile library van, where she finds one of the palace kitchen boys busily reading away.  Intrigued, she picks up a book for herself and is enthralled.  Over the next several years she becomes addicted to reading, much to the discomfiture of her family, staff, and government.  Bennett gives the Queen and his other characters a lot of witty conversation, some of it bordering on the risque, and even more insight into the value of literature and of writing.  The Uncommon Reader is a quick read but a very enjoyable one, and even if you are not a royal aficionado you will appreciate both its bon mots and its wisdom.
B000059ZIC|5.0|These are my favorite recordings of the Brahms violin sonatas, edging Perlman/Ashkenazy, who hint on occasion of a sugary style of romanticism. I think the playing here is more nuanced and introspective. These two play pianissimo with as much control and delicacy as I have heard, providing the best sense of the ephemeral quality of many of Brahms' more intimate passages. The sound of the instruments here is superb, individually and in combination. Katchen is as remarkable an accompanist as he is a soloist; I always love the distinctive sound of his piano. Suk is not as far forward in the mix as is Perlman, but still projects power and intensity. His violin has a somewhat dry tone, offering for me the slight classical shading that is necessary to capture the Brahms style of romanticism. For the Dm sonata, the Vengerov/Barenboim pairing  is on an equal plane with this recording in my estimation. It is a different, bolder execution. Vengerov gives us luscious tone and inspired playing, well complemented by Barenboim and this pristine recording. I listen to it often. But the Suk/Katchen is still my favorite interpretation. The tempi are moderate throughout. The recording quality is excellent. These are gorgeous examples of some of Brahms' most beautiful music. Highly recommended.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I heard and watched this at a Japanese summer camp.  There were students from 8-13 years old and they all love it, so I bought it for my grandchildren 5 to 18 and they all loved it.

031250926X|5.0|We had a much loved, much chewed copy of the brown bear boardbook...till it got sneakily flung out of a stroller. When I went to replace it, I figured I'd spring for the fancier interactive version. It's not that much more expensive, and it's bigger, sturdier, and it has the fun slide and find windows. I do miss the summary page at the end of the regular version that goes over all the animals in the book (seriously, how hard would that be to add back in?), and you should know that this version is not easily tossed in a diaper bag. It's pretty hefty and large. I'm considering buying the regular board book to have as a \\"travel version.\\"

067144901X|5.0|I wish I had a video of the first time I read this book to my six month old son. His face broke into a huge smile on the first page, and when we got to the part where \\"little dogs go ruff ruff ruff,\\" he screamed with laughter. I mean knee-slapping belly laughs. I honestly don't get it, but it has kept its magic ever since. We read it every day, and it comes with us on trips. My son is 10 months old now, and he has different movements that he does for each of the different animals. I now buy this book for baby shower gifts, in hopes that my friends' babies will love it as much as mine does.     Our original copy has some pretty serious bite marks (the binding on the spine is almost completely gnawed through), but it is such a hit in our house that I'm now buying our second copy.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|At first, what a disappointment! All ready to watch it, and then couldn't even see a lot due to the too-dark imaging. I suggested avoiding the DVD version!      With a bit of debugging I determined our new audio amplifier had default settings on video that made the picture way too dark, especially for this already dark video movie.  Changed the Onkyo setting to 'Direct', which enabled the video to come through the amp without alteration, and then we could see the darker details in the movie.    We really enjoyed Deathly Hallows Part I once we were able to view it!!
B004QMW1NM|5.0|The first song I heard by The Naked and Famous was 'Young Blood.'  After listening to the samples on Amazon I immediately downloaded the album.  There is not one bad song.  'All Of This' is a great opening track and it only gets better.  They change up their sound with reverb and feedback to get that garage sound on 'Spank' and 'A Wolf In Geek's Clothing.'  Then there is the amazing 'Girls Like You' - a song that just builds and is self reflexive in meaning and lyrics.  The male and female vocalists is what makes the group so dynamic; they complement one another  so well.
B00005LIN0|4.0|Very high production values and if you enjoy Porgy and Bess it is a good choice. Until the end.      Sorry, but Porgy throwing down his crutches to set off walking to New York is not how the opera is supposed to end.  Porgy's main mode of transportation is supposed to be a goat cart.  He can NOT use his legs! In the end it is how he is setting off to New York.    The book Porgy ends with Maria watching Porgy leave on his goat cart to New York and for the first time realizing that Porgy is an old man.    If you are going to produce a quality performance of a classic, then stick to the intended ending; don't throw in your own \\"uplifting\\" ridiculous conclusion!

1451629184|5.0|I am thinking there was very little editing by professionals with this book.  I believe Jaycee wrote this book by herself and I want to give her credit for that.  I think that is quite an accomplishment considering her terrible ordeal happened not that long ago.  She wrote what she wanted to express, kitten stories and all, and I am glad I purchased it and read it all today.  I might even try her recipe.  I did not see the Sawyer interview, a few bits of it.  I will try to find it online.  I don't mind at all having spent the money for this book, which will help the JAYC Foundation.  One of Jaycee's dreams was to write a best seller, and she has done that.

1577314808|5.0|This book is phenomenal! So much of the information that Eckhart Tolle expounds on strikes a personal chord within me.

I've read the whole book and plan to read it again. Heartily recommended!
0812973992|4.0|There is a kernel of truth in this book, like an apricot with a seed around which the juicy fruit clings.  The true part is the daring tightrope display by Philippe Petit between the World Trade Center towers on August 7, 1974.  There are a couple of chapters about how Petit might have prepared for the feat, and in some way or another all the main characters relate to the events of that day in New York City.<br /><br />But the juicy part of the book is the characters and their various intertwined stories.  This book has a format popular with current writers--chapters are short stories told from different points of view. (The Imperfectionists: A Novel and A Visit from the Goon Squad are two others.) The reader has to remember details hidden along the path of the book to make sense of the plot.  Time, point of view, and characters, are all changing throughout the book.  As a result, this book may be too challenging for the Attention Deficit Disorder crowd, or even for serious readers who can only afford to read in short interrupted segments.<br /><br />It isn't a perfect book.  I hated an early chapter about siblings growing up in Ireland.  And considering the author is Irish, that wasn't a promising start.  McCann makes characters in New York--men, women, rich, poor, black, white, young, old--much more interesting and believable.  I am not convinced a couple of chapters belong in the book--the characters seem too loosely connected to the plot, and were just not compelling.<br /><br />But, I loved the book. The story that emerges (after you've put together the scattered clues) is heartbreaking and ennobling.  Frequently the language McCann uses and particularly the final chapter where the narrator finds meaning to life, is pure poetry.
193413712X|5.0|This fine novel is ostensibly about the death of George Washington Crosby, an old man who lies dying of cancer in his living room while his family keeps watch. But the book isn't about George's death; that simply provides the framework for the real story, which is about his unsteady relationship with Howard, his father. While Paul Harding takes the reader into that theme through George's deathbed recollections (and possibly hallucinations) he develops it in a parallel narrative told from Howard's point of view. The story arc can be confusing, but it's clear when the reader pays attention. It's well worth the effort, too.<br /><br />Tinkers worked for me on many different levels. Harding immerses the reader into the dying man's stream of consciousness, a flow of thought/feeling/dreams that I suspect is very realistic. At times George is lucid, recalling notable incidents of triumph and tragedy from his life as clearly as a newspaper reporter. Often, though, he slips into prose poems that seem to have little bearing on the story but perfectly reflect the semi-dreaming state of his mind. Some readers may find these passages overwrought or superfluous; I thought they contribute to a greater understanding of the way a dying man's mind conducts itself.<br /><br />The strange workings of Howard's mind often intrude on the storyline, too. Despite these forays into sub- or semi-conscious thought, I found the characters well-defined, believeable, and sympathetic if not always totally likeable. In other words, George, Howard, and George's grandfather (who makes a cameo near the end) are just like real people. And, just like real fathers and sons, their relationship are very complicated, reminding me often of the paternal ties explored in my own short fiction collection, [[ASIN:B0054GQEVY A Tale Of The Christ: Four Short Stories]]. The value of the novel lies in its ability to increase our understanding of ourselves.<br /><br />Tinkers may be a short book, but it is not a light read. Not because the subject matter is heavy, but because there are layers upon layers of meaning piled on the reader who takes the time to appreciate it. I plan to return to Tinkers again and again and expect to find at least one hard new truth every time I read it.ubject matter is heavy, but because there are layers upon layers of meaning piled on the reader who takes the time to appreciate it.

B001DF68MA|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2CN4647XTUE9J]]Although this is actually a great child bike seat, it's smaller than the recommended age and weight that Amazon lists. I am a loyal Amazon advocate because their products are usually as pictured and described, but this one was definitely wrong. Not a deal breaker, but be aware that this seat is designed for a smaller child, probably up to 20 pounds max, not the 40 pounds listed in the ad. Watch the video and judge for yourself.
1401309666|4.0|In classic economics, there are markets and market forces, and these interact in known or predictable ways. However, perhaps, just perhaps things are different now. The widespread use of the internet, and particularly trading, has redefined the market place and market trading. The broad thesis is that we no longer have just bricks-and-mortar stores (shops to you and me) that stock items that are likely to sell. Now new trading methods enable very slow movers not only to be sold, but to be WORTH selling if the market place is large enough.    Chris Anderson uses examples from different market sectors, and especially examines items where selling can take place with little stock sitting on warehouse shelves. In entertainment (music and films), the technology is available to create physical items to sell when an order is placed, and in these markets (and increasingly in books as well) items are not always shipped, but transmitted digitally. The can be almost no cost in holding items in the selling inventory - and with physical books, the technology of print-on-demand can mean this same principle applies here.    No longer is the choice limited to the top 50, or even top 1,000, but there is a demand for items further away from the `hits' - extending a long way down \\"the tail\\" to include products that were hitherto unavailable anywhere. This means more choice, but the crucially what is available is easily found. Such tools as customer recommendation even generate extra sales, with \\"customers who bought X also bought Y\\" suggestions.     The figures behind the theory are sometimes speculation, and more investigation is needed. However, the ideas are refreshing, well explained, and are a supreme example of unintended consequences at work.    In the USA, 20% of the population are more than 8 miles from a bookshop and 8% are more than 20 miles from a bookshop. This is part of the large untapped demand that long-tail selling can open up. Not only do `hits' sell (the traditionalapproach for pile-`em-high and sell-`em-cheap outlets), but that there is plenty of profit in the niche market that is the long tail.    Anderson even talks about how the `long tail' for music is not really a simple long tail, but a plethora of long tails, by genre. When is a long tail not a long tail? Why, when parts of it are themselves heads of niche markets, subdivided by genre, of course! Anderson makes his points well and this fairly easy read will explain all better than I can in a few short words.    Peter Morgan, Bath, UK (morganp@supanet.com)

B004A9F9ZI|5.0|The primary thing that has always set this amazing zombie story apart from all the rest is that its primary focus has always been on the people and their trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in this nerd-fantasy, post-zombiepocalypse world. If you haven't read the still-ongoing comic series, it also comes highly recommended, but has only ever meant to serve as a basic guide for the direction of the show and there should be no surprise that the live action version holds some \\"detours\\" from the comic - some extremely creative ones I might add.    There's no shortage of zombie tension in this six-episode season 1 (that was actually meant to be just the pilot, but went a little long), some good cliffhangers, and there's certainly plenty of character drama with this group of survivors surrounded by death.    If you're looking for a non-stop action, zombie kill-o-rama, this may not be what you want; but if you're looking for an extremely well told story of survival based on an amazing comic series with plenty of gory zombie goodness, then you cannot go wrong with The Walking Dead. And with season 2 coming in mid October 2011, now's the time to get caught up with the story.

B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is one of the best tower defense game for Android. This game differs from other tower defense games in the layout and level options.     Most TD games have a blank canvas and you create the path with defense units as you see fit.     With Grave Defense HD, the paths are pre-determined with turret locations strewn around and you just have to figure out what towers go where. The beginning levels have enemy units coming from one location but as levels progress that changes and the enemy units originate from different locations and take different routes.     Variations of turrets available changes by level and so do enemies.    You can clearly tell the amount of thought, time and effort put into the game by each level.    Graphics are great and the game runs very smooth on my HTC Inspire.     This is a really great game and even if you missed the amazon offer for this game (it was offered free), it'll be the best two bucks you'll spend on a game!
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Yes, it has a lot of fanservice and some part are exaggerated. However, this anime has a lot of action moments and comedy. I watched the original broadcast in Japanese. Then just recently, I found out that it was available in the US with English dubs. I didn't think twice to get it. The English dub is pretty good, and this is the kind of anime that you want American jokes in. I've watched this at least 8 times already and I'm not tired of it yet. It's one of those rare gens that you don't want to end. Apparently there is a sequel stated for September in Japan, so get this so you don't miss on anything.<br /><br />Ok, a little bit of the plot. Takashi is your regular lazy high school student. One day, he is skipping classes until he witnesses a murder right in front of the school gate; then the teachers that were there started killing each other. And that's where hell broke loose. You have Rei who was member of the spear club, Saeko was a member of the kendou club (sword techniques and stuff), Takagi is the school's genius girl who provides everyone with most of the info, and the school nurse who helps the team in different ways. Those are the girls in the team. Now the guys; Hirano is a student who used to get bullied a lot, but he didn't complain. He actually received military training and is the weapon's specialist of the group. Takashi is the guy who doesn't have a real skill other than to adapt to what's going on. He's got good thinking and he is most mental-stable person of the group (which is shown later on in the anime and manga). Takashi s the type of guy who has natural leader qualities. He tries to move forward with everyone and tries to help them in any way he can. Later on, they find a little girl named Alice.<br /><br />Basically, the whole world has been overrun with zombies or \\"them,\\" as they call them in the anime. The team works together to get to their goal, which is to make sure everyone's families is secure. They come across a variety of times such as weapons, motorcycles, cars, and even a bus.

1439512965|5.0|Hopefully this will help, it seems that all reviews are clumped together regardless of which edition is being reviewed.  If you follow this link you'll notice that there a few editions to select from (If you can't find where to choose the format/edition, it's to the right of the picture, and down a bit):  [[ASIN:0194792226 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Bookworms Library)]]  ***The default paperback is NOT the original!***  - I'm talking about the version published December 6th, 2007. Notice that Andy Hopkins and Joc Potter are listed as \\"Adapters\\". Do not buy this copy!  ***The Library Binding edition has 24 pages of new material from the original.***  - I originally ordered this, and the copy I received is retitled \\"Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?)\\" rather than just the original title. The cover art (not shown on Amazon as of now) also depicts the actors from the film (Harrison Ford and the girl). A quick search on Wikipedia confirms that some editions were retitled after the films release, presumably with no changes to the text. The book itself lists Philip K. Dick as the only author, so I can only assume that it's his work and his work alone. It is however, labeled as a 25th anniversary edition and claims that it \\"Contains 24 pages of new material!\\" So if you were looking for the completely original copy, this certainly isn't it.  ***The May 28th, 1996 version is the original***  - If you click the drop down list for the paperback editions, there is the May 28, 1996 version which is by Philip K. Dick only. I ordered this one, and it is the original text! I would recommend buying this copy, unless you want the additional content in the library binding edition.
B001HN6922|1.0|I took my two granddaughters to see this movie, and was absolutely horrified.  Every problem was dealt with a gun, bigger foe, bigger gun.  Lots of bombs, blowing up continuously, one strapped to Mater, others set off with remote controls.  Two scenes with cars strapped down and sadistic grimacing torturers cranking up the ray to disintegrate their innards.  This movie was disgusting.
B0055D3EOG|1.0|Started out kinda good but once the old lady come into the movie, it went downhill fast. Couldn't even finish it, just too dumb! The gas mask was the final straw!
0793563836|5.0|I didn't want to write a \\"straight out of the box\\" review. I wanted to actually use the book first. This book was bought back in Dec. 2010 and it is now the end of July 2011. This is by far the BEST beginner book I've seen. What I like most about the method is the fact that although it does teach you tabs, which come later in the book, it teaches you to read music. So, by the time you get to the tabs section, you really (I don't) use them. The 3 cd's that come with the book are invaluable. They really help you with your progress. I use them as a test to move on to the next level. As a side note, I'm in my early 50's and have no desire to be a rock star. I just took the bass up as a hobby. Be that as it may, whatever your goal, you can do a lot worse than this bass method book! I also HIGHLY recommend the use of stretching exercises before and after playing. You don't want to get carpal tunnel syndrome. There are some great exercises to be found on you tube. I hope this was helpful, enjoy.
B00005N6KG|4.0|For someone like me who has ears shaped such that earbuds don't fit well, especially during very active workouts, these headphones are great.  The sound is average and they can generally only be counted on to last for a year or two of daily use.  However, the cost is minimal they're fairly comfortable and will stay on during pretty strenuous exercise.
B003Y5H542|3.0|This is a cute movie however it does have some foul language. I would suggest that parents preview it before allowing their children to watch.
B005DC68NI|4.0|I found this book to be clear, concise and very readable. As a `How-to' it is more effective than most. Significantly, its tightly structured layout allows the reader to jump around from topic to topic without losing the narrative thrust.     LGD is both a history lesson and a methodology. Given the subject matter which is very `now' this combination seems both logical and essential. The particular icing on the cake is the case study section at the end of the book. It's fascinating to see the commonalities but also the considerable variety of experience and motivation that's occurring in the brave new world of publishing. If you are a complete novice in the subject area this is an essential primer. If you are more informed LGD will expand your knowledge base considerably.    There is a rhythm to the writing that keeps the reader's attention. The chapters are all relatively short - bite sized information dumps spiced with personal anecdotes. This combination and the wealth of practical information keep you riveted.    There are no attempts to be diplomatic here. The Author calls out a number of extreme viewpoints and shines the cold light of common sense on them all. From Amazon's nonsensical international policy to traditional publishing's head-in the-sand attitude and defensive reactions, they are all examined and critiqued.    The Author also has a knack for argumentative discourse. A broad range of attributes are succinctly pulled together to make a cogent point of view. This happens on nearly every point - a significant academic achievement. One that makes the relatively small book that much more potent.    I have only two points of censure with LGD;  - I was occasionally galled by this book because I couldn't read fast enough to get to the next section.  - There was no elaboration on the criticisms of Smashwords. Despite its ground breaking history this organization maintains a convoluted production process which is more discouraging than otherwise and the resulting formatting is plain in the extreme - which goes against the dictum of presenting your work well. The firm's history and Mark Coker's commendable advocacy seems to have triumphed over the more vocal of its/his critics.    My rating is a rousing four out of five - highly recommended.    iDM
B004EPYZSU|2.0|I worry for Daniel Craig. It seems like it will take a lot for him to prove to the world that he's capable of doing more than playing James Bond. And furthermore, it doesn't look like he'll be any more able to pull off a performance as Mikael Blomkvist in the upcoming Dragon Tattoo remake. Because just an hour ago, I got out of the movie that may just be solid proof of his inability to act outside his comfort zone... Cowboys and Aliens.<br /><br />I'll admit I didn't have any expectations for this movie except just a fun and enjoyable blow-em-up alien flick. In fact, something with such a title as \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" should not be boring. And a cast like Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde should help offer SOMETHING of that promise. Unfortunately, the movie has its head so far up in the clouds, it thinks it's something other than what it should be.<br /><br />I will say the movie got off to a good start with the opening moments, where Jake, the film's protagonist wakes in the desert, unaware of where he is, and then the following scene with Jake beating the men up and stealing their clothes and horse was great too. Speaking of the protagonist, I'm not sure why we don't find out his name until about 30 minutes into the movie, or so it seems.<br /><br />Anyways, back to the \\"plot\\". He appears to have woken up with a bracelet made of iron on his left wrist, which leads to what may be the most ham handed Chekhov's Gun example later in the film. He appears to have no memory at all and later finds out he is a wanted robber, and is imprisoned after a bar fight. One night, aliens attack the town, and it is unknown why (nor is it really explained, save for some weird gold subplot later innthe film). And there's more attacks, and the men go on an adventure to stop the attacks, and blah blah blah... The end.<br /><br />Oh and I forgot, Olivia Wilde is in this. What she was even in there for again I'm completely empty at the thought of too, and maybe my summary wouldn't be so vague had there been STUFF HAPPENING in the film. Sad thing is, her performance is the best thing of the movie.<br /><br />Honestly I am amazed. I haven't had this much trouble trying to find the words to say about such a frustrating film. How could a movie with such a concept be so BORING. There is basically almost no fun in the film. When a movie is called \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" and there's no fun in the movie whatsoever, that is not a good sign.<br /><br />In fact, why are there aliens in the movie, anyway. They are indeed very pointless and they feel forced in just to create some pointless conflict involving gold, which gets left to naught in the end. And we rarely see any of the aliens anyway. In fact, we see more spaceships than aliens. And the aliens look dumb anyways. Do they give razzies for CG? Because they look so bad, they make the aliens in Battle LA look awesome.<br /><br />The movie gets two of three stars for Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde, both the best things about this film, and the third star for the beautiful Arizona locations. The rest... yawn.<br /><br />OVERALL: 3/10<br /><br />Pros: Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford give good performances, as well as the location is great.<br /><br />Cons: Cowboys And Aliens is essentially a fun-less, boring, slow and plodding dirge with boring action and pointless subplots that do nothing but drag a film that should be 85 minutes to a boring 2 hours.STUFF HAPPENING in the film.

B003Y5H542|5.0|Please let it be known, this movie will not be to everyone's taste. Though children will likely enjoy the odd characters, the fart jokes, etc., the much of the humor and subtlety of the movie is aimed at a more mature audience, but an audience who also knows how to relish a little irreverance that's included with every tip-of-the-hat. (Oddly, I liken it to someone giving a respecful bow... but giving a little 'whiff' while doing so. I know that sounds odd but I think those who \\"get\\" this movie will understand. lol)     As one reviewer pointed out (though in less kindly terms), the characters are not exactly what you would call conventionally beautiful. So if you're the type who judge people by their appearance instead of who they are and what is in their hearts, then this movie might make you uncomfortable. For those who enjoy a little stab at conventionalism, I think you'll enjoy its offbeat characters and humor.    This movie is a oddball celebration of movies from the old \\"spaghetti westerns\\" to - believe it or not - Star Trek and everything in between. It's the most incredibly detailed, lusciously rendered computer animation I have ever seen so far. The characters, the settings... they're flawless. From every tiny twitch of Rango's eyes, the miniscule motions of his nostrils, the grains of sand trickling down the face of a dune, the liquid glisten and depth of Priscilla's eyes right down to the way they glow when the light hits them obliquely... It's magnificent work. It's very easy to forget you're watching characters that only exist inside a computer (or a bank of super-computers.) I've seen live action movies with less solidity, less reality than this animated one.     Animation that is jaw-droppingly rich and detailed will only get you so far, however. To really bring an computer animated movie alive, you need actors who have 'good voice.' This movie excells in that too. The voices add so much depth, are so perfect for their characters, that I could watch this movie again and again. And have. Three times so far and counting.     I could gush on about it but it will be of no use. Not everyone will 'get' the humor, the oddball characters, the multitude of film references or be able to appreciate the love and labor that was required to create this movie. I think this movie will endure the same way 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' has. I can envision groups of film buff friends gathering around to watch it together and joyfully debate which movies are being referenced when.    As an example of the offbeat humor, please allow me to quote a piece of it. Wounded Crow is the film's Western stereoptype of a Native American. Naturally, he's asked to guide the possum... err... posse upon their quest. Wounded Crow points with his crutch into the distance and says, \\"Pick up trail. Three men, headed west. One blind. One with...\\" He sniffs the air. \\"...enlarged prostate, riding side saddle.\\" And that, dear readers, is a good example of the tongue-in-cheek humor that seasons this gorgeously rendered, delightfully irreverant, offbeat movie.    P.S. For those who haven't yet found the blatant Star Trek reference, it is easier to spot if you can freeze-frame the movie. I don't want to ruin the fun of finding it for yourselves (if you haven't already) but if you have trouble finding it, I'll give another clue in the comments section of this review.
0316077054|4.0|Beautiful Creatures is one of my favorite novels, so I was excited to continue the series and read more about my favorite characters and the fantastic town of Gatlin. However, I found Beautiful Darkness to be lacking in keeping my attention fully engaged. The book felt dragged out until the last 150 pages or so where things started to pick up. Throughout most of the novel, I just felt bored, annoyed, and even confused at times. But I didn't let that stop me from reading because I knew it'd be setting something huge up for book 3.<br /><br />Even though there wasn't as much action like in the first book, Beautiful Darkness was still as beautifully written with a great set of characters. I just love Link and his spunky attitude. We didn't get to see much of him in the first book, but that isn't the case this time around. He has a rather big part to play. Ethan is always a joy to read about. He's sweet, smart, and realistic. Real emotions and believable choices. He's cares for his girlfriend deeply and when she holds him at a distant, he doesn't let that falter his determination to help her. I like Lena in the first book, but I was just really annoyed with her in this book. I understand that she's going through some tough times, but I wish she would stop feeling sorry for herself and do something about it.<br /><br />Once the action started to pick up, I found it hard to put down until I knew what was going to happen. The ending was completely satisfying and I can't wait to see how the story unfolds from here.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this app!  It is like your alarm clock on steriods!  I use it literally everyday and there are a ton features I have yet to try out, but am looking forward to.  I particularly enjoy the graduating volume option on the alarm (nothing like being scared awake by a loud alarm to start your day off wrong).  I also love the GIGANTIC onscreen Snooze button and the tiny Dismiss.  This makes it easy to snooze, but requires you to be more deliberate when turning off the alarm.      The ONLY thing that kept the app from getting a full 5 stars is that facts that periodically it force closes.  Not a good thing for an alarm app!  It doesn't happen often (maybe once a month or less), but it's enough that it requires me to use a bedside alarm as a back up every night.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Really great note app to use, very intuitive.\nWould like there to be an easier way to paste a note on the screen, the current way takes too many steps.  How do you contact the developer? Would like to have option of automatically moving checked items in check list mode to bottom of list.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|A truly well balanced film, presenting the human plight in this complicated/fluctuating industry. It won't matter if you are democrat or republican, Christian or atheist, omnivore or vegan - if you're human you will be touched by this film. Well done!

0553381695|5.0|The battle for the Seven Kingdoms continues as up to five different people have declared themselves \\"king\\". The exiled Targaryan princess gathers her strength and a plan to return and reclaim her throne. Beyond the Wall in the north, strange things have are rising and the wildlings are on the march.    Once again the reader is drawn into a complex plot that it hard to walk away from. It continually amazes me how much detail Martin has put into the series and his skill at pulling all the different people and storylines together in a way that seems so effortless. The characters are constantly being forced to change and adapt as the war quickly covers the entire kingdom. The only ones that manage to stay out of it is the Night's Watch in the far north on the Wall. And they have their own problems to deal with as strange creatures have risen beyond the wall and it is rumored that the wildlings have gathered and are on the march.    A fantastic second book in the series that takes off running from the first pages. I can't wait until it's time to start the third.    5/5  Edit
1904920233|5.0|I've gone to several of these Wagamama restaurants, and they were awesome.  Hence, I purchased this book.  The book is hard cover, and it reads well.  It has nice looking pictures that makes me salivate.
0316044695|1.0|This book could've been incredible. The first 25 pages I was hooked although I sensed the right wing rhetoric from the start. Obviously an incredible warrior, and of great service to the USA. I wanted to know the story, of how American troops I support in whatever they have to do to achieve victory died serving their country. Instead I heard about how the guy grew up a poor horse farmer in Texas because Jimmy Carter ruined his dad making 35k per horse sale and somehow not saving any money....John Boehner anyone? I'm glad the USA has men like this but as far as political view, we don't care. I understand you like George W. Bush, I voted for him in both elections. Don't think that the rest of the country is working against you though.
B00005Y1UX|4.0|Would you sell your spouse for $1M for one night?  That is the question posed in the movie.  I enjoyed watching the movie, and I'm a big fan of Las Vegas.
B003EYVXT6|4.0|I really liked this movie.  I am by no means a movie snob, but I do like those movies that fly under the radar, and aren't big, ridiculously expensive, blockbusters.  Like this one did.  I also like movies that take a formulaic idea, and do something original with it.  And, finally, I like movies that are entertaining, and hold your attention.  And this movie certainly was.  I liked how it went where most movies would back off.  You'll know what I'm talking about, once you watch it.  And, how could you not like a movie with Adrien Brody in it?  He is so likable, as is his character in this movie, that you want to root for him, even when he crosses some serious moral boundaries.<br /><br />I would recommend this for people who are into sci-fi, horror, psychological suspense, and human drama.  This movie's got it all.  Definitely worth a look.

B004EPZ07K|5.0|I dont understand why people hated this movie so much. I have been a huge green lantern fan since i was 7 so ive been waiting for this movie for 13 years. The visual effects were great. The story (even though innacurate to the comics) was good. Ryan Reynolds played a near perfect Hal Jordan. The only problem was Hal was kinda whiny in parts in the movie which he never was in the comics. Blake Lively played Carol perfectly. The only problem I had witht he movie was the fact it wasnt long enough. The movie was only 1 hour 40 minutes. To fit in more character development and more story it should have been atleast a 2 hour movie. Didnt get enough development on the other lanterns, and the only ones you meet are Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re. Even then you didnt get much of them. They need to make a sequel and go more in depth on more characters........the scene during the credits set up the sequel beautifully. Overall I loved this movie I sat in aww with goosebumps the whole movie (maybe because ive been waiting for this for years), but it was a really good movie. People complain because it wasnt realistic and goofy.......Has a superhero movie ever been realistic or not goofy in some way thats why we read and watch superhero movies to believe in something unrealistic.

OR READ THIS BOOK!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />`The quest to establish the causes of crime has been one of the most elusive searches confronting humankind,' observe Jeff Ferrell and Keith Hayward in this new book on a contemporary criminology thread, which, no doubt, will emerge as an important contribution to this field this century.<br /><br />Criminology is, of course, one of the social sciences and thus employs scientifically based methods and mind-sets to seek out the answer -- or answers -- to the pivotal question around which it revolves:  what causes crime? As the editors explain, `criminology's central focus is the systematic examination of the nature, extent and causes of crime.'<br /><br />This volume usefully compiles and presents a collection of some 22 learned essays from well known academics, each an expert in this field. It's the latest in the series published by Ashgate entitled `The Library of Essays in Theoretical Criminology'.<br /><br />This particular volume focuses on `cultural criminology' which represents and drives certain theoretical departures from what (for want of a better term) one might call \\"traditional\\", or \\"conventional\\" criminology.  It consolidates some of the most important work within this relatively recent theoretical orientation and approach.  We say recent because, apparently, `cultural criminology' has emerged as a distinct new aspect of criminology since the 1990s.<br /><br />According to the book's introduction, `crime and crime control operate as cultural processes manifesting themselves in the form of various phenomena, from media representations of crime, to public displays of emotion by crime victims'.<br /><br />To cite just one example, the editors refer to what they describe as the saturation of everyday life by multiple media forms and media technologies which, in their view, blur the distinction between `crime' and the `image of crime'  Part III - the section entitled `Crime, Media and the Image' explores all the attendant issues  here in thought provoking detail.<br /><br />The book is laid out in six sections, i.e. six categories -- including the one just mentioned -- which develop this and related themes to explain further the dynamics of cultural criminology.  That each article has been lifted word for word out of its publication of origin for inclusion in this volume is obvious; which is a virtue of course, so no criticism about that, except it's a little disconcerting to see such a variety of typefaces, fonts and layouts between the same two covers!<br /><br />This is definitely a book for criminologists, sociologists and professionals in related or relevant fields - the Criminal Bar, too, no doubt -- who wish to examine in depth the subject of cultural criminology in all its many facets.<br /><br />Here, in one handy volume, is a wealth of theoretical discussion as well as illustrative examples of how theory may be applied - plus any number of references for further research.  But, does it shed more light on the causes of crime?<br /><br />Possibly \\"yes\\", as much as criminology ever does.  Its main advantage lies in its orientation toward the contemporary and the modern - and in that respect it perhaps has more relevance to -- and promotes a deeper understanding of - the almost intractable social problems which plague society today: yep, `cultural criminology' is indeed a good title for what we face now!III - the section entitled `Crime, Media and the Image' explores all the attendant issues  here in thought provoking detail.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|WOW!  Those were the first words that came out of my mouth as I finished this book and my husband asked me what it was about.  I downloaded this book last night to onto my Kindle, I admit the first few chapters I put the Kindle down and I didn't think I was going to be able to continue reading this book.  As my 4 yr old daughter slept next to me, I hugged her and cried.  I cried for Jaycee, for what she endured and the description of what was happening to her through the eyes of an 11yr old girl.  I cried because and held my daughter praying that nothing will ever happen to her.  I cried and I cried because there was nothing anyone was able to do.  Jaycee and Jaycee alone survived this.  I forced myself to continue reading, needless to say I finished the book this morning and all I can say is, \\"Jaycee, you are my hero! Your strength and perseverance is everything every woman aims for.\\"  No one can ever replace the she spent with the Garrido's but through it all Jaycee has become a pillar of strength not just for herself but her daughters, her mother and all those around her.

And I readily admit that, although happy to write the Foreword to such a stimulating and important work, I do not.'<br /><br />That the Lord Chief Justice should state unequivocally that he cannot agree with everything written in a book for which he has written the Foreword is less dismaying than inspiring when you come to think of it.  It exemplifies the tradition of fair comment, fair play and fair minded debate, not to mention the (almost) universal acceptance in the UK of the principle of agreeing to disagree.<br /><br />Yes, the book is controversial. And on reading it, you may not entirely agree with it either, although you may well agree with it in part.  The subject matter is murder: - the various kinds of murder; whether murder, or manslaughter, whether deliberate or accidental -- and the punishments, whether appropriate or inappropriate -- that have resulted and/or should result.<br /><br />What does result--and the book is pretty convincing here - is that poorly thought out `messy laws' confuse juries, while `adept legal minds', not to mention ordinary folk, are equally confounded by `fine lines and distinctions' typically (but not always) of the kind referred to above.<br /><br />The `fine lines and distinctions' of the title echo the words of both Lady Wootton and Lord Parker in the course of the Parliamentary debate which led to the abolition of the death penalty in the UK in 1965.  In its place remains the mandatory life sentence for murder and all the attendant difficulties emanating from that.<br /><br />Following years of copious research, analysis and professional experience both eminent and distinguished authors agree that `the English law of homicide is in a mess.'<br /><br />Reference is made throughout to specific cases; for example the case of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who eventually was sentenced initially to life imprisonment for murder and following an appeal, to five years for manslaughter, on grounds of diminished responsibility for shooting and killing a burglar who, with his cohorts, had persistently targeted his property.<br /><br />One is reminded on reading this, of the thorny issues raised by this case and the controversies that raged around it and still do.  One is also reminded of the current proposals to protect householders from prosecution resulting from having to defend their homes and families against criminal intrusion.  The complexities which could result, most of which are raised in this book, are truly and oppressively mind-blowing.<br /><br />Published in 2011 by the Waterside Press, this timely, provocative and certainly topical book puts forward a closely argued and well supported case for encouraging `a root and branch reform of the law of homicide', a reform which must depend on legislation and therefore parliamentary -- and we would add, public support.  The book will therefore provide ample evidence and ammunition to those who would agree that such a reform should be put in place as a matter of urgency.ce is made throughout to specific cases; for example the case of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who eventually was sentenced initially to life imprisonment for murder and following an appeal, to five years for manslaughter, on grounds of diminished responsibility for shooting and killing a burglar who, with his cohorts, had persistently targeted his property.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|This is the complete set of Battlestar Galactica series.  It has the mini series that started the show, all four seasons of the show.  It also includes the Razor movie and The plan movie.  The webisodes are not in it, but some if not all of the webisode footage is include in some of the extended episodes that come in the series, and there are several extended episodes over the course of the series.  Great buy.  High Def pic and sound will everything that Battlestar Galactica 2004 has to offer.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|A movie with a title and a premise this goofy had better at least deliver some fun, so I will give Cowboys & Aliens a little credit in that department. I had really been looking forward to this crazy sounding genre mashup. Even with the mostly negative reviews, I still had hope.<br /><br />My main issues are with the weak story and just a general lack of amazement from any of the CGI and action sequences. The plot is just your typical western for the first 30 minutes or so (which was the best part), until the aliens show up. Then the cowboys become friends with some indians and they must combine resources to fight the aliens. That about sums it up. If you see a movie called Snakes on a Plane or Cowboys & Aliens, don't expect anything other than that. The visuals are not bad, they just didn't show us anything new or inventive. Well, I guess you could count the sight of a dude on horseback from the 1800's being chased by an alien spacecraft as something new.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is pretty good as the Charles Bronson like character. Mostly silent but deadly in an instant. Harrison Ford is okay as a gruff and tough cowboy, even though he was not always believable. Olivia Wilde is here to look at and Sam Rockwell is wasted, though he does have a couple of good lines.<br /><br />There is not really more to say about a movie this basic. I hope this decline presented in both Iron Man 2 and Cowboys & Aliens does not continue for Jon Favreau.
0545259088|2.0|This really pains me, but I did not enjoy FOREVER. This is a book that I have been looking forward to reading for a year. One year and ten days actually. So, I should have just powered through it...loved on it, rolled within the pages and then lamented on the end of an era. Sadly though, it was not to be. I actually had a hard time finishing this one? Don't hate me, but it's true. Stiefvater's token prose actually grated on me and her descriptions dragged instead of titillated. I was literally yawning through the first 100 pages and forcing myself to just finish - hoping for redemption, yet never finding it.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />Grace is a wolf and Sam is left behind as a human with Cole St. Clair and Isabel. Sam is a bit down and out because of his girlfriend being stuck in a four-legged state and the fact that everyone in town thinks he killed her. Cole St. Clair is busy dealing with his new \\"unstar\\" state and a slight obsession with Isabel and the fact that he is pretty sure his brain can whip up a cure for their werewolf. Then there is Isabel, who finds out her father is calling in the big guns to hunt down the wolves and when one wolf kills again - the townspeople will do anything to support him even round up some helicopters and sharp shooters. Will the trio be able to save the wolves in time? Will they be able to work together long enough to even come up with a plan?<br /><br />This physically hurts me to write this review but I actually felt that Sam was a moping mess most of this book and I literally wanted to scream \\"Get your head out of your butt emo boy!\\" Then the Cole and Isabel dynamic was trying. I really felt that the first 100 pages were just a big sobbing mess of descriptions and angsty lamenting about how their life sucks. Then when the action did pick up and a certain minor but featured character dies off - there was very little reaction. Then swoosh into the action and it rolled right into the ending. Then there was the ending, I couldn't believe it ended that way. I just felt deflated; it was anti-climatic. Where was the wrap-up? Was I missing something? I felt like through this entire book nothing was accomplished! I'm having an urge to rant - and please feel free to let me know if you feel the same way. I guess to describe my overall feeling would be let-down. This should have been epic. This should have been the culmination of a three year journey. I should have rejoiced as two of my favorite character's got their HEA - yet, I felt all I found was new characters with the same name. A new emo boy with drama queen tendencies and a detached and rather non-existent werewolf girl that needed to be shaken out of their depression to actually make a decision and move the story forward.<br /><br />  I am sad.<br /><br />  This is me being sad.<br /><br />Because I didn't enjoy this book.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATIONS:<br />Recommended only for fans of the series and it should be read in order.ay.

0811870413|5.0|Here's the deal: if you don't want to spend time making bread, don't buy this book.    On the other hand, if you want to make good, even wonderful, bread, but this book.  I've been baking bread products now for a whole year. Wow!  That's not long. I started with the Cooks Illustrated Bagels recipe.  It was an instant hit for me (and my colleagues at work). But then I had the \\"misfortune\\" of buying Peter Reinhart's Bread Bakers Apprentice. That got me into pre-ferments. I didn't quite like his bagels recipe so I took it and amended the Cooks Illustrated recipe to include a Poolish. That was when the light bulb went off.  What a difference in taste.  And the folk at work noticed too.  I liked Reinhart's bread recipes and progressed with those and was doing pretty well till I met this book.  Honestly, I found reading this book to be akin to meditation.  Even better, I found that making the bread Chad's way was like meditation also. If you've tried his techniques, don't you find it amazing the way the dough changes between the first, second and third turns? You start with flour, water, leaven and salt ( I use course French salt so that goes in early) but you quickly have a cohesive dough. And with very little effort. The recipes make beautiful, open crumb, tasty bread.  If you want more sourness, leave the final rise in the fridge overnight.  Sorry, Chad, I like my bread more sour than you!
B004XUDJII|5.0|This album is a combination of an outstanding voice, musical talent, and emotionally powerful lyrics.  Although \\"Jar of Hearts\\" is her claim to fame, the album is not dependant on songs of defiance, strength, and/or independance.  There are real songs of love, such as \\"Arms\\" that shows she can go from end of the emotional spectrum to the other.  This album is full of feeling and is not to be missed.
0525951652|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  This book will cause you to think about the cause of war and what must be done to prevent it.  Love and hate are woven into the story with believable characters.  Very entertaining and informative.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|This app opened once, showed me an unnecessary video of Jamie with no sound, then asked me if i wanted to download the data to the tune of 80 MB?!?!  You can fit the recipe for every meal he&apos;s ever cooked in less space than that. The download never started. The app force closed and will not run. I&apos;d love to use this app even with its excessive size. I&apos;ll check back to see if there are updates.
0545259088|3.0|Okay. I absolutely LOVE this trilogy and was so excited to see the last book was out. I have it autodelievered to my kindle so I could read it the day it came out. I had reread the first two in hopes that I would understand everything better in time for the last one. I spent the whole day reading the new book only to be disappointed by the ending... It's like it leads up to nothing.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is so great! I think it&apos;s the coolest app I have! I love how he gives step by step instructions and you can add needed ingredients to a shopping list! Best of all, these are new, healthy meals to feed my family! Love it!
0345529057|5.0|Bought the set of 4 books:  Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, Storm of Swords & Feast for Crows -- The set was VERY reasonably priced.  Also, purchased A Dance With Dragons, which was just released earlier this month.  I'm HOOKED!!  Only meant to read through the 1st book (1st season of HBO series \\"Game of Thrones\\", but I simply can't stop reading!  Price was great and delivery was FAST!!  :)
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|It was with some dissatisfaction that I began to watch Terminator on my PS3 and 45\\" Vizio. First, I had to double-check and indeed make sure this was a Blu-Ray and not a VHS recording. Serious - the film quality is stuck with the plot... in the 80's. The sound was not that impressive either when running through a pretty darn good 5.1 system. And to top it all off, the Special Features best aspect is a decent range of subtitles. At the end of the day, when Arnold promises to be back, it seems he didn't bring the quality content with him.<br /><br />So, the movie itself is a classic, we all know that. And occasionally I enjoy the old school grainy pictures. But this is to date the worst Blu-Ray I have seen. It looks better when watching it on cable. Seriously. Stick with the DVD. Even paying $10 for this is more than a bit aggravating.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|Saw her at the Montreal Jazz festival this summer and had to buy all her CDs. She is so talented live and on her CDs.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|From the moment you hit 'play', this blows away at least half of my Blu-ray collection. The sheer number of options and special features, the menu interface, the soundtrack... everything is better, especially coming straight from watching the first Terminator film on Blu-Ray... check out my review of that travesty at your leisure.<br /><br />The film transfer strikes me more than any previous viewings on several differing mediums: the stark colour contrast of blue environments and red Heads Up Display places the perceptions of the Terminators outside the realm of the living and breathing. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, there is only one detractor - the morphing of the newest class of Terminator, the liquid-metal T-1000. And that is a muted detractor, the transfer to Blu-Ray is that good. It seems the further into the movie, the better the T-1000 images get.<br /><br />There is but one minor complaint with this Skynet Edition - the special features run during a viewing of the film; there is no option to watch them on their own. But like I said, it's a minor inconvenience compared to the surplus of material.
B004HD2ZJ0|5.0|I'm seriously happy that I stumble upon JVM. This album is so great and I vote it my best album of 2011 (So far)on NPR. I have listened to it at least 20 times more than anything else this year. His voice is so different and beautiful and his songwriting is masterful. Hopefully he makes great albums for many years to come.

B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club has never looked or sounded better than this Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The picture has an awesome gritty grain to it.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS HD Audio will feel like a punch in the ear!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|WONDERFUL follow up cd to 19.  I love every song on this cd.  So good!  I hope she gets her self admitted alcohol addiction under control and does not become an Amy Winehouse repeat performance.  :o(
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|Don't get me wrong, that last box set was cool.    But for those of who just want the movie in a box, this is the one to go with.    For those that cool stuff in their box set, get the one that has the gold cover, it has everything from posters to a wallet with a badge!    The picture and sound quality on this box set is extordinary for these movies, and I bet they look even better on Blu-Ray.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The love I have for this film. I think most people need the film to tell them the plot..or to tell them how they are supposed to feel. This does nether. As you watch this, you start to feel and fall in love with the characters. It's a movie you watch once a year and it's like you are hanging out with them again. Like you are part of the group.   It's hard to really describe this film. The characters don't say much, but you know what they are thinking about. Sometimes dialogue is not needed.     I wish Sofia Coppola would have done a commentary track for this. But no, it doesn't have one.    The image quality is nice. The sound is great too. It has 5.1 Dolby Digital and a DTS track.    Give it a watch. You will not regret it.
630521610X|4.0|The picture quailty is great. The sound is great. The special features are great.    But it's Non Anaphormic, for those of you who don't what Non-Anamorphic is, it's basicaly this...    If watch it on your Laptop, Blu-Ray player, or a HDMI 1080p Up-Converter DVD Player, the film will have thick black bars on the top and bottom, an black bars on the vertical sides of your TV.    Get the Blu-Ray for a Anamorphic version of the film.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The only cons are its a bit unintuitive to install, but it doesnt mean its rocket science. Just look at a youtube how to.  And its very tall. I had to modify my case a bit so that it would fit.(fix the casing side fan lower down)  so be sure to check out the dimensions.    other than that its very low noise, very good cooling can install 2 fans for maximum effectiveness. And great value for money.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Without a doubt this 30th Anniversary Edition of Jaws is wonderful.<br /><br />Why should I switch from my 25th Anniversary DVD? You may ask.<br /><br />Because in this DVD we get both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 Surround Soundtracks. If your DVD Player has a DTS encoder then you're in for a treat. It also includes the original Mono Soundtrack, which was what it sounded like in theaters.<br /><br />Picture Quality is the same, but that is not a bad thing because it is quite clear.<br /><br />Special Features<br /><br />Everything is the same except for the documentry<br /><br />In the 25th Anniversary DVD we got a 50 minute Documentry, in the 30th Anniversary DVD we get a 2 hour documentry, it's the same documentry but with an extra hour and 10 minutes. Very interesting Stuff.<br /><br />And finally we get a new featurette, that is an interview with Steven Spielberg on the set of Jaws, yes during shooting of the movie.<br /><br />Get this DVD by all means.
B0013URJTG|4.0|How brilliant does a band like Porcupine Tree have to get before America pays attention? If you are fortunate enough to have a DVD player that can handle the DVD-Audio format (not to be confused with DTS) then you are in for a sonic treat. Steven Wilson among his musical talent is a talented engineer who has worked on the 5.1 mix for King Crimson's Court of the Crimson King, as well as Tull's Aqualung, if those aren't credentials I don't know what would pass for them?     Porcupine Tree has been committed to giving fans ultra-high quality recordings. You want to hear the difference? Well you aren't going to hear it on your IPOD. You have to go out to the front room where the home theater is (don't worry the seats are comfy) and put it on out there. If you like you can just raid your Dad's CD collection, Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or Dire Straits \\"Brothers in Arms\\" will do just fine. Give those a listen. Can you hear how wide and expansive the music seems? Now put on some Metalica or Arcade Fire and hear how canned it seems? That is Dynamic Range Compression. That is some Brooks Brothers power tie wearing jerk deciding that the sonic quality doesn't matter to the public because you are just going to listen to it on an ipod anyway. Don't get me wrong Arcade is a brilliant band but they are going along with selling you an inferior product.     As for \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" it is a great album. It wouldn't be the album that a new Tree fan should start with I don't think? I would say try \\"In Abstentia\\" the stereo release of this is awesome, unfortunately the 5.1 mix is out of print (wake up Steven!)
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Dr.Strangelove Or: How I Stopped Worrying About The Love Bomb is a hysterical staire about the cold war.    This 2-Disc DVD box set is an amazing treatment to the film.    The picture is great.    Sound is great.    It even comes with a booklet with behind the scenes photos.
B003YOZNBK|4.0|I was really expecting this movie to be a lot like Will Smith's Wild Wild West, but to my pleasant suprise, it wasnt. Very Dark and Gritty, lots of action, the weapons used were a lil far fetched for a movie set in 1890's, but then again its a DC Comics Based Character right? Very Good Movie would definately go see the sequel at the theater (if they ever make one.).    Dan.
B002QEXNDE|3.0|I really like this record, however, it was recorded poorly.  I got the CD originally, but wanted better sound.  Usually, vinyl provides that...not in this case.  Too Bad
B0021L9ME6|1.0|Im a huge DC / Marvel Comics fan, and naturally after collecting each & every Marvel Comics Character Movie on High Def Blu-Ray, I had to go back and collect all the DC Comic Based movies as well right? I was so excited to have this movie on BR Disc, but to my disappointment the 1080p HD, really brings out the poor quality CGI used in the fight scenes, as well as all the cheezy acting and poor dialoge beetween Halle Berry & Benjamin Britt, this would have been better as a straight-to-video movie, cant believe it was even released in actual movie theaters back in 2004. Didnt even finish watching the full movie, just put it back on the shelf, next to Batman Begins/The Dark Knight,...thank GOD for Chris Nolan!

0553801473|3.0|Martin's first three installments of the A Song of Ice and Fire series were brilliant, egrossing and intricate.  The last two have not maintained that high standard.  I have never agreed with the description of \\"bloated\\" that many reviewers have given his novels in the past, but A Dance with Dragons has earned it.  He uses 1,000 pages to convey 500 pages of story, and that is considering the Fantasy genre typically requires additional page space due to world building.  If it was contemporary fiction, this could have been a 200 page novel.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Martin's and I sincerely hope his next book actually delivers something closer to what his loving fans have come to expect and admire.  If you like the series, read this book, but don't expect it to be the same wild ride you enjoyed reading A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords.
B003Y5H542|4.0|Rango is, in many respects, a typical western flick. (some spoilers) Evil rich guy controlling the water supply in order to buy up everyone's property...smart talking, tough as nails cowgirl...your typical handful of thugs, villains, drifters, ne'erdowells, ranchers and cowhands...only thing is, this movie is about a chameleon, cats, lizards, snakes, etc. Bizarre? Nah. It's really pretty good.<br /><br />The film is a parody of westerns, and as such gets away with all the things that real westerns don't. The humor is good -- nothing outrageously funny, but some solid laughs. The movie is a little slow out of the gate, but picks up speed right quick. * ahem * Anyhow, the pace picks up, and the laughs start coming pretty steadily, after the first half hour or so.<br /><br />This is not the funniest movie you're likely to see. It's not even the funniest put out recently. And, no, just because it's animated, it's not necessarily a kid's movie. There are darker themes touched on, and the pace is such that younger kids might find themselves bored quickly. This is an animated films for grown ups and young adults more than kids. And it is a good one.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend for those seeking a light-hearted, amusing film. 4/5, for a solid, fun western parody.
1594202842|4.0|Tiger mother battles for and her offspring. Both win, sort of.<br />Engrossing though at times highly-strung first-person account of a mother raising her children - with sweat, tears, all.<br /><br />Just what exactly was the fuss all about? After reading Amy Chua's article in the Wall Street Journal, which incredibly enough, attracted close to nine thousand comments(!!!), I was expecting some sort of an in-the-face cultural diatribe against the American (or Western) style of parenting, mated to an unalloyed gloating in the superiority of the \\"Chinese\\" style of parenting. But that is not it. At all. As the daughter of Chinese immigrant parents, the author  is appreciative of the freedoms that America has provided, and has immersed herself in the American experience (she is also married to a Jewish American). \\"But most of me feels tremendous gratitude for the freedom and creative opportunity that America has given me.\\"<br /><br />The book does excoriate the permissive American style of parenting, and those criticisms are not altogether without merit. No one would seriously take offence at someone criticizing the often lax, hands-off nature of parenting, American or otherwise, that nonetheless ends up with children growing up in a weltering pool of mediocrity, snickering at world-class achievements while still secretly envying them. Parents grant children freedom in the name of giving them \\"space\\", the children still grow up to resent their parents. But this is also a tale of angst, defeat, and often enough of a tension-filled atmosphere in the house of the Chuas.<br /><br />This is the story of Amy Chua, professor of Law at Yale University, telling in the first-person, the story of her two children - Sophia and Lulu - and of her attempts at instilling in them values of hard work. No, make that relentless hard work. This is the story of how her two children were trained to become brilliant pianists and violinists; Sophia, the elder, performed at the Carnegie Hall; Lulu, the younger one, was called a \\"gifted violinist\\", and the mostly overwrought, highly-strung style of parenting that Amy Chua brought to bear upon her children. All well-meaning, and the love she has for her children cannot be doubted, but a highly-strung environment nonetheless could be found in their house. This is also partly the behind-the-scenes story of her American Jewish husband, who seems to have been a calming influence on the stormy waters that Amy brings to the table, so to say, and to mix metaphors.<br /><br />Since enough has been written about the book - by the author, reviewers, critics, and more, after some thinking, not a whole lot mind you, I think at least some of the criticism leveled against the author draws not so much from the merits of the book or its story as much as from a resentment, to put it one way, against the author's assertions of parenting superiority over the American style of parenting. Those criticisms tend to ignore the very clear over-the-top style of writing, where it is obvious that the author is exaggerating, and not to be taken seriously. In case the reader forgets that, there are intermittent reminders.<br /><br />\\"By the time Sophia was three, she was reading Sartre, doing simple set theory, and could write one hundred Chinese characters. (Jed's translation: She recognized the words \\"No Exit,\\" could draw two overlapping circles, and okay maybe on the Chinese characters.)\\"<br /><br />As a side note, Amy Chua gave up a Wall Street career in law to teach at Yale. Why?<br />\\"At the all-night drafting sessions with investment bankers, while everyone else was popping veins over the minutiae of some multibillion-dollar deal, I'd find my mind drifting to thoughts of dinner, and I just couldn't get myself to care about whether the sentence should be prefaced by \\"To the best of the Company's knowledge.\\" Any statement contained in a document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein shall be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of this Offering Circular to the extent that a statement contained herein, or in any other subsequently filed document that also is incorporated by reference herein, modifies or supersedes such a statement.\\"<br /><br />The second reason behind the hailstorm of criticisms and judgments against the book and more so against the author would be that the author is what I could call an example of a successful immigrant family that has embraced the American dream of making it big on the back of hard work and perseverance - the same traits that were extolled in America for so long and can be credited for the nation's rise to economic greatness in the twentieth century. As close to a successful experiment in social heterogeneity as may be expected. She is the daughter of an immigrant Chinese family, she herself is a successful academic, a published author, her husband is a successful doctor, and a Jew - so that is a culturally heterogenous family you have there, the children are successful in their endeavors. The elder daughter performed at the Carnegie Hall, no mean feat that.<br /><br />\\"As I watched American parents slathering praise on their kids for the lowest of tasks - drawing a squiggle or waving a stick - I came to see that Chinese parents have two things over their Western counterparts: (1) higher dreams for their children, and (2) higher regard for their children in the sense of knowing how much they can take.\\"<br /><br />These two reasons, in my opinion, make so many of the Americans criticizing the author feel uncomfortable - because it reminds them that hard work is a sine-qua-non for success in this world. Because the culture of hard work is actually one of the defining traits of the American nation, one that it has been known for in the world. Because somewhere down the line America  chose to abandon the virtue of hard work, the Protestant work ethic, for the more profitable pursuit of prosperity via the easy route - witness the surge in interest in Wall Street and the economic catastrophe in 2008.<br /><br />To be sure, there is much that most could find wrong in Amy Chua's parenting style. Sure. But I suspect most criticisms do not draw from that pool of indignation. Much of the mud hurled comes from the fire of envy.<br /><br />And does Amy Chua have the all-knowing smirk-like attitude to her writing? No. Not really. She is quite self-aware actually. Self-deprecating too. But with a tart tongue too. Sample these: \\"Thank goodness I'm a lucky person, because all my life I've made important decisions for the wrong reasons.\\" Or \\"This took me aback.

But I suspect most criticisms do not draw from that pool of indignation. Much of the mud hurled comes from the fire of envy.

B003UAKE9Y|3.0|As with many of these movies, they aren't really made with kids in mind. But this one is especially creepy and scary. I was scared and anxious during most of the movie and my kids were wide-eyed and confused. They watched it 'till the end (they're 3 and 6) because they insisted on it and they haven't had nightmares for now but I really wish I hadn't bought it. It's much too dark and crazy and deformed...
B0019GJ4EM|3.0|This is not a US release. While it purports to have some extra features: alt bank robbery opening, 3 trailers and a documentary the only one I could actually get to work was the commentary. Picture quality is mix. There is noticeable artifacts throughout and the entire film has a green tint compared to the special edition DVD. However blacks are super rich, though the entire disc is mastered dark.

0525951652|5.0|Just finished this epic novel that I found very difficult to put down once I picked it up.  I am a huge fan of Follett's work, and I felt this was one of his strongest novels.  No, it's no \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", but what is?  For this yarn, Follet has chosen World War I as the focus.  He concentrates on four groupings of characters, from England, Germany, Russia and the U.S.  Since World War I engulfed all of these nations, it's a perfect idea for a perfect setting.<br /><br />Like all great works of historical fiction (one of my favorite authors is John Jakes - this one reminds me of his best works), Follett's writing makes me want to learn more about the subject matter in which he surrounds his characters.  Other timely topics besides the war are tackled within these pages as well. Some of the main ones are The Russian Revolution (both the Menshevik and Bolshevik), The Women's Suffragette Movement, and the enormous unfair gap between the classes of the very wealthy and the extreme poor.<br /><br />Anytime a novel mixes in actual events with fictional characters, a certain degree of realism needs to be dismissed. At least that's what I feel.  Many readers aren't as kind and immediately discount the events in the book as \\"unbelievable\\".  Perhaps, but I think that's a bit unfair.  Example: During the first Christmas of World War I in 1914, a strange event happened quite accidentally.  German and British soldiers, who were attacking each other from the trenches, declared a Christmas truce and they all put down their weapons, came out of their posts and met one another in \\"no man's land\\" to celebrate Christmas together.  Well, in the book, since the German and the British character in the novel knew each other before the war started, they \\"just happened\\" to be in this particular place and time and \\"just happened\\" to be joyfully reunited during this actual event.  Yes, it is far fetched, and, yes, a LOT of this sort of thing happens throughout this book - but it's supposed to be a \\"story\\".  I take no offense at these events occuring and they do not insult my intelligence.  If anything, I admire Follett for using such tid-bits to teach the reader a bit of history that many might not know otherwise.<br /><br />Then, there's this \\"coincidence\\" that all of these characters seem to be having babies all over the place.  At one point I gave up trying to keep up with which characters had which children and how many were in the total mix.  It becomes obvious that all of these new born children will muscle their way into Volume 2 as the main characters.  Unbelievable?  Perhaps.  But again - it's a \\"story\\", folks.  My main criticism with all of Follett's work is that he tends to share details of the character's sex lives a bit too explicitly.  Sadly this trend continues here.  At one point in this book, we read about a couple's conversation as they're lying naked after sex.  The man is playing with her curly pubic hairs as she offers to shave them for him.  (\\"Umm, Mr. Follett?  Ick\\")  Fortunately one can practice their speed reading skills during such encounters.<br /><br />Another small criciticsm was that I felt the last 100 pages or so was a bit rushed.  The majority of the story takes place during the War years (1914-1918), but the whole story goes through about 1923.  I would have loved for him to flesh out these latter years more, but I guess he felt (and others would probably agree) that the book was already quite lengthy, so it is probably for the better that these years were trimmed.  I would have even enjoyed if he would have written an entire novel in between the two world wars (I believe his volume 2 will focus on World War II) and made this a four-novel series instead of a trilogy.<br /><br />I would take great joy in one day rereading this novel.  I'm hoping that by the time I pick up volume 2, I'll remember the story well enough to not be lost within the pages.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Ken Follett and/or historical fiction.<br /><br />NOTE: As I type this review (July 2011), this book is not, to my knowledge, available in paperback in the U.S.  Strange because I picked this book up in Puerto Rico about a month ago in the paperback format.  I'm not sure of the hardback edition, but one thing the paperback had that I thought extremely helpful was a \\"cast of characters\\" section at the beginning of the book.  This was very helpful because there are a lot of characters, real and fictitious, in this story and it can be a bit hard to remember who some of the minor characters are while reading.TE: As I type this review (July 2011), this book is not, to my knowledge, available in paperback in the U.S.  Strange because I picked this book up in Puerto Rico about a month ago in the paperback format.

1423113381|3.0|Back in April of this year I noticed a free chapter sample on Kindle for [[ASIN:1423140567 The Kane Chronicles, Book Two: The Throne of Fire]].  I read that chapter and thought it sounded like a really good book and wrote a review to that effect. Then I discovered that one of my grandchildren was reading the first book in the series so I bought The Red Pyramid so we could compare notes on the book.  I'm sorry to say that the book was quite a bit of a let down for me.<br /><br />The first few chapters were quite interesting and I thought I was going to like the decision author Rick Riordan had made to allow both children in the story, Sadie and Carter Kane, to present alternating chapters of their adventure.  This device made sense to me since the two had been raised apart since the death of their mother and they really didn't know each other very well.  Later, when I discovered that I often needed to refer to the top of the page to see which person was narrating I began to rethink my liking of that aspect of the book.  I seemed to have trouble keeping straight in my mind which person was doing the storytelling.  Luckily someone connected with the book must have foreseen this as a possible problem because the top of each right hand page has the name of either Sadie or Carter, depending on which one is 'talking', printed at the top.<br /><br />This story really almost wore me out.  I began to wonder if these children would ever be allowed just to eat a meal, spend some time sleeping or find an adult who would explain what was going on.  The book is centered around magic and Egyptian gods and lore.  When their father was involved in a magic episode Carter and Sadie began to try to rescue him, but were never told anything about what it would take to do that.  Every chapter sent them on another harrowing adventure where they had to fight an Egyptian god or a magical beast without knowing how to do that.  Each person or god they met sent them off on the next perilous adventure without giving them any explanation of what they were doing, what their ultimate goal could be, or how to accomplish what they wanted to do.  In other words they spent all their time winging it and fighting for their lives.  Finally toward the end of the book someone explained what they were caught up in, but by then I had read through chapter after chapter of one dilemma after another.  Those poor kids were just constantly going and doing.  I must say it reminded me very much of the Saturday morning cartoons where everything is constant action with very little explanation or contemplation.<br /><br />I've never read any other work by this author and as this is my only example I doubt very seriously that I will try another of his books.  I didn't like this very much, but I forced myself to finish it.  Luckily for me some of my questions were answered in the final chapters.  My granddaughter simply gave up on it and did not want to finish reading it.  I think she is the more satisfied of the two of us.nture without giving them any explanation of what they were doing, what their ultimate goal could be, or how to accomplish what they wanted to do.

B004OT8HJO|5.0|I got one of these from target for $140. Its a good set but in my opinion it worth around $20 less. The Halo Mega Bloks Pelican isnt much smaller than this ship. the completed set is about a foot wide and around 2 feet long. the cockpit holds two minifigs. the ship itself is fairly detailed outside and in. the only part thats not so detailed is the bottom of the ship. this one is really a remake of the original millenium falcon lego made awhile ago but with vader instead of a snowtrooper and turret. im surprised that this set did not include c3p0 or r2. i really like this set, it was well made.

0553801473|2.0|As one of GRRM's first and diehard fans,I have recommended this series far and wide, even going so far to tell people the wait was worth it, which was harder after Feast, but I pressed doggedly on. Now, with a week's worth of sore wrists and neck (maybe the Kindle really is a good idea), I'm sadly disappointed. I have a vision of the HBO producers sitting around a table drinking heavily and wondering what they're going to do should they make it to Season 4, contemplating hemlock, hitmen and making a deal with the screenwriters.<br /><br />I won't go into many details, everyone has already done a masterful job of that, great reviews, but the main points are worth repeating: characters left out, characters cliffhanging, characters introduced that end in pointless wanderings, characters that we care about pointlessly wandering (Brienne, Jaime, Rickon, Catelynn, Arya, Bran??), hundreds of pages wasted on sailing, marching,and food. The sturdy rope that held this series together is unraveling so fast and has so many loose ends it's as if a Westerosi wind knocked over GRRM's box of index cards and he has them hopelessly mixed up. Oh, and editing...if I never hear \\"I'm just a young girl who doesn't know the ways of the world\\" again I'll die happy. More like, \\"I'm just a young girl who wandered through 959 pages and forgot what she was doing\\" describes our once-vibrant Dany.<br /><br />The real frosting on this soggy cake was GRRM's Acknowledgement at the end - he thanked everybody he could think of except the people he should've thanked: his loyal and long-suffering readers who've made him what he is. George, take a page from Stephen King - he never fails to think of us, he's gracious, thoughtful and kind. After the slog through this tome, you blew it big time with that lack of courtesy, pal. I deserved some of that acknowledgement and so did everyone else.

B004A8ZX28|4.0|The movie starts with Liam Neeson (Dr. Martin Harris) and his wife travelling in a plane to Berlin. They grab a cab and while loading their luggage into the cab forget a briefcase behind in the luggage carrier.  On the way to their hotel, the cab driver starts to talk on the radio in another language and Dr. Harris asks his wife, \\"Did you understand any of this?\\"  She probably didn't but strangely enough I did understand every word of it.  You would think that people would speak German in Germany, but the cab driver was speaking Turkish.  In another part of the movie, a restaurant owner was also speaking Turkish.<br /><br />Side Note: there is a large population of Turks living in Germany and unfortunately they are not well integrated or assimilated.  This causes friction between the Germans and the Turks.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT BELOW*******<br /><br />The movie itself was exciting with unexpected turns of events.  After an accident causes Dr. Harris to lose part of his memory (along the lines of Bourne Identity movies), Dr. Harris discovers that his wife doesn't know him and another man has taken his identity.  But, this movie was not as good as the Bourne Identity series.  One part that did not jive was that earlier in the movie when he was Martin Harris, he was getting his *ss kicked.  But later on when he figured out his real identity, he started to fight back.  This is one big difference between this movie and the Bourne movies.  In Bourne movies, even though the protagonist lost his memory, his fighting skills were intact.<br /><br />The parts where the assassins try to kill him were exciting.  Definitely a good action movie to watch.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I think Jaycee is truley courageous for telling the story of what those horrible people did to her. After seeing her interview on T.V. I preordered her book on my Kindle. She does get graphic in the first part of the book and I had to put it aside for a few days. I'm glad I picked it up again and finished it because she just wanted to get the truth out and then continued the story without going on and on with the morbid details. She has come through this ordeal remarkably well and seems to have a strong will and positive attitude. I highly recomend buying this book to help support Jaycee and her girls.
B00007J36V|4.0|I'm not exactly quick to give a Fairport Convention album a high rating. I just can't get into this band the same way most people can. Yes I hear a female lead singer with a pretty enough voice, and occasionally some of the folk arrangements are pretty good, but the band never felt like they excelled at particularly strong songwriting to me. There are exceptions, and this album is full of them.     Anyway, I won't be centering my review on the negatives. Not in the case of Unhalfbricking at least. By the way, \\"Unhalfbricking\\" is NOT a very friendly album name to type out on my keyboard either. It takes me an eternity to type it out, haha.     The highlight is the 11-minute folk epic \\"A Sailors Life\\". Doing a decent enough job creating colorful and interesting images of sailors going about their business upon the ocean blue and being optimistic (because the melody contains an uplifting vibe) there's more appealing features besides just that. A simplistic and rather ordinary vocal melody occupies the first few minutes before the song eventually shifts into a respectable full-fledged jam.     The jam is the best part because it's SUPER melodic, and the electric guitar is the musical instrument of choice as far as the most interesting aspect of it is concerned. The fiddle never offers a whole lot in the way of excitement because it's buried in the back of the mix, and even when it does appear it never does anything worth noting. We need more of it. Not bad for an epic though. Perhaps an even stronger vocal melody would have made it better.     \\"Autopsy\\" has a really solid vocal melody with a nice emotional punch. I especially admire the part when the pace slows down a minute in and a beautiful guitar solo comes in shortly after. I love this song. \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes\\" has a distinctly sad vocal melody but what strikes me even harder is the sincerity in Sandy Denny's voice. My favorite song might just be \\"Genesis Hall\\". I LOVE the way Sandy sings the line \\"Youtake away homes from the homeless, and leave them to die in the cold\\". It's really dark lyrically, but the prettiness of Sandy's voice gives the melody a tricky effect. \\"Percy's Song\\" is a more traditional style of folk, and it's a pretty passionate one. Sandy Denny steals the show once again.     Overall, no folk/rock isn't my favorite genre. No way. Jazz/fusion or progressive rock is. However, I can see myself going back to this album every so often.

1423101502|5.0|I typically have given all the Percy books four out of five stars.  Mainly this is because I've never felt *quite* as connected/invested with the characters as some of my other favorite YA/MG series.  But, that said, I'm bumping up the last two books in the series to five stars, because, even though they might not personally be my all-time-favorite series they are head and shoulders above so many others!  The series wraps up with a good sense of closure, Riordan does a great job of bringing things together at the end, and I have to take my hat off to Riordan for the vast amount of research and re-imagining that he must have put into this series (I know I learned a lot about Greek Myths by the end!!).    Anyway, on to this book!  \\"The Last Olympian\\" is the final chapter in the Percy saga.  I won't go into story details, because I don't want to give anything away.  I felt that this book wasn't *quite* as \\"THE END\\" as some other final book in long series.  In a way, I was wanting just a tad more, but in another way it was nice to have it feel kind of like every other Percy book.  Plus, there was this lingering sense (at least for me) that maybe this isn't the end of these tales.    And even though I said I wasn't *as* connected to these characters as others in the literary world, I do love them.  I like Percy a lot!  He's got a good head and a good heart, and I wasn't ever really annoyed with him or felt his character needed to move along faster.  Ditto with Annabeth, Grover, etc.  This series is packed full of characters that I really liked and was really pulling for!    I also like the messages at the end here.  It was so great having a series that centered around such epic themes, monsters and Greek gods and Olympus, but really centered around something relatable, and probably themes a lot of kids can empathize with.    I'm definitely going to be reading \\"The Lost Hero\\" soon, and since I'm also a fan of Riordan's \\"Kane Chronicles\\" I'll have to add him to my author watch list, and make sure to check out whatever he publishes next!!

B001O2ZW1A|5.0|First of all, if you're looking for Porcupine Tree and won't accept anything else, you probably won't like this album. There's not much tight song structure, and the guitars are mostly there for ambience than to drive a consistent melody. The drumming, however, is top notch... thanks to the help of Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison. I didn't officially know that GH drummed on this album until recently, but I knew from having listened to the album because it's not hard to guess. You will recognize the drumming style from past PT songs, particularly the style of the toms.    The first track (\\"Harmony Korine\\") is loud and grand and atmospheric and the exception to the rule on this album. You should not buy based on this track alone because you will be disappointed if you are looking for that to hold up throughout the whole album.    The rest of the album is atmospheric, uneasy, quiet-then-loud, lots going on in the background, etc. It's experimental but not completely random -- there is a thread that holds everything together in most tracks, and that's the main reason it works, in my opinion.    It's drab and depressing, but in a good way. If your mind is congested and you are too tired to do much of anything, but this on and it will clear it up. Seriously -- it is a decongestant for the mind.    You really need to give it time to grow on you. To me, it's so different from most other music that I can't remember what most of the tracks sound like, even after repeated listens... but I quickly recall them as soon as I hear the first few seconds of the track. This doesn't happen to me with many albums and it probably means I'll never get tired of it.    Can't wait to hear what SW will do on his next album.

B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Really fun book to read, had trouble putting it down most nights.  Be sure you read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first because this book is a sequel.
0312323867|5.0|Amazing book definitely worth reading! I don't know anyone who didn't love it and think it was worthwhile! I didn't even want to read this one after reading something borrowed but i am glad I was convinced!
B004UA8D2S|1.0|I cannot believe this was inspired by a true story. The dialog was hokey and we know that standard formula of the mixed personalities. People always get bumped off in onesies and towsises. The \\"monster in the cave\\" movies are much better. At least people get eaten. I watched to the end to see if there would be a survivor that may get eaten by cannibals.<br /><br />The dialog was well less than stellar.  The photography was adequate. The characters would never be let out of the institute let alone in the water.<br /><br />However the fast forward button worked great.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I hope by buying this book it helps support Jaycee and her daughters. Her story, all in all, is amazing. She truly is an inspiration. The story is told by her, written by her and you can tell. It's written on an almost elementary level but that being said, I don't regret purchasing it because as I said-it's gripping and inspirational. It's a tragedy what happened to her family. But they outlook she has-is amazing and I hope she continues with it. I pray she doesn't let society and media bring her down.
B0058VW36U|2.0|I really enjoyed this game on an iPod. I got this game thinking it was the same, but without the ability to multitouch, some of the levels are just stupid. Even simple levels are frustrating because it was creates with multitouch in mind...Lame
B0037AGASG|1.0|I cannot stand Justin Bieber in any way shape or form. But because my daughter loves him I bit the bullet and bought this cd for her for her birthday. She's ten, she doesn't know good music yet so she loves this kid. Unfortunately I will have to hear his annoying voice over and over again when she opens the gift but knowing she loves him and can now listen to his music any time makes me happy for her. It reminds me of my own childhood listening to The New Kids on the Block. I'm sure my parents hated them just has much as I hate Justin Bieber. So if you want to make your daughter happy go ahead and buy this cd. At least it will keep them happy until the next \\"hot guy\\" comes around. Hopefully the next one will have some talent.
0553801473|3.0|GRRM set a very high standard with the first three novels in this series.  It's significant that he published those initial books in a four-year period.  In the eleven years since then, he has completed two books, both of which were disappointments to many readers.<br /><br />The previous installment, A FEAST FOR CROWS, improved on a second reading.  Except for the sequences with Brienne, AFFC had brisk pacing and plenty of plot.<br /><br />ADWD is much longer, and feels really, really long.  I got about halfway through and felt like nothing had really happened.  With the first three books, I couldn't put them down.  I took time off work and read for hours at a time, unable to break away and get interested in anything else.<br /><br />With ADWD, by contrast, I actually starting looking forward to finishing it.  I was constantly flipping ahead to see how many pages were left in the chapter I was reading, and came very close to skimming in several places.  By the end, I wanted more, but that's because the story was finally getting exciting, and I knew I'd be left hanging.<br /><br />There is just too much detail, too many incidental characters, and no real sense of events coming together.  It's more a collection of linked vignettes than a novel.  Martin is casting his net too wide; many of the subsidiary characters would be better dealt with in a series of short stories that could be published separately.  Dorne, the Ironborn, and Brienne would be good candidates for this treatment.<br /><br />However, Martin wants to include everything, and this more than anything else probably accounts for the long time it's taken him to get this far.  He has so many balls in the air that it's difficult to focus.  This book is a vast, sprawling, out-of-control mess that needs a good editor.  I half-expected to see a POV chapter entitled:  \\"THE KITCHEN SINK\\".<br /><br />Hopefully, if he's able to regain control of his material, he'll be able to finish the next book before Doomsday, and he can start bringing the disparate threads of the plot together.nd he can start bringing the disparate threads of the plot together.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|This app causes the Motorola Triumph to reboot randomly throughout the day. This occurs even when the app is not running. It caused me a lot of headache until factory resetting my phone. There is a thread on HoFo about this where others report the exact same problem.
0439023521|4.0|Let me start by saying that I decided to read this book because I was tired of being reminded that I really need to read this book. The Hunger Game series is on the top of most must read lists, so when I finally set down to read I was happy to find that I was not disappointed.    This book was interesting because the idea was without question unique. I had to get over the shock of the idea of reading about twelve to eighteen year olds killing each other to survive while an entire country watched what happened live. Today our world is filled with such jaded young people that I am sure this was not as big a shock to some other readers, but to me it was the hardest part especially if I became overly attached to a character.    Suzanne Collins made it easy to become attached to the all the characters in different ways, but the character that stole my heart was little Rue. While she is not a main character, she just brought me to tears at one point. Of course the other character I loved was the main character, Katniss. The story is told from her perspective. The internal dialogue she had with herself was comical at times, but for the most part it was her struggle to maintain her identity when every page threatened to take more of her true self away. Of course, no teen book is complete without some sexy men characters and Collins did not disappoint. There was Gale the boy who she has come to depend on and trust her family's lives with. Then, there was Peeta the boy who she must face in The Hunger Games, and if she wants to survive, come to terms with killing. Collins is truly gifted at developing her characters, making you cheer for necessary blood shed, but reminding the reader that even those that seemed to enjoy being in The Hunger Games were living as best as they could in a system set up for failure.    Now, the part I hate. The reason why The Hunger Games did not get a five out of five was because the ending felt rushed. The book is broken up into three parts that flowed together nicely, then all of a sudden \\"the games\\" were over and all of the other players were gone. It wasn't that I did not expect the end to come, just that it felt as if she decided: \\"That's it! They all must die!\\"    Overall, I thought the book was great. I will definitely be reading the rest of the series because I want to see how Collins continues the story. I hope you go out and pick up this book knowing that it will not disappoint.

1594744769|1.0|This is one of the stupidest books I've ever read. i don't even know why i finished it. to be honest i skipped every other paragraph. it was poorly written and predictable. i really wanted to like it and thought it had great potential but no. it lost me.
1401924751|5.0|First off, THANK YOU Amazon and the publisher for getting these cards out much earlier than anticipated.  I was so excited to find these in the mail so early!<br /><br />The artwork on these cards is as beautiful as they are on all the other decks I have.  The colors are very light and uplifting, and the energy is also very light and easy to work with.  And I love that not only can I ask about my life purpose in terms of future career possibilities and long-term, but I can also find out what is charted for me in my path for the next day or two.  I have had a good laugh at this twice.  About four days I asked about my purpose of the day, and in the immediate past card position I received ORACLE CARDS.  I had just done a few oracle card readings for a friend in the UK earlier that day.  She was really going through some uneasy times and needed some angelic guidance.  It made me feel good to know that I was right in life with my path.  I also noticed one day that I was quite attracted to flowers for some reason.  I love flowers as most women do, but that day on my walk even wild flowers were catching my eye and attention.  Later on that day I noticed that a local grocery store was selling beautiful colorful roses for $0.50 a piece.  I bought half a dozen for myself.  I never purchase flowers for myself.  Later that evening I laid out my cards, and again in the immediate past position was the FLOWERS card!  So there really are no coincidences in life.  ;-)  I must have needed the energy of flowers for healing on that day.<br /><br />I know in these times so many of us are finding ourselves either losing our jobs unexpectedly or no longer content with something we've doing for ten years, but we are scared to leave and need guidance.  These cards will really bring you some peace of mind and guide you in the direction that truly makes your heart sing.  I was once told that if we truly opened up to our Divine paths and did whatever is was that brings out our inner joy and Divine happiness, the finances would take care of themselves.  ;-)
B0055CJ8T2|1.0|This is wayyy to mainstream for me. Nothing groundbreaking on this album and it doesn't present her voice like it should. She sounds like a little girl talking about adult topics.

B00006I53S|5.0|This lens is as good as the reviews indicate.  I cannot wait to experiment more with mine before I go on a serious photo shoot.  The problem I have with this item is that the consumer is not aware while looking at the product description that most of the sellers are shipping \\"white box\\" products.  Unlike my other Canon lenses, this product arrived in a generic white box with no user manual.  I realize it is the same quality of product, but I had to research that while feeling deceived by the seller.  If there is really nothing wrong with the \\"white box\\" version, don't hide it when describing the product being sold!
0743496736|1.0|We had read My Sister's Keeper in our book group previously, and while not a great book, it was good for discussion. I could not have predicted how bad this book would be. Aside from the rip off of Columbine events, the \\"business\\" is contrived, the dialogue poor and the characters actions often unbelievable. A mother who is a judge, running late for work does not decide to make her teenage daughter bacon and eggs for breakfast. A boy does not meet a member of his soccer team on the bench during a game. Soccer practice starts weeks before the first game. There were so many moments like this where the characters actions did not ring true, I wondered if the author submitted her first draft to the publisher without reviewing her work at all.    The theme of kids on the outside and inside of the popular circle is hammered home repeatedly without any concern for the nuances of such groups in high school in reality. The actual sequence of events that take place during the shooting don't make sense. Picoult should have consulted more law enforcement before crafting this fictional crime. I wish I had not paid $16 for this book, but didn't have time to get it from the library. No more Picoult for me!

0811875040|3.0|I received this book a couple weeks ago, and today I got an email saying that a new book would be sent to me in October because the measurements in some of the recipes were wrong.  I opened the link in the email that says what exactly was typed wrong in the book, and WOW, there were a lot of corrections.  My advice would be to wait to buy this book until the NEW version comes out in October 2011, when the measurements are correct!    Also, beware: this book doesn's seem to be for the novel baker... these are real recipes that are somewhat challenging.  A few of the recipes are fairly easy, but most of the cakes require special techniques/pans/utensils, etc.  Buy this book if you are looking to take some relaxing time baking in the kitchen...do not buy this book if you are looking to quickly throw something together for your kid's bake sale!    Everything does look delicious though, and the pictures are certainly wonderful and the books scalloped edges are cute.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is very well written, the actors are understanding of their roles, they do a fine job of making the plot believable, and enjoyable. The directing is very good.

B003Y5H542|3.0|I order the movie Rango for my son's Birthday. I watched it with my nieces and thought it would be a movie he would love. I ordered it through Amazon Prime two day shipping. It was suppose to arrive on July 28th the day before his Birthday Party. This way we would would have time to wrap it. It didn't not make it to my house until the following afternoon. Yes I understand that I could have selected for amazon to wrap it for me but it was more money for them to do it than for me to do it myself. So he got his birthday gift in an UPS envelope. I was very upset about this even if my now 8 year old son was not. Two day shipping should mean two day shipping. If it can not be done it should not be offered but that is my own personal opinion.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I read and loved the Percy Jackson series, so I was wondering where Riordan was going to go with this tale. Well, he went straight to the bank with this one; this book bodes well for the new series \\"Heroes of Olympus\\".<br /><br />The action starts immediately. Jason is a boy who is suffering from amnesia. He wakes up on a school bus not remembering anything from his past, including anything about who he is. He is sitting next to Piper McLean, a girl who is apparently his girlfriend, and a boy, Leo Valdez, who claims to be Jason's best friend. The bus is taking them, along with the rest of the class at their school, the Wilderness School, on a field trip to the Grand Canyon.  The Wilderness School is apparently a school for delinquents.<br /><br />While they are there, they are attacked by `venti' or storm-spirits. Their teacher, Coach Gleeson Hedge, reveals himself to be a satyr, and helps fights the venti. Jason surprises himself by automatically using a sword disguised as a coin to fight off the spirits when he is threatened. Coach Hedge is captured while defending them. At the height of the battle, pegasi (two winged-horses) land next to them, carrying strangers: Annabeth  and Butch (who has a rainbow tattoo; he is a son of Iris). Annabeth is angry because she had a vision that she would find a clue to her missing boyfriend, Percy Jackson, at the Grand Canyon. She was told to look for the \\"boy with the missing shoe\\". Jason lost a shoe in the battle, but has no memories of his own identity, let alone Percy Jackson's whereabouts.<br /><br />The three students are informed that they are demigods (children of a god and a mortal) and are taken back to Camp Half-Blood where they meet other demigod children like themselves. There, Leo is revealed as a son of Hephaestus, Piper as a daughter of Aphrodite, and Jason as a son of Zeus and the brother of Thalia. He remembers his sister while seeing a picture of her in Cabin One. After scarcely 24 hours of learning about their previously hidden identities, the three set off on a quest to rescue Hera, queen of the gods, who was captured by unnamed forces.<br /><br />This book hits the ground running, and doesn't stop until the end, where Riordan sets you up for the sequel, in classic Riordan style.  The action is great, and the monsters are fabulous.  There is even a mechanical dragon, which I find to be an interesting idea.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|NO SPOILER ALERT  THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSIS<br /><br />You would be hard pressed to find someone who does not know the name of Jaycee Dugard.  This is the memoir of her life as a kidnapped 11 years old child, her 18 years of captivity, and subsequent return to her family.<br /><br />Jaycee's voice is strong yet, wavers between that of a child and the young woman she is learning to be.  I like the fact that she is able to write as the child she was when she was kidnapped.  Her stark storytelling places us with her; her fears, her emotions; and her turmoil.  In contrast, as she ages in the telling of her life's story, she uses excellent metaphors and has incredible insights.  This woman-child is all the more remarkable for her wisdom, inner strength, and willingness to let go of her horrific past.  How Jaycee survived is a tribute to both her and to her mom's love.<br /><br />The book is filled with the plain, unadorned truth.  Interspersed are Jaycee's 'Reflections'.  These are her thoughts that she shares with us, as she is painfully re-living what happened to her.  As you look at the family photos of 'Before', you are struck by a singular thought.  How could such an innocent child have survived and turned out to be such a fine young woman?<br /><br />Jaycee Dugard's story is a testament to the powerful will to survive and the commitment she has to make her life count.  She is a unique role model for all of us.

It synced seamlessly with my Google calendars and I get the same view I used with the stock calendar.  I noticed it has a refresh and a quick add button on the widget which also adds to its appeal.  I'm immediately happy with this purchase.
0740797719|5.0|This is a great book.  I highly recommend it.  I wish I had it way back when I began painting.  It talks about color and how light in different situations affects the appearance of objects.  I've never read why light in some situations are cool and in other situations are warm.  Gurney really goes into the whys and wherefores.  This should be a required text for any painting class.       Les

B0045HCJGC|5.0|A feast for Sly and Wesley fans, as they brawl it up in the past, present, and future: thawed out from their cyrogenic prisons (in 1996 or 2096? doesn't matter), they pick up the pace 36 years later in a new version of California, reconfigured following \\"the big one of 2010\\".<br /><br />A Dictator has arisen and brought about a new, Peaceful, orderly world...by driving the \\"lower element\\" underground. Sly and Wesley and Sandra Bullock shake, rattle, and roll in both worlds...and in both centuries - Bullock has studied the ancient past and is able to work with Stallone, as she understands his \\"primitive\\" culture.<br /><br />If that's too \\"out there\\", just enjoy the incredible special effects, the tight editing, the musical score. We look into the (not so distant) future... and see alot that does not seem so remote: the \\"freedom\\" of the above ground society comes at a great price - be subjugated by the powers that be and live clean, healthy...and not much more. The have-nots have no meaning in the new order.<br /><br />Watch for special cameo by Jesse The Body Ventura just before he became Jesse The Governor Ventura. And listen for a moderately portentuous mention of Arnold Schwartzenegger.<br /><br />The film never quite makes up its' mind if it's action-adventure or satire; that enhances its' presumptive \\"cult\\" status.<br /><br />Afterthought: Sly Stallon, pushing 50 at the time, looks to be about at his \\"Rocky\\" weight and very vital. There's a big list of stunt artists in the cloing credits but Stallone, Snipes, and others really broke a sweat for the fans.

0385736002|2.0|This book was very disappointing to me. I was extremely excited to read it and had heard some great things about the entire series so mabey my expectations were simply too high but I don't think that is what the problem was. Unfortunately I'm obsessive compulsive with book series and cannot stop reading no matter how bad the book is. I not only have to finish the one book, I have to finish the entire series! If it was not for this I would have put down the Alchemyst series half way through the first book! But me being me, I am now on the fifth book. And they don't get better after the first! The main problen in my eyes is that Michael Scott fails to develop his charicters. There are sooo many main charicters and way too many secondary charicters. instead of really focusing on a few main people and some secondary charicters that were central to the plot so that we as readers could really get to know the people we are reading about he just added way to many people and lost out on who they really are. To add insult to injury none of the charecters are even remotely likeable! You don't want to route for anyone because you really do not have an emotional attachment to them! To Scott's credit he really did a lot of reaserch. there are so many mythical people and creatures that I was on google looking them up constantly but it just goes back to the main problen of way too many charecters! The next biggest problem is that there are a lot of epic events that are taking place in this series yet they take place in a few days so nothing is portrayed in the light and weight that is deserved. Something that should take place over the matter of at least months and is supposed to b extremely dangerous happens in literally one hour in this series! It makes the whole thing pretty unbelievable and cheesy! When I read sci-fi/fantasy books I want then to be able to take me away and make me believe that this alternate reality (especially when it takes place in modern times on Earth) could be real and could actually happen! This series just did not do that for me and I find it to more of a waste of my time than a good way to spend my time!

B002Q8GZ62|5.0|I bought this album because of the incredible title track, \\"Once More.\\"  I stumbled upon the video on Youtube and was absolutely gobsmacked.  These guys have definitely gotten better with age.<br /><br />While Spandau Ballet was popular during my youth, as an American I probably didn't have quite the exposure to them as my British friends did.  Still, many of Spandau Ballet's songs became iconic and indelible parts of the 1980s American culture (\\"True\\", \\"Only When You Leave\\", \\"Gold\\", \\"Round and Round\\").  Picking up this album I was a little taken aback at first because the arrangements here are so different from the original releases.  But after a few plays the brilliance of this effort becomes apparent.<br /><br />These men have matured as musicians and it definitely shows.  Hadley's voice is as awesome as ever, and if \\"Once More\\" is any sign of things to come then my vote is for another album full of new releases.  In fact the title track may very well be the best song Spandau Ballet has ever done, and that's saying something!<br /><br />Overall I found the remakes better than the originals, with one or two exceptions (\\"True\\" was better as the original--it is really impossible to top that song--although the remake is nice, and the covers of \\"Only When You Leave\\" and \\"Gold\\" are in a dead heat with their originals to the point it is hard to choose which is best).  The remake of \\"I'll Fly For You\\" is astonishingly good, and the versions of \\"She Loved Like Diamond\\" and \\"To Make a Long Story Short\\" are way better than the originals.<br /><br />I've listened to this album so many times that I have a hard time remembering how to sing the originals properly. I'm not sure that I mind either, because this is an outstanding effort.  I love this album and so will you.  Five stars all the way.
B0057A6GA6|3.0|It's just limited, and there are much better choices as far as tower defense games go.  The game does look good, the controls are solid, and as long as you have a new device it runs smooth as well.  My biggest issue with the game is balancing.  I would play one game and have all the towers maxed out and just watch wave after wave get slaughtered.  Then the next game however I would max out every tower and the enemies would just walk right through as if they were strolling along the beach.  The game seems almost broken.  It either stops being a game or it becomes impossible to beat.  Either one means there are some real issues that need to be worked out.

B004SUDPXW|5.0|I thought for sure this would be the season where Breaking Bad began to slip.  Season 1 was, for lack of a better term, groundbreaking (but in every sense) and Season 2 was, at the time I thought, the possibly the best single season of a show I'd ever seen.  What floored me about this is, on paper, this show should not hold that title, but the acting, writing, directing and cinematography of the show really has no challenger.<br /><br />And then came along Season 3. The crazy part about it is its different in many ways from the other seasons.  There is an entire episode devoted to catching a fly (seriously).  Yet, it still does what it does, keep you captivated with a constant tension, lull you with the mundane then open up a firefight, and frame some of the best shots I've seen this side of a Hollywood movie.  Another milestone for Season 3, I feel, is the quality of the soundtrack - previous seasons were fine, but this season nails it with an eclectic mixture of songs that compliment the show and highlight excellent artists.<br /><br />Walt is not the same man he was in previous seasons, and here is where we plunge into the darkness, which finally aligns with his job. In this way, Season 3 brings some reconciliation of sorts, but its a cold comfort as our family man becomes the monster that a meth cook must be to survive.  The writing is superb, the acting continues to be some of the best I've seen on any screen, and the power and weight of this quirky little show about a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher cooking meth for his family's future has now secured itself in the halls of the best recorded entertainment ever produced.  I savored every episode, and I think if you are a fan, you will too.

B00005RDRO|4.0|This Movie Is OMG FUNNY. I Have Only Laughed Like This A Few Times In My Life, But WoW This Was Great Stuff
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I was 11 years when the first Toy Story came out. As a young kid I would fantasize my toys would come alive when I wasn't looking. More than once i tried to surprise them yet I was never successful. How silly this sounds now. Two years later I moved out of Peru and started a new life in the USA. I was instantly thrown into the school system. Not having many friends and not being accustomed I always resorted to movies and toys. I declared to myself I would never outgrow toys. I don't understand how anybody can? Yet little by little you do. You start college, work, new interests come and before you know it all your toys are either already gone or stored away. What happened? There was a time when a simple playtime with my G.I. Joe would be enough to keep me happy the whole day. But life continues and as certain stages end new ones start. What Toy Story 3 does is brings us back to that time of innocence, makes us remember exactly how it felt to be a kid again, gives a feeling of accomplishment and looks at the future with hope. Achievement no other movie has tackle so deeply before. There was a line in the first movie where Woody tells Buzz \\"You are a just a Toy! a child's play thing\\" And although at the moment the line didn't mean much. We now all realize they weren't just \\"Toys\\" they were part of us.
B00005RIKI|5.0|You can attribute that to endless plays of Sweet Home Alabama when it first came out.  To me, they were 'too polished'.  I much preferred the Allman Brothers.<br />  Two thinigs attracted me to this album: the 5 dollar price tag as a download, and the demos.  Here is Skynyrd in the raw, not quite shiny enough.  I could really appreciate their authenticity.  I then went on to purchse the first Musle Shoals album and Collectybles and scattered others.  Out of these, I've created a decent playlist of Skynyrd demos and outtakes.  I still turn the dial when Sweet Home comes on, but i appreciate their bona fide pedigree alot more than i used to.  And there sure ani't anything more American than Lynryd Skynyrd!

B0045HCJRG|4.0|Let me start by saying this is not a great movie, not even a great romantic comedy. The plot is corny and certain scenarios border on the absurd. Brilliant but eccentric inventor Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) believes an atomic holocaust has occur and hides with his wife in a self-sustaining fallout shelter beneath his suburban home. There they stay and rise their son until he is 35 years old. Sounds pretty weird and it is, yet there is something about this whole segment that captivates me, how the shelter becomes their whole world, they put a green carpet outside the main bldg to represent grass and the mom even goes with a shopping cart to do the groceries in the storage room. The dad teaching his kid history about a world he has never seen, there is some charm to it. And I gotta say all this is played tongue in cheek so is not a claustrophobic scenario but is more like a 50s TV sitcom played inside a nuclear shelter. Anyways once is determined to be safe to go up again, innocent but loyal Adam (Brendan Fraser) is sent to explore and get supplies and this is where he meets the cynical Eve (Alicia Silverstone). I think the success of this film relays on actors they given a script that is not always coherent yet they make it work. Walken and Spacek are amazing as the slightly loony parents and more than once I feel their detachment with reality a bit sad. Also Fraser & Silverstone's pairing are perfect for their roles. They both play opposites and successfully find a middle ground where their relationship works.

1451629184|5.0|This is the saddest, yet most inspiring true story I have ever read.  I cried thru the whole read.  How this little girl lived this horrible existance for 18 years probably is the result of her age at the time, and her home life.  Because she was very self reliant, shy, and willing to go along to get along, but yet had no worldly experience, probably made the difference.  Shawn Hornbeck was also 11 years old when he was abducted, and then found alive 4 years later. If both of these children had been older and more confrontational, the outcome may not have been the same.  I thought the best parts of this book were the details about her recovery and how she and her children have adapted to being free...but now are imprisoned by fame.  Her abductor and his wife sit in jail enjoying all the things she did not have...a clean bed, indoor plumbing and 3 meals a day.  It makes me so angry.  Pedophiles and their enablers deserve swift, final justice. There is no fixing these non-humans.  Jaycee Dugar is a hero.  May her life and her Mother's life be blessed with happiness forever more.  God Bless her.

B00430ESII|5.0|This is a great book for 5th and 6th graders.  It is a modern story of the mythological Greek gods and their half-god/half-human kids on earth.  Sounds familiar?  Yes it does.  But  there is some magical way how the book was written.  The author knows how to pin you on your seat and keep reading, and reading, and reading...  The main character is 12-year old boy which is exactly how old my son is.  He read it in 3 days, quicker than I did .  There is enough mysteries and suspense in this book that will keep you hooked till you get to the end of the page.

1451629184|5.0|I bought this book to support Jaycee and her girls. I did not want to read it. I did. And I felt, after reading the 1 and 2 star reads, that I should absolutely review this book, a real and revealing account. For those who wanted a ghost writer with considerable skill at writing emotion to infuse them with the shock and horror of some of the most demeaning experiences, I have to say ... did you read this book, and remember that it was written by the victim?<br /><br />There's no real spoilers in any review of this book, as we already know what happened to Jaycee, and about her ultimate liberation. The book is graphic.<br /><br />Jaycee more than adequately describes the confusion of being forced into adult acts, but she also conveys, like no one else can, how she distanced her emotions from those acts. She shared her feelings at the time, feelings that had become scabbed over. She did infuse us with the most unbearable part of her captivity, the isolation and loneliness. It occurred to me, quite by surprise, that while one can 'go somewhere else' during a rape, one cannot escape the soul-deep loneliness of long isolation. I read every word of Jaycee's journals, and how she learned to love, cope and nurture by caring for the cats. Her lists were so insightful, and most frighteningly, similar to the thoughts all young girls (and maybe boys) have at that age. Jaycee strove to improve her life, tend her garden more. I remember having those kinds of philosophic discussions with myself too, at that age, but I had a 'normal' life, surrounded by a loving family. Jaycee did this despite the serious lack of family support and healthy, emotional love.<br /><br />I did worry that the graphic parts would cause some pedophile to 'get-off,' but then, remember too, that victims of rape and childhood sexual abuse can also read those parts and learn that the shame is not their burden, not a part of them in any way, and they too can rise above what a horrible personal has done to them. They can identify with Jaycee Dugard, a very good role model for them.<br /><br />Jaycee's story is just that, her story. I found so much to think about and so much to admire her for.Jaycee Dugard, a very good role model for them.    Jaycee's story is just that, her story.

014241543X|3.0|*Spoiler Free*      This book has had a lot of hype, but for me it did not really live up to it. I expected a lot more unfortunately.       Now the book was sad, this is very true, but I didn't cry or do anything even remotely close to that. I loved Mia's family; her tough mum, her hilarious dad and her cute brother. I loved the whole family except from Mia. I felt sympathy for her, definitely, but she just felt a bit flat to me, especially in comparison to the rest of her family. She appeared quite dull and the whole serious musician act felt a bit cliché. I found her very one-dimensional and was wishing someone else from her family would survive. I was not too fussed whether Mia would choose to live or die.      The writing was good, but at some points in the book the syntax was a bit muddled and I found myself having to re-read sentences. Furthermore there were so many characters' names and I was often asking myself who they were. Also there was an appearance from a random famous character in the book. I did not see why this person came as they had little connection to the people in Mia's life. It was a bit bizarre to say the least, especially as I was dipping in and out of the story, my mind day dreaming about something else. It did not really hold my attention, particularly for such a short book and I did have re-read certain passages. You know when you read the words, but don't actually take any of them in, yeah that was me.       I loved Adam, Mia's boyfriend and Kim her best-friend. I also thought her grandparents were really sweet and I felt a lot of sympathy for them.      There were flashbacks integrated throughout the story. They definitely furthered the plot and it was sad to see such a happy family destroyed. However the flashbacks were not amazing and I found it tricky to absorb myself in them sometimes. Perhaps it's because I've just read the Summer series by Jenny Han which are filled with excellent immersive flashbacks. I'm not sure, but I was toooften wishing the flashbacks would end and soon!      However the last few chapters of the book were markedly different. I found them absorbing and the book was difficult to put down. I did like the book, but I did not love it. Protagonists have to be interesting to me otherwise I'm less likely to enjoy the book.      THE VERDICT  3 stars - This was a pretty good read and the ending was enough to make me read the next in the series; Where She Went.

B003TML0VO|3.0|Huge Santana fan right from the very beginning. I was playing the first LP within hours of it's arrival in my local record shop (I worked there!) I am prepared to forgive Carlos almost anything. But this? No, no, no. Let me count the reasons:<br /><br />1.  The title. It may be pretentious and presumptuous. That aside, it is just plain stupid. Honestly, if you are a rock music fan you will be arguing with the selections before you spin the disc. Photograph, Riders, Dance the Night Away - all first-rate songs. Guitar classics? I don't think so. If Carlos really did defer to RS in the selections then say no more. If he didn't then the person who made the picks should be interrogated.<br /><br />2.  The songs themselves - Does anyone really, truly believe that Carlos can add very much to Whole Lotta Love, Weeps, Sunshine, Smoke, Little Wing? These are guitar classics; the originals all feature top of the line guitarists. Having said this I will admit that this version of Weeps is actually interesting; not because of the guitar playing but because of the arrangement and the vocals.<br /><br />3.  The performances - disappointingly most of the songs on display here are simply glorified karaoke versions, serviceable instead of notable. I don't hate them, I just don't need them.<br /><br />4.  The engineering - will someone please tell the damned technicians that there are still people out here who play CDs on our stereos. We don't need the compression; we don't need the volume to be built in!<br /><br />Notwithstanding my considerable reservations I'm in the middle on this cd. I' d love to attend a concert where Carlos performed these songs with his guest singers. On the other hand I doubt that this cd will make it to my player at home very often. It's certainly better than the one star reviewers think and definitely not as good as those at the other end of the spectrum believe.

0060557818|4.0|Richard has a troll doll collection, gets snubbed by everyone in the office, and isn't the brightest bulb ever, but he manages to be a likable protagonist in Neverwhere. If you've ever wondered what's below the city sewer system and are too afraid to get your overalls muddy finding out, just read Neverwhere, because it's a whole lot creepier and weirder down there than you'd think.<br />Very enjoyable, and since I have a really broad, and welcoming imagination, I can definately imagine all this! Do I believe it? Eh, well ask my overused night lamp if I'm not the master of waking up terrified from books I've read. OK, that said, this isn't a Stephen King kind of book. It's a...er Neil Gaiman kind...packed with fantasy and adventure and weird cults and creatures living underground. Good pacing, and likely to keep you awake out of excitement as there's nothing that gave me nightmares in here.<br />.....Or is there?
B003UESJF6|4.0|I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, but I must say. It was pretty good! The story was well written and the dialogue was very clever. An evil bad guy becoming a good guy could easily have become trite and boring, but they did an excellent job making it interesting. I knew where the movie was going to end, but I just wasn't sure how they were going to get there. Will Ferrel's usual over the top performance fit really well with the Megamind character to make a hilariously fun bad guy.  For kids, I think this movie has a lot to offer, especially for those who like superheroes. This is a movie that is told from the bad guy's point of view and that's something that kids don't always get to see. They'll easily relate to the poor little blue boy in school. They'll like the tough guy rock music soundtrack too. At first, I thought it was bit too much, but really it's just fun music. Overall, a very good movie. Personally, I prefer this superhero movie over the Incredibles. I'm not saying it's better, just not as sentimental and mushy. That makes it more fun.
0553801473|4.0|The first three books in this series were fast-paced, with lots of huge, game-changing events per book, and that was part of the draw for me. A Feast for Crows and, now, A Dance With Dragons, aren't like that; they're slower, more contemplative, more thematically-driven rather than plot-driven. It's certainly a change, and I was initially a bit disappointed. But ultimately, I really liked A Dance With Dragons (and I ranked AFFC at 3.5).<br /><br />There isn't as much plot momentum here as in previous books, and at times I found that frustrating (although it helped to know about it going in). But I never found the book less than compelling; the character development is solid, the worldbuilding excellent, the writing good and the thematics strong, and enough happened to keep me interested. I enjoyed visiting new places on Martin's map and the immersive descriptions; it's as if I actually visited many of these places, something I value highly in any book. And I really enjoyed the look at the realities of leadership, seeing the characters grow and change, and gradually learning more about some of the backstory mysteries.<br /><br />It makes the most sense to discuss this book in terms of specific storylines, so I'll break it down (no spoilers!):<br /><br />DAENERYS: Unlike many readers, I found her chapters to be among the most interesting in the book. Previously she's done a lot of traveling, and it was cool to see her actually ruling here. The conflict between her values and principles and the realities of her situation was fascinating. A lot of people have been frustrated with her relationship with Daario, but despite his manifest unattractiveness I liked that too; Dany's at the age where this often happens, and how many fantasy heroines are allowed to have a fling? Also, this storyline let Martin flesh out Meereen more than he'd previously done with anyplace outside Westeros; in previous books I found Dany's \\"eastern\\" surroundings somewhat two-dimensional, but while the local characters still aren't as vivid as the Westerosi, here he goes a long way toward closing that gap.<br /><br />JON: Paralleling Dany's storyline, we see him trying to rule and the myriad difficulties he faces. Both he and Dany are faced with hard decisions and break new ground trying to do what they see as right, which didn't fail to keep my interest. Ends on a ridiculous cliffhanger--but while I've never liked Martin's ending books this way, he's done it since the beginning and I've gotten used to it.<br /><br />TYRION: His arc resembles Arya's in A Clash of Kings; he spends the book journeying toward a specific destination (Daenerys, in his case), and along the way he meets interesting people, develops as a character and faces a lot of personal reversals and changes of fortune.... without reaching his destination. I was a bit frustrated by this in both books (it's hard not to be). But there's a lot there, and it's interesting to see Tyrion try to make it without being able to call on the Lannister name or the wealth of Casterly Rock every time things go sour.<br /><br />THEON/REEK: Martin likes to challenge your opinion of a character. I didn't like this arc as much as many others; Ramsay is so two-dimensionally sociopathic and evil that it was hard to summon up any feelings toward him, and having hated Theon in previous books, I wonder if being victimized has really improved him. The jury's still out on that.<br /><br />ARYA, BRAN, DAVOS, JAIME, CERSEI: Only get a couple chapters each, although they're interesting. This book is certainly sprawling; there are so many characters in so many different places that it just isn't as unified as, say, A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />QUENTYN: Has an interesting storyline and a complete arc. He himself is rather dull, but he was intended to be. A thoughtful examination of the forces at work on somebody in his position.<br /><br />SELMY: Meh, kind of a less interesting copy of Eddard Stark. He's more another pair ofeyes on Meereen than an important character in his own right.<br /><br />ASHA: Not many chapters, but hard-hitting and atmospheric. We get a taste of Westeros winter here, and it's a scary thing. Also, Asha herself is awesome.<br /><br />VICTARION: Also doesn't reach his destination, but there are some fascinating things going on in his chapters. I still hope somebody stabs him though.<br /><br />ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE: Yes, there are more. It's a big book. The downside is that when a chapter ends, we often have to go 100 pages or more before seeing that character again; the upside, that there's a lot going on.<br /><br />Ultimately, a lot of this book is setup, and I'm not thrilled with that; when most of the best books of all time are significantly shorter than this, does Martin really need nearly 1000 pages for setups and transition? It's easy for fantasy series to become self-indulgent, and here a couple arcs seem to have their climaxes deferred; others simply don't go where I thought they would, and that's fine.<br /><br />It's not a perfect book, aside from that--there are some important secondary characters who aren't very vividly drawn (especially true in Dany's chapters), but then there are great bit-part characters of the sort I've come to expect from Martin. I have some reservations about his treatment of gender issues--for the most part he does all right, and at least he's thinking about it, but at times he falls flat because he's just so entrenched in the male gaze.<br /><br />Despite all that, I enjoyed the two weeks or so I spent with this book. It's a well-written, intelligent novel, and enough twists and turns are thrown at the reader to keep me satisfied. None of the characters are the same as they were at the beginning of this book, nor are their storylines.

0345457692|5.0|I was told to check out Altered Carbon by a friend because I had liked James Knapp's Revivor Series (State of Decay, The Silent Army and Element Zero).    Both Altered Carbon and Knapp's books have a similar \\"look and feel\\", although they are not carbon copies of one another.  For example, in both books, the main character is a detective (or at least is acting in that capacity).  Both books offer a dark Earth future, although in Knapp's books that future seems near while in Altered Carbon the future is thousands of years from now.  Both books have high tech enhancements and alterations to human flesh.  Both books have lots of violence and some sexual content.     One big difference is that Altered Carbon has explicit sex scenes.  The main character Takeshi Kovacs gets down and dirty with two different female partners.   I'm not a prude, but I've never read anything like it in a Science Fiction novel.  Altered Carbon's sex scenes are something you might expect to find in pornography.  And while Knapp's books have some references to prostitution, the main plot of Altered Carbon revolves around it.    I have to say I liked Altered Carbon a lot, just as my friend predicted I would.  The main reason I like the book is because Richard K. Morgan takes the time to thoroughly delve into the technological, psychological and social implications in making a copy of a person's consciousness and putting it into a new body.   I plan to read more of Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs books.  Likewise, anyone who likes Altered Carbon should check out Knapp's books.

0811870413|5.0|Great guidance from Chad Robertson, like having him in the kitchen with you.  I have made a lot of bread and was never completely satisfied with crumb and crust at the same time; one would turn out right and the other would be off a bit.  Following these recipes and techniques I have made the breads of my dreams.  Great photos and practical, useful advice.  Well thought out recipes and very precise.  A beautiful and useful book.
0618918248|4.0|it is really good book very convincing regarding how evolution explain a lot regarding the diversity and complication of life but evolution is just the mechanism that shapes creatures and there is still lot of work to do to find out how DNA and first cell formed.DNA is very complicated to start by chance.

0553801473|2.0|I love the series coming late to it after watching the HBO special. I am truly sorry for all the fans that waited FIVE years for this book. I only waited 3 months after reading the first four this year. What a disappointment! Worst of all, every character was left in a cliffhanger, if it can be called like it. So many loose ends from the previous book that in conjunction with this one, the whole book looks like a fur ball. And now it seems that we may have to wait FIVE more years to see a conclusion? What a disappointment!
B001R60ESE|5.0|Chris Botti makes a concert into a wonderful collection of masterpieces.  There are some songs that seem like they drag on for a little too long, but they are all masked by the excellent selection of duet songs.      I thoroughly enjoyed this concert and would gladly recommend it to anyone else interested in classical and jazz music.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|System: ASrock z68 Extreme 4, Intel i5 2500K CPU,    Runing SiSoftware Sandra CPU Burn In test for about ½ hr.  Max CPU temp with stock Intel fan reached 84°c. This is pretty high. The max Junction temp for this chip is listed at 95°c.  The stock fan is also very noisy. Sounds like a 747 is inside the case trying to get out.  Installed the  Hyper 212 + and ran same tests. Max CPU temp during test run was now 47°c.  That pretty much says it ALL!!    Probably the best $25 I ever spent in 45+ yrs [yes, really true] of working on computers.   Or as we in the trade used to call em, \\"Giant Electronic Brains\\".    One caution, you must remove the MoBo to install the backing plate for the heat sink hold down plate.  Most people reading this won't have any problem with that.  Also the  heat sink is quite tall, about 6\\" but fits inside my Cooler Master c692 case OK.    Good product, does what it says it will do, doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  What more do you want??    Stu Kennedy
B0055D3EOG|2.0|Decent production values and the sometimes startling visuals and soundtrack might make this movie an effective entry for an adolescent's Halloween film festival.<br /><br />For others, the story involves far too many actors wandering around in some kind of juvenile derivative gobbledygook about \\"astral projection\\".
B002L4QP0M|4.0|This would have earned a five star rating had the Kindle version not been awash in typographical errors. Lots of  cold war action and unexpected turns. As a new Kindle owner I can only hope that all the books don't look as if they were the pre-proof reader copy.
B004NSULHM|2.0|As a Radiohead fan, one can't help but make allowances for the band's ever-changing sound; it's become Radiohead's defining attribute. \\"In Rainbows\\" was a fantastic outing beyond its pay-what-you-want approach; it was a well-grounded, relaxed, heavily-textured album, possibly their best since \\"Kid A\\", but \\"King of Limbs\\" is not much to write home about. That's saying a lot too; even \\"Amnesiac\\" was something to write home about.    In the album's defense, I think Stanley Donwood (the band's artist) put it best when he compared \\"KOL\\" to a transitional snapshot...because that's exactly what it is. However, it's one of the band's most forgettable snapshots. Not a whole lot stands out, even when the record is on a loop. Granted, there are at least 3 good songs featured: \\"Lotus Flower\\" and the back-to-back nature-centric tracks \\"Codex\\" and \\"Give Up the Ghost\\", but the remaining songs are just meandering, minimalist collages of chopped up beats and fleeting guitar riffs. It's not like we haven't heard this kind of stuff before either, but not with this much frequency. This wouldn't be much of an issue if it didn't take up more than half of the record's 38 minute runtime and bury the aforementioned songs.     As with all of Radiohead's releases, I've played the whole thing several times because I wanted to give the record a chance to reveal itself. It took me several listens to fully appreciate \\"Amnesiac\\", which is the closest thing I can compare \\"KOL\\" to. While that record had the benefit of being a companion piece to \\"Kid A\\", this record unfortunately comes off as an afterthought. If anything, \\"KOL\\" is basically Radiohead at the crossroads, and it was probably never meant to be taken for more than what it is--a record to simply bridge the gap. There's no telling where they'll go after this, but the next proper LP (or EP?) will most likely be an improvement.
B004LWZWE2|5.0|Maybe my ears aren't the best, but contrary to other reviews I thought the audio quality was fine.  Not great, but considering the age of the film perfectly acceptable.  I turned up the refresh rate on my 46\\" LCD and I was blown away by how \\"live\\" the performance seemed.  Cheesy production values on some of the it, but inline with concert vids from the early 80's.  Well worth the money if you're a true AC/DC fan.
B0000041Z6|5.0|I have had this box set for years. Mahler mentioned that he wanted his symphonies conducted fast. He was frightened that after his death, conductors would go for slow tempo's. Solti being a Jew and having had a difficult time in his early life, could relate to Mahler. Therefore, his speeds are just what the master wanted. Bernstein could relate to Mahler deeply. He is another side of the coin as it were.Bernstein is better seen on DVD. So I can recommend to you both sets.    Of course those looking at these reviews for guidance, will only become confused. A review is only an opinion, or a matter of taste. Solti is accused in these reviews of being superficial. Actually,the world that Mahler created at times, could be cynical,poking fun at superficiality. Mahlers trumpet sounds, coming out of the blue,are memories of when he was a child, living near a army barracks. His cheap dance tunes, he also heard as a child. He would run out of the house when his parents were arguing,hearing the popular music played by an organ grinder. Hense,a beautiful or serious tune, is suddenly interupted by a banal dance. Look at some of the earlier symphonies as music patterns placed one on top of the other. Each interwoven with the other, then going off into another direction. To understand Mahlers symphonies,you must read about his life.This is the case for Wagner. Other composers you do not really have to understand, just listen. If you are looking for deep answers in these symphonies, you will not find them. For Mahler was asking the same questions as you. Who are we? Why are we here. Why do we suffer. Look at the inanities we face in our daily life. That is why he appeals to modern audiences, who on the whole have no answers, only questions. Why can life be so trival. Is there something more. Mahler wanted his music played fast, because then the emotion,tension and themes come to the forefront, as in Wagner whose music he admired. In conclusion buy this set, then think about the Bernsteins DVD's.
0143143492|5.0|The audio version is fantastic (I bought it from someone else, see below)  I think a few words are in order.  After ordering and receiving a notice of shipment, I received a separate notice indicating that the audio version I ordered was in fact a paperback, and that Amazon had canceled the order and refunded my money.  Now that is a good thing, that they caught the problem before I received it is nice.  The next step in the process is to catch the issue before I even order it, so that my ordering of an audio version results in my receipt of an audio format. Outside of that everything is in order.

B005AUWXZ0|5.0|... our family LOVED it!  As parents, the days of living for ourselves is long gone.  We now enjoy watching our children find enjoyment... and in this film, both our 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter found a lot.  Maybe some people have forgotten what it was like to be a child, but this film incorporates all the coolness of action/adventure films, and all the thrills of more grown-up blockbusters, and puts them in a film children can safely watch and enjoy (with their parents who won't be bored out of their mind).  Is it going to win an Oscar?  Probably not.  But, is it something fun that a whole family can do together?  You bet!<br /><br />I also don't understand why people are complaining about the \\"violence\\" in the film.  We're extremely sensitive to truly violent content, and nothing in this film comes close to content in films like The Incredibles (also by Pixar), Monsters vs. Aliens, Mega-mind, etc.  If this stuff bother's you... then stick to Strawberry Shortcake, and the like.<br /><br />And, needless to say, Pixar has set the bar incredibly high for future filmmakers to reach, including themselves.  So, perhaps this one doesn't top Finding Nemo or Toy Story 3... (very few films ever will).  But, this film is still far and above the majority of animated fare out there from other studios.<br /><br />You know, I'm all for pushing the art and craft of movie making.  But, not all films are meant to attain classic status, but are instead created to simply be fun and to entertain.  This one does that in spades!  So, ignore the critics, round up the family, and just enjoy a fun movie together.<br /><br />NOTE ABOUT 3D CONTENT:<br /><br />We saw this in its 3D presentation in theaters (which will most likely be the same, or very similar, transfer for blu-ray).  Like most Pixar 3D offerings, the 3D is understated and its emphasis is on adding realism and providing an immersive experience, rather than shock value.  Don't expect too much WOW factor... but instead, expect a fully fleshed out world that you will feel a part of.  (Much more desirable in my opinion.)  We plan on buying the 3D version because it really did make a fun story even more fun.  Enjoy!ou will feel a part of.  (Much more desirable in my opinion.)

B003YL4LYI|3.0|It's nigh impossible for George R. R. Martin to write a terrible book. So, despite the shortcomings of this book, it is still better than many others on the market.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons should have been ONE book. Had they been edited properly, removing the constant description of nobles and their arms/crests, etc., there would have been an, almost, excellent book.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the repetitious descriptions and the cliff hangers. Books 1 - 3 were amazing books! They wrapped up some plots while furthering the overarching plot. This book, unfortunately, runs around in circles trying desperately to avoid anything that might have been \\"predicted\\" by fans. So, where does that leave things? Outrageous, ridiculous occurrences. That's where.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this series, borrow the book from a friend or a library. There are some fantastic parts in it and we can only hope and pray that the next book will come in a timely manner and make a heckuva lot more sense than parts of this one did.<br /><br />As for the treatment of 'main' characters... I am really disappointed with the arbitrary murder, etc. of characters just for shock value. Can we get back to the fantastic, meaty books of 1 - 3? Please?
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I should have known I was in for something after I read George's acknowledgment that writing this book was three bitches and a bastard.  Well for the reader it has been a DOUBLE MUTHA!! I have been a fan of this series since the paperback edition of AGOT was released - the one whose cover shows a dark haired Fabio dressed in black and riding a black destrier through the snowy vistas with a white wolf at his side. Yeah - I've been on this journey for some time.  As the first three novels were so compelling - I wolfed them down in a few nights.  Even AFFC - I forced myself to finish in five days. But this one - ADWD - OMG!! it's been nearly three weeks since its release - and I am still trudging through this profusion of prose and maze of delusions after 763 pages. Again - OMG and WTF! Reading this book has been exasperating and I am in total agreement with the 2-2.5 star ratings.  Oh Seven Gods and R'hllor, Lord of Light, give me the strength to finish this book!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Since I think I have all of George's individual albums, this purchase was really a luxury, but I'm greatly enjoying this.  Every fan will have tracks that they would put on their BEST OF pick, and I would place the gorgeous \\"Just for Today\\" on mine, a lovely melody and one of the most clear spiritual lyrics by any artist.  The fun loving side of George is one I love with his cover of \\"Hong Kong Blues.\\"  But this collection has a very strong selections with the gorgeous instrumental and one of my favorite of his songs included, \\"Marwa Blues.\\"  Of the Beatles' live versions, I would have enjoyed a live version of \\"If I Needed Someone,\\" one of my favorites.  But \\"Isn't It A Pity,\\" \\"Got My Mind Set On You,\\" and of course \\"My Lord\\" are about as good as it gets.  George was blessed by having a position as a former Beatle to allow him to think a bit less about commerciality, which resulted in some of the most sublime music of his era.  \\"Let It Roll\\" is a grand celebration of this master musician.  Enjoy!

0937381888|5.0|Great book for the beginner, intermediate or accomplished brewer. I jumped in head first and went for all-grain as my baptism of fire. And you know what? With this book as a companion throughout my first brew it turned out quite all right. The second was just great and the thirds is fermenting as I write (a Belgian Strong Golden Ale with yeast harvested from a 'real' Belgian beer bottle...

159562015X|3.0|I have yet to take advantage of all this book has to offer because I made the mistake of buying it used. The problem? There is a one-use-only access code that you need to be able to take an online test and take advantage of the assessments that it provides to you online. If it has already been used or removed from the book, you cannot do the activity.     The book isn't totally useless--I read it anyway, and pretty easily found my 5 strengths on my own--all were predicable as I have used other similar books in the past. There are suggested action steps for each of the strengths, some of which I found helpful. I had hoped to get more out of how to channel those strengths into \\"x type of jobs.\\" I think detail is lacking here.
B005DC68NI|4.0|Let's Get Digital is a handy, helpful reference. The info is of-the-moment, so you're getting news you can use NOW. The first section is a wide lens view of the current state of the book industry and while I had read this info elsewhere, it was spread across several blogs. The appeal of Let's Get Digital is that it gathers all this far flung info into one place. The next section deals with marketing your e-book through social networking channels; of particular use to me were the points on SN etiquette. I think of myself as quite polite in person, but the author alerted me to several internet faux pas I had either recently made or was about to make. The last portion consists of 30+ authors first-person accounts of their experiences with self-publishing and sales, which I found grounding and inspiring. This is a good book to read if you're starting to write your first book or if you've been trying to get your book published. It's also a good gift for someone who is at that point.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for 4 years now and have quite a collection of bookmarks and notes. I find this is a great way to follow in church and highlight sections for review. The ability to switch Translations on the fly is invaluable. I use NIV as my base Bible but often go to NKJV or ESV to see the text differently. When Apps were conceived I think this is exactly what was in the mind of developers. A handy easy to use app with incredible flexibility.
B000PMG16U|1.0|Mr. Plinkett has dissected the terrible prequel trilogy in the best reviews of the films. That being said, why do people pay money for these? They are boring and poorly made. Expensive, but poorly made. While the originals are corny and flawed, they had character and heart. These cash-grabs are lifeless, uninspired wastes of time. Please people, stop supporting anything prequel related and ignore them. Just remember the original canon and forget the new.

0439023521|3.0|My school assigned this book as summer reading for all (about to be) high school sophomores.  We are actually assigned to write a \\"letter\\" to Suzanne Collins and explain our thoughts about the ending or an important event in the book that causes us concern.  Though this is a great book, it has terrible, choppy, grammatically incorrect, and simply treacherous sentences scattered among the pages.  It seams as though there are a lot of run-on and fragment sentences, and the sentences don't really flow.  It seams as if the sentences are sometimes disorderly scattered in the paragraphs.  I find Suzanne to repeat a lot of the words she uses to describe actions and feelings often.  I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of vocabulary, or a lack of creativity or a thesaurus.      I must say though, that just because the grammar and sentence flow may be horrendous, it is a good book.  You're probably wondering how that can be.  Well, let's just say that there's more to a book than grammar and the fluency of sentences.  The plot seams to keep me interested, as it is different from the other books I have read.  I find at times I can't wait to read what happens next, no matter how predictable it may be at times.  It's sort of like waiting for your favorite part of a movie; You know that what's coming is inevitable, but you can't wait to see it anyway.    I don't think I will have difficulty with my school's assignment to critique Collins' work.      -Jessica
B00139W3NE|3.0|When Harry Potter came out I ran across an internet article that described a number of children's films as more or less Harry Potter wannabes that failed to capture audience share.  The comments posted on the article suggested that a number of readers felt this was a harsh assessment, so I decided to view some of these films and read the books upon which they were based. The Golden Compass was one of those cited.<br /><br />The story is hardly a Harry Potter wannabe, though it probably owes a lot to [[ASIN:0060765488 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Movie Tie-in Edition (Narnia)]].  While it deals with the same issues facing young people--friendship, courage, loss, development of an identity--these are all things that are part of the genre and not specific to Harry Potter.  Almost all literature is based to some degree on predecessors.  There is probably only one children's book I can think of that seems truely divorced from all other formats and that is [[ASIN:1612930301 Alice in Wonderland]], though [[ASIN:1450515932 Through the Looking Glass: Complete and Unabridged]] might be said to have given even that a \\"copycat.\\"<br /><br />The story of The Golden Compass essentially describes what actually happens to children in society at large.  Schooling, society's priorities and stern discipline of infractions do indeed mold people to \\"fit,\\" whether they want to or not.  In essence children's spirits, or here their \\"demons,\\" are forced to conform or be lost.  The question isn't whether or not they are, but to whose agenda they are ultimately molded, and that is determined by a society almost always dominated by adults.  It comes as no surpise that it is the child's own mother who is among the forces suppressing other children and their families while protecting her own daughter and her demon from similar forces.<br /><br />The universal \\"correctness\\" of society is what the young always question, and it is usually the young and spirited that force society itself to change by degree over time.  It is for this reason that life now is so different from life in ones grandparent's generation.  The difference is easier to see when looking back three generations.  It is hardly surprising then that it is children that are perceived as \\"dangerous\\" by the adult powers in this story.  Adults have a heavy investment in the status quo; any changes can work to their distinct disadvantage and to that of their children.  At base, the Golden Compass might be seen as an unbiased guide to how society is \\"supposed to be,\\" which is why the adults want to suppress it and why only a child can \\"read\\" it.<br /><br />Although I have yet to read the book, I did watch the film.  I was a little disappointed in it.  While it certainly deals with the issues facing children, it seemed to lack charm.  I couldn't help wonder if the problem was less the children and more the adults.  A number of high profile actors played adult roles and did so superbly.  However, the quality of their acting ended up overwhelming the child roles, creating a sense that the story was more about adults and less about children and the \\"magic\\" of youth.  This is an odd way to convey philosophical information to adults, most of whom know it already and a disappointing way of presenting it to children.  (For myself I worried less about either and more about the animal \\"demons\\".)  Somehow it just didn't come together well.<br /><br />Perhaps the problem is that the actual goal of the film--which was probably about making money and not about messages at all--even perhaps of the book on which it was founded, was indeterminate.  Was the story about adults who feared change?  Or was it about the spirit of children and the necessity, even imperative, of change.  Maybe it was simply left to the audience to decide for themselves: sacrifice security and tradition and endure rigidity and loss of creativity, or endure anarchy and shifting fortune for the privilege of creativity and change.  In the end the film seemed ambivalent.  History tells us that time is not.  (Evolution tells us that it cannot afford to be.)<br /><br />The film is a nice blend of CGI characters and live action (though I couldn't help feel that the whole metaphor of the \\"spirit\\" of youth captured in \\"demon\\" animals was a little heavy handed).  I enjoyed all of the animals immensely.  The genre has come a long way since [[ASIN:B00007AJGH Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Vista Series)]]!  The sets and costumes were beautiful and evocative of the 1930s and that quintessential of all ridged and totalitarian regimes, the Nazis of the same period.  It was precisely this that made the decision for the viewer that change and creativity must be more valuable than stability.  It usually is, but the question is always for whom?ent.

B001CTDH76|5.0|I couldn't get enough of the antics of Simon Baker as Patrick Jane, using his powers of observation (as opposed to his former  fake psychic abilities) to help  reveal clues for his team to solve cases. Much to the embarrassment of many suspects lives (and lies) and also \\"innocent bystanders.\\"  And lead agent, Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney) is always in control, but wondering what tricks Jane \\"has up his sleeve,\\" and what orders he isn't going to follow or ignore. Sometimes dragging one or all of her team members with him, working on a hunch, or just being insubordinate. Because he really isn't a cop, \\"Just a Consultant\\" -  he really doesn't have to follow rules or anyone's orders. Or so he thinks.<br /><br />There are many light-hearted scenes, interspersed with the serious parts of crime-solving. Agents Cho (Tim Kang) and Rigsby (Owain Yeoman) can be crack-ups as they interact. Cho, being the serious one, and Rigsby the \\"Get it?\\" \\"I don't get it?\\" guy. Rigbsy also being in love with Agent Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti - See episode \\"Russet Potatoes\\"), the rookie who to wants to prove herself, and believes in the life hereafter, as opposed to Jane's atheistic view.<br /><br />I liked the fact that some episodes conclude with somewhat sappy, happy endings (with Jane's help), and others with darker, more somber endings; reminding Jane of the deaths of his family at the hand of Red John. And also Jane reflecting on his obsession with finding and killing Red John, and whether it will make any difference to the emptiness in his life; knowing it won't bring his family back.  The dialogue between Lisbon and Jane in the final moments of the season ending finale (see episode \\"Red John's Footsteps\\") is both haunting and touching.  Excellent writing, acting, directing and mood music.<br /><br />P.S. Robin Tunney is so darn cute, and Amanda Righetti is gorgeous.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I received the 405CX in the Fall of 2010.  I have been running with this watch now for 9 months and have been satisfied.  Initially, the bezel took a little time to get used to and the initial setup was not too much problem.  Overall, the first 9 months were great.    The problem started in the Summer of 2011 when the watch battery would go from 100% down to 0% in just a few minutes and the watch would just stop working.  This happened even though I charged the battery every night.  Now the watch does not charge and does not work at all.    I loved the watch initially but for the money that one must spend for this watch, it is not worth it.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I thought this movie was quite good. You might have to think a little when watching, but not much, and it's an enjoyable \\"what if\\" story to consider. It's not a disposable, blow 'em up action movie. It's not obtuse and self-important like a lot of indie films trying to be artsy. Like many people past their 20s, I find most films quite derivative of what's been done. I thought this was original enough, and may even watch it again sometime (and I rarely watch a movie more than once).    Best line: \\"It works better when you're smart to begin with,\\" (or something like that).

B0002VFXFE|5.0|As many of you know, silver-based compounds are superior to silicone bases for CPU heat transfer.  I can tell you that Arctic Silver 5 proves this to be the case.  I read the customer reviews on Radio Shack's site and they all praised the RS silicone compound, but it does not work sufficiently for modern machines in my experience.<br /><br />I have an Intel I5 760 Quadcore processor with the stock intel heat sink.  With the RS silicone base, I was getting CPU temps of 99C at 100% load! This is the core max temp and is obviously not good for the processor. I achieved this max temp within 30 seconds of running Prime95 torture test and within about 1 minute of running a heavy TIF file export out of Lightroom3. I needed a different solution. I tried dismounting the heatsink, reapplying the RS compound - same deal. (I applied properly with a thin layer, evenly spread).  All to no avail.<br /><br />Ordered this Arctic Silver 5 stuff and immediately at application, the difference was obvious. It's extremely thick and spreads very evenly. I used a guitar pick and got it very thin and very even on the heat sink plate. I installed it and immediately ran the Prime95 torture test...<br /><br />Whereas I got to 99C in seconds before, I have been running the torture test now (it's still going as I write) for about 32 MINUTES and the core temps have not exceeded 85C!<br /><br />I will never use another thermal compound for my CPUs.

B003DTLUFO|5.0|An adorable breakdown of Black Rock Shooter. The level of detail is more so than one would think of a figure so small, even down to smaller stuff like her scars are well painted. The number of accessories is amazing, from her actual Black Rock shooter to the number of hands and arms to pose her with. Even her other two faces are wonderfully detailed. With multiple stands and a vast array of poses at disposal this is one of the many Nendoroids I was happy to add to my collection.
B002RT69QQ|5.0|I got this card as a gift and I use this as a huge mini USB flash drive. The biggest flash drive I have is 2GB so this product does way more for a great price. It is a class 4, so it isn't the fastest reading and writing speed.  But you only need faster classes for cameras.<br /><br />Great card, great price. I highly recommend it. This card will fill your needs. 16GB is a lot of space.  I have never had an issue with Kingston before so I expect this card to last a very long time. BUY THIS CARD! You will love it!

B001G9FFKY|5.0|Mate, I love this album. this is by far my favourite Metallica album, saying that listening to the studio version on 45 vinyl i couldnt believe my ears. it sounds so original. awesome album to add to your collection. I love the fact that 'one' takes up one whole side of a 45 vinyl.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book. I read it years ago while in high school when the Bachmann books were released in one text. I found this one to be the most attention grabbing, and memorable story. A true one of a kind. All of the books were enjoyable and I would highly recommend them to anyone that is a King fan. Some of his best work.
B004UOCF3W|1.0|Although I have heard this cd is great, I have yet to hear it! I preordered my copy from the website, Amazon sent it to me and there was no disc in the sleeve! What the F!<br /><br />At the time that i recieved this cd, I was on tour with Hourcast as Chad Szeliga's (Breaking Benjamin) drum tech and we were on our tour bus dying to listen to it and when I finally opened it, NO DISC!. SUCK!<br /><br />How many copies of this went out with no disc in the sleeve? Unacceptable. Thats why it got 1 star. Maybe I will change my rating if I EVER here it.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This show is wonderful!  Whitty, well acted, and interesting story lines and writing.  The characters spark with each other.  It's fun and entertaining.  This is my favorite show!
B0000067L3|5.0|I have been listening to this album since it was released in the 60's.  The album does not have a consistent theme or the best sound quality.  However there are a few cuts (vinyl speak) that allow this album to be an essential item in anyone's rock and roll album collection.  This is one of the few albums that occupies space on my auto's music hard drive.  I usually only find one cut on any album that rates Hall of Fame (H/F) status.  This album has 3 H/F cuts.  While White Room is a well known cut on the album it is not in my H/F list.  The 3 cuts that are in my H/F are all from the 2nd disc and are live versions of Crossroads, Traintime and Toad.  Crossroads is the driving tribute song to Robert Johnson, the first member of the 27 club.  Traintime is the perfect lead-in to Toad, one of the greatest live drum solo's of the sixties.

0756655307|5.0|It's a good reference when watching some of the animated series like the latest, Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, which has animated dozens marvels villans. Given the comprehensiveness of the volume and the hardcover it's a good deal for the price. Like the artwork in the other comic giant's encyclopedia the images are not consistent across the book. Some of the illustrations of some characters look as if they were lifted out of a comic from the 1970s - maybe the last time the character appeared in print!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Review from Toshiba Thrive 16gb.<br /><br />I wanted to really like this app, my sis would have loved it - and I could really use it.  I also RARELY give one star reviews.<br /><br />I have uninstalled, rebooted, installed the update, and this bad boy won't play any videos.  Before the update,  it wouldn't even go into a recipe, just hung on a picture, locking up the tablet.  Also, the app is supposed to be using SD cards for storage, however - I can't see where ANY storage of downloaded material is taking place  Thrive has a file manager, and no folders are created for this material - either in internal or SD card memory.<br /><br />Bottom line, not ready for tablets (at least running Honeycomb), and too much data storage to be useful.  Must uninstall, and hope the developer makes it worth the price.  Non-functioning, and rotation STILL is messed up.<br /><br />*******<br /><br />Edit to add:  This app starts the Maps app from Google (guess for locations, don't know).  Due to the Sleep issues with the Thrive, I have Use Network Locations, GPS, and everything under Location Settings turned off.  Until Toshiba comes up with their fix, Maps and Gps can only be used carefully and on-demand, or the Tablet crashes.  Just an FYI for other Thrive owners.

0446619078|5.0|The Harry Bosch series was recommend to me and although I have enjoyed the first three, it was this book that I couldn't read enough of.    It started with a bang, a detective who actually wasn't on the force in the book but found himself at the psychiatrists instead. He also lost his love, his house and was truly contemplating his job so he gave himself the task of finding his mothers killer, against better judgement.     This led our fearless yet lonely Harry down a twisted road which ended in more murders, cover ups, and in the end, more guilt on his shoulders. But it was this twist, the game, the way Connelly wrote his character without him being in the force yet still being a top detective, that made this book.     It was real. It was what we'd all do if we had to. It had terrible consequences that no one would want to live with. They bought with them cover-ups that you'd have to live with which we wouldn't want to either. This human touch bought a welcome warmth to what had been previously a well written but predictable series.     Now the sky isn't a limit and I have no idea where the next book is going to go! That is the mark of a true author! I hope the series continues in this manner. If you're only just starting it, keep on reading!    Highly recommend.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|I've been a Yes fan since the 70s and have particularly enjoyed Steve Howe's work outside of Yes.  I was hesitant about this album on the first play but it quickly grew on me.  I enjoy Benoit David's voice immensely and consider him an excellent substitute for Jon.  The sound remains very \\"Yes\\" and I was happy to add this CD to my collection.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I think I need to stop reading books then expecting Hollywood<br />to do something good when they make a movie.  They did a pretty good job with the special effects of the boars, Mason Verger's face and Paul Krendler getting his skull opened up.  Anthony Hopkins was his usual top notch self and Julianne Moore did what she could with the part; would have loved Jodi Foster reprising it though.<br />What bothered me most was the ending; it's not at ALL how it ended in the<br />book!  In fact, I would have rather had the book end the way the movie<br />did with Clarice being freed and Lecter fleeing again. Also, because the character Margo wasn't in the movie, we didn't get to see how Mason really got it!<br />It's a decent movie, just not a great one.  Worth watching?  Sure, why not.
1597801585|4.0|This book is full of interesting ideas, creative solutions in a world that is familiar, yet totally different from ours, distinct characters, and smooth prose. I couldn't put it down.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|the videos are extremely informative, very helpful. the only problem i experiece with the app is that there are 3 videos ( prepping an onion, making risoto, and cooking the perfect steak) that cut off every single time i view it after about 70% through the video. i have a samsung epic 4g. ifnot for tha i would have put 5 stars.
0553801473|2.0|from the reviews I saw (after reading the book-I wanted to go in fresh), I could not agree more.  I thought there would be more resolution to story lines.  All we got was approximately 100 pages of history lesssons of Dragons, Septas, Kings, Knights.  I don't understand adding the new points of View from Dorne or other (read the book); Bran (a major character) had very few POVs.  What about Brianne?? we followed her up and down the Kings Road in the last book only to see her pop out of a bush!  I have to say this was the 4th worst book I have read.  We waited patiently for over 4 years for this installment only to see as we read it-The dance goes on and on and on...Please Mr. Martin, do not drift--get back to the story!
B000007UTN|1.0|It seems 5% of people dont get it. Reading the 1 star reviews is quite fun but they dont get it. I think what OK computer did was took a conceptual non popular style to the masses, and people liked it. Good on em    I'm sure it's not as conceptual as some music, and I'm sure that music is far less popular.    Comparisons to floyd? Well i'm sure in the 70's their music was considered conceptual, but I'm also also sure they weren't the most conceptual around. Pink Flyods a great band, so are Radiohead. They both took a conceptual sound and made it pop.
B004R2DS9C|4.0|I recently purchased this item for our son to use for storage for Legos but also to use as a playmat.  He was so excited when it came in the mail and hasn't stop playing with it.  It is very easy to unzipper and use.  He really has liked the images on the playmat; he says he thinks it is like being in the Death Star. There are two things I wish it had - a lid that was a little more secure (has two velcro pieces) and something to secure the zipper parts once they are zipped up and inside. I would still buy it regardless; I think those two things would improve the use of it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Not much to add to the other reviews, it was a great movie.   When you can make grown men shed a tear in the theater, I think they hit a homerun.
B004ZGI1V0|2.0|It was claimed - kicks even more butt in UNKNOWN - but it is an exact opposite, where the hero gets his butt kicked most of the time.<br />Expect thrills, suspense and spy-mystery - NOT action pack.  Although I appreciate the story, the marketing of this movie is misleading and out of scope.<br /><br />Appearance and acting of Bruno Ganz as retired spy-turn-private investigator Ernst Jurgen is absolute joy to watch.<br />The car-chase scenes are all too familiar (especially in Europe locations) and in my opinion, way too long.<br /><br />In summary, do not expect a \\"TAKEN\\" action rush movie and you will enjoy this typical spy-thriller show.
1416550550|3.0|The novel is fine but it took three weeks to get here.  I had ordered it to take on vacation; it arrived after I got back.  Three weeks seems like a bit of a long time.
B0054SDZXC|2.0|The actors played their characters well.  Notable character performance by Ben Chaplin.  Olivia Lovibond was a nice eye-candy at the beginning of the movie.<br />Colin plays the lead character whom struggles to get his life together again after serving prison time.  The movie seemed to emphasize more on the dark-side of human nature and not enough on redemption and change for the better good.<br />On a side note, I did hope for a severe punishment for the duo-gangster-teenagers but was totally dissappointed at the end of the movie.<br />Colin's character (Mitchel) should have continued-on but the creators of this movie are too engross in the era of 'the Departed', 'Gangs of New York'.  The movie would have been better in the hands of Guy Ritchie.
B0000399WI|5.0|I ordered this movie because I never seemed to be able to watch the entire movie when it was on TV.  The transaction was super fast and the DVD was in great condition.  Loved the movie and will definitely watch it again.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|Book four was terrible.  The last book (thank goodness) was worse.  He leaves us with all the heros dead, no conclusions to any issues, Dannery wandering who knows where with her Dragon, the other two dragons gone where? No conclusions on the trials of Cersie, no resolution of the fight with the wights at the wall.  It is as if he just ran out of energy and said \\"lets stop now\\". I will not read him again.
1594744769|5.0|This book is wonderful. Even though it is technically Young Adult fiction, older age groups may enjoy it as well. The photographs help add to the overall haunting feel of the mystery as well as the descriptive narration.
B004Y1USRG|4.0|Just when you thought this band's record making days were over, and they would carry on as a nostalgia act endlessly touring for the diehard fans, we get \\"Fly From Here\\", a modern sounding version of the classic YES sound, which has much in common with past recreations of YES, like the Drama and 9015 albums were at the time.  This album has a fresh, enegetic vibe that also has some of that ol' YES magic.  I had a big grin on my face, and a nostalgia trip back to the 70's when I went to my local independent record store and bought the album on vinyl.  This must be the first YES album Ive bought on vinyl since Tormato in 1978, switching to CD's in the early 80's.  It was such a pleasure to open that beautiful Roger Dean gatefold cover, and read the lyrics and look at the cool photos.  The vinyl itself is a regular weight album but an Italian pressing that is flawless in appearance and sound.  Because of the legnth of Side 1, there is about a minute of inner groove distortion near the end, but otherwise the record sound great!     The music is wonderful, with Howe, Squire and White sounding as inspired as ever, and Geoff Downes contributing his gorgeous layers of keyboards.  \\"Fly From Here\\" as a single should be playing on rock radio.  It has a commercial yet classic YES feel to it that would no doubt garner them legions of new fans.  Trevor Horn's production is exactly what YES needed at this time, crisp, powerful but with enough subtle touches to keep it interesting.  Benoit David's vocals are also exactly what YES needs at this point.  David and Squire's vocals blend beautifully giving this album the classic YES vocal magic that is on every YES album.  Sure, all of us longtime fans miss our beloved Jon Anderson, but YES as a band marches on despite personell.  This is nothing new in YES history.  YES still has something to say in 2011, \\"every day that you waste, is one more that youve' lost\\".  Fly From Here is a great metaphor and message for just taking off from where you are despite setbacks and situations.  YES has always been about a positive message, and Fly From Here is no exception      The side long \\"Fly From Here\\" suite has many thrilling peaks and valleys, and memorable themes, like other great YES epics.  Side 2 has 5 shorter YES songs, no less thrilling, albeit less dramatic, the best of all being \\"Life On A Film Set\\", with it's energetic 'riding the Tiger' bit.  Fly From Here is another generous musical offering from a band who refuses to go quietly.  Thank you, guys for not letting YES become a dinosaur act like so many classic bands from your era.  Your fans are still here and loving it!!

B0000AQS0F|1.0|Now, I have heard norhing but good reviews about this series; however, I have come to a different conclusion.<br />As with the first part of Stargate SG1 and with the first season of Stargate Universe there is a strong line of \\"SEX\\" and both naked men and women throughout Firefly. With a young family I am dissapointed that I can not share this show with them. Another point of discouragement is the line of language in Mandarin Chinese whenever a character is upset.<br /><br />The main spine of this story is the captian with an old war buddy decide to go into business with the purchase of an old spaceship. A \\"professional harlot\\" rents out one of the two empty shuttles to expedite her business to foreign climes. Others whom are aleady on the crew is an egotistical hothead, a female mechanic with other things on her mind, a man of the cloth with a past, and a sister and brother. The brother is a doctor and a genius and the sister is more so, but was freed from the government.<br /><br />The spine of the story is almost non-existent. The captian and his female war-buddy story is given in short. The same is so later on with the different crew members. Otherwise, they are just floating in space as an illegal salvage team. The enemy is the republic which is set up more or less like Scotland Yard. Now, when the writer and director were bored decided to put this graphic sex scene here or there. Or the topic of sex was brought up in the crew's conversation on deck. A nude scene here to perpetuate reality. A nude scene there to express the realism as the writer and director thinks would make the story more real. And then there was the sceme where the harlot has intiment relations with another girl, and the captain upright and completely nude in front of all because in an earlier show a \\"marriage\\" had taken place and the gal was nude.<br /><br />Otherwise, the storyline has no true spine. As with the movie Supernova with Lou Diamond Phillips and with the first season of Stargate Universe with (once again) Lou Damon Phillips and Peter DeLuise released a show not for the public at large but for the adult audiences, and the same holds true with the television show Firefly created by Josh Whedon.<br /><br />In short, such shows could be surmised as a group of fish stuck in a can. Give them plenty of food and water and within five years there will be no water in the tank but plenty of offspring!<br /><br />Sorry, I give Firefly to the burning barrel.again) Lou Damon Phillips and Peter DeLuise released a show not for the public at large but for the adult audiences, and the same holds true with the television show Firefly created by Josh Whedon.

B003Y5H5A6|5.0|The movie starts at its WWII origins. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers a puny 4F man who has lied his way into a military science experiment. Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent Colonel. Meanwhile evil Nazi Hugo Weaving believing he is Darth Maul, has his own plans for world conquest using sharks with frickin' laser beams. (Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from \\"Last Action Hero\\" you can't really jump around car roofs. After Rogers is transformed he becomes Captain America to be used as a recruiting tool, as Tommy Lee still has his doubts about the 90 pound weakling.<br /><br />Of course things change and the rest of the story shouldn't be too hard to figure out, even if you don't read comics. Now the very end utilizes the one-eyed Samuel L. Jackson from Iron Man 2 which hints at an ultimate sequel providing everyone isn't dead by then.<br /><br />The movie combines action, drama, light comedy, and light romance. Good acting, good dialouge, good frickin' laser beams.<br /><br />No swearing, nudity, or sex. Safe to drop off the kids.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Muy útil, flexible y liviano. Ideal para fotografía de exterior en días soleados. Lo adquirí en reemplazo del que venía en el lente Nikon 18-135 f/3.5-5.6 y habiendo utilizado un alternativo, debo decir que si bien no es una gran diferencia, finamente el ajuste es distinto en la rosca.    Recomendable.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles were our best friends and by 1 degree of separation we became each other's.  They united a generation, they defined and  legitimized us.  There has never been and probably never be another group of musicians with as much gravity, talent and generosity  as the Beatles and we are better people for having known them, intimately through their music and the collective story of their individual lives.    This 5 disc set pays homage to their lives and by virtue of our relationship with them, to ours...to our joys and sorrows, our passions and to our humanity.    Enough has been written within Amazon about what was presented within the set yet  I found one part that may have been overlooked on the 5th Disc and that is Ringo, his camera and his final words.  You can see that Ringo was truly a fan of the band and that he had his little throwaway Kodak with him to document the hook-up with his old pals George and Paul...at the very end, he is genuinely moved and expresses how much he enjoyed hanging with his old friends and that was a fitting and lovely way to end the series having spoken for everyone who had the privilege of knowing and growing up with them.    I certainly will never forget the Beatles and as I age I become more  attached to and  an avid fan of their music and my memories  of them and our times together.    All you need is Love,    Warren

I'm happy for him that the author thinks he found his way and lives the life he wants to. But this book is mostly an art of auto-promotion and self-congratulation, for achievements that are not particularly convincing. This books seems mostly a way to make a living and promote the author's web site (after suffering from the void of this book, i'm not sure I will take a glimpse at it). Disapointing. You'll find much greater and truly original insights in many other books (Tim Ferriss, Guy Kawasaki,...)...
0553386794|2.0|This story came very highly recommended to me. I understand that most fantasy buffs adore it, and I honestly expected more from such a well read book. Unlike several negative reviewers out there, I had no problem with the violence or the sex. My main problem with this novel is that it's clumsily written.<br /><br />Unlike many reviewers who rated the novel positively, I found that a few of the characters/narratives lacked depth and purpose. Sansa and Arrya, for instance. It's a tricky business using a child narrative, because the author needs to walk a very fine line between maintaining realism and still creating an engaging point of view for an adult audience. These plotlines are neither engaging nor purposeful. In their single-mindedness, they aren't even realistic. Up until nearly the very conclusion of the novel, they observe and have knowledge of basically the exact same events and surroundings, making an unnecessary, repetitive point of view. They each frequently disrupt the storyline by taking up several pages to say things that could have been summed up by a line or two of observation within a third party's narrative; for example, Ned, or Arya, could easily have observed every now and then that Sansa was batting her eyes at every handsome man in the story, making her entire POV irrelevant. Arya and Sansa's perspectives are too uni-dimensional to make their irrelevance excusable. Arya is a tomboy who wants to learn to fight, and that's great, we get it, but it would be nice if we saw more than just one side of her. She is seven, and her fighting master frequently gives her incredibly difficult and punishing tasks. It would be more rewarding when she finally proves herself in the end if she ever got frustrated by it, or doubted herself, or showed anything other than single-minded determinism. Sansa is the same. We get that she's supposed to be a shallow, empty headed twit. We do. But how does that excuse her taking up a hundred plus pages of her empty fawning over beautiful men? It would have been more interesting if we could see her struggle, between her honor and her ambition, or between a less handsome man who she secretly starts to fall for and therefore scorns and the cruel beautiful boy she chooses, or envy for Arya and her free spirit, or with real lust, ugly and grown up; SOMETHING, anything, to make her interesting and to make her choices mean something, even if they're the wrong choices. Why else give her a narrative? Every now and then these story lines are used to passively impart knowledge to the audience. One of them overhears something they don't understand but the reader does, etc. This is clumsy writing. It's lazy writing. It's practically cheating.<br /><br />But my number one problem with this story, which I absolutely can not forgive, is symbolism overkill. When symbolism is done right, it is subtle and its power is in that subtlety. I hesitate to even call what George Martin does with the wolves in this story symbolism, but I can't think of another word to use for it. The mascot of the Stark family is the direwolf, a supposedly extinct (in the known world, south of the wall) species of giant, completely wild, wolves. So of course they find an orphaned litter of direwolves right by their home, one for each of the Stark children. The mother dies by more symbolism (stag, mascot of another family, etc, totally predicting a death within the Stark family that takes place at the end of the novel). Even tiny three year old Rickon gets a fierce wild wolf to play with (for some reason their fiercely protective mother sees no problem with this). Jon, black sheep shunned bastard of the family gets the albino wolf that has been shunned by its mother and brothers (of course). For the rest of the entire novel, the wolves are mentioned about once every few sentences, but they have no character of their own. They're each wolf forms of their masters. Even Sansa has Lady, the ever polite and dainty DIREWOLF. That is till Sansa basically turns her back on everything that Starks are and therefore Lady gets the ax. The wolves shadow the stark children, feel whatever they feel, learn commands that make the reader want to roll her eyes (when the wolves are helping Sansa and Arya to pack their luggage I really had to double check that I was reading an adult novel), and are weirdly psychic to bad news and the children's thoughts for some reason that is never explained. Do they advance the plot? No. I got so sick and tired of hearing about the wolves, and what they were doing (hint: what is their master doing?), what they were feeling (hint: what is their master feeling?) every sentence until it felt like I was reading everything twice. It would be nice, again, if the wolves showed a little bit of depth themselves relative to their exhaustive role in the storyline, such as a struggle between the draw of the wild and their loyalty to house Stark etc, but we get nothing. Of course, they do cliche things like growl or hop out of bushes to disembowel an enemy at opportune moments (think: deus ex machina), and that's basically it. The whole thing comes out forced, heavy handed, cliched, and clumsy.<br /><br />I could go on about things that fell short in this book for me. The whole big world-changing shocker that is alluded to in the prologue? Even that falls flat in the end, too easily accepted and overshadowed within a book that spends hundreds of pages catering to the musings of shallow, petty children and their pets. But it's not all bad, and I'd give it an extra half a star if I could. A few of the story lines manage to be entertaining and it's a pretty easy read. Fantasy as a genre is littered with cliches and heavy handed tactics, so the story does probably compare favorably to many novels in its own genre. I genuinely enjoyed the last chapter. If the expectation wasn't as high as the hype, I might have been less disappointed. If you love fantasy, perhaps borrow the book from a friend to test the waters before you spend money on the series. The reviews will speak for themselves, but this book isn't for everyone.ally turns her back on everything that Starks are and therefore Lady gets the ax.

1594202842|2.0|The book is more about identity crisis of a woman with Asian heritage rather than parenting. It aims to provoke but main provocation it offers is repeated references on how Chinese are compared to the \\"Westerns\\". These comparisons get more obsessive than observant tone as the text progresses. This is the greatest flaw of the book and is likely to turn many readers away from the topic - which itself could have been an interesting discussion piece. The book leaves reader with confusion: the answers you wish to have after the first half of the book will remain unanswered in the end.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This is an outstanding product. I am very pleased    Pros: Surround sound makes the perfect gamer/movie experience. can use rechargeable batteries.      Cons: When batteries are close to being dead, the headphones make a popping noise once in a while. it will also make this noise if you go to far away from the transmitter box, for example, 25 feet away. It's not completely wireless. If you want to use the mic there is a cable going from the headset to the Xbox controller which is included with the headphone.      I will definitely recommend this product.

0316044695|1.0|I picked this book up on the recommendation of a friend. I enjoy memoirs and have enjoyed some military memoirs.  But Luttrell's book is unpalatable.  From almost page one it's a hearty defense of a foreign policy that is utterly flawed and a jingoistic tirade against \\"the liberal media\\" and \\"liberal America.\\"  One would think a soldier sworn to defend his country would have a bit more respect for the citizens he defends.  I find it hard to take an author seriously when he offers support for the argument that there were or might have been WMD's (supposedly they saw evidence in the desert---really?!) and is such a fan of W. Bush (well, Luttrell is from Texas).  Skip this book and pick up The Unforgiving Minute by Craig Mullaney---similar story, much better writing, tone, substance, everything.  I honor your service and the sacrifice of your compatriots---I'm from a military family and have many friends who serve and have served---but this book is really not worth reading.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I like this book alot!  I first heard about it from a friend back in 2006.  He was raving about how GREAT it was and that it was his favorite book.  After that I knew I wanted to read but never got around to it, until now and I just finished it.  I liked the story, but I like what was \\"under\\" the story even more...the story within the story.  The story not told but felt.  If you didn't connect with it the way I did, then maybe you will not understand and dismiss my review as rambling.  Either way, give the book a try.  It is a good read.  Mr. Card, thank you!
B004TTZHBK|4.0|Sure, there are a lot of cooking apps out there. Recently, I have been using a few other apps for new ideas. However, this app is my new fav.  I particularly like the shopping cart list, the howto videos (I know that those can be googled. I think it&apos;s just a bonus.) and the gourmet recipes. Works well on the Samsung Epic.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wasn't going to read this book...I tend to stay away from books that get alot of hype from critics unless it is recommended to me by a friend.  Well, someone I trust and have similar reading habits with said I should give it a try.  I was surprised.  When I first understood where the story was going I thought about deleting my friend from the \\"trusted recommendation list\\" but I would have been wrong to do so.  After the first chapter, the book was quick paced and kept my interest.  I liked the style of writing and the choice of words made the story easy to understand and imagine.  I stay away from books that cause me to get out a dictionary every other page...That is most of use read, for enjoyment and to relax.  I had enough critical reading in college.      The story is about a young girl who volunteers for almost certain death in order to save her very unlucky younger sister's life...that's the first 50 pages or so.  Once she steps forward, they rest of the book is about saving her own life in the HUNGER GAMES.  The underlying story shows us that people are people no matter what age or race or sex.  We will do what we must to survive.  We may not like who we have become or what becomes of us but our need to survive, our love for life and family/friends will always be strong within us.
B004LWZW42|1.0|I am most definitely not a comic history know-it-all; I admit I am ignorant of most of the back stories and origins[saves a lot of disappointment that seems to plague the people who go in with preconceived notions]   Primarily I attend movies based on casting and genre.  Having said that, I enjoyed all of the X-Men movies prior to this one - based solely on my general movie criteria. But this is just a bad movie - crossing over many genres: this is just a poorly made film.  I didn't give a care about any of the young mutants they recruited; there were so many that each actor got relatively little screen time except for Raven. To sum up, this movie was a waste of my time and I'm glad I used a free gift ticket; if I had paid to see this movie I would have been exceptionally irritated.  Also, to give the cameo appearance actor the obligatory 'F' word was rather jarring [even though it would not be unexpected from the character] - I don't remember any of the other X-Men movies exploiting their need to use their PG-13 quota of profanity.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Where does it say that animation is only for rug rats? I can't believe the negative reviews about their kids not understanding this brilliant and beautifully produced piece of animation. SO WHAT? I LOVED IT! It is hysterical, and yes, in the way that only adults would understand ... the clever, the glib, the... oops, did he really say what I think he said? Gads, leave the Rango critter alone. He was great, everything was great. This is a must have in all animation collections. Are the awards coming up soon?
0451169514|2.0|First of all I have to say that for 1100 pages it's a great book with true and heartbreaking philosophies which you rarely find in other books. The caracters are believable and well described. But I'm not here to write a full-review. I'd seriously give this book 5 stars and it probably could've become one of my favorites if not my top favorite book of all time, only if IT had leaven out one particular scene. It's not that I'm a grumpy person who isn't open but King has definitely crossed the line.   *SPOILERS*  I'm 20, like I said very open to many many things and I really don't mind sexual intercourse in books or movies, how strange or sick they might be. I've been through a lot, and I became insensitive for many things but this really shocked me. The scene between Patrick and Henry is nothing against it! How can one possibly destroy this wonderful book in just 8 pages? I tell you how: You write about a gangbang between 11 year old kids, one girl and six boys. I'm so disappointed I can't express it in words. These wonderful caracters are just misused and it's a disgrace to it in such way. It could have been okay in any other book but not in \\"It\\", you just cant make the 7 protagonists perform such an act even after what they've been through. It's unforgivable.  *End of Spoilers*  I dont have the motivation to write anymore, in fact, my motivation to breathe even fails me. I've treaten this book with love and care for about 1100 pages until I ended up throwing it away. This review should just help people to either be prepared, or to those who've already read it and also are completely utterly destroyed, make them know that they are not alone.

B0002KVUKM|2.0|Take every ridiculous Dracula-vampire-Transylvania stereotype you can find, spice it with some special effects and...voila, out comes \\"Van Helsing\\".<br /><br />I think you need a special kind of humour to really appreciate vampire slayer Van Helsing's hunt for Count Dracula, Mr. Hyde and the odd werewolf. He turns out to be on a first name basis with Frankenstein's monster and a mysterious order of Catholic knights. And yes, \\"Van Helsing\\" suffers from an obvious LOTR-Excalibur complex.<br /><br />I liked the cow, though.<br /><br />Two stars.
B001FB4W0M|5.0|Season four starts out with Dean breaking out of hell and the ramifications of what was caused while he was in.<br /><br />on Brother with demon blood in him the other with angels on his shouler. the fight comes down to not heaven and hell but brother on brother. when the fight comes down to the end of the season, once again, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />the show is GREAT. i am glad i go hooked on it and hope this goes on a lot longer. if you are reading this and haven't seen an episode, you MUST start with season one or none of this make sense.<br /><br />there is pleanty of gore and evil, along with some very dark humor. deffinately a must see

0307279189|5.0|I love reading running books, and this one did not disappoint. It was more than just a story about how a guy puts one foot in front of the other for \\"x\\" amount of miles. It really gets into the history of running, some anthropology, and a way of life for a tribe in Mexico. It was a very enjoyable book to read. It also had a lot of chapters which I personally enjoy so you are not stuck in one of those awkward moments when you have 30 pages to go until you hit a good spot to stop. I would recommend this book for the causal every now and then runner all the way up to a pro runner. It has something to teach anybody who has the time to read it. Great book!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance With Dragons seems like the \\"responsible sibling\\" of the series, having the burden to clean up some of the messes of of the other books while still trying to tell its own story.  It has serve as the finisher of the incomplete A Feast For Crows, which it does fairly well, syncing up with AFFC for the fist half of the story.  Also, it has to somehow gather up all the characters that were blown away to different parts of the world because of the Armageddon-level events from The Storm of Swords.  And finally, it tries to solve the problem that has been there from the beginning and has become worse as the series progresses, which is, how the heck is Dany, wandering around in the east, going to reconnect with the rest of Westeros?<br /><br />And with that, a good portion of the book involves several characters sailing, walking, or riding towards the east to connect with Dany, each for their own personal reasons.  Martin makes the most of these travels, introducing us to the details of the continent of Essos and the seas that surround.  One of the travelers is everybody's favorite dwarf, Tyrion.  In the beginning of the book, he basically serves as a stand-in for the reader to witness certain events, but by the end he is back to his usual scheming self.<br /><br />Since Martin needs Dany to stay in one spot so that those travelers can meet her, he has her stuck ruling the city of Mereen.  This is a new role for her, as opposed to her familiar style of the wandering khaleesi warrior queen.  Similarly, Jon spends the majority of his time as the de facto ruler of the Wall And All Points North.  They both spend a large amount of time hearing petitions, negotiating with other monarchs, issuing orders, etc.  Honestly, I have never really enjoyed the chapters in any of the books that centered on a monarch actually ruling, and Jon and Dany's problems ruling their respective domains is the same.  However, I know that these scenes are a necessary evil, allowing Martin to quickly and efficiently give the reader updates  on dozens of characters without much setup.<br /><br />So, plotwise with the travelers, Jon, and Dany, a good portion of the book is upkeep and cleanup.  They were enjoyable, yes, but not amazing.  The real amazing parts come with the remainder of the characters.  The moments with \\"Reek\\" and the Bolton family were truly terrifying, the result of Cersei's actions in AFFC lead to some satisfying results, and Davos, Arya, and Asha are still enjoyable characters to read about.  For me, the most satisfying was Bran, as he continues his quest that could possibly lead him to be the most powerful character in the whole series.  On the other hand, I was really disappointed by Quentyn Martell, who comes across as a complete loser,<br /><br />Overall, I found ADWD to be very similar to A Clash of Kings in terms of plot.  In both, you have a lot of characters making decrees and rulings, moving armies, and traveling to lands previously unmentioned.  However, it seems to me that Martin's writing style has advanced in this book.  He writes in a more subtle way throughout this book. Instead of saying exactly what happened, he instead drops clues here and there, and nudges the reader into trying to figure out what happened by themselves (and hope you come to the right conclusion!).  I found this style enjoyable as there were several moments when I had an \\"AH-HAAAHHH!\\" moment when I figured out what was going on.  On the other hand, I can see how other readers might not enjoy this.  It requires you to pay attention to the details, through and through.  If you are a person who tends to skim, I would guess you would not enjoy reading this book.<br /><br />I'm going to give the book a five star rating based on the fact that, plotwise, it was on par with A Clash of Kings, which I considered a four star book, with a bonus star to bump it up five based on the amazing writing style of Martin.
B0011ZWF6K|4.0|Devildriver's third studio album The Last Kind Words, released in 2007 to a more receptive audience than their debut enjoyed, saw the band mix in large melodeath influences into their usual groove orientated sound.<br /><br />The album features several of the band's important works such as `Clouds Over California,' `Head On To Heartache (Let Them Rot)' and `Not All Who Wander Are Lost.' Devildriver even mix some cleaner sounds into the album, for example on the close `The Axe Shall Fall,' which foreshadows the direction the band would take with their next album, Pray For Villains.<br /><br />The production was slick and professional, the lyrics were improved and the band were confident; finally gaining respect from everyone who eyed them with suspicion previously. The band's reputation on the live circuit and their continual growth as musicians and songwriters help establish them as reputable and honest metal band. This is the sound of a band earning the public's respect without compromising themselves.<br /><br />If any criticism has to be laid at the album's door, it would most likely be that the songs are a little to samey and repetitive. Devildriver created an excellent formula with this album and wrote a great bunch of songs off the back of it, but a little more variety wouldn't have gone amiss in all fairness.<br /><br />Overall though, The Last Kind Words is a good album of well produced, slick and professional metal that mixes groove, a little melodeath and Dez's distinctive voice to create some interesting and enjoyable material. Devildriver fans should definitely give this album a listen.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Way too much fun. My productivity at work has plummeted. Load times for Samsung Vibrant are slow but worth it.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|I miss Kelly Rowland's music. Unlike her pal Beyonce, I can really say that she has done a great job with this album. \\"I'm dat Chick\\" is definitely a good way to start the album off. When I heard this song I couldn't stop bouncing my head. With her most popular song \\"Motivation\\" I couldn't wait for this album to come out. \\"Work it Man\\", \\"Turn it Up\\", and \\"All of the Night\\" are some of my favorites but I love the whole album. \\"Turn it Up\\" shows how talented she really is close to the end of the song cause the somewhat acappella part sounds so good. I just wish she would've did some more tracks like \\"Commander\\" and \\"Down for Whatever\\" cause her voice sounds so good on Techno music. Overall, the album satisfied my long wait of her return. #Kellyrowlandfanallday
B003NX76BM|1.0|While I used to really enjoy NR, the last couple of her books have been sub par at best. This one was absolutely horrible and I skimmed the last 1/4 of the book although it was pretty obvious from the beginning that she would get lost and her dogs would find her. Absolutely elementary writing. I have some jr high students who would come up with better sentences. \\"clamored up.\\" really? Sorry, Nora, that was my last try.
1400049628|4.0|The Zombie Survival Guide is a companion piece to World War Z (The Zombie Survival Guide was written first), Brooks's satirical faux oral history of the zombie war.  As such, it is a faux survival guide in the same vein, albeit not as heavily satirical as World War Z.  It exists in the same alternate reality, but it was \\"written\\" before the events detailed in World War Z take place.<br /><br />The lighter treatment leads to a book less colored by the author's personal views, but I have to believe that the dismissive view toward pickup trucks in general, contrasted with the sensible view toward SUVs, reflects a combination of the author having a bias against the type of people that drive trucks while not knowing anyone who actually owns one.  It certainly doesn't have any basis in reality.<br /><br />The guide is impressive in its thoroughness, although is not necessarily a good thing.  A survival guide without actual practical use is not by nature an enjoyable read.  Brooks makes it work well enough, however, and imagining how you would fend off zombies yourself has always been one of the joys of the sub-genre.<br /><br />Make sure to not skip the appendix--the chronology of past recorded attacks is a high point (the guide alone would have merited three stars--it was the appendix that pushed it up to four).  The appendix also inspired a graphic novel (which I have not read).
B003VS0CX8|4.0|The movie on the DVD side is good as always, but I sure wish I had the same extras as the Blu-Ray disc...it doesn't seem fair to push people to go to Blu-Ray just to sell machines...give us the same extras and let us make the decisions...
B00003CX95|4.0|A friend of mine at work gave me the VHS version of this movie soon after it first came out--in order to help entertain me while I was convalescing a home after a hospital stay.  It was indeed pretty entertaining with all the battles and so forth.  But the final part, where poor old Wallace is drawn and quartered was really too much for me--especially given the fact that what I had been subjected to in the hospital was major abdominal surgery!  To see all of those crude implements assembled and then applied to Gibson's character made me wince--especially with a few dozen surgical staples still holding my incision closed!  I really doubt that Wallace would have been able to articulate even the word \\"freedom\\" after having his guts mangled in such a way!
0553801473|1.0|There is a reason that 40% of reviews of ADWD are 1 or 2 stars.  As good as A Game of Thrones is wonderful this book is so uninteresting that I couldn't wait to stop reading it: picking it up now and then, like any addict, hoping for a fix that never comes or satisfies.  The trajectory of this series is much like that of free falling object. If the first couple of books hadn't sucked me in I'd have stopped reading this one in the middle, much like I was quick to jettison Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time which at least kept my interest for 5 books. This much I know: If Martin ( who is as far from being an American Tolkien as the nearest blackhole is from earth) doest wrap this abomination up in book six I won't even bother to finish.  I can't imagine that Martin in his heart of hearts truly believes this work comes within light years of approaching A Game of Thrones.  Maybe we are expecting too much and Martin is just another one hit wonder.  You can't help but wonder if he is dragging this out for the money.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|What a great cast and movie.  Tom Cruise as a villain was awesome but Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith were even better.  I have to say that Jada really set the perfect tone for the movie, building an instant rapport with Jamie Foxx's character that created a believable motivation for his actions later in the movie.  Jamie's performance was simply outstanding.  Great music soundtrack, great story, great supporting cast.  As a side note I wish we could see Jada in more action oriented movies.

0300169787|5.0|For the many of us who can't get to NYC for the Alexander McQueen exhibit, this book almost does it all!

B00080Z53O|3.0|I wasn't aware this was a subtitled movie, so right there made this somewhat difficult to watch. It's about a guy who got paralyzed after a diving accident. He wants to have the right to chose to end his life so his spirit can be freed from the jail of his body. It gets a little weird when a woman who has a radio show falls in love with him, and then a married female lawyer who assists him with a court case to press for his right to end of life choices also falls in love with him...and it gets even odder later. But I did like the movie giving us a look at the side of how some people feel about having to live out their entire life limited to being bed-ridden and having to have others bathe you, feed you, move you, etc.
B004VFYPTW|4.0|They were at the top of their game- everything is well-played. I love all the songs, of course, and David sang just fine.  The problem: much of the DVD video. They uses some special effects or something that 80% of the time made a very soft/burred look. Annoying!!  At times the video would be razor sharp, for a few seconds, then for some crazy reason, it's not. It looks like it was done intentionally.  Oh well, the performance was great... but it still leaves me wanting some better DVD of them... guess I must keep looking.

0439023521|2.0|One of my only reviews I've ever put on here, but this book is nothing more than entertaining escape fiction.  Is it dystopian?  Sure.  But comparing this to 1984, Brave New World, or Fahrenheit 451 is an insult.  There is simply no legitimate description of WHY the world in this novel exists outside of a few boilerplate pages.  Not to mention, once the game starts (half way through or so) the author drops any real attempt to parallel the dystopia with current society -- in other words, it's just an action novel.      The characters were flat with the exception of the heroine, and the author's attempt at creating even a faux love for survival were lame.  I would compare this to the first Harry Potter novel, but it at least created an alternative world with consistency and detail.  The Hunger Games is more-or-less 6th grade action fiction with enough violence and innuendo to make it to Hollywood.  Sadly, I expect the movie to be better than the book.
B005ERYEGU|5.0|This is a must-read book for any sales rep, sales executive or CEO who works for a business that sells to other businesses (\\"B2B\\"). Aaron has written a practical, \\"how to\\" manual for B2B sales as well as a powerful management tool that provides useful insights for C-level executives regarding the management of the sales process and creating \\"Predictable Revenue\\" for their business. The title of the book says it all. Anyone who has ever worked in a B2B business knows that predictable revenue is the Holy Grail, and how hard it is to achieve.  Predictable revenue is a prerequisite for creating high value liquidity either via an IPO or sale to a larger company.    Aaron started as a lowly sales rep at Saleforce.com (he \\"checked his ego at the door\\") after the dot com company he founded failed during the bursting of the bubble in 2001.  He ended up creating an \\"entirely new sales process and inside sales team that helped Salesforce.com add $100 million in recurring revenue\\".  His secret sauce was to make high-priced field sales people more efficient.  This book describes his methods and his philosophy.    Fundamental to his success is Cold Calling 2.0.  Aaron defines it as \\"prospecting into cold accounts to generate new business without using and 'cold calls'\\".  His biggest breakthrough (so he says) was how to find the decision maker, and he lays out a methodical process with real world examples about how to do it.    As a high-tech founder / CEO as well as board member, I really related to the section on \\"How Boards and CEOs Exacerbate The Problem\\" (of growing sales).  He talks about how they often arbitrarily pick goals and \\"turn the screw on the VP of Sales\\".  I've seen this happen innumerable times, and CEOs and Boards would do well to read this and heed his advice.    Other areas of the book I found useful included \\"The Top Six Prospecting Mistakes Reps Make\\", \\"My Favorite Sales Call Question Of All Time\\", \\"Seven Fatal Sales Mistakes CEOs and Sales VPs Make\\", and finally \\"Assuming Channels Will Do The Selling For You\\".    The book is a bit repetitious, re-iterating Aaron's Cold Calling 2.0 mantra over and over again, but his technique does serve to reinforce the basic principles he's laid out.    It's unlikely that this book is a Pulitzer Prize candidate, but its practical and detailed methodology combined with high-level observations on management make this a worthwhile read.
B004EPZ084|4.0|This movie could've, would've, and should've been just as good as \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" but the writing and directing fell just short of bringing this in on that level. The overall problem is that Jason Bateman's character was too flat and unemotive throughout the whole movie. The other actors and actresses brought home performances that I could buy into, but Bateman seemed to be reprising his 'Arrested Development' schtick here, but he needed to be more out there for this movie to work.<br /><br />Aniston and Spacey are terrific, and there are moments of high hilarity to be found. It was a fun movie, but it could've been an all-time great.
0439023491|5.0|This is the second book of an absolutely astounding trilogy.  I ran across the first book of the series on my Kindle, and have been buying the hard copies so I can loan them out after I'm done reading them--they are too good to keep to myself.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|If you are a Scorsese fan, this is gold, the period sets and detail, the great dialogue and character development, it's a wonderful playground for Scorsese's mind, and he is able to develop the period history of Atlantic City's prohibitionist era in a way no other \\"Executive Producer\\" today could.    It's an intelligent show that really starts to pay-off around episode 5-6, where character motives and backgrounds are patiently revealed, and the drama of the period's draw of materialism and greed amongst the priveleged makes for great film art and story telling.     The dichotomy of humanity's need to do the right thing or to simply be a good person in their own mind is constantly tempted with the need to do \\"whatever is necessary\\" to survive in a hostile, competitive, unforgiving and political world where the strong and privileged either succeed or die.    Every character is flawed, realistically and appropriately, they are torn between religion, bounded by past experiences, be it war or childhood trauma, that influences everything they do no matter how old they grow to be.     Buschemi is wonderfully cast as a charming boss who keeps his hands clean even in the ugliest of situations, with deep, complex law enforcement and political connections, that are constantly challenged by those looking to get rich on the black market, in particular the Italians who want a piece and are just as deadly and dastardly in their willingness to set-up shop in the eastern seaboard's most lucrative port for importing illegal liquor.    A young Al Capone makes his appearance in Chicago, also appropriately cast, and mentions of the Cleveland Syndicate and Ohio connections, and all of the various historical notoriety of eastern and midwest mobster families and corrupt boss politicians are appropriately depicted here.     The excellent cinematography, direction and aesthetics make it really shine, and a heavy nod has to go to Mark Wahlberg for his surprising direction as well.     The 1stseason should be out on DVD and on streaming services in the near future, when it likely should pick-up in popularity and acclaim hopefully, it is so much better than \\"The Sopranos\\" and puts it to shame if you really appreciate film art and \\"real\\" American history, which of course is quite ugly.      A must watch, can't wait for the 2nd season, almost worth getting HBO for.

0894803123|5.0|Thanks to recipes on the Internet I've given away dozens of cook books collected over my 56 years of married life.  This book, however, is a keeper.  We've tried out 3 different recipes so far and they turn out as good as they sound.  The White Mountain ice cream maker and this book are a perfect pair.  Yummy is the favorite comment of my guests.  (mine too)  It's difficult to decide which flavor is next.  The ingredient list is quite rich with cream, etc. but I say if you're going to eat ice cream it should be the best and these recipes truly are.
0553801473|4.0|Many people have written reviews for this book in which comparisons to AFFC are made. Let me start by saying that there is little comparison to be found there.  AFFC seems to be an exploration of new characters And plot lines, which sometimes result in the reader feeling left out; in reality, Martin was trying to do the opposite, peppering his epic series with even more detail and points of view to deepen the reader experience even more.<br /> DWD picks up old character stories, intertwining many with those  newly  introduced in AFFC.<br />Many other reviews claim the book is like a sitting duck, with no progress of story. Here, again I feel the opposite. Tryion mayhaps can fall under that category, forever journying around with no gauranteed destinatiation, but most other character storylines help develop the main plot.<br />I gave the book 4 stars not 5 because every now and then there seems to be an element of the story that perhaps does not fit as well as intended. A small example of this is The Bastard of Bolton's extreme cruelty, which seems to me to sometimes be taken too far.<br />I gave it 4 starts and not 3 because DWD utilizes the same beloved writing style seen in all of The series installments, and because it brings together the classic feel of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\"felt in the first three with the new characters and locales introduced in FFC.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I am overall pleased with this purchase. Although I have not yet viewed all the dvd's a few episodes freeze or skip (nothing that a disc doctor wouldn't fix).

B002CLBJUU|5.0|*** updated 2/7/15: now out on blurary, the transfer is great and worth buying even if you already own the DVD.  Still, no bonus features of any kind to speak of ***<br /><br />Original review: GREAT movie badly needing a HD upgrade considering how poor the standard DVD looks on big TVs.<br /><br />A black comedy about an ex-CIA, now hitman for hire is a perfect vehicle to showcase Cusack's talents. The world is changing, and as Martin Blank will tell you, countries no longer matter and people are just as likely to be killed over soda pop formulas than political ideology.  Martin tries to rationalize the \\"moral flexibility\\" that he sees going on in the world, where market-driven globalization means more than patriotism to one's own country, by saying he at least has SOME scruples (for example, he won't take out a hit on a Greenpeace activist).<br /><br />But only 10 year removed from high school, he's not entirely OK with his new profession.  Some of the funnier side stories involve trips to his psychiatrist (Alan Arkin), who wants to drop him for a client. Blank won't let him, and dryly points out some logical reasons he should be treated, but then also casually states \\"and of course, I know where you live\\".<br /><br />When Martin goes back home to Michigan for his 10 year High School reunion he has to face several people who have no idea what he does for a living, including old parents, old teachers, old friends, and old flames. Even when he tells the truth no one takes him seriously, including his buddy played by Jeremy Piven, in what many consider to be his break out role. Minnie Driver does an adequate job as the girl he jilted on prom-night to join the army, but there are a couple of forced scenes added to the movie for \\"date night\\" appeal where she is made to look fawningly at Martin that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Overall though, this is really a great supporting cast, with Hank Azaria and even Cusack's own sister as his deranged secretary who has a great scene arguing over a misplaced bullet order.<br /><br />Much of the dialogue comes forth in a fast, rapid style that seems like he's exchanging gunfire in a high stakes shootout rather than talking.  This is especially true when he deals with Dan Akroyd's character, who plays a rival hitman bent on trying to unionize all assassins. \\"Workers of the world unite!\\"  \\"Will there be meetings?\\", Martin asks. \\"Of course!\\" Akroyd exclaims as the two continue to circle each other and mentally measure for body bags. Akroyd talks even faster than Cusack, and when the two of them get going the one liners come faster than you can process them. At one point he tells Blank to \\"Cut the string Chatty Cathy\\". When overdone it can get annoying, but for the most part is balances right.<br /><br />Michiganders will especially like the movie, stocked with Detroit landmarks and Red Wings jerseys even though most of it was shot in Chicago and not Grosse Pointe. When he goes to visit his old childhood home and discovers it had been turned into a Ultie-Mart, local brands of Stroh's beer and Faygo pop are quickly shot up. Not sure if these were just product placements, a serious attempt to sell the geography, or a clever way to again showcase Martin's notion that the \\"McDonaldization\\" of the world is destroying a sense of place. They say you can't go back home, but you can make a fresh start in life and make a very funny and entertaining movie along the way.  And afterall, who doesn't want to kill a bad ass Czech assassin in front of your old highschool locker with the help of a yearbook signing pen?ing over a misplaced bullet order.

B000MRAAJM|3.0|I just got word that there will be a Special Edition Blu-ray of \\"Planet Earth\\" slated for release in early October 2011. Based on what I've read, this looks to be the definitive version of this incredible documentary.    The Special Edition will be 6 discs, and will include everything the 2007 Blu-ray release was missing, and then some. There will be the video diaries, \\"The Future\\" three-part series, as well as additional bonus episodes including \\"Snow Leopard,\\" \\"Maya Underworld,\\" and \\"Elephant Nomads.\\" Plus some other stuff. And of course it will have the Attenborough narration. You can read all about it on the BBC America Shop site. I'm sure it will pop up on Amazon soon enough.    I agree with many others that the original Blu-rays should have had at least some of these extras, but better late than never I suppose.    EDIT on 8/10/11: and there it is. Just noticed the SE available for pre-order on Amazon  [[ASIN:B005C9YZIW Planet Earth: Special Edition [Blu-ray]]]
B004EPZ084|5.0|In 2011 Hangover 2 was on track to be the most talked about R Rated Comedy.  That held true until the release of, \\"Horrible Bosses\\".  As a life long fan of Jennifer Aniston, I already knew I was in for a treat. The fine acting of Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as well as the smart writing left me entertained and satisfied.  All of the work that went into the production of this film is top notch.  It is hard to say too much about this movie without giving anything away.  I will say, be prepared for one of the funniest films you will see.  It is too bad that the Academy of Motion Pictures does not have a category for Best Film in a Comedy because this little gem would definitely be the one to beat.
B004XJHBCE|1.0|I got this app when it was the Amazon free app of the day and didn&apos;t use it too much but it managed to ruin the file structure of the phone in such a way that even a factory reset didn&apos;t fix it.Verizon had to send me a new one. Do not download this app.
0385528752|5.0|One of the best books I've read on change. They focus not just on personal change, but societal change and organizational change too. Sometimes books like this just seem to be a random collection of alot of topics just thrown together. This one has a consistent focus in their idea of the rider the elephant and the path and he maintains that throughout the book.
0375812024|5.0|I was disappointed at first when I saw the size, but when you look inside the content is amazing for a kid.
0747599874|5.0|First of all, this book is meant for children; I hope people realize that. Secondly, it is written for Witches and Wizards.<br /><br />If one understands the above two points, and has their mindset in that particular demographic, they will appreciate this book immensely. Adults will enjoy it as well!<br /><br />This is a collection of five stories, one could say fairy tales, the equivalent to our tales of 'Cinderella', 'Little Red Riding Hood', etc. Each read is snappy and ends with a moral to the story. The imagination of J.K. Rowling cannot be denied; she certainly knows how to tell unique and magical stories. The illustrations (hand-drawn by Ms. Rowling) make this book that much more beautiful.<br /><br />It is a quick read at 105 pages, and at the end, I craved more, and so will you. Hopefully, J.K. will expand on this in the future in some thicker volume.<br /><br />I bought the British blue/gray hardcover version used [see photos], which is arguably the best version to own. The graphics of the front/back, along with the used quality made it seem like this book has been with me my entire life; it adds more character and charm to an already enchanting collection of stories. I hope to pass this to my (future) kids one day.<br /><br />Also, a portion of the sales of this book will go to a wonderful charity. Recommended.
B0046ZG2VG|5.0|A good choice for beginners and novices alike. Cool lookin' old timey feel. Every picture develops a little differently, making each shot unique and exciting. You have to pay close attention not to let the light get it while it's developing or that's money wasted and a shot lost, but that comes with the territory. Great film, over all.

0670022411|2.0|The best thing I can say about[i] A Discovery of Witches[/i] is that it's not [i]Twilight[/i].     Nobody sparkles.     Dialog is occasionally strained, but does sound relatively natural.     Otherworldly creatures are surprisingly normal and run of the mill.     The book I started reading, and the book it ended up being are two very, very different things.     It started out making sense within it's defined context, and then, all of a sudden ... Chapter 29 happened.     While there's a lot of action occuring, there isn't a lot of forward movement. I also realized that I was running out of pages and still had a lot of story left to go.     I feel cheated.     And I am not looking forward to another 579 page monster. Or, as such books are wont to grow, I'm fearful that it will be two or three 650+ page monsters. It says \\"a novel\\" right there on the cover. \\"A,\\" implies a single book. How silly I was to make such an assumption.

B0000793Z9|4.0|It's funny that I'm taking the time to pontificate on this album, because, as a middle-aged (43) man, my taste generally runs toward the postpunk era (think Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, Pavement). However, I will always maintain a soft spot in my heart for the \\"new wave\\" bands who basically got the whole \\"alternative\\" thing started. Honestly, I played New Gold Dream non-stop for about 3 years straight (and still do). Simple Minds kinda went downhill after this (although Sparkle in the Rain had some definite highlights- Waterfront, Up on the Catwalk, etc.), but, wow, what a beautiful, atmospheric, piece of work this is!

B004EPYZSK|2.0|I have to say that when I first heard about the concept of Cowboys and Aliens I laughed out loud.  It sounded like fun - like Blazing Saddles meets Space Balls - and I'd have loved to see a serious satire about aliens invading the old West.  Then I read they meant to keep it serious, like maybe True Grit meets Predator.  That sounded good, too.  After all, if there really were aliens  who had the capacity to come to Earth it makes sense that they wouldn't just visit L.A. in the present.  Why wouldn't they show up in medieval Europe, or even the wild West?  I'd love to see what the man with no name does with a xenomorph.  I really liked what Favreau did with Iron Man, and liked the Star Trek reboot by the writers of this show, so I ended up deciding to check this out when it played in our local theater.<br /><br />It turns out, though, the film didn't live up either to its initial hilarity or the subsequent promise of a serious Western in which the townsfolk are abducted by aliens.  They should have gone for funny, because my wife and I laughed out loud as the film hit clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.  I believe it's supposed to be loosely adapted from a graphic novel, but it felt like the writers decided to watch a bunch of Westerns and sci-fi flicks and then tried to come up with a plot that would give them a chance to hit them all.  The nameless drifter with a criminal past, the apparent prostitute with a heart of gold, the manipulative cattle boss and his psychopathic son, the native Americans with their wisdom rituals, the toothless bandits, the familial reconciliation, the ride off into the sunset...and then why is it that after Alien every sentient being from outer space has an outer shell that opens up to reveal internal mouths and other body parts?<br /><br />They hired decent actors and then gave them lines that were laughable.  They tried to sell Harrison Ford as a greedy and vicious man, who had the whole town under his thumb - in a role reversal of the type that worked brilliantly when Sergio Leone cast Henry Ford as the cruel force of evil in Once Upon a Time in the West.  It didn't work here - both because I didn't find Ford convincing as a bad guy and because the writers chickened out and let him turn out to have a soft side.  They ended up explaining why Olivia Wilde seemed so implausibly awestruck by the sight of Daniel Craig - but even when it was clear who she was her story didn't make sense.  Without revealing anything specific I'll just say it's utterly implausible that, being who she said she was, she'd be there just waiting for the coincidence that Daniel Craig's character happened to have the knowledge and the power that she'd travelled so far to find.  That's just one among many loose ends in the story.  I have a lot of patience, but I found the first half of the film to be overly boring and long.  Eventually it had a few thrilling moments - they didn't entirely waste their special effects budget - and that's why I'm giving it two stars, since if you were distracted and bored at home there might be worse things to do than waste time watching this one.orked brilliantly when Sergio Leone cast Henry Ford as the cruel force of evil in Once Upon a Time in the West.

B001S33D1G|5.0|Coraline is a very thrilling and entertaining read. While it's a perfect book for tweens, it is just as enjoyable for adults. The story creates a sort of tense suspense and horror in a vein very familiar to Edgar Allan Poe, but if he had been writing a novel for children. It is hard to recommend this book highly enough. My own 12-year old daughter was inspired enough to make her own 'Other Coraline' doll.

B005529BDK|3.0|180 Ultra is a fairly entertaining game, at least for a short while. It has several different modes of play, however they all amount to a race against the clock to score as many points as possible in the time allotted. This makes each mode basically the same. Since there are no \\"levels\\" to speak of, there is no feeling of progression which hurts the long time replay value of this game. The OpenFeint achievements help with this a little bit, but they are uninspired (for example, play 180 Ultra for three hours straight). If you are looking for a game to kill a few minutes while on the bus, this is a good candidate for you. If you are looking for a game you'll come back to over and over again, you may want to look elsewhere.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I discovered this game through the publisher's other product: Fruit Ninja. While I enjoyed Fruit Ninja, there wasn't a whole lot of substance to it. Age of Zombies, however, has an entertaining story line as the hero jumps through time killing zombies. Humorous one-liners are interspersed between long bouts of zombie carnage. This is an excellent game when you want to sit down and veg out for an hour, or just kill a few minutes on the bus. I recommend it.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|It may not be the music for me, even after seeing her on the season closing episode of SNL, but my wife loves it.
B003L20ICE|4.0|I was excited to see this movie opening week for two reasons: I thought director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko's [[ASIN:B00009MEKN Laurel Canyon]] was one of the most underrated films of the last 10 years, so I'll sign up for anything she does; and - like other fans of [[ASIN:B0013FSL0C In Treatment: Season One]] - I felt privy to one of Hollywood's great secrets (you know, the awesomeness that is Mia Wasikowska).  That, plus there's the good-in-everything-he-does Mark Ruffalo, Annette Bening and Julianne Moore.  What's not to love?<br /><br />Over all, it's a good film, well told. The story by Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg shows a close family unit dealing with the same issues, pressures and transitions that all families must deal with...and I think that's the writers' main point: that despite the quote-unquote non-traditional aspects of this family, they're no different than any other. Ms. Wasikowska is, as expected, excellent (watch the way she trembles at the end as her parents drive away).  Annette Bening is superb, especially in the scene in which she dives into Joni Mitchell's \\"All I Want\\" a cappella in a dinner duet with Ruffalo's Paul (you slowly realize - as does Paul - that there's something deeper than a sing-along going on here).  [Despite getting an Academy Award nomination for this performance, I thought Bening was even better in last year's [[ASIN:B003EYVXQO Mother and Child]].]<br /><br />The one issue I have with the film is one expressed many times on these pages in loud, objectionable terms: that Moore's character - in a long, committed relationship with Bening's character -would flip (literally) so suddenly for Ruffalo.  That twist outraged many. Even though I don't have the emotional investment that many have in what that sequence represents, making that the story seems at best a questionable choice.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|I really enjoyed this. If you don't want to purchase this, I suggest renting on Netflix because there are some interesting deleted scenes, a few my friend and I agreed should have been left in. SPOILERS: There is a good scene with her two girlfriends in a diner after lies are uncovered, and another extended scene with Jenny in front of David's house. Perhaps these scenes were extraneous, but we liked them.  Jenny pulled herself together in the end - although she asked to repeat her last year of school, she was not allowed to return,  what did she have to accomplish since she dropped out? Although you see her studying  in her room again, we felt that was handled a bit too neatly and quickly.  Her ex-teacher obviously helped her, but how? Perhaps that didn't need elaboration but it seemed too simple, especially with how devastated she was.  And, David just walks (drives) away in the end and he's never seen again. Perhaps too, this is an appropriate end for a creepy role.  We were also disturbed at how easily her parents allowed her to be whisked away by an older man who was blatantly lying to everyone. Watch Danny's face (David's partner in crime) in many of the scenes - very subtle and well-done. His girlfriend (who was so beautiful in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\") was also very good (and dim). We loved the music and costumes also.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|I'm an unabashed fan of the work of the filmmaking duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden.  [[ASIN:B000KX0IOK Half Nelson]] was a small masterpiece.  The under-appreciated [[ASIN:B002E01LOI Sugar]] was also superb.  And, I really liked Fleck's work in [[ASIN:B001H9MYPW In Treatment: Season Two]].  He helmed most the 'Oliver' arc - the standout story of that dark season.<br /><br />This film makes it three in a row, though frankly it doesn't measure up to the brilliance of the previous two outings.  You can tell Fleck and Boden have a growing reputation though: there's a quite a list of performers...Viola Davis, Emma Roberts, Zach Galifianakis, Lauren Graham, Jim Gaffigan.  But, ultimately, whether you cotton to this film or not falls squarely on the head of then-17-year-old Keir Gilchrist.  He does a superb job carrying the film: he's likable and believable as someone carrying just a little bit too much weight on his shoulders and lacking the perspective to shrug it off.<br /><br />The little Easter Egg inside the film is a brilliant, all-in-the-head, fully costumed sing-along of the Queen/Bowie smash 'Under Pressure' featuring Gilchrist's Craig in full-out Freddie Mercury mode.  It reminded me (more than just a little bit) of Marc Lawrence's sneakily good [[ASIN:B00005JPE3 Music and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition)]], the highlight of which is a blow-it-out, late-80s-style video featuring Hugh Grant and an underused Scott Porter as a Wham!-like duo doing their [fully fictional] smash \\"Pop Goes My Heart.\\"  It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|For a film about death, it sure feels alive.      What would you do after being trapped in a hotel room for 15 years?  If your answer is \\"bloody revenge,\\" then you pretty much know what Odlboy is about.  Or do you?    This is a revenge flick, make no mistake.  All the genre hallmarks are in place, but this is much more than Kill Bill Korea or a Seoul version of a Charles Bronson blast fest, believe it or not, there's some real heart at work here.  Director Park Chan-wook takes obvious western influences and crafts a completely unique odyssey of death and even redemption.  Choi Min-sik is a miracle worker in his portrayal of the avenging angel Oh Dae-su.  His performance is probably one of the best to come out of any film in the last 20 or 30 years.      The serpentine manga story of Oldboy is judiciously revealing and though oweing nods to Tarantino, de Palma and even Robert Towne, as I said before, it feels original at every turn.  The action is similar. The hallway hammer fight is a brilliant example of where western action seems to always get it wrong.  Clearly Asian in style, Park's uncutting wide angle camera gives us everything without bumpy cameras and non-stop edits to break the dance of carnage or the tension.  There are no cheats here, we get it all in mass quantity.  And that goes for everything else in the film, like it or not.  Oldboy is a poster child for the eruption of excellent South Korean films in the last ten years and the pinnacle of the masochistic gangster genre that has become so popular on the south end of the peninsula.  Oldboy is an incredibly violent film.  It's not really Goodfellas violent, it's more Peckinpah or Marathon Man to me.  Yet for all the torture and brutality, Park Chan-wook  has a made a film that feels as violent as it needs to be to tell its story.  This one is not for the kids and also not very everybody.  It is a genuinely adult odyssey, and even then perhaps only for a few.    I feel there is a real kinship between Oldboy and Beat Takeshi's Violent Cop. But this one has real depth of story and character where Violent Cop was exercise.  The journey we go on is a long one and though the ending is needlessly \\"artsy\\" it is a satisfying trip and easily the finest, deepest and most polished of Park's vengeance trilogy.  I'm sure some greedy American producers are working on a remake but let's hope it never sees the light of day.  Even in South Korea many psuedo clones and even competent riffs like The Man from Nowhere miss the point.  Sight unseen, if a true remake ever comes, I'll skip the new one and take the old boy every time.
B003UYUP6M|4.0|The history of the company was great, and I was glad to see that coverage of its more recent woes re. privacy and social aren't just whitewashed. I almost wish the book had been held a year+ (ha) to include coverage of Google+, but I suppose that missing piece is fodder for good book club conversation. Anyhow, I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in tech/university culture, or to anyone who often works/lives in the Google ecosphere.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|It states only 1 disc and only 42 minutes long for CM season 6. It has to be typos. Love the show.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I began reading A Game of Thrones about halfway through Season 1 of the HBO Series of the same name. I loved that the Series was so faithful to the books. I also loved that almost without fail (except for with Daenerys) that ever 80 or so pages was equal to about one episode of the show. Being able to have that deeper view of the character thoughts and motivations and then rewatching the episodes provided such incredible depth and that rare equally enjoyable experience across media.<br /><br />The book provides a much more interesting view of Catelyn than the series. It does so as well for The Night's Watch and the time on The Wall. The show gives a much more interesting view of Daenerys and the Dothraki. Together, they provided a wonderful full view of Westeros and all it's interesting complex characters.<br /><br />The idea that moral men have no place in war and politics is a compelling. The added idea that moral men often aren't as moral as they fancy themselves is an even more intriguing thought.<br /><br />That, in the end, it is the women who pull the strings and, often, carry the burden. Well, that's powerful storytelling right there.

I find it hard to believe that this album has been around as long as it has without the recognition it deserves.

B004U8VWLE|3.0|This film has many elements I like.  It has good acting, dance, music, weirdness, memorable scenes, and, of course, Natalie Portman.  What it lacks, though, is a believable story.  It's too contrived.  I wanted to enjoy it, I really did, especially after the hoopla at the Oscars, but it left me cold.      Natalie Portman's character, Nina, is a ballerina with great technical ability, a perfectionist.  But she is obviously insecure, uptight and all-too-fragile.  She always seems to have a pained expression on her face and is not the vision of a prima ballerina.  I simply could not accept that Nina would ever be a serious contender for the challenging role as the Swan Queen.  Even the director of the ballet questions her ability to transform into the fiery and aggressive Black Swan.     Yet Nina is chosen for the role.  If she were not, of course, there would be no story.  Honestly, that seems the only reason why she was picked.  Her meek, fragile character provided a convenient baseline for the horrific transformation to follow.  Once chosen, Nina's decline is disturbing and often difficult to watch.  She eventually reaches a place where she is unable to separate fantasy from reality.  Her transformation into the Black Swan is complete and the tragic ending predictable.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|This application is just like the default one that comes with your phone, but taken to a whole new (better) level. The shake-to-snooze and solve math problems-to-snooze features are awesome. Pretty unique too, if I may say so myself.
B00000JLWW|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies and the movie itself gets 5 stars, but this dvd version doesn't.  I took away 2 stars because its not 6:9 widescreen.  I dont know what to actually call it, its widescreen, but when played on a 6:9 tv it doesnt fill the full screen.  it leaves about 1/4 of the screen, to the right and to the left of picture black along with above and below.  Im guessing it was designed before widescreen tv's. Still a great movie.
0743290933|5.0|I'm glad I read this book. While most of the mistakes the author explores didn't apply to my writing (the proper way came naturally to me), the information about how publishing houses cull the manuscripts they receive was worth the cost of the book alone. In fact, the book painted such a bleak picture of it, I'll probably self-publish. LOL Basically, the overworked editor, who is sitting amongst a pile of submissions and cross-eyed from reading for hours, is looking for a reason to reject your manuscript. You must make sure to give him/her none.     This book starts out with glaringly (to me anyway) obvious mistakes, utilizing examples, then moves to the more subtle. It is organized by which things are most likely to get your manuscript chucked--things that will cause them to toss it before it even gets read, then continues through the various levels of editor discrimination that follow.     It is not the only book you'll need to polish your manuscript, but it is a good place to start--both to understand what you're up against and to identify your individual problem areas. I highly recommend this to beginning writers who are serious about getting published.
0670022411|2.0|A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness starts with witches.  Then there are vampires.  And finally there are daemons.  And they aren't supposed to mix, but they do even though they don't get along.  A witch and a vampire should never mate, or have a relationship other than one of hatred.  So, of course, a witch and a vampire have a relationship.  Perhaps the discovery of the book is that witches and vampires and daemons are not so very different despite their differing opinions and talents.<br /><br />Somewhere amidst the romantical story is a plot, though a very thin one so far.  The witch in question is Diana who is bound to be very much like her mythological namesake eventually if not fully yet.  The vampire is Matthew and he's ridiculously old, like Biblically old.  Diana gets her hands on an ancient manuscript and does not realize the significance of it.  Matthew is drawn to her because of the manuscript at first, but then realizes there's more to his attraction than that.  And there's a covenant consisting of three witches, three vamps, and three daemons that feel said manuscript, which is now inaccessible unless Diana figures out how to call it, threatens all the magical creatures.  Basically, the Covenant wants to kill Diana for the manuscript and because she and Matthew are oh so in love and threaten the whole `magic can't mix' ideal.<br /><br />Some other stuff happens in the middle and toward the end as well, but basically it's all set pieces and window dressing for the romantic story of a vampire and a witch, as well as a lead in to book number two of the trilogy.  Basically, it's all very Twilight for Grownups or some such.<br /><br />The problem with the book really is that the lack of plot does not balance with the depth of backstory.  There is so much about the main characters' pasts and how magical creatures supposedly came about that the main story gets lost in the mix.  While this is all well and good, the author, a historian herself, gets so caught up in telling all the fun facts about history and genetic research and wine, that there's very little room for developing plot.  For a book that comes in just short of 600 pages, that's a lot of nothing really going on.<br /><br />Admittedly, my reading bias toward the young adult genre means I'm used to books that are as much plot based as character based and let's just get on with the story.  But this was just ridiculous even for adult fiction.  I felt like I might as well have just as read Moby Dick again.  Some of the information in the back story is useful and probably necessary for the two future books, but I felt like the whole front half of the book was about Diana and Matthew plodding along in a relationship with a few references back to the main story every now and then to be sure the reader remembered what was supposed to be going on.  Not to mention that Diana (along with Matthew's wine habit) seems very much like she might be a not so veiled version of the author at times<br /><br />While I can see why Deborah Harkness's A Discovery of Witches has become such a big deal in books this year (similar to The Historian or Angelology, perhaps due to its depth of study), I can't recommend this book.the fun facts about history and genetic research and wine, that there's very little room for developing plot.

0439023513|3.0|The author's point is well made...war is pointless. I agree with others that this point could have been made without weakening her once powerful and proud heroin. The Final 3 chapters almost become a quick afterthought.  Having said that, this was a wonderful trilogy and well worth the reading.
B004XQO90O|5.0|The movie starts with the main character waking up startled in a train across a beautiful girl.  Not long after that, an big explosion kills everyone on the train.<br /><br />You would think that going back to the same scene over and over would make this movie boring, but the strange thing is that this movie is not boring.  Each time around we find out a little more about what is happening.<br /><br />Towards the end it got a little confusing, but if anybody says that s/he understands quantum mechanics means that that person really does not quite understand it.<br /><br />The movie is a combination of sci-fi, love story, action, and mystery all at once.  Top rate acting, casting, script, an interesting story line, and very good special effects.<br /><br />I hardly give 5 stars to a movie, but I think this one deserved it.

0307946711|5.0|a story of two ordinary people going through critical formative stages of life and how they are influenced by that one important \\"soulmate\\", friends, family and just life around them. It's a story of self discovery told extremely candidly from the perspectives of the two characters that you feel what they feel, see what they see.  Incredibly realistic, insightful and beautifully written.  I have never felt so as one with the characters - it struck chords with me the whole way through and reminded me of life experiences and emotions that we all have.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I always think that the music definitely makes a movie if the movie can't make itself. While Peter Jackson's LOTR movies don't need the music to be great, Howard Shore's contribution is still extremely important in the composition of all the music throughout the series. The Return of the King soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. Need I say more?
B00261OXUY|5.0|I have seen all the series and none of Henrys Queens can rival his Queen Anne!  She is not ever boring. Some see her as very bad and her choices as bad. But I see her as   the victim of her own fathers unfailing demands on her. I could never dislike her for all she does. I felt she was the most powerful Queen he had. I felt  her ruin was only b/c her fathers demands of her in his lust for power had no limits. It bothered me that the King did not kill him. When her power over Henry was at it's  strongest it would have been a great time to bring down her awful father. She may have lasted longer. Wish she had. I found it really hard not to like her even from the start. But impossible not to like her when it was clear she really loved him. The cast was great in the time of her romance and reign as Queen. She was the only Queen who  had that much power with Henry. She was the only one he listened too. And she did help change Henry's mind on many important matters. I could never really understand   his best friends hatred toward her. Since many of the changes that occurred were in his favor too. I only felt if she had not become so frightened she may have been able to keep Henry much longer. Her brother was right when he tells her to be more like his first Queen. She should of overcome her fears and opposed her fathers demands   and used her wits to bring him down as he was her worse enemy and his decisions forced upon her led to her demise. The erotic passion between them was most awesomely unrivaled. I also could not believe as faithful as Cromwell was to the King and his friendship and similar beliefs with Anne and her family who had helped him rise could betray her so exquisitely  in the end. They were so like minded in their religious goals To free England from the horrid acts prior by the catholics cruelty and   lack of value for life and forgiveness.  It was always entertaining and sexy when she and Henry were together. None of his Queens after her had any power atall. And since Henry seemed to bore easily with his consorts she kept his interest much longer and stronger than those to come. I never liked the Queens after her b/c they either were too  frightened to ever oppose him or in the child bride case too stupid to fear him. Maybe she did not accomplish her goals in life for all her enemies and ones that were just jealous of her. She could be called the Queen of Reformation as that was her most important achievement and influence on the King.   She did give Henry what he wanted most and that was Elizabeth. I felt she was vindicated and not surprised As I felt she was his only Queen capable of giving such a strong willed child who would become one of the most powerful and just Queens to rule England. I also found the King of France as good and much more kind than Henry.  And their fight was hilarious by his sure larger size made that scene laughable. I do not know the history of their relationship but I think they were cousins. He also secretly seemed to believe in the reformation that again was encouraged by Anne. He also seemed to have respect for women. But all the hot sexy intense love affairs were gone along with the best cast heads lost by the time Henry killed Anne. The only one who ever came close to his equal. They all became boring and the young one was so stupid I could barely watch her  time as Queen. And his best friend was gorgeous but not without deceit against his King and so called best friend. I also never could figure out what he saw in Jane when they changed actresses on us it was as if the new one more regal but not as much his type as the one he saw that was replaced with the other and seemed less his type. She was good   but it went down hill from the heat that was so intense between him and Anne. His fool was also a laughable eccentric element but I missed the constant excitement that only Queen Anne kept alive. It really went down hill as far as any of the Queens after Anne. None of them came close to being his equal as she did. This is just one opinion. Hard to not say Jonathan R. Myers was less impressive he was continuously great and a Hottie through them all. I would watch him in any movie and have!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I had never watched Chuck before this summer, my two college age kids had both mentioned it but I didn't know what a 'Chuck' was.  When my husband complained that there was nothing to watch I thought 'Oh what the heck' and picked up season one.  We've absolutely devoured the series, I think it's my favorite series of all time.  It's just completely adorable... just when I think 'what the heck are they going to do to carry on the series' they throw in another cute twist.  This may sound odd, but one of the things I love about the series is the way they give you everything you want... and I can often guess what's going to happen... but it's never boring, they give it to you in such a cute way that I end up laughing with tears rolling down my face.  Nice to see Morgan and Casey get more of a role in this season.  Anxiously awaiting for season four in Oct.  NOW I know what a 'nerd herder' is.

B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is one of my daughter's favorite movies and so is my best friends daughter's.She is obsesed with it and now she is planning to grow her hair as long as Rapunzels! this movie is very cute and very fun. The story starts out when the kingdoms most wanted(and most charming) thief finds a long tower. There he meets Rapunzel, a beautiful and tower-bound feisty maiden who is trying to leave to see the floating lights...and find out what happens! At the end Flynn, cuts off Rapunzel's hair short and she now has gray ugly modern hair and my daughters hate that part but pretend it didn't happen. It also reminds me of the relationship between a daughter and mother, you know the way how girls love their moms until they grow up and want to leave and look around but still loves their mom.And there's the part when the girl meets the boy of her dreams. And also Rapunzel gives Mother Gothel a rebellious No! it reminds me of a teenager. So buy it with a soda and popcorn. If my daughter ever manages to grow her hair that long I will seriously have a hard time brushing it.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I didn't think I would love this book like I did, largely because the plot and background description (especially of the school) can seem contrived.  However, I soon learned that it is VERY appropriately titled.  The chemistry between the two narrators made my stomach turn.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD just has it, I dont know what it is but the CD is just over all just great.
B005B7IPG8|4.0|Great performances by actors portraying characters that are anything but great.  The main characters are `Stepford Wives' automatons, always saying the right thing at the right time simply because it seems to be the right thing to say.  The core family around which the movie revolves (father, wife, and grown son) are studies in shallowness and superficiality.  It wouldn't be true to say that they wouldn't know a real emotion or thought if it bit them, but that they avoid such disruptions of their `astroturf' world like the plague.    Conversations and family discussions generally consist of recountings of substance-free past trivialities, trivial current events, and snappy one-liners intended to show their wit and mental agility, but which evidence a disturbing vacuous pathology instead.  The brother of the father/husband adds another dimension of Stepford drollness by skipping the superficiality of trite and largely meaningless conversation and simply says virtually nothing at all, sort of a study in Stepford superficial muteness and inner dullardness.    The character that moves the movie is the great \\"Mary\\", Gerry's (the wife) co-worker and longtime friend.  Mary makes the mistake of actually having real emotions underneath her attempted and often failed `Stepford-speak' (which she seems to have picked up from hanging around Gerry too much), and worse yet, having them for the Stepford son.  At first, she seems to be merely a deeply disturbed neurotic, but as the story unfolds it seems that she is actually the only sane one of the bunch, being cursed with the possession of real emotions while surrounded by emotionally eviscerated automatons, only neither she nor her friends that she tries so hard to please realize it.    \\"Another Year\\" presents an accurate portrayal and dramatized critique of a far too common sociological defect and is definitely worth seeing.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|I thought that this was a wonderful sequel to Ender's Game, was it exactly in the same vein of exciting battles and action, no but Card does a wonderful job in creating a universe that has changed since the events of the first book. The main accomplishment to me was the fact that the universe was able to age so much but Ender did not it was a good way to show the changes that Ender brought about but still be able to see how Ender changed as a person. And while this sequel is not action packed it more than makes up for it with the depth of story and characters that were presented. Any person who loves a good story, one that you can completely sink into would love this book.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I have to say I am very pleased with this 2-Disc Complete Dossier.    First of all, the packaging is wonderful and creative. For those of you that don't know, you open it up like an envelope and the dvd will slide out of it.    The picture quailty is amazing, the movie still has the same yellow/orange glow to it.    The sound quailty is also amazing, the part where it sounds the best is when the officers inform Willard about his mission, the sound makes it feel like you ARE in the room.    Special Features are great, we get a bunch of Behind The Scenes featurettes, a commentary by Francis Ford Coppola and tons more.

0061784788|3.0|Enough already with the whining and complaining about the Kindle price.  If you don't like it - don't buy it.<br /><br />Regarding the book itself, I am disappointed.  I have loved all of the Rollin's books (except for the Indiana Jones fiasco.  Whose idea was that?) The scope of his adventures is awesome and usually so fast paced you just can't put it down.  Once you allow for the willing suspension of disbelief, you are ready to accept some pretty far out ideas and settings while you enjoy the action.  But in this book, I got bored.  There are so many ideas floating around that are never followed up on, I got annoyed.  And worst of all for a Rollin's novel, many, many trails were predictable.  Throw in some gratuitous mayhem and this just didn't measure up to what I expect from him.
1453757430|4.0|I read this specific work because I am one those people who, when approaching a new series, likes to start at the first work and continue chronologically. This old-fashioned mystery is a good one for those looking for an alternative to the Sherlock Holmes stories: goes just as well with a blanket and tea on a rainy day, but not quite as stuffy. Avid mystery readers may find the pace to be glacial compared to the more complex works that are standard now, but I really avoided focusing too much on the plot and getting more absorbed in the language and descriptions of the surroundings of the time.  The book is fairly short and straight-forward -save the heavy-duty analyzing for loftier books.  I look forward to Christie's other works!
B004YKB52O|5.0|At first listen I could already tell it was much better then their last album. Not to say their last album was bad, because it wasn't. I like the guest artists on this record especially Rivers Cuomo. This album is a return to form for Simple Plan.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|Based on my husband's recommendation I bought the complete hardback set a while ago on sale at my local bookstore. I happily read straight through them and then lent the set to my mom.     Then I could not stop thinking about the books and wanted to re-read them but I did not have the set. I decided to look into the Kindle versions just to see the pricing. I was impressed at the reviews that let me know that the \\"Kindle boxed set\\" was $0.99 more and did not allow me to skip around in the books. After a little thought I decided to buy just Twilight and read through it. Great plan except I read straight through the first book and proceeded to buy/read my way through all the books again. LOL oh well. I am thrilled to say that all the books are formatted wonderfully, the index's work great and the covers are beautiful.     This set has become a favorite and is my first set that I have both the hard copy and the digital. I love being able to have it on the go with me but still pick up the book at home.    As a note on Breaking Dawn I thought this was the best book. It was well laid out, flowed quickly and really hit that magic button of being a lot of information but not getting dragged down. I highly disagree with some of the reviewers comments about the book. I was horrified at some of the ugly thoughts they imposed on the story. This is fiction, written for enjoyment, if you do not like it -- don't read it. I thought Meyer did an incredible job on this series and I am grateful for her sharing this world with all of us.
B0053ZOQMK|2.0|This was a pathetic excuse to make a western cartoon!!??? The story line was completely unbelievable. Oh well, you win some and you lose some.
0345529057|5.0|For the price I was worried about the quality of the books. I'm on book 3 now and haven't had any problems. Granted overany years they probably won't keep like a hard cover but for the price this is a very good buy.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|The story of a 1942 Jewish family being evicted from their home in Paris and sent to a camp is interwoven with the plot of a modern-day reporter trying to determine what happened to the little girl in the family. Scenes of the fate of Jewish people at the time are always powerful to watch, with this one being no exception. The anguish of families being separated is realistically portrayed, but their eventual fate is not depicted. The story revolves around the little girl, Sarah, trying to determine the fate of her brother. The other story features the always good Kristin-Scott Thomas, doing a story on the eviction of Jews from Paris, and focusing on understanding the fate that befell Sarah. This is a powerful film that will captivate the viewer.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I saw the trailers for Super 8 in theater when I watched other movies in theater. When I saw the glimpses, even with some of the earlier trailers, I found myself reminded about a good deal of the Anime I've seen for the Sci-Fi and/or Horror genre. Particularly the ones that happened to touch upon the scientific technology only slightly, and the horror is minute. The draw for these Anime is the actual storyline and the characters. Normally I find myself not interested in watching American movies for this genre, but when I saw the trailers, I found myself wanting to watch the movies at least once.    When the movie popped up on the big screen , I found that my comparisons to the Anime I like from those two genre was not far off at all. While the subject of \\"the thing\\" and other scientific elements crop up in the movie, not to mention there are a few times I felt a slight terror running through my mind, I felt that it wasn't over done. Instead, the movie focused on the characters and the plot line. I found myself drawn into the whole thing.    The characters came to life in my mind. Each of the children in their group had their own distinct personalities. There are also quite a bit of growing up issues presented within the movie, dealt with in a believable fashion. There is also the issue with dealing with parents that are over bearing. The movie is one of those that one should watch at least once, despite the fact that Spielberg does over do the detail when it comes to certain things, but that only adds to the fantastical element in the story. Not to mention it is expected of his work.     I got what I expected out of the movie. There was a great plot, a nice romance story that came across as  believable, not to mention age appropriate was also in there. The story line had quite a few cliches in it, but in the long run the plot flowed smoothly from beginning to end. It has some similarities to one of his earlier work of E.T, but the story fits more into the time frame.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|In the old west, a stranger arrives in town as some mysterious beings attack and abduct the locals. Rivals come together to fight a common enemy and attempt to save their loved ones. This film successfully melds the western and science fiction genres, bringing to the screen a fun and exciting action film with a little mystery thrown in. It starts out working well as a typical western, and the addition of the aliens does nothing to hurt the film's quality. Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig are both top-notch as always and this one definitely works.
159514188X|5.0|this book was amazing!!! i absolutely loved it and will be anxiously awaiting this author's next book later this year. this is definitely a book that young and older readers alike can fall into and most likely will affect everyone differently but affect them all the same. i would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. for older readers it's a pretty quick read too, i loved the pacing of it, it really flew along and i found myself wanting to just turn 1 more page when i knew i should be putting it down. while some of the subject matter may be intense for some, i urge readers to move past that and give the book a try, i don't think you'll be disappointed.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I am a professional touring and recording artist, OMEB, who typically sings through a beta 58. I have recently been very impressed with some of Behringer's products. Sometimes I will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics. I had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one. At $25 I figured I could chance it! I used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show. The mic was much hotter than the 58, better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies! As far as durability... that is the question, but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn't cost $160 bucks... this is your mic!
B004J4WQ46|4.0|Man I love these guys. They come out with another (per my count this is #4?) great album! On top of that they change up the style from the previous ones slightly, stick to it for the whole album, & come out with an album you like every track on.    I am looking forward to every title they release from here on out & thank god, in this era of mass-produced pop&RB that the flock just gobbles up, it give you a new confidence again in the human race....(maybe a little to deep there).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|A lot of reviewers say that this game looks terrible scaling up on tablets, but I digress.  I own this game and play it on a nice 8-inch display.  The game looks just fine to me.  I also have this game on PC, so I can do an apt comparison, IMO.  The PC is the version to beat, obviously...but considering the much smaller cost of this Android port, the accuracy of the port can't be denied.<br /><br />You know how PvZ plays; one of the early breakout Tower Defense games we've seen.  It's everything you'd expect from TD I'd say.  But not just that; it runs really well, too.  Seeing that it's scaling to my device, the fact that it runs so smoothly is testament to the port's quality.  And my tablet is considered mid-line at best by most techies.  So if I get silky smooth FPS on a generic single-core Power VR tablet, imagine a Galaxy 10.1 or an Acer Iconia with its dual cores and Tegra 2 brute force power.  If you have a 1 Ghz or higher tablet, you should run this game just fine, and look good doing it.<br /><br />Now go stomp some brain-eatin' Zombie Bastards!!<br />(also plz buy the game)
B004NSULHM|3.0|I wonder if I am getting lame, but this latest installment of RH's 'deep thought' rock was not my cup of tea. I don't know, it might have been just too deep this time for me. Maybe they should have colaborated on this with experts in the techno arena say APHEX TWIN (wow got a semi just thinking that that would even ocur)? However I will still buy any album they release from now 'til forever as the genius of their overall body of work is in my opinion beyond anything any generation's bands so far have produced (might be biased as it is my generation that these guys came up in, but oh well that's my 2-cents on it...)    In the end I hope they continue to produce music as they like & not create stuff based on some target market study.
B004WOS7LO|5.0|This Loud Morning, is a musical journey. It begs to be listened to from beginning to end and then repeated. Filled with rich instrumentation and soaring vocals, It's progressive but still has a heart based in Rock and Roll!

B000002KHB|5.0|I started listening to this album in the 70's and didn't much care for it, I am now 60 years old and playing it to my 3 and 5 year old grandsons, it is a classic rock album and has survived for 40 years, fabulous tracks, Smoke on the water being my favourite.  Anyone who loves rock should listen to this album, it is a collectors item!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The show Dexter hit yet another peak with Season 4. This season was special to me for many reasons, the first one being that this was the first season of Dexter that I watched on Showtime as the episodes were orginally aired. I had just read the first three Dexter novels and saw the first three seasons before watching Season 4, so I was completely into this show at the time. And man, did Season 4 not disappoint at all! After slipping just a wee bit with Season 3 (which nonetheless still had great writing and a terrific season finale), Dexter more than righted itself with Season 4....and how!! And what a brilliant idea, bringing in John Lithgow as the Trinity Killer. Lithgow is perfect in this role....I don't think he has ever been better, which is saying a lot. His character has many levels and Lithgow plays all of them perfectly. Nice to see the return of FBI agent Lundy, as well.<br /><br />The writing for this season is brilliant and the actors more than rise to the material. For the main cast, I am the most impressed with Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan. She has developed in major leaps and bounds as an actress since season 1. There is one scene ( I believe in episode 5, 6 or 7) where her character breaks down and cries in front of Dexter that I think has some of the best acting of her career. I can never watch this scene without getting teary eyed! There are some very interesting sub-plots, the main one...which maybe really isn't a sub-plot...being Dexter getting adjusted to married life and having a baby, which makes sleeping more of a challenge for him. I also like the rising tension between Dexter and Quinn. The one sub-plot that I was not completely crazy about was the romance between Laguerta and Batista, which gets even more awkward during season 5. And Rita does get a bit annoying during the season, that is until the last three or four episodes, where the Rita that I came to know and love during the first few seasons comes back. But those are about the only negative things I have to say about this season.<br /><br />As I said before, the writing is brilliant and the acting (particularly by John Lithgow, Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter) is stellar. This is such an intense and chilling season! And the show still retains it's dark humour. There is one episode where we get to hear what type of music some of the characters listen to and the biggest surprise is Masuka's choice of music. And yes, Masuka...he is his usual hilarious and loveable self here, but also reveals from time to time a kind of sweetness and sensitivity that helps to flesh his character out more. I don't think I have ever liked him as much as I do (did) during this season. And how could you not love that laugh of his?<br /><br />Beware the season finale and don't let anybody tell you what happens during it if you don't know already. All I can say is that I was completely blown away by it and was also completely surprised and shocked, which I hope doesn't give away anything! Just brace yourself.....<br /><br />I cannot recommend this season enough, really....egative things I have to say about this season.

B00003CXC7|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie, the cinematography is amazing and can I just say You can't go wrong with anything Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart are in.  True suspense from start to finish and the whole concept on spying on your neighbors is simply great, maybe I'm boasting alittle but Jimmy Stewart was my grandfathers cousin and that was how I got hooked on watching every single movie he was in and this movie out of all that I've seen has to be the best one for me anyway.  I only had this version to compare to a vhs copy I owned but I thought the picture quality was very nice and it had some great extras as well!

1878424319|1.0|I was excited to read this book based on so many \\"good\\" reviews. I found I was forcing myself to keep reading it and finally just put it down. It's great when I book reaches out and touches someone but it I just wasn't feeling it. Moving on...
1416511946|5.0|What an eye-opening book....and mind-opening too.  Nikki Sixx shares the most intimate, and sometimes downright embarrassing times during his addicion through his actual diaries written at that time.  He shares his highs (literally) and lows.  It gives you a clear understanding of what drugs do to your mind.  It is completely amazing that he is alive today!  His second book \\"This is Gonna Hurt\\" is just as good---and a completely different (and sober) side of Nikki Sixx.  I've never had books make me feel connected to the author.  I am now a fan of Nikki the author as well as Nikki the musician.
B000EAT246|5.0|I remember this movie when it hit the big screen, but I enjoy it more today. The characters rival the cool helicopter scenes. Scheider is convincing as a skilled but flawed veteran pilot, but Warren Oates stole the movie IMO. The scene of him chewing out Murphy and Lymangood is one of my favorite scenes in any movie. He shows a full range of emotion and throws in a lot of one-liners, sarcasm and forced grins to make his point, yet you know he still likes and worries about Murphy. A must see.
B002361MLA|5.0|I love the Power of Now. It is one of those books that you can read over and over again, each time find something new. It is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorites. If you give this book a chance, you will find it to be an amazing read. Thank you Eckhart Tolle for sharing your wisdom!

B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Chuck beats by far C.S.I., Gilmore Girls, Dr. House and all those famous series. Chuck suffered poor advertisement and bad timing but it should of became an international phenomenon! If you are looking for a funny and breath-taking entertainment, Chuck is the thing.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|Angelina, alarmingly anorexic, hasn't changed her actioner character since she was Mrs. Smith. Didn't even bother to phone this one in. She just showed up. Movie was droning on at a decent speed until Johnny Dipstick came into the first scene, then ground to a screeching halt where it remained mired in mud to the end...I guess. I couldn't get past the first half hour. Johnny is lost with only his naked face, which was alarmingly puffy and aged. Without the ridiculous Tim Burton makeup and silly hats and pirates, there's no one there. No chemistry whatsoever between he and she.<br /><br />Run! Run for your life from this one!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best touchscreen keyboard I have used to date. Predictions are very accurate. Can&apos;t see myself using a different keyboard, and I&apos;ve used Swype!
B0006GANN2|3.0|For years, I loved the weird music and the pacing of this movie. The scene where they're stewing over why the car weighs too much and how to find the hidden stuff. The fantastic setup of the ending. And the City of New York---so gritty and ugly-beautiful. This movie showed me the New York visual that I remembered from when I was a kid. New York itself as another actor in the movie...essential stuff. Image upon image piling up. Winning me over. Taking me along.    Trouble is, I hadn't bothered to see this movie from the true beginning of the film for quite a few years...I seemed to always be picking up on this movie on TV when it was about 30-45 minutes in. So I always saw it at its best. When I finally watched it right from the beginning four or five years ago, after I bought the movie for myself, I was appalled at how tissue-paper much of this movie's emotional heart was: Popeye Doyle is an obsessed character without depth or even much intelligence. He has very little personality---just a mouth, really. Roy Scheider is decorative and a supporter of Doyle, a bit of a Greek chorus to Doyle's schemings, but not much else. The racism and general bullying nature of the Popeye character is painful and even embarrassing to me now...why did I ever like this movie? The humanity is entirely missing. It's just cars, buildings, music. When Doyle pleads his case (\\"let me do this, I know I can do it\\", his superiors don't care. I find that I don't care either. He isn't convincing. He's just a mouth under a hat. Why DO they let him? We never really see why. He just DOES it. No one discusses anything. It all just happens. (I know this is Friedkin's style, but it's not working for me in this movie anymore. I've grown up.)    Hmmm. The movie's good points now? It's a tarnished idol. A time-slice, the first of its gritty cop-movie, fast-paced, tell-it-like-it-is, don't stop for breath, chase-scene kind, admittedly. But to weigh its merits now presents a true dilemma. As long as I don't watch it from the beginning, it's pretty good. Maybe even more than that, at times. It has much of the old gritty magic...but it isn't worth the \\"it's a masterpiece\\" rhetoric anymore. It has spooky-good bits but a lot of that has to do with the marriage of the visual pace with the occasional musical score; it supplies a disjointed but jarring emotional link that the characters themselves cannot give you, they are too disaffected.    This movie's early scene featuring NYC gritty cop reality laced with racial bullying just makes me feel bad and embarrassed as a white person, frankly. And as horrible as drugs and heroin and the overall heroin trade seem to me (and always has), I just don't think society cares about getting rid of it to the extent that it once did. So that single-mindedness seems kinda crazy now, kinda Hollywood-exaggerated. There's just too many other crises to deal with that are Level 10 nowadays. And the later bit about Doyle commandeering the citizen's car just seems...delusional and a total classic authority-gone-mad-power-trip from the past, representative of when cops and officials were allowed to do whatever they pleased, seemingly...yeah, a cop can just run into the middle of the street and stop somebody, pull them bodily out of their car, jump into their car, drive it away, smash it up, and it's OK...police business...he's just being a cop. It makes this movie's car-chase seem like a slice of bad 70s TV...and it's probably this exact movie that inspired much of the bad 70s cop crap we had to watch back then.    Now, I don't have any sentiment against cops. The opposite of that, if anything. I respect them and thank God they're there. Always have. But Popeye Doyle is an embarrassment from an embarrassing, notoriously corrupt era, and I don't think you should bother with this movie unless you realize it is very dated now. Man, that bit where Doyle goes in the bar and insults and slaps around all the black drug dealers in there (because every single person in the crowded bar is both black and automatically assumed to be a drug dealer, of course!) just makes me cringe. And I never thought I was a knee-jerk type of PC person. I figured I could get the subtext and overcome the other stuff...but it's too stark to me now, I can't overcome it. It's garbage, that scene practically a ficto-documentary of police abuse and disrespect to black men, and has no merits other than its telling of a bad, sad, nasty time in this nation's history. The scene ACTUALLY MADE ME FEEL BAD FOR THE DRUG DEALERS, if that's possible! And I don't want to be feeling bad for drug dealers. I want to hate them...this movie makes me hate Doyle instead. I find that grotesque somehow, a real failure---but at this point in my life, I can tell it is not my personal failure; the failure is in this movie. And I've had years to find this out, I've outgrown easy emotions. The Doyle character, at least as portrayed in this movie, is just not worth watching. (I like, even love Gene Hackman in so many other movies: The Conversation, Hoosiers, Downhill Racer, Get Shorty...even as Lex Luthor...he's nearly always worth watching, at times even fascinating to watch.)    Yeah, I guess you could say I'm a little disillusioned about this movie. I can still enjoy To Live And Die in LA, though...
B0007TKNII|5.0|Phantom of the Opera DVD. I loved the movie and just had to purchase the DVD. It is so beautiful and the music of course is wonderful. Andresw Loyd Webber at his best.
B004G600A4|5.0|I borrowed this movie from my local library and with great trepidation i started watching it.      I have been less than impressed with Disney's \\"real people\\" movies since their stellar BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  POCAHONTAS, HERCULES, MULAN....not great.  THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG,  while having some of the best music Disney has put out in YEARS, was disappointing.  But I digress.    In TANGLED you get a good story line, great characters (the horse was hysterical, a really evil villain (talk bout Mommy Dearest....yuck!) and enough adult humor to keep the Big Kids interested.  In many ways, I thought this more of an adult film than for little kids really.  Kind of like old Warner Brothers cartoons.  Pixar animation was absolutely beautiful!    First Disney movie with human characters since B&TB that I am going to purchase.  As in spend my hard earned bucks on. NOT the Blu-ray but the DVD version.    Highly recommended.
1591844096|5.0|Linchpin definition:<br />1. A locking pin inserted in the end of a shaft, as in an axle, to prevent a wheel from slipping off.<br />2. A central cohesive element<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite books. It is very powerful for its observations. A person that is a linchpin is not going to work as a cog in someone's machine. They will either rebuild the machine itself and make it better or go start from scratch and build a whole new machine. Linchpin's annoy bosses because they are not interested in following the corporate map, they want to draw one that takes the company to a better place. The good thing about linchpins though is that they do not have to be told what to do, they get things done, they lead and manage themselves. They are rare because people want to be told what to do, it is scary and exhausting to engage in creating maps and machines, that is why it pays well.<br /><br />Linchpin's do not work primarily for money, their work itself is an art. They are passionate about their work, it is their game. People that have created great businesses, books, music, web sites, and inventions are artists bringing what they imagine in their minds into the physical world. The key to the amazing success of so many musicians, authors, inventors, and entrepreneurs is that they were able to create something completely different the world had never seen, this is art.<br /><br />A true linchpin is indispensable to a business, they make things happen, they do not need a manual they have the ability to make decisions and create value. They can move an organization in the right direction with out having to be told.<br /><br />With so much of the work force becoming interchangeable commodities in the 21st century this book steers it's readers to another path, a path of thinking for yourself, creating what is needed, and building something new. Making yourself indispensable in your business.<br /><br />Very powerful book.
1603425381|5.0|This book is filled to the brim with beautiful border patterns that (gasp!) I can actually see myself using!  In fact, I've already used #30 on a birthday blanket I made for my mom - The pattern for the blanket itself was great, but the border was just several rows of single crochet - bo-ring!  This book allowed me to make the blanket even more special by putting my own personal touch on it.    There's a large, clear picture for every border in the book, the pattern directions are clear, and (for me) even better, there is a stitch diagram for each border as well.    If you crochet or knit blankets, placemats, scarves, shawls, sweaters, hats or anything with an edge that can be fancied up, you need this book!
0811874192|5.0|I bought five of these paper blossoms books. I'm very pleased and happy with these Ray Marshall books. The colors, patterns, cuts of these paper flower arrangements just amaze me. I also like the diversity of the five flower arrangements - ranging from Hawaiian, tropical, Asian, Victorian England, etc. feel. You can stare in awe at the details of these paper blossom bouquets for a long period of time. I recently gave this book as part of a birthday present to my co-worker, and she really loved the book (she loves flowers and making cards). I love pop-up books because I'm always fascinated by all the time and details pop-up book artists put into their work. I'm so very thankful that Ray Marshall made this book. This book is absolutely one of the best things to give as a gift. It's something that lasts forever. This book is better than a card and it's better than dealing with the waste and guilt of having dead flowers. I truly can't think of any household that wouldn't put this book to good decorative use. This book definitely gets people's attention. When I gave this book to my co-worker, this book stopped my boss in her tracks, and she asked, \\"What's that?\\" All of Ray Marshall's paper blossom bouquets caught her attention, and she thought it was a good idea as well. I'm happy with the size of the book and flower arrangements. And I like how the elastic holder keeps the pages and book protected. This book is a conversation starter, and is elegant, beautiful, unique, and different. It's definitely a keepsake book that belongs with all your photo albums. Like I said before, this book is such a great concept. I'm so happy that someone like Ray Marshall was able to turn this idea and book into a reality for all of us to appreciate and enjoy. I really don't know how Ray Marshall is going to top this book, but I'm looking forward to any future work from this man!
B001UV4XHY|3.0|what ever happened to the days of widescreen/fullscreen choice on a DVD?  great movie, hands down! but the wide screen version on this release is laughable!!  a little tiny sliver in the middle of the screen, the black bars on the top and bottom are as big as the picture??? the VERY small amount on each side of a widescreen version is not worth the loss of the top and bottom of the TV screen.  I hope this changes or my days of buying new DVD's is over.

0061714372|5.0|A great entertaining Rock n' Roll memoir!      Dave, on these pages is honest, revealing, personal, funny, heartfelt, remorseful, engaging... ready for peace and extending the olive branch to whoever will accept it.      When I turned the last page, I had a whole new respect and understanding for Dave Mustaine, his band and their music.      A great read from one of the coolest original guys in rock history. Can't wait to see what he does next.  Go Dave! and Keep Shredding!

B001AQO446|5.0|Let's get this straight -- this blu-ray contains both the theatrical AND the extended cuts, for the misguided soul here (obviously NOT on a mission from God) who says stick with the 25th Anniversary edition.<br /><br />And let's get this clear as well -- the quality of the picture is superb, much MUCH better than the DVD.  Older films have issues when you transfer them to blu-ray, no question about it, but this image is as good as it can possibly get (don't believe me?  Check out Blu-ray.com for a review of it).<br /><br />On the extended version the extended scenes aren't as good a quality -- the source material there wasn't available and they probably transferred it from the DVD master.  But it's not WORSE than the DVD, only not improved.<br /><br />And on that note, IMHO the theatrical version is the one you want anyway.  This is a film that does not get better when the timing gets slower -- and at nearly 2 1/2 hours the extended version just drags.  Watch the theatrical version first and if you are still jonesing for some more Brothers you can pop on the extended version (my guess is you will have gotten full -- satiated and satisfied.  And if times were different you'd kick back, light one up, pull down your shades down over your eyes and watch the cool, blue smoke drift hazily towards the ceiling and dream about getting the band back together).<br /><br />Just buy it.  If you say no, Elwood and Jake will come to your house for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day of the week.

0553801473|2.0|The author (GRRM) owes his fans an apology for releasing this terrible book. The most popular reviews pretty much cover it. 1000 pages of poorly written squat.<br /><br />I could have lived with the lack of plot progression, but I didn't even enjoy the pages as I turned them. It was a painful marathon that ended by simply running out of pages.<br /><br />GRRM's quality of writing is clearly not present. As others remarked, it's like the trainwreck of Jordan all over again. Lines repeated over and over until you want to scream. Having to chew through endless pages of describing foolish things like food. Way too many plot threads and nothing happening during any of them. Rich characters suddenly becoming two-dimensional to the point of being corny (e.g. \\"Gee whiz I'm just a knight... I can only fight... gee golly I sure could never be deceptive. Shucks.\\") I actually grew to hate reading certain characters' chapters.<br /><br />I waited eagerly on this book for years as many of you have. This one was so bad, that I no longer eagerly await the next book and deem the series to likely end poorly.<br /><br />To go from such greatness to this drivel is... a disappointment. If I ever buy another GRRM book it will be used to ensure the author makes no money off it. He will have to redeem himself before seeing another penny of mine.<br /><br />I would mail my copy of this turd back to him if I knew his address, so that it would not waste space in my trashbin.

1439153663|5.0|I have decided to rate this book on entertainment value. I listened to this book during commutes to and from work. For the first 2/3 of the book or so, I found myself riveted by the interesting angle of the plot; in the last 1/3, I had gotten into the soap opera-ish twists and turns.    It's funny how some have commented on the lack of mention of historical events of the time like the American Revolution. As though an 8-year old Irish immigrant and isolated slaves in Virginia had access to CNN. Exactly which part of the war would have affected them? Valley Forge? The Crossing of the Delaware? Bunker Hill? Just a hop, skip, and a jump from rural Virginia. Or perhaps they would have been reading about them in the newspaper that was delivered daily to their homes? (We all know how literate indentured servants and slaves were.)    Some of the characters were ones you've read about before or seen in movies. I wish they had been fleshed out a bit more, particularly Rankin, who mirrored every overseer I'd ever read about or seen in film. I would also like to have seen a white woman of the period who was not so delicate. Let's face it, many had to be tough to live through childbirth and the harshness of life during those days. Couldn't Lavinia have toughened up a bit over the years?    It's very true, and I noted this as I listened to the book, how much of the story was \\"told\\" not \\"shown\\". I didn't mind this much although I sort of felt that the end was rushed because of there being a bit too much summary.     Nevertheless, I enjoyed my commute for several days because I was engrossed in this story and would recommend the book to anyone based on the uniqueness of the the basic story line.
B00064X3BI|5.0|Perfect sound, great 5.1 mix which souds very natural, not too much coming from the rears and good Clapton disc too.
0553801473|3.0|A Song of Fire and Ice started with great promise and was easily one of the most innovative and captivating works of fiction in decades, fantasy or otherwise.  The first three books in this series were rich, fast paced, full of unexpected twists and turns, dark, humerous, profane and moving.  However, the last two books, A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons, have become bloated, unfocused and so full of predictable cliff-hangers that the series is in danger of becoming a parody of its younger self.  It almost looks as if Mr Martin took the sobriquet of \\"The American Tolkien\\" that was bestowed on him early in this series too much heart and started writing for the ages rather than his readers of the here and now.  Perhaps in the year 2050, readers of this series (if its completed by then and if people still read) may be able to have a perspective where A Feast for Crows and A Dance of Dragons can be seen as brilliant because they set up the remainder of the story in critical and necessary ways.  However real genius would have given us poor slobs reading this in real time a more tightly focused and rewarding story.  After waiting 10 years for A Feast for Crows and A Dance for Dragons to recapture some of the earlier brilliance of this series, like many reviewers here, Im not sure I care enough any more to wait another 10 years to see what happens to the story and the characters that are left.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|To put some perspective into my review, I do not read many romantic happily-ever-after novels.    It started off a promising read for a relaxing Sunday, but the characters started wallowing in self-pity and it became clear it was one of the books I will finish just because I cannot leave a book unread.    There are too many elements exposed in the book with very few explanations. One of the characters in the book summed the relationship up right: \\"co-dependent\\". I cannot relate to the characters and Pigeon just felt like a mary-sue through and through.    I'd only recommend it if one wants to know how to learn about a dysfunctional relationship.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I use this bluetooth transmitter with my Apple 6th gen Nano worn on a TikTok wristband in order to wirelessly send music to bluetooth headphones while I work out at the gym so that I have no wires getting in the way.  So far (4 months after purchase) it has been very reliable, and instantly paired with 2 different sets of bluetooth headphones.  The only downside is that it rapidly drains tha nano battery after ~1 hour of use.  Now if only Apple would come along and make a slightly larger nano on a watchband with imbedded blue tooth, 3G/4G and a longer battery life so I could download apps, check a few emails, take phone calls and listen to music all wirelessly from the convenience of my wrist, then Id be Dick Tracy!
B000JLTRKE|5.0|Oliver Stone's film \\"World Trade Center\\" is beautiful. There is no other way to describe it. One of my all time favorites. It get's very emotional, personal, and touching. I caught myself holding back tears, and sometimes not holding them back, through this entire movie. Stone did an excellent job reinventing the day that brought America to unified knees, through the eyes of it's true heroes.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Despite some sad scenes, we loved this movie.  I love how the toys all stood together despite having to pull away from \\"Andy\\".

B004DMIIVO|3.0|summer wars is basically a movie about people being connected to a virtual universe via avatars and a virus corrupts their virtual world and a great grandmas 90th bday(in short). the movie overall is ok, honestly. the 5 star reviews gave me the impression tht i would be seeing a incredible movie however which is not the case. one of the biggest dissapointments of this movie is that more than half of the movie wasn't in the magical virtual universe. ok i get the director wants to show the characters and the family interacting but i found it so vain to the point where i got bored at points. i am trying to figure out why you would create such a spellbinding universe and then not showcase it (it was like buying a Ferrari and driving it once a month but instead use your hoopdie minivan most of the time). aside that, the fighting scenes that did appear were very well thought out and polished however it left wanting more. all i am saying is that this movie should have found a main plot and stick to it. the movie gave the impression saving/being in this digital world would be the main point of the movie (via the dvd case)but for more than have of the movie they showcase a family with problems instead. and for all of the reviewers who said this is a \\"hayao miyazaki movie\\" i would have to say you are wrong. hayao miyazaki would have taken advantage of this \\"new world\\" and would have emphazied its importance by giving it more screen time, and would have created a more enticing storyline regarding the family it circles. in conclusion, if you buy this movie dont expect to see endless fighting scenes or see \\"oz\\" being shown functionally by the main characters. is the movie worth seeing???? yes. is it worth buying that is deffinately up to the viewer. it isnt one of those \\"must haves\\". (oh btw it does kinda look like the digimon movie)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A few times this summer I caught this movie on television. I was so touched by the relationship that Hachi had with his owner. The story demonstrates how trust,friendship and love develop between the two. Watching the changes in their lives and how they give to each other over time. It is an emotional experience, especially knowing it is based on a true story.
B003INJETO|5.0|It seems that Daniel has been a bit influenced by his work with Transatlantic, and the history of the Beatles. Road Salt One is not about progressive metal instrumental prowess. It is about throwback rock, and it is beyond excellent. If you're one to complain about classic rock, than perhaps you will not be thrilled with this stripped down recording. Otherwise, this is POS's best recording since BE. Very catchy, very subdued, and far better than most of today's mediocre fair.  Edit: This album really does grow on you! It's hard to get a feel for this recording by listening to a few songs on Youtube. To really get the full effect, one needs to listen to the entire album as a whole.
B0035J6TA8|4.0|Others have slammed this because the artist moved in a different direction.  That has been Gabriel's method for all these years - doing something new and different.  This CD is certainly different from ANYTHING he has done before.  It is slow - so if you were expecting upbeat music - forget it.  That doesn't mean it is a bad CD - just, well, different.  Not something you would put on at a party and expect people to start dancing.<br /><br />If, for some reason, you are just starting out and collecting Peter Gabriel CD's - or want to get a taste of his style - don't start with this one (I would go with So - but that's just me).  For those of us that have followed his career, this is just another stop along the way.
0061245097|5.0|I love that Cat Crawfield works for the government with a \\"Special Forces\\" team, instead of the usual rogue behavior that I read in many Urban Fantasy series. It's interesting that it takes Bones this long to find Cat, and by a seeming coincidence at that. It occurred to me while reading that if Bones really was as good at what he does as he says he is, then he would have found her within the first year easily.<br />Skipping ahead to the best part about this series, in my personal opinion, is the sexual chemistry between Cat and Bones. I confess, my curiosity about chapter 32 of this book, after reading a book review that made vague hints about it, is what propelled me to start this series. I actually read that chapter first once I got my hands on this book to satisfy my curiosity, and words can not describe how hot this chapter is! So often, I find that sex scenes in novels abuse cliches or do not use the details adequately for my personal tastes, but this chapter throws conventional decorum out the window without disgusting me or making me too uncomfortable to read. Plus, the more fantastical aspects of the two characters made for some unique and handy details that Jeaniene Frost used quite well to create such heat between Cat and Bones. Yes, I read that chapter several more times before I turned the book back into the library.<br />Cat Crawfield has really grown into a character of strength and determination from the first book, Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1). She knows how to use her abilities to their maximum potential and her self-confidence is strong enough to stand up to even her mother. No longer is she like a pupil to Bones' instruction, but an equal to him in every way that matters. Bones is just as cocky and alluring as he ever was - I wouldn't change a thing about him. It is obvious that he has more than a few secrets up his sleeve, but I don't mind the wait.<br />I find it intriguing how Cat can alter perceptions and prejudices of the people around her as easily as she does, as is shown with the men on her team. This shows just how much potential she carries to change her world on a larger scale. I can't wait to pick up the next book in the series, At Grave's End (Night Huntress, Book 3).her as easily as she does, as is shown with the men on her team. This shows just how much potential she carries to change her world on a larger scale. I can't wait to pick up the next book in the series, At Grave's End (Night Huntress, Book 3).
B001MYIXAC|4.0|It is a good movie - no doubt.  I love the concept - young vampire.  Her helper at the start has to be the most incompetent person to ever be chosen to take care of a vampire.  That was the funny part (intentional or otherwise).  I do like the idea that you don't actually see a lot of the violence (e.g. the pool scene at the end).  She is one crazy vampire.<br /><br />The maker does make the parents in this movie seem so out of touch with their kid - with a few exceptions.  And the school administration?  Seriously?  Even here they aren't that daft.  Those were the major down parts.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie - one worth actually owning.  I will certainly watch it again.
0385339100|4.0|As others have written, the story is enjoyable but highly improbable. As one reviewer wrote, the non-linear style is actually intriguing and fun.  I was very disappointed with the ending.  It almost felt as if the author reached the number of words he wanted to write and slammed the brakes on the story to end it as quickly as possible.  I very much wanted a happy ending, but would have accepted a sad ending if it had been well-developed.  But my reaction to the end of the story was basically - \\"Huh?\\"  I would still recommend it!
B004G8QHKO|4.0|Some catchy tunes, and as others have mentioned, not necessarily the best lyrics.  You know what?  It doesn't matter.  It's an enjoyable CD by a pretty talented group.  I would recommend purchasing it to anyone I know.
B003Y5H59W|4.0|I just went out and saw this movie with my wife. I grew up with comicbooks. Captain America was one of many favorites of mine along with Thor and Spiderman. The movies have always been Good, but I think this one is one of the BEST. First, the camera work is first rate though tough to get used to at first....you feel like you are right in the middle of the action. The costuming was GREAT....it felt a lot like the 1940's and the ladies in the film were especially Beautiful....The movie had a true classic feel to it right down to the soundtrack. The cast was a nice blend of veterans like Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson, and young actors like Chris Evans. Very Entertaining....and just the right length. Not a movie I'd watch repeatedly, but a FUN RIDE nonetheless!
B000BNI99K|5.0|Who knew Rod Stewart could deliver on the old classics.  He comes through beautifully and for those of us over 50 (or more) with a sense of nostalgia for songs where you could actually understand the lirics, it's great music.
1594744769|3.0|I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews.  And unfortunately, it didn't live up to it's hype.  I REALLY appreciated the effort the author put into the use of the old photos, and that he took the time to actually catalog them at the end of the book.  But it seemed like the whole story was just written around him finding a bunch of neat old pictures - which maybe he did.  Almost like he would pick a picture out of a pile and say - ok, now how can I write something about this picture to make it fit in the book.  Ultimately the actually story seemed contrived and simplified - like there was no substance to it.  As a commentary on cool old photos alone the author would have done a good job, but by making up such a silly story about each one of them, the author seemed to devalue the photos for what they were.  By the end, I couldn't wait for it to just be over.
B0013ND36G|4.0|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines may not be up to par in relation to T2, but it provides a good gap between now and then ('then' being Terminator: Salvation). The story is mostly forgettable, with no imagination from the previously released films. The plot does have one great and solid point - we get to see the action from the perspective of a new-comer played by Clare Danes. It is nice to have a focus point outside to distract from some minor plot holes. And it is completely optional to your enjoyment of Salvation. The plot has another thing going for it: it's tons and tons of fun. And fun is awesome in my book.<br /><br />The quality of the visuals is astounding, with little to no tell-tale signs of digital shadow or green screen edges, and the Blu-Ray images almost make up for the loops in the plot line. The sound track is all crunchy and shiny with the grinding of vehicles and the gurgling blasts of energy from the T-X, the newest version in the Terminator series. The interface/menu pop ups are simple and easy to navigate at a glance. Some Blu-Ray menus are a pain with text too small or otherwise hard to navigate; not so here. The behind-the-scenes are pretty inclusive without being redundant, and they included my favorite sort of all - the Blooper Reel. A close second in this case would by the Sgt. Candy scene... I laughed out loud, probably to the annoyance of my neighbours. There is also a feature with Todd McFarlane talking (if you can call it that) about his line of Terminator toys.<br /><br />All in all, this is a solid film for Blu-Ray and sound systems. It's a fun flick packed with extras. And you really can't beat the price... at least since the writing of this review.
B004MPESSY|5.0|Anybody who reads my reviews know that I don't pull any punches. If a movie sucks I will let you know that it sucked regardless of how others feel. So lets get right into my review for I Spit on Your Grave the remake made I believe in 2010.    This movie is a very hard to watch masterpiece on hardcore brutality. I can't even compare it to the original which I also owned. Because the rape scene was very tame in regards the set up for the revenge. But not here. This movie is a stand alone version from the original. The rape scenes are a lot more brutal, and very hard to watch. You feel for Matthew who is the mentally challenged individual who is manipulated into following orders from the others. The Sheriff role was a nice touch, and you really wanted him to get his. When he does it definitely delivers. On the revenge side its very hard to watch. One particular scene had me wanting to turn away, but I found myself still glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen. When it did happen I hurt but I kept watching. I love movies that elicit strong emotions, and its very powerful that a movie can unnerve you. The violence is realistic and you almost want to cheer on Jennifer for how she handles each situation.    This movie gets a full 5 stars because of the build of the story. Everybody in their part does a brilliant job, and comes off as believable. The movie never feels like it over does itself. There is no campy violence in this. As hard as it is to watch, if you can sit through til the end it does indeed pay off. And you've got something special as apart of your collection. I wouldn't pay attention to any of the negative reviews. This remake puts the original to shame, but it still is a very unnerving piece of film that will either make you hate it, love it, or relate to it. I recommend this highly, and suggest each person check this movie out. It has some what of a slow build but once you get past that everything else is straight forward.

B004UUKDNA|4.0|I liked this CD - it's easy and relaxing to listen to, but it has a \\"different\\" kind of sound.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|A wordy review, but I wanted to fully cover the items that I found important to my purchase of this item as well as quell a few concerns I had from reading some of the reviews with low ratings.    QUALITY:    The cooler appears to be well made and is well packaged. I will note here that some reviewers have noted that there are small gaps between the copper pipes and the bottom of the aluminum base. The heat pipes are doing the work of cooling and I don't think it is a problem at all. Also, some noted that the base was not perfectly flat. Using a piece of glass I determined that mine was not quite flat but decided to install it without lapping. I think it performs quite well as is and will probably not remove it for lapping.    INSTALLATION:    The instructions are brief and simplistic (meaning they don't spoon-feed you). I personally had no problem following them and getting the cooler installed. From the time I started removing my old heat sink until I had the cooler fully installed was less than 10 minutes.     The cooler will move around some on the processor but after some pushing, pulling and moving it around, I don't believe there will be any problems. I use Arctic Silver's Ceramique paste, which is very sticky. This will decrease the already very slight chance of the cooler moving or pulling away from processor once it has set.     PERFORMANCE:    As far as fan noise goes, this seems to be very subjective. I personally found the fan to be very quiet. At its full speed of 2000rpm it is slightly louder than my 120mm case fans, but I still have to make an effort to hear the system from more than a few feet away. Making a guess, I would say that the Max 34dB rating is pretty accurate.    The specs for my system are: Window 7 32bit, HAF 912 mid tower, Biostar TA785GE-128M mobo, Athlon II X4 635 2.9 MHz proc., ATI 5670 video card,  2 SATA II HDDs, 2Gb Ram and a DVD burner.   I used prime95 set to `balanced' for testing and I used CPUID Hardware Monitor Pro to monitor temps. I let system Idle for an hour for idle temps, I then ran prime95 for an hour for max temps.    Stock cooler: Idle 27c, Full burn 59.4c max.  Hyper 212 plus: Idle 21c, Full burn 44.8c max.    I then over clocked the system by 15% by increasing fsb from 200 to 230 giving me a processor speed of 3.34Mhz. Using the Hyper cooler I got the following results:     Idle 23c, Full burn 51c max.     Final thoughts: I only installed this cooler yesterday so I cannot comment on longevity. I will follow-up in 1 month then at 6 months, unless there is a problem.  I will say that this is a well made product that does a good job of cooling my processor. There may be more effective cooling options available, but I don't think you can beat the price vs. performance of this cooler. I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for improving cooling over the stock cooler especially if you plan to moderately over clock.

B003KADOOG|5.0|I never get tired of watching this episode, though it's very dark and lacks the usual comedy. The acting is absolutely AMAZING. The story is disturbing about England becoming a Nazi-like country after a series of disasters that happen because The Doctor wasn't there to stop them. Donna Noble's character is so real and shows remarkable progression from the ditsy loudmouth to the solemn woman who has to set things right again, even though she's desperate and terrified, and really believes she's just a useless temp. My favorite scene is when they're together with the Italian family. First the friction, then the fun, then the farewell, where Wilfred is on the verge of tears and the mother has a face of devastation that practically stops time on its own. Overall, there's never a very serious sense of peril in Doctor Who episodes because you know he's always going to save the day and stop the bad guys somehow, but this one shows a very serious dark side to what would happen if he failed.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Not a kids superhero movie, although a kid set this movie off.  Great movie.  When it first came out, I thought it was gonna be a lame  movie.  After being convinced to give it a try, it was great.  Not what I expected at all.  I'm going to keep my eyes pealed for Hit Girl  to do a solo sequel to this movie.  My all means check it out.
1934030554|5.0|I purchased two items in July: a power meter and this book.  And I believe that one without the other would be nearly useless.  The information outlined and detailed in the book is clear, concise, and methodical.  The attention to detail is meticuluous, and is presented in a very user-friendly way.    If you plan to train and race with power, I would recommend this as the Gold Standard in required reading.

B001HNE3NO|1.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" may be the worst written book I have ever read.  Which is too bad, since the incident it fictionalizes is one so worthy of good writing.  But the characters are stereotypical, the prose is flat and actually laughable, the dialog is weak, simplistic, and unbelievable, the descriptions are unimaginative, every page is loaded with cliches, and there is not a literary device anywhere to be found.  The premise--a young girl who hides her brother in a locked cabinette during the Holocaust--is a good one.  The information about the round-up of Jews and complicity (or indifference) of so many French people is important and needs to be told.  In the hands of someone who could write better than the average sixth grader, it would be worthy of the hype this has received.<br /><br />Did you ever read a book where nearly 25% of every page has sentences that end in question marks?  Where the characters ask themselves questions, over and over again, without answers?  Do you think it would be annoying to read paragraphs composed solely of questions?  Questions that repeat themselves throughout the book?  Do you see what I mean?  But wait, do you think the author only likes questions marks?  No?  You are right!  Yes!!  She also likes exclamation points!!!!  And short sentences.  Very short.  Sentences.  With no variation.  Or wordsmanship.<br /><br />My advice: skip the book, see the movie.  After finishing the book and seething over how the weak writing ruined a potentially great story, I learned that while the French author has published several books, this is the first one she has originally written in English.<br /><br />If she is wise, it will be the last.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|There are a lot of \\"popular\\" shows that receive awards because of pure hype. While Dexter is award-winning, it's not hype. This show is really that good! What makes this show so great? I think the premise is pretty unique. Dexter is unlike any other character on TV.     That's all I have to add. I'm sure the other 500+ reviews have said everything I would have. :)
076790592X|5.0|One of my favorite books. I've read it several times at different points in my life and each time I take something different away from it.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|What a sleeper of a sci-fi movie! It's way cool, way intense, way intelligent, way well acted and way Spacey--Kevin that it who plays the voice of Hal...I mean, Gerty.<br /><br />Basically, it looks like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey but it's so much more than that. You actually feel like you're on the moon with some terrific scenes of the lunar surface. The light and shadow they work in is simply amazing.<br /><br />Then there's Sam Rockwell's tour de force playing the lone astronaut sent to the moon to man a \\"mining\\" operation up there. I won't spoil it for anyone but he plays his roles (yes, that's with an \\"s\\") far beyond anything you've seen in any evil twin story.<br /><br />Then there's Kevin Spacey's voice. You'll have flashbacks to 2001's Hal but in a better twist he's a helpful robotic voice.<br /><br />The extras too are exactly what you'd want in a DVD. Besides a couple of commentary tracks, we get the rundown on how they created the visual effects (mainly from models and it shows giving the picture a far grittier realism).<br /><br />There's also two Q&A sessions where you'll be confused as to whether they cloned the director Duncan Jones. In the better Q&A at NASA's Space Center in Houston we get far more the nuts and bolts of the film. In this one DJ looks like a roly poly grad student.<br />In the Sundance Festival Q&A with various members of the production crew there's someone channeling Sam Rockwell's character complete with beard and it's DJ. You'll do a double take but that laugh gives him away. That Q&A seemed so much like the usual--dumb questions from moviegoers. Did nothing for me but contrasted with the NASA Q&A it was fun to watch.<br /><br />That's not all. You also get a 28-min. film called Whistle about a contract killer who hits his marks with the help of laser technology...and it has a nice twist. Having said that, the no-lipped actress who played the killer's wife was sheer awful in her role. Could they not have cast someone better?
B004XQO90E|5.0|If you liked Moon you'll definitely love this one. Like Moon this is a mind bending movie forcing you to think to follow along. If you hated Moon you'll hate this one too but that's why movies like Harry Potter and Pokemon were made for :)
B0010T0OCY|3.0|You can read opinions elsewhere as there are 575 of them on .com as I write this. Saw this for the first time in whole in 2010 after Inception came out. I have to say there is stuff in Dark City I thought Inception lifted and did far better especially the creation of these new worlds where buildings arise and fall at night (in Inception case it's in dreams).<br /><br />What doesn't work in this movie is it is too dark--not the theme but the lighting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the title is Dark City but it is hard to see anything on screen at times.<br /><br />Also, what is up with Kiefer Sutherland and what seems like his attempt at a Peter Lorre accent?<br /><br />Felt the story was unique and had legs but the execution of it was, well, the whole thing looked a bit like a made-for-TV movie. I know there are comparisons to Fritz Lang's Metropolis but this movie is not even remotely close to the genius of that man's filmic vision.<br /><br />To top it off the extras are laughable on this version of the DVD. All we get are notes and still pics. It's ridiculously bad. You may have just sent people to a Web site if you were not going to have a \\"making of,\\" etc.
B0030ZOYJ0|3.0|Though I am not an anime fan specifically I always appreciate the fact that they often contain many fascinating ideas and concepts. This one has Judeo Christion slant and involves prophecy. I don`t want to say much more cause I hate to spoil the plot but besides on sexually charged scence this movie could be veiwed by 10 years old an up. There is only 1 part where a parent should standby and hit the fast forward button.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|The case is a little thicker than I like since I often try to keep it in my pocket.  But thicker also means the phone is more protected.  I don't use the screen protector but am glad to have the cleaning cloth.  I was a little concerned that the buttons were exposed but so far that hasn't been a problem.  I can take pictures with it on too.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I admit it, I officially don't get why this book series is getting such good reviews. All I can think of is that it is one of those books that has become 'trendy' to say you have read and you loved. I have just finished the series and can only say it was ok, certainly not great.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this 3 pack too as the first book was awful! The writing was poor, you could see the plot lines coming from a mile off and to be honest there would have been no way I would have read the second. The second book starts off in much the same manner but does improve towards the end. Even then though the plot is do blindingly obvious, you are reading it really to see if you are right rather than because you want to know what happens!<br /><br />In the last book you can again see the result of the war from a long way off but there are a few surprises that make it worth reading. The writing also improved.<br /><br />I guess as a summary I am disappointed this wasn't so much more. Yes it's worth reading, but don't expect a lot of it. Stick with it to the final book if you want to get it at it's best too. I'm not sure if this means I'm recommending it or not! This isn't a book I'll want to reread or will think about now I've finished it. So I guess I would say find something better, but if you're really struggling then give it a go.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|This is an album of very good material. Each song can stand on its own. I know little of Susan or many of the other members of this ensemble, but I know what I like. It's a five star album of musical enjoyment, my only complaint is the overall sound could be better. My copy seems a little subdued and even flat in areas. Overall though I'm very pleased, would recommend it, and look forward to hearing more from this talented family.
B004OR1XGK|5.0|An excellent collection of Best-Practices, perfectly arranged according to the sotware development lifecycle, with clear explanations about what to use when, how and why... Highly recommended for Software Architects, Methodologists, as well as for beginners who wish to understand the \\"Big Picture\\" of Software Engineering, beyond the narrow niche of the code.
0446563048|5.0|This is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone in business- front line employees to senior leadership. It's message is that culture is about everyone and how the company as a whole conducts itself and that doesn't mean from the top down. Sometimes (even often) it's from the bottom up.  I'm reading it for the second time to be able to lead a book discussion group on it and I'm getting so much out of it again. The best review I can offer is that if you are in a company that needs inspiration on how to bring your culture back from the dead, this is the book to do that. It's not a how to because every company needs to figure out what works for them, but there are fantastic ideas and ways to think about culture that are very different from your average business book. (ps. Forget what they told you in school and mark up this book so you can reference it. I kept my highlighter handy and dog earred plenty of pages and it was really worth it!)
B0043RTACU|4.0|Yet another solid Jane Austen classic. Had all the trademarks of typical Austen...a strong heroine, interesting characters, plenty of humor, and misunderstandings that eventually become cleared up for a most delicious ending!
B004P9FAK2|5.0|Do you want to know more about the filming of each film? Then you definitely want to watch this blu-ray.  It is amazing how the different directors took a different view and approach to the making of the movies.
1594744769|3.0|This was a fast read - more like a long short story.  Imaginative concept using real pictures to help narrate the story. I would highly recommend this book for teens and tweens.  It's a story about a young man who searches for the home for children that his grandfather was sent during WW2 to escape the camps.  But all of the children there, including his grandfather, have special physic gifts. This book would appeal to anyone who enjoyed Charlene Harris' \\"Dead\\" series and the Twilight books.
B000ESST6U|5.0|I have enjoyed opera for 60 years and have seen it at major opera houses in America (San Fancisco, Chicago, New York) in England (Covent Garden) and on the Continent (Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Stuttgart, Pisa and others), and I think this is the most imaginative, enjoyable, brilliantly conceived production I have seen. Reviewers concerned with the anomaly at the end must be purists who don't understand England in the war or simply can't enjoy enhuberance. The dance and movement elements throughout are brilliant. A nice discussion of fun on the dvd helps to explain. Buy this. You will watch it again and again as I have. I am sending it as a gift to friends.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This Product was positively Enjoyable.  Everything worked, the disks were in great shape and the story was very enjoyable.      Also the Service and Price including speed of deliver, from Amazon.com was wonderful.  The price went down after I ordered it, and Amazon charged me the LOWER Price, saving me even more.
B0051BVQFG|2.0|If you are looking for a great SciFi movie, like for example:  Independence Day,  Battle: Los Angeles, is not it.  It is more of a war movie fought in and around Santa Monica, Ca.  The camera moves too fast to let your eyes focus on the picture.  Almost like a reality show.  The \\"aliens\\"  resemble somewhat the robot character in Terminator, hard to knock down.  The story seems to have been written very fast and with no thought given to allow enough time to a prelude to an earth invasion.  What can I say, the acting is so, so,  the story even worse.  By the way,  the movie, seems to be somewhat of a copycat of the other scifi movie failure called:  Skyline.  Choose carefully, before wasting money and time in watching something that is not appealing to real scifi fans.
1596177373|3.0|I love Tim Burton, however I do not love these cards. They are truly unique and the artwork is great, but playing with them has been difficult. The numbers and letters are all black [instead of the standard black or red] and the suit is only shown under the letter on face cards. It has caused many errors while playing. You have to be very careful and double check to make sure you're playing the correct colour/suit.

B004EWFUQY|5.0|I started this diet 4 weeks ago, and am very, very pleased with the results.  I lost a lot the first week, and have been losing steadily ever since.  I feel great, and am starting to look much better.  Several friends have also started this diet, with equally favorable results.    I can eat at restaurants pretty easily and can even have fast food in a pinch.  Most restaurants will hold the sauce and substitute side dishes.  So order the meat/chicken/fish, and instead of the potato/rice/past ask for sauteed or steamed veggies.  No restaurant has balked at this yet.  I had an excellent steak and sauteed spinach dinner the other night with friends.  In a pinch, I can go to Burger King, order a double hamburger-plain or grilled chicken sandwich-plain, and remove the bun.  This works when you're on a tight schedule.  Bottom line: this diet fits easily into my life, I don't have to count calories or portions, and the weight is melting off.    For those reviewers who say this is a waste of money--I disagree.  If it works and the reader is successful, it is not a waste at all.  Yes, this is similar to other diets.  The trick is finding the one that works for you.  This one is working great for me!  I hope it works for you too!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The story is compelling. I love the characters. Have since the first book. Tyrion is one of my favorite literary creations of the past 20 years. I still grieve for Eddard Stark. But holy mother of God, Mr. Martin, have them get off their bloody arses and DO something! I do not want to wait another 5 years for A Song of Fire and Ice Vol. VI: Marching Into Tedium.<br /><br />...and another thing. Stop killing off your most beloved main characters. I spend 4000 pages getting emotionally invested in a character only to find out that they were a long term redshirt? It doesn't make me wary of things when it's done too often (and it's done way too often), it makes me feel as if the author has played a really big joke on me and he's the only one laughing. So move the story along already and let someone live.<br /><br />To George's editors: grab your red pencils and do your job. Words are wind. Too much wind is a tornado.

B00457X7XQ|4.0|When I heard that the author of the famed sysinternals suite of system administration programs had written a cyberthriller I couldn't wait to read it.<br /><br />It is a good read, and scary. It could happen -- it really could happen. The author doesn't even go very far, in that he deliberately makes the enemy much weaker than he could have.<br /><br />The book keeps up the pace, and stopping reading in order to eat, sleep and go to work is difficult. The main characters are well drawn, with enough substance to make them belivable and likable. The plot is conventional, but that's not the point. We don't read cyberthrillers for the plot.<br /><br />The main drawback of the book is the presentation of the technical details. The author has made an obviously painful effort to dumb down the technical aspects in order to allow people who are not IT professionals to understand what's happening. Unfortunately this effort went at the same time too far for the IT persons, and, I suspect, not far enough for people who don't know what a registry key is. I would have preferred either the full details (using, for example, a variant of the infamous Sony rootkit which was discovered and analyzed by the very same Mark Russinovich), or no details at all.<br /><br />Then there is the issue of the second half of the book, when the action suddenly morphs from cyberthriller to ordinary guns-and-knives adventure. I don't know what else could have been done, but then I don't write thrillers. It just seemed odd.<br /><br />If you know what a rootkit is and how it works, and you like thrillers, then you will like this book.<br /><br />(Scale: * - unreadable, couldn't finish. ** - bad or very bad, but readable. *** - honest solid work, value for money. **** - very good in its genre. ***** - timeless masterpiece.)
B0055D3EOG|2.0|But in the end it just ended up being another dull, non-scary ghost type story.  For me, it just didn't live up to the hype.  I love movies that make me jump but this just didn't deliver  :(
0553801473|3.0|There's a hilarious scene in Michael Chabon's [[ASIN:0812979214 Wonder Boys: A Novel]], in which pothead author Grady Tripp is confronted by his student Hannah Green about his monstrously overdue and overlong manuscript, which she is the first person to have read. Tentatively, she explains that while the first few hundred pages were amazing, he seems to have lost control of the narrative, especially when he gets into lengthy side narratives about the histories of ancient ruins and the genealogies of minor characters' horses.<br /><br />\\"'Grady,' she said, sounding more than a little horror-struck. 'You have whole chapters that go for thirty and forty pages _with no characters at all_!'\\"<br /><br />Now, I don't know if George R.R. Martin shares Grady Tripps fondness for the good herb, but he definitely shares the core symptom of not being able to make his story smaller, even when that would make it better. And like Tripp, he has an overwhelming fondness for lengthy asides and genealogies of sometimes terrifying detail - though none yet for horses, thank the Seven.<br /><br />Certainly he remains a productive and very gifted writer. I actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons more than most reviewers so far. Hence the four stars, which I know I'm going to get reprimanded for despite writing a pretty critical review. But I did enjoy the book! It's mostly quite well-written, and despite the frequent complaint that \\"nothing happens,\\" is actually packed with events. There are plenty of exciting scenes, some clever plot twists, and a few revelations about ancient mysteries and the motivations of certain key players. The chapters set in the North are particularly good, and I also liked the Tyrion chapters a lot (though I know many other readers did not).<br /><br />The problem is that by the end of the book, the reader feels that the series is no closer to a finale than it was at the beginning. This world Martin's created just seems to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and is now firmly in danger of getting too vast for its own good. And Martin over-indulges in too many of his own equivalents of the genealogies of horses - histories of minor houses, squabbles over tracts of land, and other details that just don't command enough of the reader's emotions.<br /><br />Moreover, many of the newer additions to the population of Essos and Westeros are less interesting than the old ones. I speak of course of the teeming host of Meereenese characters, who all seem have names like Grover zo Snuffleupagus, but whose personalities do not shine through nearly as brightly as their ridiculously colored beards. Martin has an impressive ability to make even his side characters come across as fully-formed people, but with this last book it's pretty clear that he's hit his limit.<br /><br />The first three books of the A Song of Ice and Fire series are about as good as popular fiction gets - whatever the genre. And unlike some, I still hold out hope that Martin can turn the tide and give this series the climax and ending it deserves. But to do that, he's going to have to start making his story smaller rather than bigger, and that's going to require some difficult decisions. But, to quote Hannah Green in the movie of Wonder Boys, that's what writers do. They make decisions.<br /><br />UPDATE: After pondering the book some more, and reading some other reviews by people I respect, I've decided to downgrade this one to three stars. I did enjoy the book in its own right, and continue to think that the frequent complain that \\"nothing happens\\" is rather ridiculous. But the key problem remains that Martin is not making the difficult decisions needed to bring this series to the lively climax it deserves. And more people are watching now than ever before. He needs to fire his editor and kill or compress about half of his POV characters in order to right the ship, and to do those things he's going to need some friendly but unmerciful feedback.
0375703861|5.0|One of Zadie Smith's strengths as a writer is her ability to create characters that are instantly memorable and engaging.  Unfortunately, \\"White Teeth\\" is filled with almost a dozen such creations and every time a new personality enters the novel, one cannot help but be disappointed because this means less time spent with the characters already introduced.  This, however, may be the only complaint about this novel, a sprawling- shall we say epic- novel set (mainly) in England in the late 20th century, a novel whose true main character may be the theme of Personal Identity in the Modern World.<br />  Two families inhabit the novel- The Jones, featuring Englishman Archie, his Jamaican wife Clara, and their marginalized daughter Irie; and the Iqbals, featuring Archie's life long friend Samad and his large family, each of whom responds to being a foreigner in a foreign land in a markedly different way.  Through the actions and reactions of these two families, Smith deals with identity issues- racial, gender, sexual, political- and captures the struggles and successes of the oppressed populations in a melting pot England.  The disparate threads of the individual family members veer off in many directions over the course of its nearly 500 pages, only to come together in a tidy, yet not forced, fashion in the novels satisfying closing chapters.<br />  This book contains many elements- comedy, romance, war memoir, science fiction thriller, family drama- and thanks to Smith's deft writing prowess, the pieces fit together and the tone stays consistent throughout.  This is a stunning debut and a must read for any fan of modern fiction.
B002QAY31Y|5.0|There are lots of brilliant reviews on this product, therefore I'll try not to repeat what has already been written.

B004EPYZSK|5.0|I know it sounds a little bizarre, but this is a Sci-Fi movie where the Aliens attack Cowboys.  Set amidst the desert, magnificent rock formations and canyons of New Mexico, this 2011 release was a hoot!  There is plenty of CGI and action, with Daniel Craig (James Bond 007, etc.) and Harrison Ford (Star Wars, etc.).  This is a good one to see on the big screen with full sound.<br /><br />The 2 hour and 13 minute movie opens with Jake Lonegan/Daniel Craig coming to in the desert.  He does not know who he is or what happened to him.  He is wearing a wide metal armband that he cannot remove, has no boots, and he has a significant wound in his side.  Three men and a dog ride up to him and the men are not very hospitable.  But, not to worry--Jake kicks their collective backsides and rides off with a horse, boots, a change of clothes, and the dog.  In a nearby small town, he finds help with his wound, meets some folks, and renews some acquaintances.  We realize quickly that Jake can take care of himself, too.<br /><br />Also in town, Jake finds out his name, and that he is wanted for murder, mayhem, and a bunch of other stuff.  We find out the town is practically owned by Harrison Ford, the cattleman whose money puts meat on everyone's table.  We also meet Ford's arrogant son, Percy.  Daddy's power and money have obviously gone to Percy's head.  And, we also meet the Aliens, as they begin a seek and destroy mission that grabs a good number of the town's people and takes them away.  Ford and Lonegan and other town folk head out on horseback to see if they can find out what is going on.  Oh yeah, there is a pesky woman following Lonegan, too.<br /><br />I actually saw this movie Friday night.  I loved it so much that when my little boy (age 38) wanted to see it today, back I went!  It was enjoyable and high-action.<br /><br />Note to parents--there is plenty of violence.  Scenes of Aliens grabbing folks and taking them away, Aliens ripping into people with their long ugly fingers, opening folks up, biting through them, and taking out their organs may be sufficient to scare your young children.

0062060554|3.0|I read the sample of the book provided by Kindle and was interested in reading further.  The first chapter hooked me.  Unfortunately, the suspense and the circumstances in which Christine found herself became very trying and unbelievable.  My concern is that the people who \\"genuinely\\" loved and \\"cared\\" for her totally abandoned her without a thought.  The Waring House will not release an address but will release a patient without verification?  Ben remains elusive and Adam suddenly appears?  I was good with the novel until about 60% through and then I read on because I wanted to finish the book.  There were some good narrative descriptions when flashes of memory came to Christine but the drudge of her existence, without questioning beyond those immediately around her, was difficult to imagine.  Would you not want to check old newspapers for an obituary, for a fire, for a marriage or divorce certificate?  Would you trust a stranger who claims to want to help you?  Why would you not \\"run away\\"?  I don't know.  This is like a Lifetime movie, dessert and no main course.
0553801473|3.0|...for the second straight book, turning the series into a song of waiting...and waiting....for something...ANYTHING...to happen, at least with the main characters: Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion. With 'A Feast For Crows,' the holding pattern wasn't nearly as excruciating for me. After the insanity and intensity of 'A Storm of Swords,' it was almost expected that there would be a little breather, the calm after the storm, and the calm before the next storm, while Martin slowly put all his pieces into place.<br /><br />But after another thousand pages, the story has slowed to a near-standstill, and I'm beginning to wonder how necessary these last two novels were, as the majority of events could probably have been covered with about a third of the page count without losing much substance. After page 500 or so in 'Dance,' the timeline moves beyond 'Feast's' timeline, so I looked at the second half as sort of the first book of the second trilogy (with 'Feast' and the first half of 'Dance' providing the bridge between the two), and we all know how non-stop awesome the first trilogy was. In truth, the second half was more of a slog for me than the first half, the story crawling to the finish line, a stark (no pun intended) contrast to previous entries in the series, where the intensity would build and build, culminating in a series of climaxes. But with 'Dance,' once the novelty of being back with my favorite characters for the first time in many years wore off, so did my interest level.<br /><br />It's not ALL bad, however. Martin's descriptive prowess remains in top form here. When he's describing a scene, it's never difficult to picture what's happening, or what the setting looks like, it all flows very well. It just takes Martin twice the page count these days to accomplish this. The chapters are also twice as long as earlier books, but with less plot development, and more descriptions of feasts, everything eaten at the feasts, and what clothes are being worn by the eatersof these feasts. Still, Martin has a way of drawing the reader into his world, and it was nice to catch up with my favorite characters, and spend some time taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of Westeros (and Essos). Martin excels at making you feel as if you're actually there, one of the main reason's why I still consider 'Dance' a pretty good read overall. He also develops the history and mythology of the world in more detail here, giving it a slightly more epic feel, which is definitely a plus.<br /><br />Also, while I found most of the main characters' storylines to be underwhelming (although each had their moments), the book truly shines with the secondary characters' POV chapters, particularly Reek's, Quentyn's, and Bran's (he seems somewhat of a secondary character now). These chapters were very well-written and infinitely more interesting and absorbing, although one could debate just how necessary they are to the main story. I'm split, in that I love my epic fantasies to be EPIC, with as much insight into the world as I can get, but it's beginning to seem as if Martin is losing control over the story, that it's becoming too unwieldy, at least if he's still planning on the series concluding with book 7. Either way, as good as these chapters were, it wasn't enough to put 'Dance' even in the same ballpark as the first three. I'd probably put it on the same level as 'Feast,' though I was more disappointed with this one, as I was expecting so much more. Still, if the final 2 books are anywhere near as good as the first three, it all will have been worth it. There's still time for Martin to turn things around, if he can get off the side roads, back alleys, dirt roads, and switchbacks that lead to nowhere, and get back on the main highway. Here's hoping he can pull it off.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|This tale of a man who relies on his hands to express himself, cellist and encoffiner, begins with an exchange of \\"stone letters\\" between a young Japanese boy and his father.  So among other things, it's a story about touching things --and people.  Death becomes palpable in the viewers' eyes as does food eaten with the same hands that just dressed a corpse.We are touched as well when one of the stone letters reappers in the final scene to tie up an unexplained departure -- and heal it. Another painful separation is aborted by a pregnancy.  Likewise, death itself may not be forever, but merely a \\"gate\\" to the next thing. All quite a touching -- and respectful -- film, deserving of its Oscar.
0307269752|5.0|I am in the final throes of this incredible trilogy and wondered why I ever missed it the first go around!<br /><br />The plots are always intriguing, the writing (while often too detailed) is solid, is the ongoing cast is a group you'd like to take home to dinner.<br /><br />How sad that Mr. Larsson is no longer here to remind us that \\"the wrong shall fail; the right prevail\\".
B003Y5H5A6|4.0|If you've paid attention to the shape of cinema recently, you'd notice that we are sort of living in what we could call \\"The Superhero Age\\" of cinema. Because starting in 2008, anticipation for the upcoming Avengers movie had started with the stellar flick Iron Man, with the mediocre Incredible Hulk following. Then, of course, in 2010 the just as spectacular as the first Iron Man 2 followed, with the credits holding a teaser for Thor, which would come out this year, with Captain America following just a few months later. That, plus Iron Man 2 held plenty of secrets regarding The Avengers.<br /><br />And so me, the comic book nerd I am, waited for every movie with great patience, and voila, they were all great... And believe me, Captain America is a fun as hell movie.  While it may not be as great as Thor, it's still plenty of fun to be had, and it's overall a great time. I was initially worried before this though, because for one it was directed by Joe Johnston. And mind you, I've got nothing against the guy. In fact I gave a 5/5 review of his Wolfman remake. It's just that I was worried he couldn't pull it off, and he did it. Another thing is Chris Evans. I thought he was initially too much a bishonen to be convincing, and he surprisingly pulled it off. So in all, I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />The movie, like Iron Man and Thor before it, is more of an origin story. It takes place in 1942 during the second world war, and Steve Richards, a small and skinny shotaro boy with a laundry list of medical problems, has been dying to join the American army, to help serve, and fight for his country. He has been unsuccessful in every attempt, and furthermore, he is completely jealous of his buddy, who is already in the army. One night, he manages to successfully get in, thanks to the help of a German doctor Abraham Erskine, although it isn't without difficulty in training.<br /><br />However, the handsome and smart, not to mention very tech savvy Howard Stark has a plan for him: a serum that will give him a he'll of a physique, amazing strength, and furthermore turns him into the super soldier under the name Captain America. After this procedure, the transformation into Captain America begins, as he manages to do many things, such as free imprisoned soldiers from the jaws of death, somehow manage to make the smokin' hot British army general Peggy Carter fall for him, and get on the road to overthrowing the evil German doctor Johan Schmitt, who has terrifying plans for the war.<br /><br />So really, let's begin with the fact that the 3D was surprisingly great. I wasn't going to bother since it was filmed in 2D and converted in post, but reading CinemaBlend's review of the 3D and further research that Joe Johnston had 3D in mind from the very early stages and carefully shot each scene for the 3D convinced me. And yes, it is totally worth it. While it's no Avatar or TRON Legacy, this is the best post conversion I've seen since Piranha 3D. Very few films shot in 3D looked better than this, and that's saying something. Maybe I'm over exaggerating, but if this is a sign of things to come for the current boom of 3D, maybe post conversions in the future could look as great as TRON Legacy or Avatar. So yes, do go for 3D!<br /><br />As for the film itself, wow. Great performances abounds in the film. I wasn't expecting Chris Evans to be as great as he was, and boy did he thrill. He had great comedic timing, looked the part, played the role just the way you'd expect Captain America to be played. Tommy Lee Jones was great too, and so was Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. The script is very intelligent and filled with humour, action, and great dialogue too. The action as well, is simply amazing! Why can't all action movies be well shot, with camera shots lasting longer than a few seconds? Transformers, despite 3D, still has the quick shots syndrome, so thankfully the action here did not disappoint.<br /><br />Another surprise is the use of CGis very limited- thank god! The thing about Joe Johnston is that he's been known to use CG sparingly, mixing CG with practical effects. As you could imagine, this film takes place during World War II, and not on Asgard, as well as it doesn't have a man in an iron suit, so for the most part, the effects are practical and in camera. However, when he does use CG, you almost don't notice it, it's that well used. So I gotta say, it's great that we have a blockbuster that makes use of mostly practical effects. Maybe it's just my inner child speaking, as I grew up with a man in a suit playing Chewbacca, or people holding the doors open on the Enterprise to give it the sliding illusion, or Keanu Reeves sitting on a train writing his journal with a map of Europe projected on his face, but I was pleased with this.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, it's that the movie is slow in a few parts, but that is just a teensy quibble. Otherwise, this movie is a fantastic blockbuster, and a sign of things to come for the Avengers. A total recommend, and I also advise you to stay after the credits, as there's a teaser for The Avengers!<br /><br />Overall: 8/10<br /><br />Pros: Captain America is a surprisingly very great superhero action flick, with awesome action and performances by Hugo Weaving and Chris Evans. It also looks great in 3D and makes awesome use of practical effects.<br /><br />Cons: it is slow in the middle, and Dominic Cooper's underuse is just a teensy bit disappointing.Johnston is that he's been known to use CG sparingly, mixing CG with practical effects.

B0034G4P80|3.0|One can't say Kenneth Branagh's Thor isn't ambitious. This adaptation of a comic book based on Norse mythology includes romance, humor, family drama, and lots of special effects. Unfortunately, the film is a confusing mish mash, aspiring to be both more and less than what it is.    The film begins in a New Mexican desert and awkwardly segues into a distant flashback, before moving into a more recent flashback and then back to the present. The recent flashback follows the warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), king of the planet Asgard. Thor's arrogance lands him on Earth many miles from home. Confused and frustrated, he stumbles upon a group of scientists, at least one of whom, Jane (Natalie Portman), is willing to overlook his bizarre behavior and help him find a way home.    One section of this film is set in Asgard, a visual creation both kitschy and beautiful. A much lighter section involves Thor's humorous adjustment to Earth. Yet another section involves S.H.I.E.L.D., a group of government agents who are interested in an unmovable hammer which Odin threw to earth.    The script is an odd mixture of genuinely funny and unintentionally humorous. The social and physical laws that govern Asgard are hardly explained, and the pacing picks up when our hero falls to Earth. The agents are present to connect Thor to other superhero films produced by Marvel, and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s role is entirely unrelated to the plot. However, its scenes are some of the most functional in the movie.    The actors seem to be in several different films. Hemsworth fares well as Thor, seamlessly shifting between several genres. His transformation from cocky to contrite to compassionate is far more believable than his love story. Portman's Jane is cute and her attraction to Thor is understandable, but the film implies that they fall in love without showing us how. Watching them giggle at one another is not particularly gripping.    Kat Dennings, who plays Jane's assistant Darcy, is natural in her delivery of amusing one-liners. Thor's friends, The Warriors Three, seem to have stepped out of a science fiction show, Hopkins is low key as the patriarch, and Renee Russo has a thankless, tiny role as Thor's helpless mother. Colm Feore does his best as Laufey, leader of the blue Frost Giants, and a great Idris Elba plays a seemingly implacable gatekeeper to other worlds.    Most baffling (and, in some ways, interesting) is Thor's brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. He appears to be in five different movies. Loki is almost as important a character as Thor. Too little time is spent with him to completely understand his motivations, but because the audience follows his character, the tricks he pulls feel like tricks on the audience. Alternately calculated and extremely emotional, he is more bizarre than intriguingly ambiguous. Hiddleston gives an expressive, even furious performance, making his campier moments stand out all the more.    Patrick Doyle's soundtrack is stirring. Sometimes its high quality only emphasizes what the film lacks. In the end, Thor's numerous distractions prevent it from either remaining lighthearted or developing its mythological elements. Weighed down by special effects, action, and dumb lines, Thor is an original idea that seems determined to be a mediocre film.

B0034G4P80|5.0|I always thought it impossible to make a good movie out of Thor.    I am not saying that it is bad material, but getting Thor to work on the big screen without making him seem over the top, was never going to be easy.    You have to give credit to Marvel for pulling it off. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and the story is exciting and entertaining. However, it is in the humour stakes that Thor really delivers.    The film is fun and often makes you laugh.    Great entertainment.

B002ON5ATC|4.0|I will be the first to admit that I am no expert on classical music (I do, however, know what I like). As a listener of classical music, this is an excellent recording of Brahm's Symphony Cycle. I do own the Karajan cycle and it too is very, very good. But in my opinion, neither eclipses the other-they are different and that is as it should be.    The Rattle interpretation is truly a romantic's version. Lush, full, tender...beautiful in execution. The playing by the Beliner Philharmonicker is exquisite. I believe this orchestra to be one of the finest - if not the finest in the world.    Karajan's Brahms is more forceful (A wall of sound). It is a different Brahms and it too is a valid interpretation. I am happy I own both to enjoy. Isn't that why we purchase different versions of the same composer's work? To hear how a conductor and the orchestra interpret the work.    I personally like the first symphony. I know this is a rarity among most people who listen to the cycle, but it speaks to me on a personal level that I am not sure I can articulate. Suffice to say, I have listened to this recording many times...I find it moving. This is a the way I like it played...passionate, tender, emotive direction and playing.    In conclusion, this is currently the go-to Brahms symphony cycle for me. It is extremely well recorded. I am very happy with my purchase. If you enjoy Brahms, this is an excellent choice. I am currently mulling over getting the CSO's interpretation of these works. Ah, the choices we music lovers have to make. I can honestly say my choice to purchase this set was a rewarding one.     Enjoy the music....
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Stick with it and you will be glad you did.  To be honest I read this book because my wife recommended it.  About a quarter of the way I thought about putting it down but by half way I couldn't stop reading it.  I have never read a book that evoked as much feeling as this one did.  There were a few parts where I laughed out loud, parts where I became mad and felt the characters frustration, and of course the very sad parts.  Some critics argue the author obviously has no idea how a dog would think and it is totally unrealistic, my response to that is, \\"and you do know how a dog thinks?\\"  Also a few have criticized it for being completely boring and only read a few chapters.  Well if you only read a few chapters what are you doing on here reviewing the book?  As being one who finished the book, I can assure you, it does begin slow but picks up drastically to a point where I could not put it down.  GREAT BOOK!

0307278255|5.0|As other reviewers have reported, Lahiri's prose is simple, and never draws attention to itself.  She writes about the world of Indian expatriates to the West and their relationships with westerners.  Her characters live and grow, suffer and love.  I've read many books about Asian immigrants to the US, including Lahiri's celebrated earlier books, which were terrific.  But this book made me laugh and cry.  The strengths and limitations of Indian families are brilliantly examined.<br /><br />The book has all of the strengths of both novels and of short stories.  the author achieves greater depth in afifty page story than many great novelists do in 300.  There are romances, sibling relationships, parent-child tragedies, and modern roommate situations.  I love reading books set in places I know very well, and Lahiri returns often to Central Square Cambridge, and other places in the Boston area.  Her sense of place is also used to advantage in Italy.<br /><br />Her writing is calm but intense.

1433210428|5.0|This book has information I hadn't seen anywhere else and the author interpreted his experience well.  Frankl was sincere in his account and lucid explanation of the search for meaning.  I intend to listen to this book (I got the CD format) many more times.    Because there was so much information that was new to me, I really have to listen again.  For example, Frankl said sensitive individuals tended to last longer in the concentration camp that less sensitive inmates.  This is exactly the opposite of what I expected.  The reason given is that sensitivity helped people to retreat to an inner spiritual life and thereby provided strength.      Frankl's views on the importance of love stands out.  He felt that it was the strongest force in our world and through it we would in a sense never really die.  He discovered this in a time when he would talk to his wife while suffering in the camp.  He had no way of knowing his wife had been killed already, and he felt her presence as if she were alive.  To do this point justice, I'd have to quote Frankl verbatim and at length.    One of the lasting impressions of the story and the interpretation has to do with the futility of trying to control one's fate as opposed to being true to one's innermost feelings.  At several turns, Frankl would have perished if he had taken choices that seemed correct for purposes of survival and yet didn't feel right to him.      I recommend this book to every one, because we all suffer since there is no escape from suffering.
034552554X|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book, so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be really good.<br /><br />The characters were all really interesting and well developed. I only had issues with the main character being wishy-washy towards the end, but maybe that's just me and maybe someone who grew up the way she did has a right to be unable to make decisions. For the situations, a lot of the main characters actions seemed really realistic. Sometimes I feel exactly the opposite, but when I feel like screaming at a character because it seems like they've really done what they've done, the book is a pretty good one.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about this book without giving away things, so much happens. I will say that it gets you pretty good in the beginning, holds on well through the whole middle, and grips you in the end.

0439023513|2.0|Okay, first of all, I absolutely loved the first two books. While I initially blew The Hunger Games off as an overhyped kidsy-type YA book from Suzanne Collins (I wasn't too fond of her Gregor series...decent adventure, but groan-worthily cliche and depth-lacking), it ended up surprising me. I loved the ever-present feeling of danger, excitement, brutality, and the young protagonists' developing cunning, relationships, divided loyalties, etc. The second book was a thrill ride too, and I felt as if the characters were really taking off somewhere. Here were two books with straightforward language that matched the survival-bent atmosphere of the story, a reasonably likable female protagonist who wasn't a complete Mary-Sue, and a killer cliffhanger. So Mockingjay should have blown me away, right?    Actually, I'm not sure why the five-star reviews are raving about the brilliant conclusion, the emotional hits of the deaths, or the realistic war-zone depictions in this book. Maybe I was just utterly disappointed after two books I suddenly found myself in love with after severe doubts, but I felt that everything in this book was very different-and not in a very good way either.    One huge thing that annoyed me was the shallow way in which major and minor characters alike were killed off. People I loved throughout the series could tragically die, and I couldn't feel a shred of emotion except irritation. It was as if a bad fanfiction writer had decided to write some sort of heartwrenching death scenario for the some character. Of course, the other characters react and all, but as a reader I just didn't get to feel intimately in the story enough to feel anything. So the deaths were clumsily dealt with. I'm pretty sure several of them weren't even necessary. Not to the plot, character development, or anything at all...I'm pretty sure the author was just trying to evoke devastated emotions in the readers with \\"realistic\\" examples of war. It didn't work well.    Also, ~SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!~------------------------------  Katniss became a spineless loser. I'm not sure what I was holding my breath for. Maybe I was hoping for a breakthrough? A swell of strength? Standing up like a heroine is supposed to, especially at the climax of a trilogy clearly about teenagers stuck in an oppressive, merciless world? Um, no. So instead of doing any of that, Katniss just gets drained, like she really needs a nap, and just kind of...gives up. Sure, there's a couple of last-minute save-the-operation attempts, but they feel weak and fainthearted, based on reasons that seem more superficial than heart-swellingly powerful and worth standing up for. And the end! I'm not hating on it because it's \\"depressing\\". It's not even well written. In fact, I feel like, by the end, the main conflict is never entirely resolved or explained. Not clearly, anyway. And it's not in a way that's intended to reflect the confusions and realistic chaos of war. No, just no. It feels like an itch behind your back that you just can't quite reach, and so the semi-happy ending comes out forced, fake, and defeated. A lot of things fell flat, especially Katniss's transformation into Peeta (who's really just her only choice, and not true love at this point)'s broken, compliant baby-maker. What a disappointment.    So read it if you must, because the cliffhanger from Book 2 was harsh. But don't hold your breath for anything too epic. If you're into the whole dystopian-crash-after-exciting-thriller-brimming-with-promise kind of thing, then by all means go ahead.

B004DK5CYM|2.0|Disney has control of the greatest of all documents of the legend of Secretariat - the thrilling ESPN SportsCentury documentary commemorating the '35th greatest athlete of the 20th Century'. It is an outrage to not have this included in the extras for this DVD, and a criminal act to have no footage of the real Secretariat at all. I assume that one of the motivations of Randall Wallace, et. al. in making this was to introduce him to young people, but the archiving of this film with nothing else means Secretariat is no more real to my eight year old horse-loving daughter than Mr. Ed is.    I enjoyed the movie in the theater - despite a few contrivances, it was marvelous to watch a movie where none of the characters are evil. It should be rented only - Disney should be punished in the marketplace for such lazy packaging.
B004IFYN2Y|5.0|The video and audio on this blu ray are excellent. What really bears comment if the film itself.  \\"Fair Game\\" is the true story of Valarie Plame Wilson, a covert CIA agent and her husband, former ambassador  Joe Wilson.  Leading up to the 2003 war in Iraq, was the concern that Saddam Hussein was gearing up to produce nuclear weapons.  And at the request of the Vice President's office, the CIA asked Joe Wilson to go on a fact finding trip to Niger (the presumed location of the purchase by Iraqi agents of a form of uranium called \\"yellow cake\\").  Wilson was previously an ambassador under Presidents GHW Bush and Clinton and knew the area well. His findings were in fact that rumors of such purchases were false and he reported such.    When GW Bush launched the war against Iraq, the rationale was based principally on the Iraqi possession of such weapons of mass destruction.  When that lie was perpetuated by Bush in his State of the Union address (the now infamous \\"sixteen words\\"), Joe Wilson spoke out in a Op-ed piece in the Washington Post.  And from that point on, members of the Bush administration, from Dick Cheney on down, sought to discredit Joe Wilson by exposing his wife (Valarie Plame Wilson) as a covert CIA operative.  And they further attempted to assassinate the character and reputation of both by claiming that his wife had sent Joe Wilson on the trip as a junket.    The official records are now clear (after the Fitzgerald investigation and the indictment of Scooter Libby) that Joe Wilson was telling the truth as he exposed one of the biggest lies in the history of U.S. foreign policy one that lead to biggest foreign policy disaster since the Vietnam war----namely the Iraqi war.  Libby was convicted of  lying and obstruction of justice.  Bush took care of his own by commuting Libby's sentence, but he did not pardon him.    This film is a story of patriotism and bravery; and it also the story for abuse of power, treachery and deceit.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|We have the entire series of movies and will buy the last one as well, but this one was particularly well done and included all the pertinent details.
B00386EZJU|5.0|One of two soundtracks I have ever bought. Wow. WOW. I can't--I almost can't describe in words how wonderful I find this soundtrack.    The movie was amazing, but I can honestly say that without the soundtrack, it would have been mediocre.    Just listening to a snippet of \\"Test Drive\\" gives me full-body chills. Another reviewer mentioned that it captures the feeling of flight--absolutely. And that feeling is joy. Pure, clean, unadulterated joy. Close your eyes and you're soaring through the clouds, wind rushing past, nothing beneath or above you, just air and joy. It's just a sublime experience to listen to this soundtrack.    There's excitement. Heart-racing, fast movements that make you feel ready to leap out of your seat and run or fight, ready to ACT! There's sorrow, fear, worry. There's delight and passion. There is an entire world in this soundtrack.    I'm having trouble writing this review. I'm listening to the soundtrack now and I don't want to type, just listen with a huge smile on my face. Why even read this review? Why read any review? Take your time, instead, and listen to any of the amazing tracks on this CD.    There you go.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Even though this story is partly about three little girls, boys will enjoy the action sequences and the villains.  A few scenes may be a bit scary for the little ones, so use your best judgement there.  Some people may not appreciate the sarcasm from the girls and attitude of \\"the bad guys\\", but it's a comedy.  Don't take it too seriously!    I thought the movie was OK the first time I saw it, but it gets better with repeat viewings, with lots of funny little details.  My parents and single siblings even enjoyed it.    The audio & video are perfect and show off your system, if you care about such things.  It's definitely worth paying extra to watch it in blu-ray.    Highly recommended.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|This book was funny for the first few chapters, then I got bored.  It wasn't bad, but I just got tired of her humor.  I loved Mean Girls and 30 Rock is the best, but I wasn't impressed.  If you are looking for a funny book, I recommend \\"Lies that Chelsea Handler Told Me\\". It was great!
0061765236|4.0|This book was an extremely interesting read. I couldn't put it down. I kept waiting to see what would happen. I found myself connected to the characters and really wondering what they were feeling and thinking. Jodi Picoult has a gripping writing style.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies.  I have watched it countless times and enjoy it each time.  I recommend this film to anybody who likes dancing, dry comedy, and love stories.
B004L49K20|5.0|One of the best duran duran albums since Rio.There is exactly back of old sound in this album.I mean it is a combination of their first 3 albums.Of course their sound has modernized for present time.AYNIN has really become their best album.All songs are great on album.Especially \\"Being Followed\\",\\"Girl Panic\\",\\"Mediterrania\\" and<br />\\"The Man who stole a leopard\\" are my favourites.Highly Recommended.10 of 10 marks !!!
B00003XACV|5.0|This soundtrack is thus far one of only two soundtracks I've ever purchased in my life. Movie soundtracks, at their best, complete a movie and enhance the watching experience. This soundtrack does that, but it also functions as an amazing listening experience on its own.    To anyone who thinks it sounds immature or simple, I say that you obviously judge music only by its complexity. Have fun missing out some amazing stuff.    To review this, I have to refer to my own specific experience. Each track made me emotional. The emotions invoked changed with the tracks, but generally, I felt joy, apprehension, anticipation, curiosity and sorrow all at once, blended together in this wonderful, overwhelming feeling. At the same time, I find the music incredibly calming and relaxing.    The movie is great, but the soundtrack is amazing. This CD marks a rare collection that I will listen to while doing nothing else. Really, really good music doesn't serve just as a background distraction or accompaniment to another task. It's an experience in itself, and this soundtrack does just that.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I use this cable with my iPad 1 and it works great for those apps that support it.  It makes me want to get the iPad 2 so I can use the cable with everything (like the Xfinity and Netflix apps, which do not work with IPad 1 + this cable).
3836527286|4.0|The book is beautiful in both size and content. Once again, Taschen delivers an extraordinary product at a great price. Pictures are of a very decent size and quality as is the book itself. I wish the written content could have been a little more in depth, and the only thing I did not quite like was the quality of the paper in which the book cover was printed on. To make a comparison, this book is of much higher quality -and more elegant- than The Beatles Anthology book. Just wished I had the money for Paul's signature.
0307463745|5.0|p.77 Decisions are progress...you can't build on top of \\"we'll decide later,\\" but you can build on top of \\"Done.\\"<br /><br />Don't wait for the perfect solution.  Decide and move forward.  You want to get into the rhythm of making choices.  When you get in that flow of making decision after decision, you build momentum and boost morale.<br /><br />The problem comes when you postpone decisions in the hope that a perfect answer will come to you later.  It won't.  You're as likely to make a great call today as you are tomorrow.<br /><br />p.80 What makes a museum great is the stuff that is not on the walls.  Someone says no... Its the stuff you leave out that matters.  So constantly look for things to remove, simplify, and streamline.  Be a curator.  Stick to what is truly essential.  Pare things down until you're left with only the most important stuff.  The do it again.  You can always add stuff back in later if you  need to.<br /><br />p.22 Why grow?  What is wrong with finding the right size and staying there?  Why is expansion always the goal?
B003Y5H542|5.0|Rango is really different from other animated features that I've seen. The characters and the settings are bizarre and the story is full of references to other movies (especially westerns). Rango is an animated western in which the main character wants to find who he really is and what part does he play in the world. The story is amazingly told. All the comedy, the adventure, the dialogue is very original and smart. I have to say that when I first saw the ads for this movie, I wasn't interested but after seen it in theaters, I absolutely love it. This film may not be for little kids and I mean that in a good way. It's refreshing to see an animated film were adults can enjoy it as much or even more than kids. Kids from 8 onwards will definetely enjoy it.<br /><br />The characters are really odd as the whole movie is, but that enhances the story. The animation done by ILM is amazing. It's the first animated film they produce and already are in the level of the Pixar films. Simply excellent. The voice cast is really good with Johnny Depp being outstanding as the titular lizard. Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty and Bill Nighy are excellent as well. The story is very interesting and will keep you invested the whole time and there are a lot of references from other films that will make you laugh. The score by Hans Zimmer is outstanding. Gore Verbinsky has done and incredible motion picture and I wouldn't be surprised if this one is a front runner for the Oscars. Is really that good.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />Paramount has done an impressive job with this BD. Simply put it, this BD is the best looking of this year and one of the best ever. All the detail, the clarity, the contrast, everything is perfect. The animation comes to life like never before and the colors are extremelly well reproduced. An incredible transfer!!!<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also absolutelyu gorgeous. Sound effects are crisp, dialogue is clear and there are not distortions of any type. Amazing sound!!!<br /><br />Bonus Feautures:<br /><br />First you have two versions of the film: the theatrical release and an extended edition with some additional scenes. Also you have a documentary of the whole production of the film which is amazing. Full animated deleted scenes which are the ones included in the extended version including an extended ending. Also you have an interactive tour around the town of Dirt, a \\"Animal Planet\\" type program that explains which animals are included in Rango, the theatrical trailer, an audiocommentary and a storyboard to film comparison.<br />All the bonus material is excellent and fun to watch.<br /><br />A DVD and a Digital Copy are also included.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />With amazing animation, a great story, interesting characters and witty dialogue, Rango was a very pleasant surprise. This BD offers truly amazing video and audio and a great amount of bonus material making this set a wonderful one for a wonderful film.

0783114222|1.0|Three of the disks would not play on three different dvd players. I made sure that I had not ordered the Bluray version by mistake. The disks were supposedly new in the package, there was no reason for them to be defective. Had to return them.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this app a few times a day.  It&apos;s nice to be in Chicago and be able to listen to KDHX St. Louis anytime. The alarm clock feature has been great and I have never really had any force closing issues with this.\n
0847835073|5.0|This lavish volume of photographs of Italian model/actress Monica Bellucci was apparently produced by Ms Bellucci herself and features a plethora of full page photographs of her taken over the course of her career (to date) by a wide seleciion of noted fashion & art photographers. The very first image in the book (the only non-photographic image of her) is provided by Italian erotic 'cartoonist' Milo Manara presenting Monica as a renaissance beauty in the Boticelli tradition. Monica next reproduces her 2 earliest 'professional' photos at age 13 (she was cute!) and then heads into the bulk of the artful photographs taken of her over the years by a literal 'who's who' of the glamour photography world. Personally I was more interested in the pix of Monica than the 'photographers' and I would report that this book presents a satisfying range of images of this exquisite Italian beauty. A majority of the photos are in artful black & white, but there are some color examples as well and several tasteful nude studies are included. Bellucci has a timeless beauty that, similar to her predecessor Sophia Loren, has continued to develop as she has matured. For fans of Monica this is a treasure trove of classic imagery.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was really young. I've been afraid of clowns ever since I saw IT for the first time, but I can watch it over and over without getting tired of it. I have always been a big fan of Stephen King, and this is my all time favorite. :)
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie was amazing.  Cher was wonderful and Christina is a great actress, dancer and singer.  Own this movie today!
1439163146|5.0|I was so excited to read this book and once I did, I absolutely loved it. The fact that James Franco wrote it makes it even more interesting to me. He is a very talented person, not just in movies, but as an author as well. I love that each story is about troubled teenagers because most teens who are in high school might be able to relate with the short stories. It is especially good for those who live in the Bay Area of California, because it is where the stories take place. Overall, I definitely enjoyed reading this book and I will totally be reading it again.
0385342039|5.0|I have read many of Sophie Kinsella's books and have enjoyed them all. This one is is a little slow but once I got a few chapters in, I really got into the book.  It was funny, quirky and enjoyable to read.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This is by far one of the best action films I have seen in my 30 years of life. Stallone assembles the best action cast to date and everyone performs masterfully. This film is action from beginning to end, and it does so without taking shortcuts using CG and it keeps the plot going the entire movie as well. A truly masterful movie designed for the real men and those ladies that like to get a bit dirty. The fact that a sequel is in the works is quite telling as well. Definitely worth owning in my humble opinion.
1451629184|4.0|I will say this is a good read and definitely very interesting. It feels real in the sense that it jumps straight in to the story and perhaps it is the use of present tense that adds an extra level of realism to the recount.    [SPOILER]    One issue I had with reading this was the evaluative tone of Dugard and how she makes subtle attempts to blame other people for her lack of rescue. eg. early in the book she talks about the parole officers who come to the house to check things out. She implies that they failed to do their job properly but only later on in the book does she disclose that she actually spoke to the parole officer(s), but lied to them to protect Phillip.     Only towards the end of the book did she disclose that she had access to the internet and was even sending emails to people, went shopping in public etc etc. I don't know why she would want to criticise anyone else's efforts to unfold the situation when she made such blatant attempts to make herself continue undiscovered.    I've thought about this a lot and I guess my conclusion is that she was stolen at such a young age and could have been brainwashed into not wanting to leave. My only point is that she shouldn't be overly judging other people's actions when she tried her best to stay quiet and ignore any opportunities to escape.
B000V5TV22|3.0|The driver software included with this GPS reciever is unstable when using Windows 7. I tried both the version on the cd-rom that came with the unit and the newer version downloaded directly from the manufacturers web site. Since the GPS data stream is serial data, the driver software is suppose to create a virtual comm port. It does that justy fine. EXCEPT GPS data is suppose to stream at 4800 baud rate. That's the industry standard. The driver ALWAYS defaults to 9600. That means you have to manually reset the baud rate to 4800 before the GPS receiver can communicate with whatever navigation software you're using. And everytime you restart your computer the baud rate gets reset back to 9600. So you must manually reset the rate each time you turn on the computer.     The manufacturer's forum has PAGES of customer input about having trouble using this GPS with Windows 7, but virtually nothing about problems with XP or Vista. So I suspect that the unit and driver work fine with those versions of Windows. Too bad I didn't check the forum until I was having trouble.     I'm not panning the receiver completely because once you do get the baud rate issues taken care of, the unit is as accurate and fast as any other GPS I've used.
0321200683|4.0|I should preface this review off with the fact that I have not read the entire book.  I had specific areas I wanted to look into and this book was highly recommended, so I picked it up.<br /><br />Wow... this thing is literally a bible. It not only has the colored chapter divisions indicated on the end of the page (so you can see what chunks of pages are chapters without opening the book), but also has... not one... but TWO ribbon bookmarks.  The authors were smart to put two of those babies in, because you tend to do a bit of skipping around, since a lot of the topics are related.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found the text to be highly legible and breakdown complicated concepts very nicely.  You can read the book synopsis on Amazon if you want a review of the topics... I am merely going to endorse the fact that this book covers a great depth of material on the subject of messaging in a very clear manner.  It should be on the bookshelf of every enterprise software architect.<br /><br />Go buy it.
B004XE0P5E|1.0|Is this a joke.?? Is this the reincarnation of Tiny Tim ??? What a poor excuse for a falsetto. Good lord this is bad.
B005AUWY2W|3.0|From an adult who watches kid's movies, it was enjoyable. It's an animated action movie. They brought James Bond and Fast and the Furious into the Cars world. It had Pixar's high quality animation and voice acting, but I think they missed their target audience. The first Cars movie was about being loyal to your friends and those who have supported you, doing whats right, and not always thinking about just yourself. Cars 2 lacks this morale center. It's just an action film in Cars clothing. There is a subtle plot line about McQueen being embarrassed by his rustic friend and how he should accept him for who he is, and Mater learning that the world sees him as an idiot and his need to prove his self-worth, (as well as a political commentary about alternative fuels and big oil companies) but these plots are likely missed by young children (and probably many adults).     If you don't care if there is a lesson to be learned, its a great film. Enjoyable for all ages. If you believe that children learn social skills from their entertainment and see their movie heroes as behavioral models, they aren't going to gain much from this movie.

B001AQR3IU|5.0|This movie has enough of the elements of classic fairy tales to seem familiar, but enough plot twists to avoid predictability. Fun, humorous and romantic.
0671027344|4.0|Coming of age amidst depression tale; Charlie relates his life in letters; detailing his family, friends, everyday issues and hinting at sexual abuse.  It's an engaging book and a worthwhile read.
0307595862|5.0|Among the best crime novels I ever read, if not the best, the author has exacted layers over layers of mystery and unending twists and turns. The playing with the array of characters embedded in a background of a whodunit scheme was executed so skillfully that my jaw dropped. The structure of the novel was also worth to note. I have enjoyed it a lot.

B004EPYZUI|3.0|I had such big hopes for this film but I was really let sown. Dont get me wrong a few of the fantsy sequences are amazing but the rest of the film was a little boring. And the ending was totally stupid. Zach I hope the next film will be better.
B004ZBFRTY|1.0|this is for those curious about the blu ray edition, first off, i love this movie and i owned the previous blu ray edition which was not in high defintion either so when i read about this and heard it actually was to be converted in true high definition this time, i was stoked and shelled out the mere $16 just to again find out its the exact same disc used as the previous \\"blu ray\\" edition. Sadly the only thing new to this package is the digital copy and a standard dvd copy...i wish i would have just kept my older copy, at least it had a cooler cover design
0764141201|5.0|Others have aptly described the contents of this book, but I would like to join in the chorus about the book's popularity with students.  I taught ESL at the university level for over 20 years and never found a book as popular as this one for the teaching of vocabulary. Now I'm teaching as a volunteer at my church where all of our students are Spanish speakers. Because of the high number of cognates in English and Spanish, many Spanish speakers can adjust their ear a bit, making it possible to recognize those words which we share in common from the Latin heritage of the old Roman Empire and the lingering influence of Latin throughout the Middle Ages. However, they struggle with the Anglo-Saxon component of English vocabulary, which is huge and still the basis of daily conversation in English. This book was actually discovered by one of my students, who is now a U.S. citizen with about ten years of residency here. I hesitantly started using it as in all my years of ESL I never did vocabulary this way, but this book has been a huge hit with all of the students who have seen it. They asked me to order them copies from Amazon and have even asked me to order one for friends who do not attend the class! One woman has a college-age son who has graduated from high school in the U.S. and has attended some college classes. She says he is often hard to motivate where study is concerned, but he loved the book so much he told his mom he wanted to keep it and could she please buy another one for herself! Every week they say how much they are learning from this book. They are assigning themselves homework from the book and sharing with each other what they learned on their own throughout the week.  On numerous occasions they have said they have heard their boss use one of these phrases but never knew what it meant before and, thus, regard the book as a lifeline. Despite the long time they have been in the U.S., they were not conciously aware of the phrasal verb concept and, as a result, had been focusing on the lexical word rather than the particle/preposition, which, of course, is what makes the meaning of the word. The hour and a half flies by when we use this book. Once they catch the meaning of the word, they love to share examples from their own lives of incidents where a phrasal verb would aptly express what happened. In short, if you have hesitated with this book because you think it might be dry or unorthdox in methodology, it would certainly at least be worth a try. Every Sunday as I'm driving to the class, I am confident we will have a good lesson with the content of this book.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|I may not be old enough to have enjoyed the very beginning of Star Trek when it first debuted, but thanks to my parents' love of the series I've seen more than my fair share of the older episodes.<br /><br />It is very hard to do a \\"reboot\\" of such a loved series, but I believe that J.J. Abrams did a marvelous job. Abrams and his casting department were spot on with all of the main characters. Zachary Quinto was a fabulous Spock, from his looks down to the way he phrased his lines and his mannerisms. Chris Pine was able to portray the cocky Kirk while still making the audience love the character. Although these two actors were great, my favor was Simon Pegg as Scotty. He is such a brilliant comedic actor.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams stuck to some of the original ideas/jokes that the main series had - like killing off a red shirt. The only thing in the movie that made me say \\"Hey! No! that cannot happen!\\" is when ****SPOILER ALERT*** future Spock met present day Spock.<br /><br />I loved how Abrams developed the characters from when they were children. I think it gave the characters a depth that hadn't been explored thus far.<br /><br />All in all I would definitely recommend buying this DVD. The special add-ons are a huge plus. I know that I've watched all of the specials at least twice, maybe three times.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful and that you end up enjoying this version of Star Trek as much as I have...and still am!!
0689815816|5.0|I am a Pediatric Occupational Therapist who uses this book during our summer program. We use a different theme every week with the children and during our camping week, I use this to make an obstacle course to go along with the book. First use a holla hop hung from the ceiling with streamers hanging from it for the grass. balance beam over the blue paper to be the river. Half moon rubber like disks to simulate the squelchy mud. Make a forest of trees to stumble trip thru. Use a bubble machine to go thru the whirling snowstorm and at last get to the dark cave they crawl into and find the bear.    This is such a fun book both my boys loved when growing up! I continue to love the book and use it as a great sensory motor activity for the children as they venture thru the story themseleves.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Tron:Legacy may not have pleased every movie fan. And Daft Punk's score let down a few of their fans. But if you(like me) love film scores, I have to say this one keeps getting better the more I hear it.   Their use of strings is some of the best we've gotten from the recent crop of new film composers, but the album still retains their signature electronic mastery.  There are hints of vintage Herrmann in here. Plus a little nod to Blade Runner. This is a great first score for Daft Punk.  The 2CD set(which I bought here on Amazon), is a nice addition to any collection. The 2nd disc, however, is rather short, with only 5 extra tracks. The addition of 'Castor' is great.   The best stuff is to be found on the 1st disc, which is exactly the same as the American version. This CD isn't tinted black and the cover is not glossy.  Overall, I would say the Special Edition is not necessary(it is rather expensive), unless you've got to have it all.  Hope to see an Ultimate Edition someday.

I am enjoying these Series of TV shows very much since I am a product of the 1950's, and things shown in these episodes really are quite accurate as to the degradation of women, and all of the BS which went on and goes on in the work place.
0553801473|1.0|We all know that names sell books and authors/editors are always tempted to fill the bookshelves with mediocre stuff...it is the case, nothing happens. The characters wander without direction strongly suggesting thatbthe author does not really know what to do to fill another book before finishing. As Brienne in  Feast of Crows the characters go around without getting anywhere. Worst, The thing I most liked in the series, that characters actually die, has completely disappeared. Now everybody is saved at the last moments, Catelyn, Davos, Brienne, Asha Greyjoy...they all seem to die and then reappear...<br />My advice, wait to the next one and if you are an extra fan wait a couple of months to get this second hand, there will be lots available
091581112X|5.0|I originally owned \\"Spiritual Growth- Being your Higher self\\" in the early 90's, and was so impressed with it that I lent it to a girlfriend. If I remember rightly, after ranting about some of the wonderful experiences I had whilst using it as a guide in meditation.<br />The girlfriend and I needless to say drifted apart and I lost my beloved Book. I can't even remember which girlfriend it was, but I have never forgotten the Book.<br />I now have a new copy, and I am not lending this to anyone. And I have to say that re-reading it really has felt like I have found an old friend.<br />Basically it is a manual to connecting to your higher self, we all have one. And some simple techniques described by Sanaya Roman, (as a channel for Orin, her spirit guide), can assist you to see life beyond our present existence and connect with an inner wisdom, and that can answer so many of the questions that we all have.<br />I cannot recommend this book enough...<br />******(Six Stars)
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I am enjoying the story, however it is very confusing.  I often don't know if the author is talking about a street, a town or a persons name.  The plot is good and suspenseful and the main characters are great especially Hole.  However I do not enjoy the read because I have to go back so many times.  Or i just wing it.  I know it was translated and I will not get another book like that again.  It reads like this \\"he was but there in the room\\"...What?  Ok i get it he was in the room.haha  I read a lot but the names of  almost everything is very foreign to me.  So I never really know where there going.  Put this all aside..The story is great and Hole is a character worth reading about.
0671027344|4.0|In an age where we all may have forgotten what high school was like comes this thrilling tale of Charlies adventures through his first year of high school. I found this book very fascinating from start to finish. I bought the book because I had read great reviews and I had seen that a movie was being made starring Emma Watson. I was curious, and was not let down. Charlie's every emotion is set into writing as he writes letters retelling about the many journeys that he makes. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a new type of book to read!

While I am aware that some reviewers have criticized him for not citing social science data to back up many of his assertions, I counter that there isn't much hard data to be had at the moment -- or at least there wasn't when Qualman wrote this book back in 2009. What he had to go on were his own observations and the anecdotes of others, and given that I think he did a fine job of framing for novice readers the importance of social media and how it might be applied to business situations.<br /><br />Originally, social media was pretty much confined to a younger demographic, which used it to build friendships (Friendster) and share music (MySpace). As the technology expanded to more groups of people, bigger and better social platforms came along, the most obvious being Facebook and, eventually, Twitter. The only information available about these applications came from participants and early adopters (Clay Shirky, for instance) who quite literally saw what was going on and explained it to the rest of us. While Qualman did come a bit late to the early-adopter party, it is in this tradition that he wrote Socialnomics.<br /><br />So, having served as an apologist for Qualman, let me now say why I like his book. First, it's written in simple, jargon-free prose that makes it easy to see how social media phenomena might apply to one's business or nonprofit group. Second, he tells some good stories that illustrate the effects of social media in the longer term, beyond just real-time entertainment. Finally, he makes it quite clear that resistance to this new form of communication is futile and that those organizations that don't jump in the pool are going down (so to speak). I like his direct language and entertaining tone.<br /><br />We're half way through 2011 as I write this, but if you are still one of those people who hasn't started using social media in your work, Socialnomics remains a very good first resource.Socialnomics remains a very good first resource.

B004A8ZX2S|1.0|Grass grows faster than this so-called tree of life. An abusive father, a whacko kid, a script that is non-existent and a story line (it does not exist) that redefines \\"nonsequitur.\\" This movie is horrible. What if \\"they\\" wrote a movie script that was the worst ever and put two big names in and dared themselves to see if people were stupid enough to go to the big movie because of star power. Here it is. 75% of the people in the theater I was in walked out by half-time! Save your money. Go see Captain America.Tree of Life is depressing and down right terrible!
B004XQO90E|5.0|Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself in the middle of a conversation with a beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) he finds himself on a commuter train to Chicago. 8 min. later he is dispatched by an explosive. Once again he wakes up to find himself disoriented and being interrogated by an Air Force officer (Vera Farmiga). It seems that he has a mission and will relive those same 8 min. over again until he completes the objective. However Colter may have objectives of his own. As the story unfolds with Colter and the people he interacts with get closer to both objectives we go along for the ride.<br /><br />As you know there are several movies out there with the same theme is time or the essence of time being allowed to change over again so that you can right your mistakes. This movie of course is one of them. It may not be set apart from a lot of other movies that you seem with similar themes; however it is excellent in both visuals and story setting. You will not be disappointed in taking the time to view this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't say much here, except WOW! Read this book. It's wonderful regardless of your preferred genre.<br /><br />On the technical side: I love the fluid use of present tense and first person. I've read few books that do that as brilliantly. On the artistic side: The characters are beautifully created and brought to full-blooded, realistic life. The inner workings of Katniss are presented in such a way that anyone can see themselves as her, facing the unspeakable, staring down the challenges, defying those who deserve defeat.<br /><br />Yowza! - I gotta kick some butt before I explode. If you don't find yourself wishing you could run through the gray-clad crowd throwing your sledgehammer into big brother's giant televised face, then you didn't get the point.
0439023521|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and I was very skeptical at first. But I found the story to be engrossing from the beginning. It's a little dark with the dystopian setting, but the author pulled me in. I couldn't put down the first book and read it in one weekend. There were definitely some disturbing elements to the story, but overall I liked the book and will recommend it to friends. I look forward to seeing the film.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|That's saying something, considering great classics like Pink Floyd's The Wall and Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti. Stadium Arcadium is a great Chili Pepper album, with a whopping 28 songs on it. When there are that many songs, who cares that it came out four years after the last album (By The Way, a softer, more melodic sound that disappointed some Chili Pepper fans) and five years before the next (I'm With You, not yet released)? Not only that, but they're good songs. Yes, a couple of them are a bit like By The Way's songs, but they all come together nicely, with a bright new sound and style. The guitar is everywhere, thanks to John Frusciante's amazing talent. Flea's basslines are top of the line. Chad Smith has impeccable drumming. And Anthony Kiedis has stepped up his lyrics a couple notches, and his singing style has improved even more. It's amazing for somebody who had problems staying on key in Under the Bridge to have come up with these songs and lyrics! I have to say, though, that a lot of the lyrics are kind of cryptic so that you aren't entirely sure what a song's about. No, there aren't a lot of sexual innuendos, both because of the cryptic lyrics making any possible references incredibly obscure and because of where Kiedis is in his life (a healthy, regular old relationship with a woman that he basically proposes to in one song).<br /><br />There are so many songs that I enjoy too much. I really like Stadium Arcadium, very beautiful and Kiedis's singing is very good. Death of a Martian is about Flea's dog, Martian, who died. It's the very last song, and the second half of the song is a poem that is rapped. It ends the entire album on the right note while still is a great song in its own right. Wet Sand is also an amazing song. Tell Me Baby is about people coming to LA to become famous musicians, and how that never happens. Most of the other songs are very good, but there are so many of them. There were a couple that I always seemed to think dragged on, especially on such a long album, mostly Slow Cheetah, Warlocks, and Animal Bar. At first I didn't quite like them compared to other songs and almost always wondered, When is this album going to end? or at least, When is this song going to end? They are good. I wasn't too impressed with Charlie, for some reason, and Hump De Bump took a little while to enjoy. Some of the songs, especially in the middle and end of each CD, don't seem to be as strong as the singles and blend together a little.<br /><br />I feel like the biggest downside to Stadium Arcadium is the double album idea. It's long. To play a double album, you need one and a half or two hours. There are a lot of songs that blend together a little and are easy to forget. And to play all twenty eight, you have to change CDs, which breaks up the ideas of an entire album, played start to finish. Still, this album has shown how far the Chili Peppers have come since their debut self-titled album in 1984. It's a great new sound for the band, which is why these nearly fifty-year-old guys are still so impressive. They have learned how to change for the better and come out with new ideas.ally on such a long album, mostly Slow Cheetah, Warlocks, and Animal Bar.

B0057A6GA6|5.0|I spent over 6 hours playig this game the first time I played.\nThe graphics is good, the levels and variety are good.\nOnly one complaint is sometimes when the game is fully engaged and very busy, I tried to buy more weapons and the screen locks up.\nDon&apos;t know whether that&apos;s due to the game or Android machine. (I play this on my EEE Transformer).\nGood strategy tower game.\nHighly recommended if you don&apos;t mind the addicting potential.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Very well made light. Feels good in the hand and is easy to turn on and off. Turbo switch is right beside the on/off button which gives you 4 stages of light. The brightest setting is very bright. I needed a spot light to see hogs on our place at night but could never find a rechargeable one that would do the trick. I have tried several expensive flashlights but none were bright enough. This light does the trick. Very bright, not bulky to hold, and runs off of 8 AA batteries. Highly recommend the light.
0670022411|5.0|There are a lot of paranormal vampire and/or  witch books but this is one of the better ones that I have read recently.

0553582461|3.0|But it could have been better. As I finished reading this novel, I felt that the story ended correctly as it should have, given the events that lead up to it. The Fool's decision was the correct one, as sad as it was, and the ending wraps up all the major threads, with enough minor ones dangling in the background that the ending doesn't appear to be too tidy.    But I was dissatisfied. Here's why. Some spoilers.    Plot: The climax of the story, plotwise, comes through 2/3rds of the way through the story with the resolution of the dragon issue. Granted, afterwards, there is the Fool plotline to resolve, and then tying up all of Fitz's loose strings. But those plotlines lack tension of any sort. There should have been some way to smooth out the plotting so that the climax comes later, rather than expending itself in a rush in the middle of the tale and then flopping about like a dying fish. Worse, there is an awful cop-out in the form of Fitz going absent for a month, and this is used to avoid several difficult interactions.    Characterization: In retrospect, I see very little characterization or character development as compared to the previous books. The Fool and Fitz were given a little bit of development as demanded by the plot. We find out some of Burrich's reasons. We learn a little bit more about Swift and Nettle. We are greatly annoyed by Thick and learn nothing of him that would make us care more about him. That's it. Really. Chade's development was completely, wonderfully, fleshed out in the previous book, so much so that there was no room for development here. Prince Dutiful doesn't do enough to reveal more of his character. Even worse, we don't see enough interaction between him and Elliania to care about her - she gets one good scene in this book. Peottre, also, is a character with undeveloped promise. The Pale Woman - we learn nothing of her motivations. The Dragons - barely touched. But the worst failure is to develop or even showcase Molly. It's beensixteen years - why does Fitz still care about her that much? Answer: Another cop-out. Why should we root for Fitz and Molly to reunite? The book merely relies on the weak, crumbled foundations of the second book in the first trilogy.    World building: There are some tantalizing hints, but no real answers. We don't learn any more of the Fool's origins. We don't learn anything about the Skill current or the forces that reassembled Fitz and Dutiful. We don't learn anything of the Pale Woman beyond a simple appetite for destruction. A few bits and pieces of the Wit and the Skill are dangled before us, always with the promise of 'later', as Fitz tells Web. Later never comes.    Overall, the quality of the book is still good. It is marred only by the unfortunate sense that the book was written with a specific ending in mind, and at least one character was sacrificed with that goal in mind.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|This is Yes' best album in 10 or more years, in my book. It's not a classic, but it all works well together.  The closing song \\"Into the Storm\\" is the most memorable.  Unfortunately, in their current tour, they only play the title track (not the entire suite by that name) and a recorded version of the Overture.  And the title track was not performed well at all. I'll enjoy this album for many years, but the 7/30/11 concert was the worst Yes show in my participation of every tour since 1976. I wish they'd dropped the repeat of old standards like AYAI, ST, CTTE, HOTS, Roundabout, etc and done this album in it's entirety. They tend to rely on the old standards year after year on tour, and you could tell Howe was bored and improvising new parts that didn't work. Benoit needs vocal training to extend his phrasing and to stay on pitch.
1936719118|2.0|yes, interesting story, but I wondered if this is really worth a book. quick read, but not so much of inspiration.

B00284BNKC|5.0|This is not a glamorous movie.  as a matter of fact:  it is always in your face, edgy, strident and perfect.  Everyone in this film should have garnered awards for their performances.    The characters want to feel good about themselves........escape their crappy/humdrum lives for something better.  But with their various forms of drug addictions: life becomes a fast, crippling hammer to the skull.    As I said...Always in your face........the struggle to survive.
B003OT4LZY|5.0|Every song is solid. Especially \\"ARE YOU READY' which is brilliant. Not the Verve, so if that is why you are contemplating buying, then look away. But it is a nice, unique, modern, hip-hop, rock, orchestration, fusion thing happening that I was really surprised with, and then really loved.

B00005Y23E|5.0|I recently visited an uncle that lives in a far away country (Sri-Lanka) for the first time in 10 years. When i asked him if he wanted something from the states, he quickly responded with \\"Bob Marley CD.\\" I was amazed by how he even knew who Bob Marley was because the particular part of Sri-Lanka that he lived in was quite remote. It just goes to show how much of a legend Bob Marley was and how his music still spans the globe to this day. Once i got back, i bought this and sent it to him and i'm sure he'll be the happiest man in Sri-Lanka when he gets it.
1439156816|5.0|A professional copywriter referred me to this exceptional piece of writing for the writers's craft by arguably one of the very best!  There is great value in having this book for periodic re-reading especially if you're a writer, but even if you're not.  Why?  Well, if you're a writer, there are scant few books, if any, on the craft that could be more useful.  If you're not a writer, per se, you'll still be enthralled by it.  I don't want to steal one whit from the reading, so suffice it to say, his subtitle, \\"A Memoir of the Craft\\" includes fascinatingly told stories within the larger story of a life of writing still in progress.  Two thumbs up from the reader!

B004IFYMYI|5.0|I was happy to see that in many ways, the film has weathered the years well and is as relevant today as when it was originally released.  The blu-ray transfer is clean giving the night scenes an atmospheric feel and the audio is clear.
B002AFX52S|5.0|As ostensibly the 109th reviewer of this astonishing film in Amazon's irrelevant list, there is no need to recapitulate its history, plot, or merits.  What are at issue are the following: A. Why did n't ALL reviewers award this 5 stars? B. How justifiable are the technical criticisms such as the quality of the transfer, and whether indeed one can actually play this DVD at all?  To deal with the first question, several highly intelligent reviewers withheld at least one star because they did not consider it to be Kurosawa's finest film, and others because they thought it less good than RAN. Both arguments are difficult to justify. This was Kurosawa's great leap forward into the world of colour. What a leap! And what colour! He started life as a painter, and judging by the many magnificent examples featured in the Extras, a very talented painter too. For 5 years he churned out paintings of scenes he had in mind for Kagemusha, although its gestation period was closer to a full decade. He painted the film first on paper, and then went on to paint it on the camera. In doing so, he created perhaps the greatest true Art Film up to that time. No film that I know contains a greater profusion of beautiful shots and images, both in their composition and their colour, although the same can be said of RAN. Plot and characters are almost dispensable. You can switch to the commentary, sit back, and allow your eyes to be ravished by the images that emerge from the screen. It is like touring a Gallery displaying the retrospective exhibition of a great artist. The characters don't speak; you don't quite follow all the action in each painting; but these frozen moments in time capture the viewer more so than the work of any other film-maker. Kagemusha's great leap compares with Beethoven's Eroica and Picasso's Les Demoiselles D'Avignon, the ascent to the highest level from which point further advances were simply along a plateau. Seen in this light and knowing that it was, however fine,derivative of its great predecessor, I cannot understand the logic of awarding RAN a higher rating. It does have the advantage of a simpler story-line and one more familiar to Western audiences through King Lear. The one significant fault in Kagemusha is the tortuous plot and the fact that all the characters seem to look alike. It is inevitable that the Thief and the Brother should do so, as they both served as doubles for Shingen; but it is also hard to distinguish the various other warlords and generals. I am sure that Oriental audiences would not have this problem, but it is well known that  an untrained Western eye finds it difficult to recognize the facial individuality of Japanese, Chinese, or even African Blacks. Kurosawa's rapid transitions and the similarity of dress  compound the problem. I found it impossible to separate the soldiers of one warlord from those of another during the battle scenes, and this was my 3rd viewing of the film. The marvellous voice-over commentary by Stephen Prince is a great help, and I would strongly counsel any first-time viewer to play the movie in this mode before moving to the full version with subtitles. Contrary to some comments, Prince skilfully draws attention to technical and stylistic elements in the way the film is composed, as well as providing a fascinating historical background and highlighting the subtle interplay between the characters that would escape the unobservant eye. Better still, play the documentary IMAGE: KUROSAWA'S CONTINUITY even before the commentary. This shows all of the 200 paintings that Kurosawa produced and fits them into their correct place in the narrative, providing a quick summary of the plot. Some have complained about the acting being cold and less demonstrative than in Kurosawa's earlier Samurai movies, but for me the reserve and self-control, the silences and the long takes, all added to the subtlety and psychological power of this film, and I was very happy to do without the hystericsthat for me mar some sections of Seven Samurai.    Now to the 2nd question. It is unforgivable that Amazon should combine reviews on VHS tapes with those on orthodox DVDs and add them to genuine reviews of this Blu Ray version. Forget statements about this NOT being the full 180-minute copy. Ignore those who complain about a poor transfer. Pity those who tried to play the Blu Ray disc through a standard DVD player. This is a technically superb product in every way. The clarity is sharp, except where, as in the burial and dream sequences, Kurosawa deliberately softens the images. The subtitles are detailed and precise. Only the sound track is a disappointment. Most of the time there are no sounds beyond those of the humans and the elements, but there are supposed to be Noh drum rolls from time to time that carry important artistic significance. These and others were inaudible to me, and even the fateful flute melody preceding the shooting of Shingen could hardly be heard. The musical score, mercifully limited, is terrible  -- completely wrong, as if it drifted in from Hollywood during an airing of Star Wars.    My final word? Kagemusha or Ran? I prefer the former, but the two fully merit 5 stars and there is no commandment that states: THOU SHALLT NOT BUY BOTH.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|LOVE THE MOVIE!! alot of people didnt like it but the thought and the way the cinamia flowed watched it now 15 times
B004WPYNY8|5.0|A fantastic mix of heavy, progressive and symphonic metal. Michael Romeo doesn't fail to impress and he does many creative things with his guitar playing. Another amazing album by Symphony X. Only thing missing is a 20+ minute epic like in previous albums.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|After years of waiting, we have a CD full of new Beyonce songs.  She continues the pattern from \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\" by giving the album a B-side feel with dance numbers coming later on the CD.  There are plenty of heartfelt ballads, such as \\"1+1\\" and \\"Best I Never Had.\\"  There is some gritty hip-hop found in songs such as \\"Countdown\\" - my favorite - and \\"Run the World (Girls).\\"  Not quite as fun as \\"Sasha Fierce\\" or \\"B-Day\\" - but still a fantastic album.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|This is a beautifully crafted movie. Eastwood direction is almost classical without relaying on any visual analogy or abstraction he creates an almost surreal atmosphere that haunts every single scene in the movie. The performances of the three major characters is for the ages and the level of deepness that they bring to the ordinary man is almost epic. At many points I felt there was more underneath than I was been shown as if there were paranormal forces forcing the characters actions but as I come to realize there isn't really much left its just our own perennial ghosts.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|NO SPOILER ALERT NEEDED.  THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSIS<br /><br />Lee Child is a master of writing page-turning novels.  It must be his uncanny abilities developed as a TV director, knowing when to pause, to tease, to leave us wanting to know what's on the next page.  I would classify his writing as suspense, not thrillers.  Yes, there is violence, but, it's not gratuitous.<br /><br />Lee Child has given a strong voice to his serial protagonist, Jack Reacher.  He's a man of few words.  But, when Reacher speaks, meanings are conveyed and readily understood.  The dialogue is rich yet, Child is not one for flowery descriptions.  Rather, it is often like reading an inventory list.  Sometimes, it's what is unspoken that is important.<br /><br />The character, Reacher, is a former MP.  Traveling across America with nothing but the few items in his pockets, he wants for nothing.  Somehow, trouble always finds him.  And Reacher never walks away from it.<br /><br />Easy-to-read, with a minimum of principal characters, the reader finds himself quickly adapting to new locales and situations, just like our hero. This story takes place in New York City.  For those who are familiar with the city's subway system and streets, it adds realism to the story.<br /><br />Lee Child writes an exceptionally tight plot; there are no loose ends here. Brilliantly paced, Gone Tomorrow is a hit.
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|I said it once and I probably would say it until I die, I love ABBA music, I find it infinitely charming. I don't know how this happened, I wasn't born in their decade, my dad didn't play their music as much when I was growing up, none of my musician friends or music idols consider ABBA as one of their inspirations yet I do. And just like I appreciate their music when no one in my social circle does I enjoy this movie thoroughly when not even my fiancee does. Its corny, simplistic, predictable, and has an unrealistic sparkling brightness that makes romantic comedies like \\"The Sweetest Thing\\" look like serious gritty mysteries. But it's not all fluff, we do have Meryl Streep who has the ability to make the Titanic resurface with her bigger than life characters. Maybe is the fact that the actors spent more time singing/dancing than acting that I felt I was watching a music video. Maybe is the beautiful Greek scenery that brings me back to my youngest dreams of paradise. Maybe I'm just cheesy like that...but this movie is charming, harmless and even though it has enough sugar to make you diabetic, you might just like me, like it. It is definitely a strange zone you step in when you find yourself idiotically singing along to a movie while your fiancee looks at you and says \\"That's just gay\\"
B003UBTX7C|3.0|NO SPOILER ALERT NEEDED HERE.  THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSIS<br /><br />When David Baldacci appeared as a new novelist, I was impressed with his writing abilities and his plots.  I liked his character, Oliver Stone as a strong protagonist.  Sometimes, though, even strong characters need to be put to rest.  Oliver and his Camel Club members have solved mysteries admirably.  Only now, Baldacci has run out of steam.  The plots have always been exciting but, not so in Hell's Corner.  This one doesn't ring true.<br /><br />What Baldacci continues to do well is to give each of the characters a well-defined personality.  The dialogue of each one helps the reader visualize the characters' looks, manners, and dress.  He also brings a sense of realism to his book with his settings.<br /><br />I hope that Baldacci's next novel introduces us to new protagonists, new settings, and new plots.  It's time for a change.
B001UN1KVE|3.0|Not as funny as I remembered but still cute. John Candy's character \\"Barf\\" (Chewy) and Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet are probably enough reason to watch this movie. The rest of the cast does what the script asks for but little less. Interestingly enough the main characters Lone Star and Prince Vespa are the ones that are weakest. Not all the gags succeed but I still find this very easy to watch. Even if you are not a Star War fan you can enjoy it.
159514188X|2.0|I have to agree with the nearly only other reviewer who did not care for the read.   The ridiculousness of the need to kill oneself over such inane circumstances - particularly when she regularly states how ridiculous they are - was almost too much too waste my time with.  The author presents this young lady throughout the book as unusually (for a teen) self assured, confident in herself, and she certainly had no problem putting other teens in their places.  So to commit suicide......it just didn't work.    I could understand this book as a summer teen read to impress how meaningless acts can negatively affect another but this is not an adult novel by any stretch.
6304712499|1.0|In the future there will be Art House revivals \\"Horribly Camp Super Hero Movies\\" and this will play along with Lee's Hulk and the original 60's Batman Movie. Hell lets make one now and drop in Batman Forever in there.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I turned to Mankell after finishing the Larssen trilogy and needed more Swedish mystery reads. Troubled Man is a multi layed story and takes the time to develop the characters of the story.  I want more.
B002UD56I6|4.0|Even though I'm not the biggest Michael Jackson fan I was really upset when he passed away because I hated how the media kept making fun of him and it sucked he didn't got the chance to shut everyone up and show he hadn't lost it and could still be a great entertainer. Coming into this release I was expecting a documentary with a lot of people talking about how sorry they feel and footage of the rehearsal but this ain't that at all. These are the actual compiled performances with dancers, back screen 3D footage, props and even newly recorded HD video segments that serve as intros to the songs. Of course these do not have the final look but they do feature live playing and singing. You can really see him gesture and dance as he was doing it in front of thousand people. As it turns out he did sang in front of us. So I'm happy he gave a 100% of him because now I'm able to see what he was like live and he was indeed great. Thus in a way I'm thankful that Ortega was able to do this film because the people who see it will realize that he wasn't just a crazy guy but an incredibly creative entertainer who left at his best. This is not remembrance feature but a celebration of life, no inscriptions at the end describing his fate but just the end of a great show.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Really great music.  I agree some songs are better than others.  This is a must buy.  It is unlike anything I have I have listened to,  and I love it.
B001EJIMUG|3.0|It's difficult for a film to be completely faithful to the novel due to time constraints.  Having the novel fresh in my mind, this film does a pretty good job of including the key parts, at the same time it is found a little wanting. Certainly not the best Austen adaptation I've seen.  Characters are truly depicted. However, surely Anne Elliot could have had some facial expression other than deer-in headlights.  If you're a Jane Austen fan and home sick for the afternoon, it's entertaining enough. But I wouldn't watch it multiple times as I would something like BBC Pride and Prejudice.

0316067938|2.0|During my Master, I worked on the following topic : vampires in Literature. For my second year, I chose to modernize my corpus and to narrow it to contemporary novels (bit-lit and YA novels above all). So, I could not let the Twilight serie go without reading it, even though I tend to look upon such hyped books with utter defiance. Yet, I felt I had to give it at least a try.       Book 1 was okay. I do not (and will never) understand the craziness about this serie however. It wasn't that well written, the story is nothing short of ordinary - vampire-wise - and some of her ideas even ridiculous. But I liked the Cullen family very much and even though Edward is a stalker, I did prefer his character to Bella, that annoyed me to no end.       Book 2 was okay. Depressing but okay. I would even have allowed a rapprochement between Bella and Jacob at this point ; after months of mourning Edward, while believing he didn't care for her at all.       Book 3 was my favorite. It was also the one I feared the most to read because of the trio in it. Oh boy, was I right... At the very end of the book, she suddenly kisses Jacob and Ooooohhh she discovers than she loves him too! WTFF?! She agreed, quite reluctantly to marry Edward, angered me with her I-want-to-become-a-vampire-yet-I-am-not-that-fond-of-the-idea-of-marriage and yet she kissed another. Alice almost has to beg to be allowed to organize the wedding... Who is this girl? Are you for real? I was so mad I through the book at that point. Only picked it up much later cause Hubby said that since I paid for it I should finish it. (Since then, I do not finish a bad book, just leave it to rot.)       Darn, book 4 is such a joke : Alien meeting serie B. When I think that today, at work, parents wanted to buy it for their 11 years old child... I'm appalled.     More reviews on : [...]
B0057A6GA6|4.0|This game is one of my guilty pleasures.  I am a big fan of Tower Defense games, and this one is fun with the right amount of difficulty. Not too hard or too easy. Not as good as Fieldrunners, but fun in its own way.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I happen to believe that Eddie Vedder has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. This album of intimate, acoustic music, really brings his voice to the forefront. Songs like \\"Broken Heart\\", \\"Sleepless Nights\\", \\"Longing To Belong\\" show a real intimacy that can sometimes get lost on the Pearl Jam releases. \\"Without You\\" and \\"Sleeping By Myself\\" are probably my favorites, but I enjoy them all, and never hit skip when I am listening. I even bought two copies-one for home and one for the car!    I cannot recommend this album highly enough. If you enjoy acoustic music and admire Eddie Vedder's singing, you will absolutely love it, just as I do!
B005DD7H50|3.0|Good guy takes pill,  Bad guys chase and try to kill good guy to get the pill, Good guy overcomes and is super smart and life is good.  Typical Hollywood action movie formula, blah blah....     Lets put it this way or use this for a yardstick, it was not a \\"V for Vendetta screen play\\" that really got you to think.      I am glad I didn't plop 12 bucks at the movie theater for this movie.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Poorly written book. Too many contradictions. Instead of an organized work of literature, it is more like many short stories bound together and passed off as an organized thought.  In addition, the translators took many liberties to change passages when compared to the original work from 2000 years ago. Sorry, but can&apos;t recommend it.
B004XJHBCE|2.0|I got this for free with the App of the Day. Awesome concept for an app. I gave it 2 stars for the concept and that it Did organize my stuff.

Whenever I would exit and app, my screen would be white with the HTC logo, followed by &quot;Loading... &quot; this would last for 5-10secs. It was driving me crazy and I realized this started after I set up this app. I decided I would uninstall it, then Restart my phone... And magically my phone went back to perfectly exiting programs\/apps and I no longer had the glitches. \n\nStinks that it was this program... Because I loved the organization it offers! I wish the Android operating system would offer\/include what this app does. Hopefully one day! \n\nI can&apos;t recommend this and if any of you have noticed the HTC &quot;Loading... &quot; screen glitch AND you have this app, understand that the problem IS this app.
B00003CX8N|5.0|If you like Anthony Hopkins AND books, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you're looking for action, this isn't the movie for you.  If you're looking for a good story, this is the movie.  This involves a correspondance between an avid reader in New York and a bookseller in England and takes you through Wartime in England and the food shortages.  A very pleasant surprise is seeing Dame Judy Dench as a very young actress playing a relatively minor role.  I had this in VHS and recently upgraded to a DVD.
B000001E18|4.0|Very underrated. It's not perfect. But, there's enough from the sessions here (Lemon, Hold Me Thrill Me-later released for Batman Forever) that made me actually take notice of them. It's where U2 went from the perception of a mildly soft band to having an edge, literally and figuratively.     Favorite tracks:  First Time  Lemon  Stay (Faraway, So Close)  Zooropa  Daddy's Gonna..even though the title's a little corny. lol    Least:  The Wanderer, the Johnny Cash sung closer, was meant to be a joke I heard. It's not funny.  Some Days is eh and I could have done without Babyface.     Still, I got this for cheap. So the album's a success in satisfaction and what it achieved: experimental U2 broadening their base. :D
B003Y5H574|5.0|Has any genre fallen further into formulaic drivel than the studio romantic comedy?  Hollywood churns these out, year and after year, becoming less and less distinct as they go along.  The romantic comedy has consumed more potentially promising young actresses than I care to count (remember the late 1990s, when Jennifer Lopez was hot off \\"Selena\\" and \\"Out of Sight\\" and looked to be a young actress worth following?).  \\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\" comes from co-directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa, previously responsible for the entertainingly oddball Jim Carrey film \\"I Love You Phillip Morris\\" (seen by not nearly enough people, incidentally), who, while not exactly breaking all the conventions, are making a determined effort to do things differently.  The result is a big success, and I imagine that, much like their previous film, it will not attract nearly the initial audience that it deserves.  I can't recall a studio romantic comedy in recent times that has entertained me as much as this one.  Spoilers follow.    \\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\" falls into a largely discontinued subgenre, the 'comedy of remarriage' - it fell out of style with the explosion of the divorce rate (or actually before that), but was very popular in the age of screwball comedy (\\"The Philadelphia Story\\", for instance).  We open with Cal (Steve Carell, playing it fairly straight) and Emily (Julianne Moore, who I used to think couldn't do comedy very well, but she's done a few recently that worked), married for 25 years when Emily blurts out that she has had an affair and wants a divorce.  Cal grants this with unseemly equanimity, and settles into the life of a bitter divorcee hanging out in a bar and regaling everyone with his story.  This eventually prompts the intervention of Jacob (Ryan Gosling, straying outside the indie drama for the first time in a while), a ladies man who vows to help Cal recover his masculinity.  Cal gets a makeover, and tries his hand at womanizing, starting with Kate (Marisa Tomei).  Jacob, meanwhile, is flirting with articling law student Hannah (rising star Emma Stone, enjoyable as always).  And Cal and Emily's only son, 13-year-old Robbie (Jonah Bobo), has a crush on the sitter, 17-year-old Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who in turn secretly crushes on Cal.    The handling of the ensemble cast is not completely perfect; some of the supporting characters go away for decent stretches of the running time (Jessica, especially).  Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, as the married couple's significant flings, are both underused, especially Bacon.  However, there's a wonderful depth to things.  Carell and Moore have lovely chemistry as a couple that has been together for a quarter-century and is now at odds (Moore has played the cheating spouse a number of times in the last few years, I must say).  Ryan Gosling is marvelous as the somewhat caddish Jacob, and plays very well off both Carell and Stone.  The kids are also well-done, with Tipton making a believably awkward teenage girl.  Tomei, for all her limited screentime, has a lot of the most purely comedic stuff in the script, and does very well with it.  While there is the aforementioned issue of juggling all the characters, the script is otherwise very smart, and incorporates a number of surprise reveals that are almost impossible to guess while also playing very fair with the audience (the big one near the end is, on reflection, really well-done; I had earlier thought that it seemed odd that a couple married for 25 years had a 13-year-old as their eldest child).    Highly recommended.  Hollywood really should try to make more like this.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Unstoppable\\" for lots of reasons. There's very little soap opera back-story, as in so many disaster films, and the story gets off the platform from the beginning. At a crisp 96 minutes, this story that is \\"inspired\\" but not \\"based\\" on actual events is no end of fun and excitement. Acting is fine, and the editing is remarkable, as are the special effects.There's time to know the characters' motivations without intruding on the action at hand. This review may never be read, but I was compelled to get in my 5-stars. I had no problem with my enjoyment of \\"Unstoppable\\". Comparisons to \\"Runaway Train\\" with Jon Voight ('85) are not realistic. Different venue, different situations. The DVD I watched (Netflix) had no extras. That would've been nice.<br />UPDATE (8-24-12): So very sorry to hear of Tony Scott's tragic death. He will be missed.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|If you are reading this review you know what to expect from this cd. Like the majority of both the professional reviewers and others I like this music very much. I have no issues at all with the style, the songs or the performances. I do, on the other hand, have a problem with the negative reviews. Now don't get me wrong. All music is not for all tastes. Anyone is entitled to dislike any work of art. I never got into Husker Du, for example. I enjoyed Big Star but never considered that the band was in any way extraordinary. More recently I had a problem with the later Radiohead releases. However, it is one thing to dislike a cd or admit to an inability to appreciate what the majority adore and quite another to attack a record as inauthentic or incompetent without presenting anything in the way of hard evidence. The Pitchfork review of Stephen Deusner is a case in point. The review is witty and well- written. Mr. Denser clearly hates the cd. He levels multiple criticisms, none of which hold any water whatsoever as far as I am concerned. He complains that the band has too many influences, that the songs sound incomplete, that the entire record lacks honesty. In essence he suggests that Mumford and Sons have cobbled together a pinch of Fleet Foxes, a soupçon of The Avetts, a sprinkling of Gomez and Keane and a dash of Fairport. For good measure he could have mixed The Strawbs and The Decembrists into the recipe. Perhaps the band was influenced by these artists. Perhaps not. I don't know and neither does he. Quite frankly I don't care! What I do hear is a band with it's own sound. And I like what I hear. After 60 years of modern popular music nearly all \\"new\\" music is derivative. Sometimes the artists have have listened to and absorbed the influences of those who came before. Occasionally new artists happen upon a sound or a style quite by accident and are astonished when someone plays them a record from the past that they have never heard but that a third party would argue had to have influenced the artist. Either way, if I like the new music I'm okay with it. Mumford and Sons sound thoroughly original and honest to me.rgue had to have influenced the artist. Either way, if I like the new music I'm okay with it. Mumford and Sons sound thoroughly original and honest to me.
B0014BC3C2|5.0|I don't think I can really add anything that hasn't already been said in other reviews, but it's hard to watch this without saying something.     Torture has proven to be effective in forcing people to give up information, but the hatred it can breed in the heart of the enemy can become a blind rage with a focus on vengeance. Even if critical information is discovered that saves lives, how many others might ultimately die as a result of the fuel that was added to the fire?     Of course the same thing happens to Americans at the hands of the enemy, and it has a dramatic impact on us because it's infuriating, degrading and inhumane. It makes my stomach turn to imagine someone being subjected to pure evil with no regard for the terror and pain they endured.     I know someone who fought in WWII. He recently (and reluctantly) told of the torture on both sides, and it still haunts him. Nightmares, flashbacks and images of the torture and murder of individuals who were rendered defenseless and whose lives were in the hands of their captors. I think what bothered him a lot was the fact that he and his peers were convinced they were eradicating evil sub-humans. It was a VERY short period of time considering how long he has lived, but it had a profound effect. It took decades for him to get past an idea that had been drilled into his head: the entire race he'd fought against had no worth. Believing that and then realizing it was not true was its own unique form of torture. He's a good man that believed in his country and followed orders.    I was sickened by the details and photos of the P.O.W. torture that certain U.S. soldiers were prosecuted for not long ago. They portrayed our country as heartless sadists to those who know the U.S. only through the media. Who needs propaganda when there's documented proof of depravity? The people they did that to may have committed atrocities, but you gain nothing by lowering yourself to their level. Don't misunderstand me, I sincerelysympathize with those soldiers because of what led them to that point. It may have been driven into their heads, or it could've been fueled by things they had witnessed - maybe even by a specific individual or his/her associates. The person(s) who were interrogated and brutalized may have been downright demented and bloodthirsty, but to return that evil on them is no less depraved. Pack mentality can drive people to drastic behavior, and that's the only way I can begin to comprehend a group of individuals going against every shred of human decency and justifying their decision to use torture as a means to an end.    National security is critical to our survival, but there is NO excuse for physically torturing another living being. If you teach people that brutality is acceptable when it comes to defending themselves, where does it stop? If I suspect that someone is guilty of being involved in a violent crime against me or someone I care about, do I have the right to torture them for information? What if I'm wrong? I can't just say, \\"Oops! Sorry, I have the wrong guy! You can go now.\\" The damage is done. Even if I was right, I would be as guilty as that enemy for treating someone inhumanely.    Would I shoot an intruder that threatened me or my loved ones? Absolutely, without hesitation. But if I were to blatantly brutalize that person I would be held accountable for it - and rightfully so. There's a good reason why we aren't permitted to threaten others and decide what brand of justice we personally feel is a relative punishment for the crime they've committed against us. There is absolutely no grounds for torturing any living being, not even in battle. Defending yourself is an entirely separate entity from intentionally brutalizing someone or inflicting revenge.

She leaves no detail unexamined but for the sake of continuity and clarity, I wish she had.  Those who prefer a linear storyline may be disappointed by the observations and ramblings of the various narrators who are frequently annoying.  Many of the characters are neither likeable nor particularly sympathetic even when you've grasped the extent of the trauma in their respective lives.<br /><br />While each chapter of GOON SQUAD tells a story that is cohesive in itself, the book as a whole is related in disjointed chapters with the action flowing back and forth in time and with relationships so inter-woven between the chapters it requires the reader to create a scorecard in order to keep track of all the players and how their lives are connected.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|I've been intending to write this review ever since IYD came out in early May, 2011.  My only problem was that initially I wasn't sure what to make of it.  I liked it but was not immediately in love with it.  In the past, I had found it easier to get into new Stevie Nicks' albums.<br /><br />Well, I kept listening and this is one of those albums where every time I listen, I discover something new and love it even more.  It struck me yesterday that Stevie Nicks has been a star for many years but she writes as if she's living the life of an everyday person.  She's the opposite of some rockstar turning out cookie cutter lyrics because s/he lives in a glass house and doesn't know any better.<br /><br />From beginning to end this CD is full of brilliant lyrics and outstanding music plus a unique delivery from someone who really feels her songs.  (There's no need for me to do a track-by-track analysis because everything on this CD is wonderful).<br /><br />I guess the best thing about IYD is that it's something you can cherish for a long time.  It's quite amazing that Stevie has been around so long and still turns out great new music.<br /><br />It's her first solo CD since 2001.  The last Fleetwood Mac CD was released in 2003.  She's still going strong.  Whether she decides that her next project will be another solo effort or another Fleetwood Mac gem, I hope she doesn't keep us waiting too long.
0307279189|4.0|*Born to Run* is the Book of the Summer for freshmen at Appalachian State University (2011-12). It was an inspired choice, because it will appeal to guys (a major issue), has an Indiana Jones feel to it, and yet manages to impart valuable anthropological, physiological, and cultural information. The author begins as a discouraged runner (persistent injuries) and raises the question of whether human beings are really designed for this activity. The context for the question is not your basic 10K race; rather, McDougall focuses on ultra-marathoners. These are the people who think nothing of flying to France for the yearly 100+ mile run around Mt. Blanc. It turns out that not only Kenyans and Ethiopians are good at these incredible distances. So are the Tarahumara Indians in the Copper Canyon of Northern Mexico. Theirs is a secretive and remote culture. McDougall turns the book into a double quest: to learn more about this people and their running ways and to solve the problem of the naturalness of running for contemporary humans. Along the way, the reader is introduced to a number of quirky-yet-disciplined non-Indian runners, a mysterious running fanatic who lives in the canyon, and the thesis that evolution has equipped us for staggering feats of distance work. One impact of the book is that you will experience your feet in brand new ways and begin to consider the decalced life.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I purchased the Phenom II X6 1090T as an upgrade for my aging Phenom 9600.  I've used reveal quad core Athlon II systems and expected similar performance from the new CPU.  It's much better than I thought.  My Starcraft II frame rate almost doubled with the same settings.  I always assumed my geforce 250 was the bottleneck.  It's able to play crysis, world of warcraft, Portal 2, and many other games at very high frame rates and the AI is running smooth.     I also run BSD on my system and tend to compile a lot of software.  The chip cut down the time to compile Firefox in half and sped up many other tasks I do as well.  The reason I bought an AMD chip was the possibility of an upgrade, and they haven't let me down!  It's like a whole new computer for under $200.
B003Y5H59W|2.0|Not as blatantly, ridiculously dumb as \\"Thor,\\" but -- from start-to-finish -- completely synthetic and artificial and, to me, deeply disappointing.    As a fan of \\"The Rocketeer\\" I was excited that \\"Cap\\" would have the same director, but Joe Johnson brings along absolutely none of the spontaneity, breakneck fun or lurking danger of the former film. \\"Cap\\" is \\"The Rocketeer\\" completely drained of its essence. The structure is uncertain, the pacing sloppy, the action dull, the logic constantly questionable.     This is a movie just going through the motions, but at the same time it feels like a four-hour film trimmed down to two. Motivations are unclear, questions go unanswered, introductions are set up and then never made. For example: Why have The Howling Commandos appear at all if you're not going to identify them as a unit?    Probably the biggest missed opportunity is the handling of Steve Rogers, who -- thanks to a super-serum and some \\"Vita-Ray\\" exposure -- goes from 96 pound F-4 weakling to a strapping, totally cut uber-soldier. His \\"before\\" version is whiny, passive aggressive and seems a bit of a masochist (taking brutal beatings from bullies, diving onto runaway grenades); his \\"after\\" version never really seems the least bit disoriented, conflicted or even very excited by his transformation. And most importantly we never learn exactly why Rogers was so gung ho to fight in the first place, even though there are countless opportunities for a quick monologue that might explain his passion.    In an effort to seem important, \\"Captain America\\" clutters itself with World War II-era iconography, but its \\"chase-fight-chase-fight-repeat\\" train of thought comes from a cut-rate videogame.
B003Y5H5AG|1.0|Sometimes despite your best efforts a movie you just know is going to be an awful experience is somehow worse than you imagined even though you tried to talk yourself into thinking it might not be so bad. \\"Oh, this actor and/or actress is in it. Hopefully I'll still be able to enjoy their role in this monstrosity,\\" is what you say to yourself. It turns out to be all for nothing and even though that person you admire is in it, you're just left wondering why they're a part of something so horrendous to begin with. The Smurfs is such a movie and I can almost guarantee you that you haven't seen anything as bad as this all year.<br /><br />The smurfs live in Smurf Village in another universe where magic actually exists. These little blue creatures are about seven inches tall that can sing, dance, talk, live in mushrooms, and are massively annoying all day long. The evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria) is obsessed with capturing the smurfs in order to obtain their essence to become the most powerful wizard in the universe. During the festival of the blue moon, Clumsy (voiced by Anton Yelchin) accidentally leads Gargamel to Smurf Village. Amongst the confusion while they're fleeing Gargamel's onslaught, they accidentally stumble onto a portal to our universe as Gargamel follows in hot pursuit. Unfortunately for them, our moon never turns blue so they must rely on the assistance of Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) and Grace Winslow (Jayma Mays); a couple who's expecting their first child and who are going through some troubles of their own.<br /><br />If you weren't a fan of the original Smurfs cartoon, then you probably won't have any reason to actually sit through this thing. Speaking as someone who isn't a fan of anything Hanna-Barbera related, taking one for the team or biting the bullet doesn't even begin to describe the unfortunate displeasure I experienced throughout this cinematic miscarriage. The Smurfs does nothing but make a repetitive, never-ending effort to rub its audience nose in the fact that it's trying to be cute. It can't just show something cute and move on. It's basically shoving cuteness down your throat without asking in a rather obnoxious and extremely forceful fashion.<br /><br />As if purely tolerating these tiny, blue kumquats wasn't enough, the movie makes it a point to rub salt in the wound before dousing it with lemon and plunging your exposed injury into a bucket of bleach. There's a Rock Band scene where Neil Patrick Harris plays the game with The Smurfs and they decide to add their own lyrics to Aerosmith's \\"Walk This Way.\\" Imagine the song with all the lyrics replaced with stuff about sunshine, kilts, intelligence, being angry, blue skin, and \\"smurf\\" every three words or so. I recommend not getting nachos before seeing this. You'll want to pour the hot, scolding nacho cheese into your eye sockets just to make the torture on-screen be a little less painful.<br /><br />Looking at the movie from a critic's perspective doesn't even help matters. It shows you all the main plot points in a vision Papa Smurf has at the beginning of the movie, so you basically know what's going to happen long before you even get there. You probably already have a solid idea of what the movie is just by seeing the TV spots alone. There's also another scene where Gargamel is in prison in our universe. He has a conversation with a moth. He doesn't use magic as he doesn't even have anything on him at the time other than an orange jumpsuit. He talks to this moth and convinces it to break him out of prison. How, you might ask? With about a million flies. Flies break Gargamel out of prison. All family movies have to include some sort of bodily fluid in them anymore. Crude humor is apparently the only way you can reach a younger audience these days. So I hope you like cat vomit and a grown man digging through a vomitous pile for a few strands of hair.<br /><br />Is there anything actually decent about this movie? If you've read this far,you're probably thinking that. There is, actually. The 3D effect is actually utilized really well. Smurfs are constantly jumping in your face and when they're not random objects are flying at you thanks to Gargamel's magic. There's a scene at the very beginning of the movie where two smurfs are riding birds. That scene is pulled off incredibly well as the birds twist and turn in the air. The perspective, positioning of the camera, and the way we seem to follow their every move makes that thirty second sequence work really well. Neil Patrick Harris is probably the least offensive part of the movie, but that isn't saying a whole lot. There's actually some really talented people buried in the cast. Unfortunately they're so smothered in smurfberries that you probably won't even notice them.<br /><br />The Smurfs is the first movie I've ever actually physically ran out of as soon as it was over. It is downright offensive with how cute and corny it is. With an overly predictable storyline, ridiculous plot points, and some of the lamest material to ever hit the big screen, anything remotely good in the film is immediately erased by the overwhelming wave of forcefed cutesy garbage. It's like having an entire jar of Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme crammed down your throat. If you suddenly have the urge to see this movie, stay home and drink a bottle of Drano instead.

It's like having an entire jar of Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme crammed down your throat. If you suddenly have the urge to see this movie, stay home and drink a bottle of Drano instead. I promise you'll have a better time.
B0050XFY4O|3.0|Touchy subject, but not so much an issue since their characters were not fully explored leaving their relationship as brothers not so believable. I really wanted to give this film a huge thumbs up, but I felt the storyline was thin in a few areas. I also had issues with continuity and how the adolescent years were skipped entirely. The relationship between the two brothers could have offered us better treatment if attention was given to character development during those all-important teen years; yet we are jolted by the swift jump from boyhood to adulthood. Also, portions of the film were crossing over to soap opera mode, including the repetitive music score. Given the disconnect I had with identifying them as brothers throughout the film, I did find the chemistry between Cardoso and Vasconcellos very engaging, and dare i say, almost distracting since they are both incredibly handsome men. Kudos to casting for pairing these men together.
0553801473|2.0|I have been a big fan of this series and it is one of the few fantasy series I tell others they have to read.  With that said, skip this book, it goes no where and destroys the characters that made this series what it was.  Martin is an amazing writer, but was asleep at the wheel (on his way to the bank) with this book.  I have to wonder that if the real reason it took so long to \\"produce\\" is because he really didn't want to write it.
0525422943|4.0|*Spoiler Free*      I liked Where She Went a lot more than If I Stay. Adam's point of view was refreshing, especially as I liked him more than Mia's character in If I Stay. Interestingly enough, from his perspective, I learned to like Mia more as well.      I also preferred the writing in this book and Gayle Forman does a fantastic job at conveying Adam's grief. I felt so sorry for him in certain parts of the book and could imagine how awful it would be to have his life. There were a few clichés in this book, for example the fed-up rock star who hates crowded places, but they didn't feel quite as tired as those in If I Stay. I could really empathise with Adam, you could see how lonely he was, without Mia.      I also really loved the flashbacks in this book. They added a lot to the storyline, considering how much time had passed since the accident. It was interesting to learn how drastically Adam's life had changed, especially with the band.      The end of the book kept me on my toes and I was so happy with the outcome. I was really unsure what would happen in the last few chapters, Gayle Forman certainly kept me guessing.      THE VERDICT  4 stars - This was a good ending to the If I Stay series and you are left with a feeling of satisfaction.

B001O54NHQ|5.0|The soundtrack to \\"Batman\\" is great! This is a great soundtrack to one of the biggest films of the late '80's and one of the best comic-book movie adaptations of all time.

B001UV4XHY|1.0|Decided to rent and see this movie before going to the LAST ONE!  After the first two in the series, I stopped going because it all became a bore and my sons both grew up and decided the HP movies stunk (which I agreed with). Yes, the kids in the movie are no longer kids and the movie does attempt to show the angst, temptations, jealousies, etc.... of teens BUT the movie is still a bore.  Maybe in the theaters it was better, but on TV, scenes look too dark and the special effects don't look too special.  As for character developments and acting - well the actors try do the best with the material but there is nothing noteworthy in any of their scenes and everything drags right up to the final scene. You can take this LONG movie, cut at least an hour out of it and not miss a single point the movie is trying to make - which isn't much.  This is one of those \\"disposable\\" movies - things look serious, actors act serious, everything is dark and gloomy but, in the end, it's all pointless.  The minute you finish watching the movie is the minute you start to forget all about it.    Update: Went and saw Part 2 - enjoyed it. You're not missing out on much by skipping Part 1.  In fact, you'll be doing yourself a favor by not sitting through a terrible movie totally conceived to rip off the \\"Harry Potter\\" fanatics who could be fed 3 hours of brooms flying in space and they would love it.

0553801473|3.0|This is over all a good book. The writing skills of Martin are shining. BUT it saddens me that he seems to have cheapened the series yet again. Going for gasps instead of building on themes and stories already in place just does not work here. I hope he is able to bring it back to life in the next installment but that could be years if ever.
B002OLUPYO|4.0|I like this pop rock album a lot better than her earlier R&B/Rock hybrid stuff.    This is a combination of explosive numbers like So What to the mellow out I Don't Believe You. Extra tracks like Push You Away should have been on the standard edition rather than One Foot Wrong.    Her hit videos are here together with some excerpts from the Funhouse Tour. Some are in widescreen format and some in fullscreen. One request, please standardize them.      For me, I will always welcome the deluxe editions. So I'm glad I waited for this.

B004QK5N5W|5.0|I've only had it a day or two, and I already love it -- it's going on vacation with me so I can watch movies and stream Netflix direct to big TVs.<br /><br />Easy to use:  I just plugged it in, and in a couple of seconds, I could see video on my TV screen -- no drivers to load or settings to configure, it's just plug-and-play :-)<br /><br />Warning:  I tried a non-apple brand of HDMI adapter first (about $5 cheaper) -- it also only had the HDMI output, no replicated dock port, and it was a piece of garbage -- it never worked.  And even if it did, there was no way to power/charge the device while it was in use -- imagine getting half way through a movie only for your device to run out of power -- no fun!  Buy the official device here and you'll have much better success.
B0036T31YY|1.0|This movie was horrible.   If you enjoy crossword puzzles you make like this movie if your intoxicated.  But if you just want straight entertainment select something else.  I have no problem with a movie challenging me as a viewer, but it repeated the same scenes several times and still did not provide a solution to the main character's problem.  For a suspense/horror this movie was a straight H.A.M.   (Hot A$$ Mess).
B0051BLT4O|3.0|I enjoyed this ebook and definitely got some tips for improving my food photography, but I was constantly being distracted and even annoyed by the photos in the book. Often the captions did not match the photos or were in the wrong section; at times photos were entirely missing. For example, in the section \\"Create a Scene\\", the last photo has a caption \\"Here's to Summertime and Sunday suppers back home\\". The photo is not mentioned until the next section \\"Show and Tell\\". OK, flipping back to see it wasn't a big deal. But what is a big deal is that the photo itself has nothing to do with the caption nor with the text that refers to it. It is the cover photo from the book itself.    So maybe the problem is not with the ebook but with the Kindle reader software (running on iPad). If this is case, I will happily increase my rating. Can anyone let me know? Thanks.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|We love playing with the original Perplexus, Inc. so when I found this it was a no-brainer to get as a gift for my just turning 12-year old son. He was so excited when he opened it and started playing right away. What followed was a bunch of screams, shouts, outbursts of frustration and general anxiety - all the things he loves about a challenge! It was not easy to get through but eventually, he conquered the entire maze.<br /><br />There are numerous starting points so that you don't have to start at #1 every time. This is great for when you just can't make it past a spot and need to clear your mind with another pathway.<br /><br />The biggest differences I see between the two Perplexus are shorter containing walls, harder tip over areas and a completely new set of challenges.<br /><br />The outer plastic is a little thinner but this doesn't take away from the quality of the design. Ours is well built and will hopefully last a long time.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is not for the easily frustrated, it will take time and a lot of patience!
B0015XASFS|5.0|I loved this CD / DVD, it's absoulity Magnificent.  Josh Groban is absoulity Magnificent.  I HIGHLEY Recamend this CD / DVD to anyone and Everyone.
1439165645|5.0|The Hundred-Foot Journey.  Richard C. Morais.  I loved this book.  I could almost taste the flavors of the Indian and French cooking.  This story of a gifted chef, his quirky family, and his adjustment to a new and strange culture, while excelling at its own prized `game' is moving and edifying.  Like a good meal, it is gentle although at times fiery, interesting, and educational.  Above all, it is satisfying. Ionabicycle

B005DC68NI|5.0|With feet placed securely on the ground, David Gaughran leads the reader through the state of the industry as it is now, tips for bringing work to market, and ensuring it is seen. I've already embraced indie authoring for my back-list, but \\"Let's Get Digital\\" was more than worth the money for its suggestions. The appendices are superb, and I'd like to thank all the individual authors who shared their experiences, and their sales figures, for being so candid. Overall I consider it to be an invaluable aid to anyone on the brink wondering which way to jump. Jump this way first, you'll not be disappointed.
B001GKJ2FW|3.0|I like this movie, but the one thing that I can't figure out is what is a Digital Copy; I have tried to play it in both the Regular AND the Blue-Ray DVD Players and it Doesn't even work, so I haven't a clue to why the Manufactoring Companies insist on putting something in when it doesn't even work.  If and only if it's meant for the Computer, then why don't these Manufacting Companies say that its for the Computer.  I HATE Guessing Games, and these Manufactoing Companies insist on playing Guessing Games with people that know Practiclly Nothing when it comes to such things as a Digital Copy of Any Movie.  If these editodic Fool Harded Companies are going to insist in putting these Digital Copies in with Movies, then in my own Opinion, I would have to say that these Companies / Business's MUST also Include Instrctions in just how Exactley these Digital Copies are to Work and are to be Played!  But will these Compnaies / Business's Include Extreamly Simplafied Instructions in how to go about the Playing of these DIgital Copies, NO they Won't, so why are they Waisting Everyone's Time and Money by Including a Digital Copy of some Movies, when a Percentage { % } of the Worlds Population is 100 % Clueless in how these Digital Copies Work and are to be Played?      So what I do with ALL Digital Copies of any movie that I get, I Shreed it Up in my Shreeder, for the reason's because One { 1 } it doesn't work, and secondly { 2ndly } I haven't any ideaa to how it is supposed to be played!  So why should I go waisting Money and Space for something that I haven't any idea to how it is to be played AND how it works.
1416550550|4.0|This story spans 5 generations of women and the secrets they keep.  The protagonist of the book is in England trying to uncover the history, and story, of her grandmothers strange journey to Australia.  The book jumps around a bit and is told from several points of view.  At times it is hard to remember what the granddaughters knows and what only the reader knows.  Ther is also a lovely hint of romance that almost redeems the failed romances the book outlines.  Overall an enjoyable read.

B004EBT7RI|1.0|Why oh why does the Kindle version have to be more expensive than the paperback version.  It makes me want to boycott the book until the pricing structure is reviewed.  Does anyone else out there feel the same?
0553801473|2.0|This is a book written to make money.  It does not move a story forward, it is not exciting or mysterious or romantic.  It just plods along going nowhere.  George may be making a lot of money, but his reputation as an author is just fading away.
0439023491|5.0|Loved this series of books and was very disappointed when I finished the last book.  Now I have to find something new and engulfing to read and it won't be easy.
0385341679|5.0|It's hard to say anything about this book without including spoilers, but I'll give it a shot.   I LOVED this series! I did get frustrated while reading because the story is spread out over all five books. There is no conclusion at the end of the first four books, just more questions. Fortunately, I discovered this series after the fifth book had been published, so I was able to read them all straight through. I hear that KMM is writing a spin-off series, and I can NOT wait. All the important questions were answered, but there are some characters I would like to see more of.   Great writing, great story. Definitely recommend.
B004OR1X6A|4.0|Notes from San Francisco is a good album, not a great one. The liner notes and pictures, although stylish are not informative nor relevant to Rory. The studio disc is interesting, but not really that different from the original songs. However, some unreleased songs are good. The live disc is very good and worth the price of admission alone. we lost a good one.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Jack Reacher isn't your typical hero so don't look for that in this story. He's a bit scary but the guy you want by your side when things get rough. He finds himself charged with murder almost minutes after coming into the town of Margrave, Georgia. It is one tense situation after another for Jack as he navigates through each, trying to figure out who he can trust and how to shake off this town. It doesn't take long to be drawn into this intricate web of lies and mystery.<br /><br />The writer uses a first person narrative to tell the story, which allows you to track Jack's reasoning and strategies in real time. The writing style took some getting used to and made it a slower read for about the first half of the book. Once I adapted to the style, it became synonymous with Jack.<br /><br />The pace of the story was swift even when the writing style slowed me down. While there were some predictable moments, there were some things that happened I never saw coming with a pretty exciting finish. I still have some unanswered questions about Jack and am intrigued enough to continue reading this series.<br /><br />Great first book in the series.

B000I9YWDO|5.0|One of the 5 funniest movies I know of.  But I don't think this was a good move, in retrospect, for Ron Livingston.  He is so hilarious and memorable in this role that, at least for me, it has been impossible to take him seriously in any other role, such as the officer in BAND OF BROTHERS.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I highly recommend it. You'll be exited about how the story unfolds from beginning to end.The plot is never boring, predictable, nor over-done like nowadays movies seem to be.Matthew McConaughey at his best!
B000IZXR7U|4.0|What you're looking at here -- or at least, the product I think I'm writing this review for -- is the very first \\"Mad Max,\\" the one that put a young Mel Gibson on the map.  The later one, though, \\"Mad Max:  Beyond Thunderdome\\" is the one everybody knows.<br /><br />This one is low-budget filmmaking at its best.<br /><br />Two points:<br /><br />1.  For some absurd reason those who put out this DVD decided to dub the original \\"Australian\\" into American English.  What an insult.  Really, how dumb do they think we are?<br /><br />2.  Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.<br /><br />3.  How'd they get that music?  Wow.  That was an impressively well-done score.<br /><br />4.  Film was crying out for aerial shots!  Too bad they apparently couldn't afford a crane or helicopter.
B004C4IKCU|5.0|Elvis Presley was fat and playing Vegas when I started tuning into his music.  Sure, I'd heard \\"Hound Dog\\" as a boy, but I played \\"Purple People Eater\\" more than Elvis.  It is a treat for me now to hear this Legacy Edition of two of his albums that I never heard with some added singles on each disc.  While all recordings are a product of their time, some of the music reads as dated, interesting like looking at a musical fossil.  However, some of it is incredibly stunning!  Elvis' take on Peggy Lee's classic \\"Fever\\" is one I NEVER heard!  Elvis smokes on the track with his voice trembling and the percussion subtle but wonderful.  The Drifters' \\"Such a Night\\" pulses joyfully with Elvis savoring each sonic kiss.  \\"It Feels So Right\\" bakes delightfully as Elvis turns up the heat, \\"If it feels so right, how can it be wrong?\\"  \\"A Mess of Blues\\" from the added tracks joyfully swaggers.  On the second disc, \\"His Latest Flame\\" plays like a rock tango.  \\"Little Sister\\" is one of my very favorite Elvis tracks with its naughty playfulness.  \\"Good Luck Charm\\" still sets my toe tapping and puts a smile on my face.  \\"Elvis Is Back!\\" Legacy Edition is a great set of music from one of American musical icons.  Enjoy!
B004EPYZUI|2.0|Ehh...I enjoyed the action scenes, but the rest...the story and how it played out in the asylum/brothel was retarded...how can I describe this movie........maybe an action chick flick?  I still don't know...I watched the movie and was impressed by the action sequences, but that was all.....I felt disappointed in almost everything else....I will not buy this movie nor would I recommend it to anyone
0553801473|2.0|Now we know what took six years to complete.  It sure was NOT this book, that seems to have been contrived and written in a couple of weekends.  It was the HBO contract that took six years to finalise.  Anyone else find it convenient that this title only came out after Season 1 on HBO was complete?<br />The book stumbles and rambles along.  I found myself actually skipping to the end of chapters just to get them over with.<br />Contrived cliff-hangers, characters that enter, impact little and less and then disappear, it just goes on and on and on to nowhere.  Very boring.  There is very little real storytelling just endings that try to startle you into saying \\"Well I didn't see that coming!\\"  And I mean TRY...<br />The beauty of the first few books allowed for the entry of mysteries that had the potential for explanation on a grander scale.  This grandeur fades rapidly as you enter The Dance.<br /><br />Martin has lost his way.<br /><br />Look out for the next book after Season 3 on HBO.  That is my prediction.  And wait that long to buy them both.<br />The second star is for Tyrion and Dolorous Edd.

B003AYBCV4|3.0|I was hoping to get my socks knocked off like the other Sonic Fidelity discs I gave recently bought, but this one is not a huge improvement over the other pressings available, at least the ones I have heard. I am sure it is all because of the original recording, and we have not technically gotten to the point of being able to restore some. Or maybe it cost too much...   This version has an underlying grit to it, to the point I thought that it was a bad cable or some other issue with my system so I changed the disc over to my other player, also HDCD capable, but the grit remained. Same results on another system.  Like most of the SF discs I have heard, the bass is punchier, and the imaging is good, but with the Simon and Garfunkle, some of the instruments that were buried in the mix are now up front and their poor recording is evident.  Leaves That are Green, cut 2, has a shaker or some sort of percussion instrument that sounds more like crackling plastic wrap. I don't remember ever hearing that before but it is not pleasant.  I hope that someday these  great old albums can get to a point of full restoration, but this version definitely comes up short.  I will continue to try the other Sonic Fidelity discs.  I have Songs in the key of Life, Hell Bent for Leather, Walking Man, and all are fantastic discs.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book, I thought the charecters were great, and the story was good. can't wait for the next one to find out what will happen next.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|This movie is targeted more towards young adults. You can tell by the modern-day language and the Twilight-esque cinematography, but that is probably due mostly to the fact that the films have the same director. I think the characters should have had accents or at the very least they should've spoken proper English, but, again, tweens were the main target for this flick. They probably won't care much about those kinds of little details with sexy Peter and Henry vying for Valerie's affections. Sex-crazed teeny boppers drool over a good, hot love triangle, but I have to admit that I certainly enjoy that, too. Aside from the steamy stuff, I did like the mystery of the wolf. I thought I had him/her figured out, but my guesses were incorrect. That made me happy, because I am tired of predictable movies these days. Hollywood needs more original ideas. This movie is far from being totally original, but I appreciate its good twist on a classic.<br /><br />On another note, I love Gary Oldman, and I think he is always a great addition to any film no matter what role he plays. He does quirky, weird characters very well. I think his part as the priest was extinguished a little quickly, and I was hoping to see him through to the end (even though he was kind of a bad guy). So that was a little disappointing.<br /><br />The movie's ending was kind of left a little open yet it was satisfying. I rented this for a buck, but I kind of wish I'd gone to see it on the big screen.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|McCartney's first solo album, recorded as the Beatles were disintegrating, and released in the April 1970 slot originally slated for [[ASIN:B0025KVLV0 Let it Be]], remains the least polished record in a legendary perfectionist's career. Many of the songs, particularly the numerous instrumentals, are sketches and jams rather than finished productions, and even some of the lyrical tunes are fragments rather complete compositions. For a lesser artist this might be uninteresting, but for someone of McCartney's stature, the album provides a candid picture of the isolation he suffered in his break with the Beatles. McCartney played all of the instruments, overdubbing on a Studer 4-track tape recorder he had installed in his home; the opening excerpt \\"The Lovely Linda\\" was the first piece he recorded, and provides a snapshot of the love that helped pull him through the darkness.<br /><br />McCartney indulges his creative impulses, experimenting with verbal rhythms on the bluesy \\"That Would Be Something,\\" adding inventively sparse percussion, and creating an eerie menagerie of vibrating wine glasses. He digs deeply into the soul of his bass and rips up some twangy blues on guitar, momentarily invoking the reprise of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" in the middle of \\"Momma Miss America.\\" The song \\"Teddy Boy\\" was rescued from the Get Back film, and the album's most polished jewels, \\"Every Night\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" became popular album cuts on FM radio. The latter, among McCartney's greatest songs, became a hit single in live form seven years later, but the original retains an intimacy that the Wings version didn't capture.<br /><br />Hear/Concord's 2011 reissue offers a crisp remaster of the original album, along with a seven-track bonus disc. The new tracks include two original session pieces (\\"Suicide\\" and \\"Don't Cry Baby\\"), a demo of \\"Women Kind,\\" a 1973 performance of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" from an early Wings television special, and three live tracks from an oft-bootlegged 1979 Wings show in Glasgow. The all-cardboard four-panel slipcase and booklet neatly deconstruct the original gatefold album's photo collage, beautifully reproducing Linda McCartney's images in viewable sizes. The album and bonus tracks would just as easily have fit on a single CD, and the Q&A which accompanied the original press copies of the album would have been a real treat, but it's easy to second guess, and what's here is a treat.

0141806699|5.0|Every now and again, there's a reader of recorded books who is vastly superior to all others. Ms. Thomas is such a reader and this odd titled book is made all the more memorable by her reading. Buy it knowing that hours of entertainment lie ahead.    CD arrived quickly in perfect shape.
0395389496|3.0|This has never been one of my favorite Christmas stories. I bought it for my husband our first Christmas after we got married since it was one of his favorites. This is a nice edition. The pictures are good and the book is a nice addition to any Christmas library. But personally, I've never understood why this is such a classic. I don't feel that there is much to the story at all. But, like I said, my husband loves it so maybe our kids will too.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|I wanted to love this movie but i thought it was just ok.....the kids liked it but they werent WOWed by it. Its language seemed a little too adult and a lot of jokes were adult based and the kids didnt understand. So its a 3 star movie from me.. Its worth the 3 dollar rental but not the 14 dollars to buy the DVD.
B004I11VZ0|4.0|I loved IP Man, awesome movie with an incredible story.<br />When I heard there was a part 2 I had to see it.<br />And...<br />Excellent acting for the most part.<br />Pacing, score, direction were all done well.<br /><br />The movie had me just like the original but then for some reason they wanted to go into \\"boxing vs Kung Fu\\".<br />This direction really baffled me as it didn't seem to fit with the themes presented in IP Man or the first half of the sequel.<br /><br />The whole boxing vs martial arts seems a tad ridiculious to begin with.<br />I think it has less to do with the method and much more to do with the fighter themselves as to who would win in such a match.<br />Both forms of fighting are beautiful and require great discipline.<br />That's really my only complaint about IP Man 2, the Brits were portrayed as very one dimensional and none of them could act very well either.<br /><br />That point asided IP Man 2 is still an excellent Kung Fu movie that deserves to be seen just for the awesome fight sequences in the first half of the movie.<br />Recommended.

0596809158|5.0|You will be disappointed if you are a competent R programmer looking for \\"hacks\\". Note that the only negative review so far mentions its author's four-year experience with R. Mine is much shorter, yet I too find the book too \\"junior\\" for my needs. (With \\"R in Nutshell\\" and Google at my disposal, I can send \\"R Cookbook\\" back after making several notes to record what I learnt from it. There are several nuggets that you will not find in \\"R in Nutshell\\", or will not think to google). However, the book is not advertised as an \\"R in Depth\\", so no complaints.<br /><br />\\"R Cookbook\\" is a friendly and highly informative introduction to \\"general-purpose\\" R (one half of the book) and doing basic statistics with R (the other half). A chapter on time series, with a look at \\"zoo\\" package, is a bonus; a somewhat light (but does-the-job) take on R graphics may be viewed as a downside, but I see the benefit of getting the basics right, and letting the reader explore other resources - I would recommend \\"R Graphs Cookbook\\" and Quick-R Web site - when he/she is ready.<br /><br />Yes, there are free R tutorials out on the Web - but given that this one is widely praised and inexpensive (even if you are never going to resell it - and at some point you probably should, and move to \\"R in Nutshell\\" - $25 is not too much. How much saved time is worth $25 for you?), why not take a look?<br /><br />PS. \\"R in Action\\" by Robert Kabacoff is another option, and one that I actually like better.<br /><br />PPS. The second edition of Michael Crawley's \\"R Book\\" is a large improvement over the first, and is a stronger competitor to both \\"R Cookbook\\" and \\"R in Action\\".
B0019NB9A2|5.0|A fine movie. A retelling of \\" The Tempest\\", but done in a way that can be enjoyed on many levels.   This film, with its state of the art affects, adventure, robot and just plain fun, was the \\"Star Wars\\" of its day.  The writing is good. The actors are well chosen for there rolls, and who wouldn't like seeing Ann Frances (T.Vs Honey West) in short, 1950 style Sci-Fi dresses?   All in all a just plain good movie. One that can be enjoyed over and over.   If you don't agree, then you can just go to Krell.
B004OT2UE2|4.0|Ok let me start off and say that the minifigures are AWESOME! The best minifig would be wolffe. He has leg printing,front and back printing, and helmet printing. I was very surprized when i saw that he has a different face too which has a white eye and a scar on it.The only other different clone face is Rex's face. The wolfpack trooper is cool too. i bought like 3 of these on ebay. the two new jedi: quinlan voz and eeth koth have very good detail but to me they both look a little stupid. And theres also yoda from the att,nothing special.Now the frigate looks much like the Republic cruiser that came with qui gon jin and obi wan but the frigate is a war ship and the republic crusier was used for diplomatic missions. The frigate has many cool details such as opening cockpits,an escape pod, and lots of turrets. A really good feature is that theres a handle on th top to carry it which is very useful. The price is a bit high but its worth it.It would have been better if it was $119 instead of $129.    Ratings:  Playability: 8/10  Minifigure: 10/10  Feature: 8.5/10  Price:(10 being expensive 1 being cheap) 7/10  Overall:8.5/10
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This CD is AMAZING!!!!! A lot of people hated on this cd for being \\"too poppy\\".. Never stopping to consider that maybe Muse was trying to take their message of resistance to the more pop saturated mind controlled crowd instead of to those who are already on the fringe of society already lol.. Who did Jesus go to? Was it the pharisees, those who knew God's laws, or the thieves and prostitutes? I'm an atheist, so don't start anybody lol, but I think you get my point.. He came to talk to those who people thought were beyond hope.. That's how I see Muse in this album.. Traditional muse fans' favorite albums will probably be something else rather than this one, but, hell, this album actually got radio play!!!! LOL.. Could Matthew Bellamy be the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ???? I think we all know the answer is \\"I think so\\"..<br /><br />That said.. This CD stands on it's own even without Muse's past work.. I would probably really like Muse even if this was the only CD by them I'd ever heard.. It freaking RULES!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
006088732X|5.0|This book is a wonderful book to read. It keeps your interest and introduces the characters and plot in a timely manner. I would highly recomend this book to any girls ages 14-19 who are interested in reading a mystery book with all the drama of your own life!
B003Y74KCK|4.0|This is a good - not great - case. The back part fits nicely & it stays on without falling off on its own (which is crucial). I did not like that the top sides are a little loose but like I said it's not enough so that the covet falls off; it's enough so a little dirt gets on the top of the metal parts (it's probably a little loose so you can get your phone in & out without struggling anyway). Overall, this case is worth the money you pay but don't get it if you want intense protection; in that case go with the Otterbox or something similar (though those cases completely kill the sleek look of this phone; this case maintains it to a greater degree). You should buy screen protectors whether you own this case or not, but definitely use a screen protector with this case so dirt that sneaks in won't scratch your phone & the front has minimum protection so protectors will keep the front scratch-free as well. I do like the minimum coverage on the front though because, as I've said, it doesn't disrupt the sleekness of the phone's appearance.
0062060554|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but will admit I was a bit disappointed in the ending.  With the overall tone of this novel, I would have preferred an alternate ending that included one of the final scenes when Mike is burning the missing pages of Christine's journal through which she had just discovered that the man she had been living all along with was not, in fact, her husband but rather her attacker. This chapter would have ended with her watching as he burned her memories leaving her with the paralyzing fear of knowing that tomorrow when she woke up, she would remember nothing of those missing journal entries and would go on believing that this man was indeed her husband. The final page of the novel would mirror the opening of the novel, with Christine waking up, not knowing who she is or where she is, looking at the strange man laying next to her in bed and him finally waking up to explain, as he does every morning, who she is and that he is her \\"husband\\" who loves her. On a side note, I don't wish for this to be the ending because I have anything against Christine's character, I simply feel as though this would have added to the psychological terror of this book--I mean, could you even imagine this alternate ending?? It would have rocked me to the core, which is just what I wanted from this novel, an ending to elicit precisely the reaction that Dennis Lehane explains having on the dust jacket of the book, that the novel \\". . . left my nerves jangling for hours after I finished the last page.\\"

B004BLJQOK|5.0|...that I would see the day when I watch and enjoy a vampire romance. One of the most despised genres in my book!<br />Ok, it is more horror than romance, and the romance is of a very tender age of 12 years, and stays appropriate to the age. No Lolita vampirism here, no precocious liberties either. More holding hands and shy smiles. And the young lady shows her horror mettle in a sufficiently creepy way to keep you interested.<br />Very good remake of a Swedish hit movie after a novel called Let the Right One In.<br />Recommendable if you appreciate the occasional better horror.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I decided to read reviews after I'd finished the book, so I had no positive or negative feelings going into it. I'll make this short and sweet, but I think there couldn't have been a better ending. Katniss is only a 17 year old girl, and her feelings throughout the book seem exactly what they should be. I read how many people weren't pleased with the ending, but it's wartime, and you lose ones you love during war. You see what kind of person she really is at the epilogue, when she's living with all that she's endured, yet her life is full and complete. Loved this book, and personally think that any happier of an ending would have stripped the story of its poignancy.
031603441X|5.0|First, I have to state that I love The Rolling Stones. Not The Rolling Stones of the last 15 - 20 years (except live in concert, which I saw 5 years ago, and they were still amazing). But the Stones of the four shot run of near perfect rock and roll albums: Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Street. And then, if I had to get all teenage girl like goofy on who is my favorite Stone, it would be Keith: the quintessential rock and roller - and all around role model for most of us wannabe cool kids growing up in the sixties and seventies. All that said, I was really looking forward to reading his book - and then the dilemma of hardback prices verses waiting for the paperback, and I want to read it now, and the queue at the public library had me somewhere around 150 in line for reserving the book, and yeah, I thought - when am I going to get to read this damn book?<br /><br />**Shameless namedropping alert**<br /><br />Segue to two weeks ago, I'm staying at my friend and fellow writer Rob Roberge's house out in the desert by Palm Springs and we got to talking about Keith's book, as Rob had already read it. I asked, \\"you've a copy?\\" And Rob said he did, but that Gayle, his wife, was reading it. But then Gayle said she wasn't really reading it and I could while I was there, and so I started and I got totally engrossed, as the first chapter really draws you in - and then it was time for me to go home, and I asked if I could borrow the book - and then Rob says actually it's Craig Clevenger's copy (Craig had recently been staying out in the desert finishing up his newest book) and he had left it, plus Craig hadn't read it yet, so Rob wasn't so sure he wanted to lend it out - but then he said, \\"actually, it's Craig's Sister's book.\\" Which was a whole nother animal, as obviously Craig was so \\"irresponsible\\" as to have just left his sister's book lying around at someone else's house, that he sort of forfeited his claiming rights in absentia, that I figured hell, I'm a responsible guy, I don't lose books, let me borrow it, please, please, please - come on.<br /><br />And that's how I came to read: Life: Keith Richards.<br /><br />Now, before I go any further, I have to preface this by admitting I don't read \\"childhood\\" sections of most memoirs. I really don't give a damn what your freaking childhood was like, as really, in most cases, it has not all to do with what I'm usually interested in, which is what a person has done with their life that makes them worthy of my wanting to read them and find out more about them. Sorry if that's upsetting. But what Keith was doing before the Stones just doesn't really matter to me and after the first chapter, it's on to Keith as a young-in and I just skipped ahead 50 odd pages to when he first met Mick.<br /><br />To read Keith's take on how the Stones became who they are, and how they got there is amazing. As an avid Stones fan the details and inside information Keith divulges is way more than cool. But then, I had to stop reading and look for the writing credits, as Keith may be a lot of things: songwriter, guitar player, dopefiend, movie actor, crazed Englishman - but as far as I know he's not a writer, and has never said he was. And here it lists James Fox, a \\"journalist for the Sunday Times in London,\\" and an international best selling author, who was given the credit of \\"with,\\" as in \\"Keith Richards LIFE, with James Fox.\\" So what is this: rock and roll billing on a literary level? But what I'm thinking here, due to the narrative nature of the book's \\"voice.\\" Is Keith told all this to, or recorded it for, Fox - and he put it all together - I know, yes, brilliant of me to conclude that and all. But anyway, I only bring this up to say the writing is well done, and Fox strives hard to keep it in Richards' voice, and narrative pace.<br /><br />And then I don't know if any of you have read Bob Dylan's unsatisfyingly vague: Chronicles, Volume 1, where he never mentions usingdrugs, or that he says \\"my wife\\" but doesn't say which wife, he's had two, hardly mentions making albums, or recording sessions, and well - it's safe to say that Dylan's book, while beautiful in its prose, didn't really leave me feeling I knew much more about Dylan than I did before I read it. However, thankfully this isn't the case with Life. Richards tells all. He doesn't leave out anything He gives you the dark underbelly, and the glamour. In fact he keeps telling so much that I started to get bored, and at times, a bit annoyed. Keith was a junkie - with a line on some really good drugs. He had heroin he had to cut %97 - or it'd kill you. People gave him jars of pharmaceutical cocaine. When he had to kick heroin, William Burroughs lent him his nurse to administer the meds. When he got busted, mega-lawyers were there to get him out of jail and the charges pretty much dismissed - so when Keith complains about how hard it is being Keith for the 100th time, somewhere around page 400, I had to put the book down. For the time being, I'd had enough Keith.<br /><br />But then I was on the phone with Rob, and no he wasn't calling about me returning the book, thank you very much - thankfully, there's still a few trusting souls left in the world (and besides, Clevenger still hasn't returned, so mums the word on that). And I said, \\"Man, I had to stop reading it.\\" He said, \\"Yeah, but you gotta get to where he disses Mick.\\" And I'm like, \\"oh yeah, right.\\" So I picked the book up again and muscled through.<br /><br />I don't think it's the best book on rock and roll. I don't think it's the definitive tell all by a musician. I don't think it will win any literary awards. But I did find it a great read on the greatest rock band in history, by the greatest rock musician still alive and kicking. And I think it a book that Keith should be very proud of. He's put a lot of himself out there - and given more than most.t say which wife, he's had two, hardly mentions making albums, or recording sessions, and well - it's safe to say that Dylan's book, while beautiful in its prose, didn't really leave me feeling I knew much more about Dylan than I did before I read it.

B000784WMW|2.0|Great acting by Timothy Dalton, but he's too gorgeous for Mr. Rochester. I can't believe no other women wanted him except for his money. I thought Mr. Rochester and Jane in this version are mismatched. This Jane just looked like a self-righteous older woman with weak voice...not likable at all. She often looked annoyed or irritated, instead of having inner strength. I couldn't see how Mr. Rochester can be attracted to her. After reading the book, I felt like I couldn't have enough of Jane and Mr. Rochester, but this adaptation gave me some bad after taste.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|The movie's plot/story line sucks, ok? It leaves you with many questions that are not answered and then the director takes you on these weird visual tours of Manhattan. Why? I don't know. Probably to distract the viewers from his failures. BUT the movie is entertaining enough to keep you engaged. Those weird visual tours/effects are pleasing enough not to complain much about the plot. Bradly Cooper is a good and promising actor and does his best in this one. All in all, this movie is entertaining and fun to watch....

B002GHHHKQ|4.0|Fraught with controversies and lawsuits, misinformation, outright lies; it's a miracle of stubbornness that this film ever got made and has such a devoted (overprotective) following.  Personally, I don't know what to make of this film.  It frustrates and annoys me and yet I found it absolutely absorbing, something I couldn't turn away from, even at its lowest ebb.  At all times it is entertaining.  But it is also manipulative, filled with stock character types rather than genuine people, and a story that is obvious; nothing truly surprised me about this film.  And yet, I still liked it.  I'm trying to figure out why.<br />The opening sequence is magical in its simplicity and beauty.  It gives one pause to wonder.  Unfortunately, how and why we wonder is soon taken away from us by a story that literally maps out exactly what we should feel, when, and why.  Allowing us to arrive at our own conclusions was taken away, I find that galling and not a little insulting.  I was also put off by the heavy handed way in which religion was presented (making Christians either lunatics or self-righteous nitwits).  This was less a story about discovery and more about the politics that might surround such an incredible occurrence.  All the fringe ugliness dampened whatever enthusiasm would be inherent in such a life altering moment.  This is a great idea, mishandled.  Why the botched \\"contact\\" moment?  Why all the nastiness with James Woods maniacal character?  If you want to tarnish and kill an ending, that's the way to do it!<br />On the other hand....there is that magnificent performance by Jodie Foster (and Jena Malone) as Dr. Eleanor Arroway.  John Hurt was bizarre (in a good way) as the mysterious S.R. Hadden.  It was so nice to see David Morse play something other than a bad guy, the same goes for William Fichtner.<br />In the end, I find myself justifying why I liked this movie in spite of all its negative points (that would include Jake Busey & Rob Lowe).  I think that what I liked most was the notion that this could be possible, and wouldn't it be great if it was.  I think that for a film to inspire that (hope) is something special in itself.<br /><br />I've often found myself peering up at the night sky, wondering if anyone is out there...wondering if anyone is out there.t was the notion that this could be possible, and wouldn't it be great if it was.

0596809158|2.0|I'm not a statistician, but I've used R for analyzing data for about four years now.  I had hoped that this book would be a real \\"cook book\\" that would unlock some secrets that would make more more effective. I expected that I would have the book lying open next to my keyboard. But I think it will just sit on my bookshelf, unused.    Most of the book just summarizes what you could learn from reading the on-line help. I expected detailed worked examples. The structure of the books follows a 'You want to do this, here's how to do it\\" format. But the \\"you want to do this\\" sections are more like \\"You want to use xyplot, here's the function call.\\" But I can read about that from the command line.  Not helpful.     Perhaps the book would be useful for someone just starting out, but there are plenty of on-line PDF versions of \\"Intro to R\\" books that you can print out for free.     I feel like a spent $30 for nothing.

0307346617|3.0|My favorite part is when the zombies are sitting around the campfire, eating brains and farting.    No, no, I'm just kidding. That was my obligatory reviewer's remark bringing up Max Brooks' famous filmmaker father, Mel. The younger Brooks' approach to horror is considerably less slapstick than his dad's. In \\"World War Z,\\" he sets out to be a kind of Studs Terkel of the Living Dead, compiling the personal stories of those who lived through the zombie apocalypse.    After decades of enjoying zombie carnage in print and on film, I was beginning to wonder if America and Italy were the only countries afflicted by shambling hordes of the hungry dead. Not so. Brooks' docu-novel explores zombie outbreaks affecting communist China, the Middle East conflict, industrial super powers, the Third World and all other points on the globe -- and even in orbit above it.    For me, the oral history format and the multiple POVs have a distancing effect. There's no hero or group of characters to get attached to and follow throughout the novel. But whether or not the method of storytelling entirely works for me personally, Brooks does an impressive job of replicating a world's worth of voices and making them diverse and distinguishable. And for the most part, he evades the pitfall of so many stories told in vocal flashbacks -- that of characters with total recall and the eloquence of a best-selling novelist. Although it's doubtful anyone would say in conversation, \\"I reached the freeway, looming above the swamp like the ruins of a Roman aqueduct,\\" Brooks generally keeps his literary aspirations in check and avoids that kind of obvious artifice. His characters talk like people talk, and their recollections are authentically fuzzy around the edges.    Aside from a few stumbling lunges at satire that suggest Brooks is better off leaving the funny stuff to Dad, \\"World War Z\\" reads like a real-life document of a real-life invasion by real-dead zombies.
1451629184|5.0|I read this book not really knowing what to expect. Jaycee was 11 years old and she was abducted and raped and kept prisoner for 18 years in the backyard of a perverted sex offender and his scumbag wife.  While I found the details of her early years incredibly graphic and horrific, I can so appreciate how vague she becomes after years passed.  This was part of her survival and I applaud her.  I was a victim of sexual abuse and I did not have the courage to speak up.  Years later my abuser was \\"caught\\" and now spends his remaining years in jail.  Although this book details the taking and the rape and the giving birth and all of the other ugliness, it most importantly (in my mind) clearly details the sickness of her kidnapper.  It also clearly depicts the role of the enablers - the wives, the families, the parole officers. I too tried to believe that my abuser had changed and therefore my silence was acceptable.  Jaycee throws the door wide open as to why sex offenders should not be allowed to roam free to continue to feed their sickness.      The memories of an 11 year old child are indeed graphic.  Jaycee's survival mode was to block out and live beyond the nightmare.  Her animals and her children became her focus - not the craziness of her kidnapper.  The fact that she survived and seems to be adjusting is remarkable and a miracle.      Finally, I would just like to mention that I too saw the interview with Diane Sawyer and I was amazed and in awe of Jaycee's attitude of not wasting a moment more on her kidnapper.... that she was not going to waste energy on hate.  This is powerful stuff and I love that attitude.
0684824906|3.0|The best thing about this book is is the picture of the many actual and potential presidential candidates for 1860. It's a sort of challenge to the reader to identify them all by role. The lesser the role, the more interesting the identification problem. Beyond the first page though it's hard to justify the publicity attending this work.     The title doesn't quite work as the principles were in no way rivals beyond the election of 1860. Kearns doesn't stray from well beaten paths. She is excessively careful to avoid any aspersions on the legacy of Abraham Lincoln. The book fails to examine any negative side of Lincoln's legacy. His racism, coercion of early secessionists and his wartime mistakes are hardly mentioned. Nor does she seem to place any blame on Lincoln for the choice of Andrew Johnson as his running mate in 1864.    Lincoln's character, his self education, political and polemic skills as well as his humor has been well documented by many predecessors. The only questions examined have been well resolved by previous writers. Try Stampp, McPherson, Borritt, Foner, Randle, LaWanda Cox, or even Ken Burns. For a non conventional view read Thomas DiLorenzo, whose presentations apparently don't fit the popular need to read only works justifying preconceived notions.    Kearns does an extensive job of describing the characteristics and backgrounds of Seward, Chase and the Blairs, concentrating as much on family and social life as on political philosophy. There is little new or enlightening in the realm of politics. For example, Seward's \\"irrepressible conflict\\" statement is given as a truism without discussion. Chase's controversial judicial role is given minimal coverage. I would be more impressed by an equivalent work on the Confederacy cabinet. But that is not likely to sell as many books.    Much too slavish adherence to the popular line for my taste. Enjoy the front-piece and skim the rest.
B0055D3EOG|2.0|The way insidious started, it had the potential to become one of the scariest movies of all time.  The first hour or so were confusing, with great setup and even better execution.  The type of great scary movie where you know something scary is going to happen and are still scared out of your mind when it does!  This was great.  But then the movie went quickly downhill.  The last part was some stupid, goofy bad movie which you wouldn't want to have anything to do with.    How did this movie go so far off track? Did the director go home or the writer's get fired? It just went so bad so quickly.  What a shame because it had such promise.  Save your money and don't rent or buy this turkey.
1573921394|5.0|It takes a bit of hubris to post a review of this great work, but it's not quite as abstruse as its reputation. Well organized in terms of separate ideas the book enables the reader to study each idea in isolation. Employment theory, monetary policy, stimulus, consumption, investment and savings can be studied separately before attempting to understand a total Keynesian theory, or else rely on more up to date versions by Samuelson or Skidelsky. Of course, it's likely that the whole edifice, with interrelations, can only be held in the mind of J.M. Keynes.    Reading the book serves to emphasize that the decline that Keynes' reputation has suffered in recent decades is not justified. The left has hijacked Keynes' theory as justification for egalitarian motivated stimulus spending. Conservatives blame him for liberal excesses. Neither derogation is justified.    The book sheds light on a number of points, relevant to the current state of the US economy.  Keynes use of inflation extended only to relating an economy after a depression, not as a tool to finance social spending. Keynes never advocated the social spending in good times and bad that has leading to the current  permanent debt and deficits. His idea was to stimulate economy by social spending in bad times and replenish funds by running a surplus in times of economic growth.     The book shows Keynes to be far from a closed minded ideologue as he appreciated the work of rival economists Hayek, Schumpeter, Pigou, Sraffa and even Irving Fisher. My bet would be that he would have melded his work with that of Milton Friedman in place of the current ideological controversy manufactured by their politically minded successors.    Kudos to Paul Samuelson for stating Keynes' ideas in terms of modern economics, understandable to the current reader.  It is a great help in understanding Keynes to read about his life and ideas as written by Robert Skidelsky. Skidelsky shows that Keynes was about more than mathematical economics, having great appreciation for sociology and ethics.
1603090002|4.0|As a fan of the LoEG, I had to pick this up.  The new League is back deal with a new threat.  The main character of the story is Nemo's daughter Janni who is the most interesting part of the book.  Probably the most developed of the characters.<br /><br />Speaking of such you might want to look up Carnacki the Ghost Hunter and A.J. Raffles the Gentleman Thief.<br /><br />One thing that is great about this issue is the artwork; O'Neill again does a great job.  The oft maligned Black Dossier will be special to me as I once met O'Neill at a showing of the Black Dossier and he drew a picture of Nemo in my copy.<br /><br />I do wish the story had been better crafted.  For example, Mina was around but didn't have an opportunity to do her vamp side.<br /><br />Carnacki and Raffles were supposed to be interesting and it time they might but I was not fascinated by them as I was with Hyde and the Invisible man.<br /><br />Overall, it's an ok story and I will give the forth version a try.
0671449028|5.0|My kids and I like pretty much all of Sandra Boynton's books, but The Going To Bed Book is one of our favorites!  Both my kids and I can recite the whole book by memory we've read it so many times.  Highly recommended!
B0045U9WPU|2.0|Too bad this was not one of the free titles on amazon.   I was really disappointed to pay full price and have such an incomplete story - lots of loose ends plus a depressing ending.  I'll pass on any future books by this author.
B004GTLFNW|4.0|First Day on the Basic Program:    I am already feeling the effects of a challenging workout on my upper body after doing push and pull exercises... my muscles feel worked out... I am already sore... SORE on the same day as the exercises - this means my body did not wait to become sore the next day.    After being a gym member for years - at least since I was sixteen and I am now 30 - I am surprised at how truly difficult bodyweight exercises are. Lifting weights seem too easy... try this book out yourself to see just what I mean.    AND I am starting out on the BASIC Program... I should be somewhere in the advanced stage but apparently, bodyweight workouts are much more difficult than lifting weights in the gym.    This is just the first day... I expect to see more results coming at the end of the first two weeks. With most programs, you often don't know if you will see results. But with this one, you will know right after the first workout.    I do have to complain about one thing... some of the exercises require equipment. While I can easily find a door to do pull-ups on and a surface to do push-ups... the last exercise called Let Me Ups proved difficult to figure out. First it required something you can lie under and grasp the surface at arm's length. I have a kitchen table that would have worked fine if not for the fact that the table has a center stand - which prevents me from lying straight under the table. Then I tried putting a mopping pole between two chairs and it was too low. Finally, I tried my metal desk which worked out pretty well. I have tried to think about how I could do this exercise at my gym - but I don't recall any kind of equipment I can use to pull myself up while lying on the floor. I might have to ask one of the trainers if he has any suggestions on how to do Let Me Ups at the gym unless you have suggestions you can offer here.    As for the seated dip, that was easy. I used my tall stainless steel kitchen trashcan with lid to do the dip.But I still feel uncertain about the other equipment such as heavy boxes and phone books. The reason is strictly mine... I have a rare and undiagnosed lung disease that make breathing difficult - the oxygen drops even with mild exertion. Heavy weights held against the chest - in effect obstructing the natural rise and fall of the lungs - make breathing more difficult. I know I am blessed that my baby nephew is still light enough for me to carry around on my hip, but this will stop once he gets too heavy for me. I get nervous just thinking about holding a heavy box against my chest....    For this reason - I still prefer to use barbells and dumbbells because they are more stable and are better designed for gripping other than that they won't obstruct breathing.    BOTTOM LINE:    Mark Lauren designed this book for people who do not have the time or the money to go to a gym to use the barbells and dumbbells and other basic equipment. Forget the fancy cable machines - they do not work at all. But if you do have the time and the money... you can still do these bodyweight workouts using barbells and dumbbells and other basics available at your gym.    Bodyweight workouts are truly tough... you will feel the effects after the first day. I know there may be some criticism on some of what Lauren mentioned in his book but I skipped over these chapters because I get bored with all the constant talk on nutrition and science and what else... I just go directly to the workouts. I have my own nutrition plan that suits my needs for energy based on my current health issues.    I'd love to hear back from anyone who has tried the Let Me Ups on what equipment I could use to do them at a gym.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a sweet romantic-comedy about sweet people from Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the duo behind last year's overlooked [[ASIN:B002ZG9800 I Love You Phillip Morris]]. This is a film with genuine characters that follows the conventions of a Hollywood romantic-comedy but succeeds on the strengths of the well-written script by Dan Fogelman. Maturely written, it handles the romantic exploits of adults and children and puts equal emphasis on both. This is one of the few films of late that has a sub-plot about adolescent love that takes the character seriously rather than needlessly padding out the story. Emotions are allowed to naturally unfold instead of being dictated by what is required of the plot. This is written by someone who knows what he's doing and directed by two men who know how to lead their actors through the story to maximum effect.     Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is having dinner with his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) when she abruptly announces that she wants a divorce. Cal is stunned, especially by her admission that she has slept with her co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Almost overnight, Cal moves into his own apartment and spends his nights moping at a local bar. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a smooth-talking womanizer with a remarkable gift of getting beautiful women to accompany him home every night, sees Cal and offers to help him become irresistible to women. This comes after Jacob has just met Hannah (Emma Stone), whom he can't seem to shake from his mind. Meanwhile, Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has fallen for his 17-year-old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who happens to harbor a crush on Cal. Parallel plot threads like this tend to bring trouble for writers, who tend to push one thread to the side in favor of another. Not here. Everyone is given equal attention and is fleshed-out appropriately. The way the plot threads eventually come together in a surprising and hilarious confrontation is easily one of the film's highlights.     The characters are very believable and extremely likable. Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a comedy, but the humor comes from the way characters handle their emotions. The characters never seem to be consciously attempting humor and the film only rarely does. Directors Ficarra and Requa know comedy and actors, which is likely why both are so well utilized. There are some great actors, some well-known and some not, who appear to be enjoying themselves while perfectly capturing the essence of their characters.     This is a film that gets far with a talented screenwriter and some talented directors, but the overall quality rests on the shoulders of the ensemble that bring the story to life and, for this film, they can't be overlooked or ignored. Carell is the everyman, cynical and hurt over his divorce. Gosling, who after massive success with The Notebook seemed to retreat from the mainstream for more personal roles, is so suave and electrifyingly charming, it's easy to accept some of the dialogue he gets away with. Stone, who seems to get better with every new film, has an uncanny ability to light up the screen and the chemistry she and Gosling share is absolutely smoldering. Marisa Tomei also has this light up the screen ability and still does even with a small role. Moore makes the adulterous Emily such a sympathetic character that it's impossible to harbor any ill-will towards her. Finally, for the third time in 2011, Kevin Bacon appears as the \\"bad guy,\\" David Lindhagen, a sweet man who feels guilt about his role in the dissolution of a marriage but also feels strongly about Emily. I question whether Bacon is intent on playing every variation of a villain he can. Even the younger actors do good work and the sub-plot about Robbie trying to woo Jessica is convincingly written and poignantly acted.     Crazy, Stupid, Love. does not alter the foundation of Hollywood romantic-comedies, but even at its most formulaic, it's done right. It maintains such a positive tone that even Robbie's graduation, the film's most generic scene, is warm and adorable. The film is equal amounts comedy and drama, but the genre elements blend splendidly to create a surprisingly wonderful movie. It's not a great film, but it works so well that there's very little to criticize. It's just so...sweet.    GRADE: A-
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The Social Network is about the genesis of Facebook and the strange personality of its main architect Mark Zuckerberg. Critics may be right that this movie is not an accurate depiction of what really happened, but this movie is still fun to watch because of the backstabbing and successes. There is also something inspiring about it, the idea of coming up with an idea that changes the world. I laughed quite a bit too because of Zuckerberg's extremely intelligent way of insulting people.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is it. Ten years after the first movie based on J.K. Rowling's world-wide bestselling novels, the Harry Potter series has finally reached its epic conclusion, setting the usual box-office records that accompany its arrival. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a landmark in this wildly successful series; not only is it the final installment, but at 130 minutes it's the shortest Potter film, and is the first to be presented in (post-converted) 3D. The film functions as the climax to the Harry Potter saga, as well as a reunion of all the characters we know and love. Every character here seems to get their moment and whether you're a casual fan or a complete fanboy of the series, there's a lot of emotional stuff here. As the title reflects, there's also a lot of death and this makes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 the most emotionally-charged entry in the series...It may also be the best of the series.    The film begins with the final shot of Part 1, but truly opens with a marvelous, monochromatic shot of Hogwarts. From there, it is right back to Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) interrogating the goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis, doing double duty) about where to find the remaining Horcruxes so they can finally destroy Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Their quest will eventually lead them to a final confrontation at Hogwarts, now in shambles with Snape (Alan Rickman) as the new headmaster. Having never read the final book, I have largely avoided spoilers and I will assist you in doing the same.    This film is set apart from the others by becoming noticeably darker. The whimsical fantasy elements are practically absent and the tone has matured along with the characters. This darkness is reflected tonally (you know you're in for something dark when Voldemort appears in fetus form) but also in the overall look, which is brought to life brilliantly by the limitlessly talented production team and director David Yates. It's not hyperbole that every aspect of the production looks stunning. Cinematographer Eduardo Serra has made even the most macabre images into shots of pure beauty, while the various elements of set design and art direction are impeccably rendered. Even Alexandre Desplat's score seems much more haunting than usual. The CGI department should be given raises for their astounding work on the spellbinding CGI which, when juxtaposed with the sets, costumes, and photography, make this film breathtaking to behold.    These films have used nearly every British actor available and many of them reappear for a final time, particularly Maggie Smith (as Professor McGonagall) and Jim Broadbent, both absent from the last film. Even in the final chapter, there is still room for new faces including the, relatively unknown, Irish actor Ciarán Hinds as Aberforth Dumbledore. The actors give their all in their roles, with some even saving their best performances for last. Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort, more so than ever before and his performance really blossoms here into the fully-realized incarnation of evil it's intended to be. Radcliffe, meanwhile, has not only grown in age, but also as an actor and he carries this film triumphantly in a way that only a real, mature actor could. The studio took a risk casting him, as well as Watson and Grint, but hopefully their success and growth throughout the years will encourage studios to be less weary of such risks. I believe the best performance may be by Rickman, still delightfully evil as Snape. Rickman leads this brilliant character through one of the best character arcs of any film series and he is as fascinating to watch as ever, giving a performance that stirs conflicting feelings of spite, as well as empathy and sadness. He has given a great performance since the beginning, but he's able to provide an emotional climax that really allows his performance to be fully appreciated.    Any complaints to aim at this installment are few and far between, and some criticism may be at aspects taken directly from the book. First, the film almost seems apprehensive to reach its conclusion, throwing in everything it can at the last moment to keep it from getting there. That's not to say it drags or grows boring, it just feels drawn out at times. Finally, the epilogue (which is taken from the book) extends the metaphor of the series further than necessary. Not that this metaphor was ever closely concealed, but it pushes it from overhanging to blatant. It's a nice, simple ending and despite my reservations, I can't imagine a better one.     Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a miraculous achievement that closes the book on one of the most well-crafted series of films ever released. I hesitate to say it's the best film in the series, as my memory of the others has waned over the years, but I can't fathom how any of the other films could pack as much of a punch as this one. Aside from how stunning it looks, it's also heart racing and, for two hours, almost unbearably suspenseful. This is a landmark in cinematic history, an exciting and entertaining piece of pop culture, and a brilliant fantasy film. As one-half of a whole finale, it complements its counterpart brilliantly and stands alone as near-perfect end to a near-perfect saga.     GRADE: A    Due to a complete lack of 2D showings, I was forced to see the film in 3D, despite reservations about an already dark film being made darker by the 3D glasses and a weariness of the film being converted to 3D in post-production. To my surprise, the picture was still clear and no-less stunning than I'd imagine it would look in 2D. The 3D neither detracts from the film nor adds anything to it. I applaud Warner Bros. for the effort they put into the conversion, despite its complete lack of worth. The 3D does not draw you into the world onscreen nor does it throw anything at you. Essentially, it is completely unnecessary if for you to pay an additional fee for a supposed additional dimension that adds nothing additional.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is a brilliant app; part cook book, part cooking show, it is a perfect (or at least very very good) cooking app for a phone (or, I presume, a tablet). The videos are helpful and he has little audio hints at done steps in the recipes; all in all, very well thought out. I picked this up when it was the free app of the day, but after using it, would easily pay for others that have this quality. I&apos;m on a stock Verizon Droid X and have had no technical problems thus far.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|This movie was scarier than I expected. When you first start it you'll think it's going to be cheesy but honestly they could have done without the intro scene. The movie reminded me a lot of Paranormal activity. There were parts that literally made me laugh but other parts were pretty freaky. At first I was fine after watching this but the more I think about the demon the more freaked out I am around my house in the early morning or late at night. I'd definitely plan on seeing it again-
B000G8NXYQ|5.0|Amarcord by Federico Fellini    I'd watched this one around 50 times long before I got it from Amazon.  It's my favorite movie actually.  I'm a Brazilian, of Italian descent and had never been aware of my Italian roots until I watched 'Amarcord' at a movie theater in São Paulo, Brazil, back in 1975.    It got me amazed and astonished ever since the first scenes: the actor's performances, the enticing soundtrack by Nino Rota, the plot (was there actually one?).    Those who love the movies just can't miss it. It's a must see, definitely.  The quality of the DVD is just perfect!  Don't miss it!

0307716511|5.0|Sometimes it's not the subject matter or themes of a novel that grabs the reader's attention.  Sometimes, it's the way the novel's written that takes hold of the reader and won't let go.  This is the story of two sisters who are incredibly close; when the younger sister Tess goes missing, Beatrice rushes to London  from New York to find answers.  The official story is that Tess  committed suicide, but Beatrice knows that her sister was murdered.  I know---if you read a lot, you're thinking been there, done that, but this novel written as a letter from Bee to Tess--  The first person narrative and epistolary style  make this book immensely readable.  For me, this book was not as suspenseful as I thought it would be, but that's okay because I really became wrapped up in the sisters' lives.  Tess and Bee were so real to me that they practically jumped off the page.  As the book went on I discovered the many facets of each sister's personality, what made them tick, how they felt about their relationships and family.<br /><br />It's hard for me to believe this is the author's first book.  The dialogue as well as the author's vision of where the story was going was pitch perfect and as the reader, I really enjoyed the experience.  I'm anxiously awaiting another novel from this author!

0439023521|4.0|Reading some of the other reviews on here, it's apparent that this is a very successful, very talked-about book...that somehow I totally missed; I'd never heard of it until a few weeks ago.  During a discussion of good books to read, a friend whose opinion I trusted brought it up, and I just added it to my cart with a bunch of other books, only reading enough of the synopsis to think, \\"yeah, that might be OK.\\"<br /><br />Then last night I was watching the first season of the new Doctor Who, and there was an episode where the doctor and his companions are teleported into some futuristic game shows.  In these game shows, getting evicted from the Big Brother house or being voted the Weakest Link got the contestants disintegrated.  When the show was over, I was thinking, \\"Now, why was that so familiar?\\"  Then I remembered the book I'd bought but hadn't read.<br /><br />So I started it about an hour before bed.  To give you an idea of how much I enjoyed the book, you should know I read every night before bed.  It's part of my ritual and I think the actual act of reading has turned into a sort of Pavlovian hypnotic.  Usually I only get through a couple pages before my eyes start getting heavy and I have to put the book down.  If the book is particularly excellent, I might soldier on to the end of a chapter before succumbing.<br /><br />Not this book.  I actually stayed up half the night to finish it.  Fortunately it only took me about five or six hours to read, because I literally could not put it down - and with as much as I had to do this morning, running on no sleep would have been awful.<br /><br />Do I need a warning about spoilers when hundreds of reviews have outlined the plot already?  I don't think I'm going to spoil anything anyway, but just in case, consider this your warning.<br /><br />The other reviews outlined the plot pretty clearly, so I'll skip that.  Just a few observations: the plot has been done before, several times.  It has tones of 1984 and very clearly reminded me of Stephen King's \\"The Long Walk\\" and the beginning of Piers Anthony's Chromagic series...and, as I mentioned, was very similar to that episode of Doctor Who that I'd just watched.  Reused plots don't annoy me as much as they do some people; as long as the writing is good, I don't mind familiar territory.  Nor did I mind the predictability - since there are three books, it's not a big leap to guess that Katniss survives.  The writing, while on the simple side, was very well done and often very funny.  I liked the fact that we weren't herded into liking Katness; she's an overall likable character, but she's not perfect, not superhuman, and not always very nice.  In my opinion, that made her all the more real.<br /><br />What I did mind, and why the book is getting four stars instead of five, is the ending.  It was rather rushed compared to the beginning.  The whole first part of the book was a fairly detailed account of the events leading up to the games.  In comparison, the end hits you like a brick wall.  The most irritating part was the cliffhanger at the end.  I've always been of the opinion that books in a series should stand on their own and that the desire for a new, separate story because you like the world or the characters is the incentive to read the next book.  This ended more like a serial soap opera.  \\"To be continued,\\" or \\"stay tuned for the continuing story of...\\"  The book didn't end like this part of the story was over, it ended more on a commercial break - as though one very long book got chopped into pieces.  Yeah, I'm going to buy the next book and read it, but it feels like coercion, and it left me feeling piqued.  My one other gripe is that I really would have liked to have learned more about this future Earth - how did the planet get to this point?  How big are the districts and how are they laid out?  What's life like for people outside of Katniss's personal world?  These things are touched on, but in my opinion could have been fleshed out quite a bit more than they were.  Of course, there could be more of this in the books to come, but if that's the case, we get back to my earlier complaint about having to buy the next book to continue the story.<br /><br />But that aside, it's still an outstanding book.  You should read it, and you might as well buy the other books straight away because you'll be all kinds of frustrated if you get to the end and then have to wait for the next installment to be shipped.  Just be sure you block out plenty of time to finish it, because you aren't going to want to interrupt the experience if real life intervenes.Of course, there could be more of this in the books to come, but if that's the case, we get back to my earlier complaint about having to buy the next book to continue the story.

B00457X7XQ|4.0|Certainly a great read, even more appealing if you are into technology. Mark is well known technology expert who has turned his hand to also writing a novel with great effect. Some of the technical aspects and insights in this book come directly from his experience and skill.<br /><br />The books is easy to read and enjoyable by any audience who enjoys thrillers. I found the first part of the book really engrossing however I felt that this wasn't quite matched by the the second half. It was at this point that the plot expanded beyond its initial focus to be something that I felt was taking the well trodden path of global terrorism which it possibly did not need to take.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I felt that widening the story to include these aspects moved the book beyond the realm of reality and little and made it feel cliche. Overall it was still page turner as I became in engrossed with learning the conclusion of the events. Even thought the whole plot is plausible I just felt talking it down the path of the 'war on terror' didn't allow it to stand apart from similar books.<br /><br />However, that said, I still highly recommend the book as something reader will enjoy. You'll probably also enjoy it even more if you are into technology as the quality of subject matter shines through here. It makes a great modern day thriller and I reckon a feature movie can't be far away.
0553801473|3.0|I liked reading it. I like the characters, the world they live in, the different cultures. I like GMMR's style and writing. I was curious about how the story would progress. The short version of the premises: Seven kingdoms vie for the throne, as the long season of Winter approaches, and with it an old threat from the north.<br /><br />The book puts a spotlight on a too large cast of characters, while none of the contenders for the throne get anywhere. We literally learn nothing about the threat from the north. It is well crafted, at the same time to this reader does not meet its purpose well.
0553801473|3.0|Okay, I LOVE the series. But this one just...sucks. This is a book about getting nowhere.  I mean, literally, the installments of each story line are merely outlining the non-events of NOTHING happening.  The Lord Commander's greatest moment comes at the beginning of the book when he deals with a certain someone. This event leads one to believe that Jon Snow is well on his way to the Skywalker/Conan/Rambo Hall of Fame.  But alas...his major conflict through the book is *gasp* feeding the wildlings.  Oh no! I just can't bear the thought of all those widdle hungry mouths, all in the bitter cold without a mommy and a daddy.<br /><br />Speaking of complexes and badasses in regression, 'Hey Dany, are you my mother? I'll bet you think you are.' . This was a promising heroine who appeared to be developing into an Elizabeth type, but fell short of it with her angsty teenage hang-ups with the 'bad-boy', while nursing a tenuous infatuation with being the mommy of perfectly developed and capable indivduals, even though, by the gods, they sure as hell don't act like it. And her dragons? Don't get me started.<br /><br />Hey, Tyrion's story might be good, right? Oh wait, no it's not. Reading his tale is about as entertaining as watching five year olds bounce a beach ball at each other: it's over here, no it's over there, over here, over there, WAY over there.  I hope the metaphor helps. Oh and how about that curve ball with the second Targaryen? Way to just pull THAT one out of your ass, Martin.<br /><br />But back to going nowhere. Picture this: After winning a small and quick victory at Deepwood, Stannis Baratheon boldly marches on Winterfell to crash Roose and Ramsay's various dinner parties and a marriage---the finer details of which I could probably have done without, namely, the bedding part. Are there no more boundaries? Just checking---only to be caught in a snow storm during which...nothing happens. Nothing. Apart from the starvation, snow falling, and a quizzical 'sacrifice'. In one lengthy chapter, Reek/Theon tours snow sodden Winterfell...and nothing happens.  Next installment, he tours even more snow-sodden Winterfell, and nothings happens...again. Oh wait, a complete marginally character forces him to give her a tour of Winterfell's crypts where she elaborates on a completely unreasonable gripe against a very long dead Ned Stark...and we care...why?<br />From beginning to end, this book DRAGs ON. Drags and drags, sparks fly at times, but nothing comes of it. EVER.  Do yourself a favor: get updated by someone who has read it. Trust me, if your informer sticks to the major events, it won't take long.
B005EPFA8I|5.0|The representations of the animals in these cave paintings is extraordinary.  Done on cave walls, the black, what appears to be charcoal drawings, depict horses, lions, bears, bison, rhinos, mammoths, and even the bottom half of a woman.  There are shadings on the pictures that are very modern looking, most reminiscent of the artwork of Joseph Beuys and Susan Rothenberg.  My eleven year old daughter said \\"Why didn't we see this in school?\\"  One idea in particular stuck in my mind:  that they didn't have words or musical notation, so the only way they could communicate with the future was with these drawings.  The esoteric mystic, Gurdjieff wrote something to the effect that true art will last for thousands of years, and that from within the artwork there will be a feeling from the artist, an essence of sorts that travels through time.  It is hard to imagine that anything we make now will last as long.  This movie is a must-see for anyone and everyone, as I think you can see the essence of how the artist was...
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Being a PC gamer for a long time I am very accustom to a Mouse & Keyboard controller setup.  This is how I play.  The Eagle Eye has bridged a gap between the Playstation 3 and us old timers on the PC.  I can promise you the number one reason more PC gamers are not on the a console is because they don't know the Eagle Eye exists.    This device is great.  It takes some tweaking to get setup correctly and a high precision mouse like a G500 is recommended. After I got it setup to my liking, I don't notice a difference between this and playing on a PC... Other they the money I'll save not having to keep my PC up with the Jones's anymore.
B000JIHP88|3.0|At 8 weeks old my son found his mobile.  We thought it was so sweet how he would look for it when we would put him in his crib and smile when we would wind it up. Lucky for us he would start falling asleep at the sound of his mobile we thought yes extra sleep time for us AND wake everY single time the 2 mins were up or was so mesmerized at watching the animals going around in circles start wailing when the mobile would stop, every 2 mins.  Finally, I started reading the reviews on amazon and about the different fisher price mobiles available and decided to go with this one in the end being that it had everything I was looking for in a mobile.  It took a bit to put together, but it wasn't too hard at all, I'd rather be safe than sorry. The colors are very vibrant and the nature sounds are very beautiful and realistic  along with the choice of music.  As soon as it was complete I showed my son and if a 10 week old could dance, he did.  His feet have not stopped kicking since.  He just loves this mobile and is absolutely mesmerized by it.  He talks to the animals and smiles when he is in a playful mood but when it's time for nap or bed time this soothes him immediately and he falls asleep in mins.  We've never needed the remote.  This was the best purchase we've made. I would definitely recommend buying this over the other mobiles. UPDATE:  he is now 12 weeks old and the mobile stopped working.  We've replaced the batteries and that still didn't fix the problem.  We were told by a fisher price representative that to fix the problem we should remove the leaves.  Needless to say we will be sending this item back which is just sad to us being that our son is so in love with this, shame on you fisher price. On the hunt for a new mobile sigh
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Been listening to the Black Keys since I heard them on a soundtrack from Rescue Me. I now own every album.  Tighten up is first song I heard on this album, but the entire collection Rocks. My favorite band right now.
0670022411|1.0|Please don't waste your valuable time or money on this pathetic attempt at a fantasy novel.  The author is confused as to her audience- it reads like 'tween' but has blatant (if boring) sex.  The writing is laughable and the author makes no attempt to incorporate novel structure.  There is no end to this novel as it was never intended to stand alone on its own merits but to be merely the first in a series.
B0025KW29U|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when we first heard about this, but from the first minute of this movie, I knew I was going to love it.  It pulls you in from the get-go. Neil Patrick Harris shines as Dr. Horrible.  Funny, clever, poignant at times, and the music is shockingly brilliant.  One song even sounded like it could have been in Rent, the Pulitzer prize winning Broadway musical.  Weird ending but I'm glad it didn't fall into lame cheesiness.    Aside: I watched Megamind not too long ago and I wonder if the creators of that movie took any inspiration from Dr. Horrible.  The \\"villain\\" and the \\"superhero\\" are strikingly similar in both movies.

0553801473|4.0|It's apropos that the game cyvasse is mentioned several times in the any storylines. ADWD is the series' tipping point, where gambles are made to position the pieces for the end game and the players must needs deal with problems they could not predict. With what we assumed were the dragon's three heads in dire straights by the end of the novel, those of us who have followed it from the start must, in Martin's devilish fashion, re-examine our assumptions and speculate anew.<br /><br />The pieces are positioned, the game is afoot....all the remains to be seen is what kind of Rabbit GRRM pulls out of the hat in the final two volumes.
0553801473|1.0|Too many additional open-ended plots and storylines, just as a FFC.  Progression of this series is dragging on and on and on.  There is no need to introduce 10 new characters with each new volume.  Adding characters (who are EXTREMELY uninteresting) just shows a lack of creativity.  This spent WAY too much time on characters in the free cities; those characters are boring and pointless.  This book was ALMOST as worthless as a Feast for Crows.  The past two volumes of this series have just been a sad decline of a, once, brilliantly told story of characters you WANTED to connect with.  Going from a book that was entirely written on characters we're set up to hate to the characters we're supposed to love (in Dance with Dragons), I was dismayed at the lack of progression in the characters.  Not enough time spent on Arya, Bran, or Jon.  Too much on Tyrion, in which none of the chapters focused on character growth..just a wandering around aimlessly...soooo boring.  Only good thing that happened in this good were the couple chapters on Cersei.<br /><br />I would suggest readers of a Song of Ice and Fire stick to the first three books.  Poorly done, this go-round.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I don't have enough superlatives in my vocabulary to review this movie adequately (and the Blu-Ray version of it).  I'd rate it at six or seven stars if I could.<br />The cinematography in this movie was incredible.<br />I was overseas in the Army when the movie was released - I had only seen it in the 4:3 format later on.  So watching this version was the first time I had seen the widescreen presentation.  Combined with the amazing restoration, it was like a movie I had never seen before.<br />This version has made me appreciate my Blu-Ray player even more.

B00186DV1U|5.0|This is a great film and even better because it is shown in its original aspect ratio.  It is unfortunate that so many movies are not presented in their original aspect ratios.  Movies should always be formatted in the form in which they were originally filmed.
B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. We have watched a millon times atleast lol. good quality love that you get the blu ray and dvd combo. great for the money.
B004G6009K|4.0|This movie is a fun movie to watch!..even without the 3D,but the 3D makes this movie come to life..The 3D could have been better,more jump off the screen action would have been nice,but very well made movie..good story,my daughter loves it!..I give the movie 5 stars and the 3D 4 stars.
076115678X|5.0|I bought this book two weeks ago at Barnes and Nobles and then ordered copies on Amazon for my friends. This is a wonderful resource for all hair types. I'm a Black female with corkicelli/(3b) curly hair and found the tips on how to wash and condition my hair so helpful. I learned that I've been mistreating my hair for years. Lorraine discusses trimming your curls at home, natural home conditioning potions and learning to work with your hair's natural curl pattern. Also, I highly recommend that you buy the book with the instructional DVD. Both of my friends called me to tell me how helpful this book it. This has become my go-to book and will continue to recommend or give it away to my newly natural friends and family.
1451629184|3.0|I agree with some other comments and I wish she hadn't written about her being raped, besides just saying she was raped which we know she was would have been enough.  I wish she would have written about her daughters safety some reassurance that they weren't hurt and are doing fine would have been relieving. The book leaves you questioning everything you questioned before you read it. Its not a bad book its well written considering she only attended elementary school,  actually I was quite impressed \\"lets be honest most high school graduates cant spell\\"  however it was repetitive.  I have admiration for this girl I really cant begin to imagine living the way she did for as long as she did.  The book is a diary of what she went through and how afraid and brainwashed and fed up she was.  She was a helpless girl who stayed 11 over those 18 years and did the best she could to survive.

My friends now make requests for their favorite vegan cupcakes!!!
0440245931|1.0|After reading the first three novels by John Grisham, I can confirm that he belongs to the Pablum Club of American writers.  He joins Vince Flynn, David Baldacci, and Brad Thor, but the club is sure to grow as I discover new authors.<br /><br />Contrast this with the Caviar Club, whose members include James Lee Burke, Michael Connelly, Neal Stephenson, Robert Ludlum, and Alan Furst, among others, as far as American authors go.  The Brits have their own elite members, such as James Clavell and John Le Carr&eacute;.

1451629184|5.0|After college I was very burnt out on reading, and completely driven away from picking up another book. However, I was looking for a book to spark my interest back up again and needless to say, I could not put this book down. Jaycee did an amazing job of explain her story with no untold details. My heart truly goes out to her and her family.  Definitely an A+++++ book!

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Over 15 hours of content on 2 DVD's, Pink Floyd is known for giving more value for the money than any other music group. Live concerts in 2 parts, plus all the music videos from the EYE, so you can watch the concerts & not miss anything trying to watch live performance & Eye videos at same time. Plus extraordinary behind the scenes footage explains nearly every song's origins, plus 3D diagrams showing the blueprints for their stadium designs & how it's all put together. The audio & video quality is out of this world excellent, as always with Floyd official recordings! Interviews with the graphic designers who came up with some of the 3D imagery in the videos, countless story board type photos and drawings, even a section called Bootlegging the Bootleggers! The female backup singers are some of the most talented I've ever seen & heard, but 2 of them are indescribably good, especially during their vocal solo's during the concerts. I was trying to decide which one was better & could not choose, both were sublime.<br /><br />This set is the best money I've ever spent on a DVD set, and at under 75 cents an hour of content, the best deal ever. If you haven't seen Pink LIVE, this will make you feel like you are there! If you have seen them live, same deal, and if you haven't seen Pink in years, or listened, this will make you remember how much you loved them to begin with & start you on a path of buying up Pink Floyd CD/DVD's or even LP's, again. During the concert, huge robotically controlled pig monster puppets come out & shake to their songs from Dark Side of the Moon; all the classic favorite songs are on these DVDs both LIVE and music video versions. This is one music set you will watch again & again, never tiring of and seeing something new every time. Don't wait another second to bring home some of the most thrilling pleasure you can have, with your clothes on anyway. :)
B004APVI1G|4.0|Decent movie I felt it was worth the money. Not Avatar but few movies are even close to that. Some reviewed the plot as being confusing? Maybe if you're 3. Typical good versus evil movie, but good graphics, funny lines, and interesting characters make it worth a look in my opinion
0345529057|3.0|The story line and the characters are amazing. It keeps you want to read more and more. I would recommend buying this Boxed set of four books, because when you'll finish one, you will want to jump right to the next one.    Only problem was that the books were delivered in poor condition - the cover was slightly torn (enough to annoy the paying customer) on ALL four books - this was not done by delivery, because the whole boxed set was covered in a special \\"air bubbles\\" wrapper. I suspect that I (and any other overseas customer) got the \\"B Grade\\" copy, that was in the storage, maybe because most overseas customers don't have the time and energy to complain and return the book - especially when they waited 3 weeks to get it, and anxious to read. Unfortunately, I am one of this kind of customers :)    I sent a complaint to Amazon more than a week ago, but didn't get a respond.       To make it short - \\"Don't judge a book by its (torn) cover\\"  - this is a Great set of books! Just don't order them here, unless you can return them conveniently, in case you will get them in damaged condition, like I did.

B004WCTLNY|5.0|I saw the previews for this movie on a DVD I watched recently and was intrigued by it. I am already a big Matt Damon fan and am becoming an Emily Blunt fan. They, along with several other cast members, gave outstanding performances in a movie that kept my interest from beginning to end(a rarity these days).Very believable chemistry between Damon and Blunt,Terence Stamp always riveting and Anthony Mackie is someone I'll be watching for as his career takes off as I'm sure it will.Overall a very enjoyable film and a purchase I'm happy about.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|This movie was great have a lot of action from beginning to end. I hope there's another part to this movie.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Watch this show, the film, and everything affiliated with it.  I can not stress enough the disgust you will have after having seen everything this show has to offer only to find it ended too soon.  Regardless of that emptiness you might feel, it is worth every single moment.  Watch this show!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love it! I call in my Gladiator porn.I'm not a porn person but wow. I like the story line. I can't believe the Romans were as decadent as they were. Horriable people....they got what they deserved.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I ordered this movie while serving a tour in Afghanistan.  I remember watching the trailer for this movie time and time again, anxious for its release in the U.S.  I had such an interest in this movie my friends quickly became convinced that the movie would be worth their time to watch.  Now I admit that Anime isn't for everyone.  There are several Japanese culture and subculture fillers in all of Anime that for the casual movie or TV show watcher it might be a bit over-whelming.  Summer Wars is filled to the brim with said culture and it is exactly that which makes this movie both unique and extraordinary for all.  This movie fully assumes the audience is Japanese and as such is a wonderful and colorful experience for everyone.  This may seem contradictory to the previous fact but what a great way to see the culture in its purest form.  This isn't some action film that is full of unreal scenarios or Please Teacher setting where the women are objectified, but rather this movie is a full fledged family movie both funny and exciting.    The film takes place in a modern day time setting where an MMO (massive multi-player online) system controls everything.  Everyone uses this system and even more so they depend on it.  This seems plausible considering how much we depend on technology today.  Well what would happen if something in that system went wrong?  This movie answers that question with an interesting and entertaining plot.    So if an interesting crisis plot, a love story, family oriented, and Japanese Cultured movie sounds like something you might be interest in try this movie on for size.  Forget that it is animated and try to keep an open mind.  You might be surprised how much you like it.  The people I was deployed with loved it.  Try imagining 10 grown men sitting in a small break room, in uniform, covered in Afghanistan dust, and tired from a full days work, watching an Anime.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This is a great classic style RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior.  Definitely worth the $3 asking price.  I do wish the resolution scaling was a bit better so the game would use my entire screen.  -Atrix 4G
B004XJHBCE|1.0|Still can't figure out how it works... (even tho my computer background goes back to the early 60's) The online instructions don't match the version I bought-even remotely.  Why not make it simple: create a folder on the home  screen with a long touch and then drag apps into it.
0316098329|4.0|I must admit, I kept coming back to this page reading reviews (and avoiding spoilers) to decide if I should buy it. Finally last week I purchased this book and only read a few pages each night and finally sped through pages 60-the end in one day. Not to say the first part of the book isn't a page-turner. I just had trouble reading a lot of it at night because it was so haunting. It's been nearly a full day since I finished the book and I still find myself thinking about the characters and the story itself.<br /><br />I will say there was a few parts towards the end of the story that were a little disjointed. Though haunting, the first part of the book was more linear than the second part. I still found myself powering through the second half- eager to find out what happened. As a whole the book worked for me, which is why it has this 4-star review. I'd recommend this, but cautiously, because you have to know that you're signing up for a bit of a haunting while reading this engrossing tale.
B0007939NO|5.0|Had this on VHS, saw on amazon DVD was available, got it. Always loved this greatly misunderstood film which did not do well at the box office.  I think the problem is that Vincente Minnelli was an artiste of the first rank and considered the entire film a fantasy which deserved fantasy treatment.  Thus the clearly painted backdrops and recreating the hills of Scotland on an inside sound stage with no pretense about it not being just that.  The brilliant stage musical didn't fit easily into the film mode, one reason for the delay in the stage musical becoming a film, largely because stage audiences and film audiences were different fish.  They removed some songs, they simplified the plot, they gave that ole devil M-G-M gloss but the movie never gets out of second gear. Cyd Charisse, a nice Jewish girl, is transformed into a Scottish lass and is gorgeous but somehow the nice Jewish girl keeps popping through her portrayal. As a dancer she is unequaled, of course, and she and Kelly make a divine pair (it's often forgotten Charisse ably did drama, comedy, musical and satire, interesting because as a person she was shy and never presented herself as a star; if you ever saw her interviewed she was surprisingly matter of fact, though supernaturally gorgeous).  Van Johnson almost steals the film and Elaine Stewart in her brief screen time is fabulous.  But the real star here, beside what's left of the story and score, is Mr. Minnelli, who clearly had a vision for this one and delivered it totally.  Too bad John Q. Public wasn't buying. Even if you have no clue about this film or the talent involved it, get the DVD. You will watch it over and over and over.
