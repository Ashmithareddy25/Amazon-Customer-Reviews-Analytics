B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My wife loves this game, she bought it for her ipad and she plays it all the time.  She says its fun to play to kill time.
B009VB97EY|1.0|It was awful! We didn't even finish it. 20 minutes into I told my husband if it didn't pick up I wanted to shut it off.....well we did 30 minutes later. Boring as can be! Not funny at all. The main girl has no expression and talks and acts like Kristen Stewart(whom personally I find very boring as an actor/actress). Yes it had quite a bit of &#34;R rated&#34; material which really didn't bother me but now I have no curiosity whatsoever to go to a men's club. Don't waste your $4
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|Grandsons favorite color. He was excited to open the case and see the kindle fire HD for christmas. He lovedhow versatile it is.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good story, but I hated the ending. Surely the author could have made a better heroine out of Katniss, but maybe that's just the romantic in me.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This movie is ridiculous.  The lip syncing is completely off timing, the way they break out into song at the most random times is awkward and completely cheesy, and Zeta-Jones' acting is horrendous.  I couldn't even finish watching this movie.  Glad I only paid $3.99 for it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing solitary especially on my kindle. I also play on my smart phone. The game is quick and challenges me
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This came out when my daughter was little. She loved it, we loved it, and now my 5 yr old son LOVES it too! There aren't many movies he will sit through the whole thing which I think says a lot.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This movie should be on everyone's must-have list - and buy the blu-ray.  If you don't have a blu-ray player, now is the time to get one.  The high definition is utilised fully by the incredible detail; not just every rivet in a ship, but cracked and peeling paint on each rivet.<br /><br />This same attention to detail was lavished on the script.  The action and characters are as good as movies get.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Good app great price so why not give it a try I use relaxed melodies every night to help me sleep better.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works very well.  It is much much better than the Kodiak that I had to get rid of since it wouldn't print well at all.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is funny and its even better with friends and worth the watch. Going to put this in my collection when i find it on bluray
B0051QIGP4|4.0|Daughter had to have it. To me ordering a digital download isnot as good as a real CD,but very affordable and immediate. Record has high and low points.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read so far this year. The story is beautifully written. It is full of surprises. Some u can figure out n others just right our shock u.<br /><br />The story between Sky and Holder is full of passion. For those of u who think its just another teen love story are just wrong. I mean it is a love story but its a mature love story full of pain, loss, passion, faith n of course hope. I loved this book way more than SLAMMED.<br /><br />Please just read it. Read the sample n if the first chapter doesn't make u wanna buy n continue reading then this book is not for u.
B0007M4610|5.0|I was trying to teach my son about Japan, and this little Brio train is a great look-alike to the Shinkansen! My son loves the train. The only thing I would suggest to Brio is to make the magnets a tad stronger - the last car sometimes comes off if your going up a hill. No big deal though - still delighted with the train.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I thought the book was okay. I can see this story more relatable to high school than college with regards to Abby and Travis' relationship.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once you begin to read on you become enveloped in the suspense involved.  The book takes you through a journey that makes you happy sad and even sometimes anxious that sometimes only tells the bare minimum of stuff and you wan t to know more.  It was one of the best books ever. I highly recommend it to anyone of all ages thirteen and up
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|This is a cool game other than I bought a item used it and after a while it said I didn't buy it other than that it's cool
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's a Good game and has nice calming background music. Also it gives hints which is good. Overall great app.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|its the cutest game I ever played and so cute animals best game ever I love the game so much. I play it a lot
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Good layouts for a free app like the options for backgrounds and I like the tile styles will play a lot
B005OZE9SA|3.0|The Scarlett 2i2 seemed like the perfect interface for my newly revised studio. I try it out, but the drivers are totally useless.. None of my software recognize the driver although my control panel put it as the default device.. But the interface itself seemed to work. I could directly monitor my recording through my headphones from it and it sounded fine.. Maybe it was my fault.. But I see that a lot of people have problems with the drivers.. So unfortunate..
B00992CF6W|5.0|mojang did an awesome job at taking minecraft to the kindle. the only thing I don't like is NO CAVES!!!
0446560073|5.0|Lots of fun for all ages. My grandchildren find the pictures funny.  Great book to keep on the coffee table.
B003VDY7XE|2.0|Loved Hero's, Loved Lost, Loved a lot of great serial/cinema shows.  This is not one of them.......It's a mediocre try.
0446560065|5.0|Lots of fun to read and look at.  Enjoy sharing it with all of the family.  Young children will enjoy looking at the pictures.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I gave this move 4 stars because had I been able to rate aspects of the movie separately the average would have been 4.  I am a fan of M Streep and I would have given her 10 stars.  I see all of her movies because I think she has an amazing capacity to act and I love to watch her take on the various personas.  Some who we celebrate as 'great' simply play themselves or a variation of themselves in a changing array of settings.  In the past three years we have seen her go from nun to Prada-diva to Greek Island middle-aged hottie, to ageless chef to the iron lady and I may have forgotten a couple.<br /><br />In this less than complicated plot we see Meryl capturing the look and emotion of an empty-nested housewife whose husband has retreated into a deep cave lined with golf tip movies, newspapers and mechanical movements.  We learn later that both are responsible for the frigid status of their marriage, but here we see Meryl accurately portray the middle-aged woman who though embarrassed and vulnerable, haltingly and bravely takes steps to mitigate the situation.  Through the nuances of the relationship, Meryl, with believable depictions allows us to know how someone in this situation would feel.<br /><br />Steve Carell was remarkably believable as a therapist and Tommy Lee Jones played the angry curmudgeon he seems to know so well.  The plot was simple but realistic and the scenic shots were kind to the eye.<br /><br />And, there were no explosions, no pictures of bloody carnage, no chase scenes, no leaps from airplanes with or without benefit of parachute. Not a single shot was fired!  Absent \\"action\\" our attention as viewers was held rather through human interaction.  How novel!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Le Miserables: I had just seen the movie, and immediately wanted to purchase (most of) the music.  It's splendid! I think the cast and their voices were perfect.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book! It goes into so much more depth than the movie and there is much more emotion. I recommend this book to EVERYONE!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is a must see for all...it is so magical.  I would recommend this film to everyone not just kids....adults will love it too
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is so fun. I can't wait to get the second part. it is so mysterious. again it was so much fun and I wish more games like that could be available.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Loved it! I can't wait for the next book to come out. Definetely worth reading! I've req'd this series to everyone I know.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book so much!!! I can't even find any words to describe it!!(: Its amazing everyone should read it!
1400067820|5.0|It is impossible to summarize this book, so I will not even attempt an overview, instead, I want to discuss why this book is important and encourage anyone with an inquisitive mind to purchase the book. Of course, I am biased in favor of Mr.Taleb's writings but the concept of Anti-Fragile is incredibly important for individuals.<br /><br />Anti-Fragile is a work that brings to light a philosophical point that few in history have discussed in detail, yet, anti-fragile is a critical concept. I am often upset to see that many reviews miss the point and application of anti-fragility. Often,  large marco-social-political questions are asked by the reviewer ignoring the fact that anti-fragility is a bottom up philosophical work. Taleb gives the reader not only the definition of anti-fragile but also adds 7 \\"books\\" that further explains, defends, and offers practical applications for individuals.<br /><br />This is a book that challenges the reader to view the world through a different lens, to question the very reality that makes up modern society. However, trying to view the world through anti-fragility can be difficult task, straining the mind against a lifetime of conditioning created by a society that stigmatizes against the question \\"why?\\" A lazy mind will reject Taleb's anti-fragility, but a truly open mind will find the work incredible. This does not imply that anti-fragility is the ultimate truth, but as Karl Popper might say, it is the closest thing to \\"truth-like\\" we can get in philosophical truths.<br /><br />In the end, there is nothing I can say that Taleb did not say more clearly and concisely. I just encourage readers looking for a book that is a true philosophical and  practical book, read Anti-Fragile.<br /><br />I would also like to thank Taleb, this is a wonderful book that has pushed me to learn more, to expand my horizons, and live a life that is anti-fragile; in essence, I am turning into a practitioner.
0393339882|4.0|Interesting , particularly the historical descriptions.Would have liked more explicit mathematics<br />as a series of appendices.Quite well written and rare to see this combination of physics and<br />history.
B002BVYBC4|5.0|My brother is a huge fan of the Fast and Furious series, and for $1.99 this was a great deal!
B0047Y17P2|2.0|I read \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\", and really enjoyed it, so I thought I'd like this one too.<br />Wrong!<br />The problem with this book is, .. it's a screenplay, not a \\"book\\".<br />I'm just not into Hollywood pulp.<br />What a disappointment.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought this album spontaneously because it was part of the $3.99 Black Friday sale. I absolutely loved it! Imagine Dragons is a fantastic band with a unique sound. They perfectly blend rock and dance music with great vocals and lyrics. Absolutely great.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|I got a set for myself before Christmas. It was on sale for $130 for all 3 seasons.  At the time of this writing, its gone back up in price to over $200.  A little pricey.<br /><br />The Blu Ray disks have both the original effects, and the updated.  And, they are set to different view angles so that you can switch back and forth.  But, at least on my player, when a special effect scene is about to show up, a camera icon shows up on the screen. It is distracting.  And, perhaps this is an issue with my player that may or may not affect you - but on my player, when it comes to a special affect scene, it pauses for a second, I guess searching for the right location on the disk.  That is annoying too.<br /><br />Just FYI.
B002GWV7D4|5.0|My 9-yr-old saw La Sagrada Familia this summer and was inspired by the architecture, so we got him the nanoblocks, and he put it together right away.
B005JR47R6|5.0|This is a crucial epsiode. Very well done emotionally and psychologically. Touching!<br />We loved it , cried and laughed. Superb!
B000FC1MOQ|4.0|Extremely descriptive narration of addiction. Love the style  of writing. Great story. Captivating alternatives  to overcoming substance  abuse. Will continue reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Needed a simple calculator for general purposes. Works very well. Like that u can see your equations. U can review your calculations.  Makes it very nice.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The kindle fire lightweight microshell folio fits excellent on my kindle fire it snug and perfect was a little septic that it wouldnt fit but was dead on
B004856SQ8|5.0|Lets face it you do not go to (or buy) a movie like this to see an academy award winner.  You go to see explosions, fights and stunts.  This movie delivers on all of those.  The acting, while not horrible is not anything to write home about.  I think all the characters do well in their roles, especially Patrick Wilson as the CIA agent and Sharlto Copley as Murdock.  I never really watched the TV series so I did not have the old characters as a reference.  For the fans of the series that may keep you from accepting any of the characters in their respective roles.  This movie takes a lot of suspension of disbelief and just going into it for the entertainment value.  If you are a fan of mindless action movies that are fun to watch, you will like this one.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Hilarious!! I'm not a Glee fan but bit the bullet and brought my teenager to see this. I was surprised to see that the character development and acting were done so well. Well worth your $3.99. It was so funny, I may even buy this one.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|If you have not seen the series Firefly, you should do so before watching this.  When I first saw this in the theater I had not watched the tv series, so it did not make as much sense and the moments that were supposed to have the emotional impact just did not have as much of one.  Most people reading this will likely have already seen the series, but for those who have not, it was originally a show on Fox, that the network totally screwed over by airing episodes out of order and changing when it was aired so it could never gain a foothold.  Then it was cancelled basically without warning.<br /><br />The movie basically wraps up the series to show us where the story would have ultimately gone.  We start by seeing River broken out of the facility she was in, and ultimately find out what she knew and what was causing her mental instability.  From the outset her character does a lot more than she had in the series up to that point, and Summer Glau does a great job with it.<br /><br />Like pretty much all of Joss Whedon's TV shows and movies, this blends action, comedy and drama.  There are funny moments within tense moments (that are even funnier if you have the background from the series), and the acting and writing are both top notch.  The movie on its own is very good, the movie after having watched the series in the order the series was meant to be seen is awesome. For what it was trying to do (tell the entire story of what could have been spread out over multiple TV seasons in two hours), the movie accomplished that very well.  It is unfortunate that this and the series are all we are ever likely to have of this story.  It will forever be relegated to cult classic status, but if you give it a chance you will be glad you did.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|The first 10-15 minutes were funny and it looked promising. It took a swan drive from there. Waste of $2.99
B008WCP2KG|1.0|Ultraviolet is the worst digital download imagineable. You can sync with itunes, requires a seperate app and weblogin to use. Basically, this digital download is an 8-track in an MP3 world. Digital download is worthless!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have now read the first and second book. I can not wait until the next book is released I'm pre ordering it now. Amazing story line!
B0054SMID0|5.0|Like it much more than I thought I would. Couple of nice twists. Nice mix of characters. If I ever need a criminal attorney I will look for his clone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Even if this is not your typical genre, I still highly recommend you read this story.  Hard to put down!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The plot is great. The story telling is very good. The Only real issue are the typos, but unlike some kindle books, this is worth tolerating.
B0068FYZMK|5.0|What else can I say other than that it is a great movie, Babe is the cutest pig, his voice is so cute, would recommend this movie to anyone. Great family movie
B004V5QWU2|4.0|My only complaint is a couple of the sounds aren't very natural, which is to be expected, since they're not, but the ability to mix and adjust the volume is a great feature.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is not like other apps!  It is because it's not like other 6  star apps...  when you get coins you don't have to ACTUALLY $PAAAYYYY$ FOR BOOSTS you earn easy coins in the game. Trust me this was the first app I ever wanted !!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. I don't do much reading but when I do, I never put the book down. Got this book the 25th and its now the 30th. I really wished that Sam and Charlie got together. Now I can go see the movie. I wonder what my next book will be. I have a pattern I read books about drugs and people doing drugs. I would recommend this book to the younger crowd.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I really like Rick Riordan's books. I think he is a great author. But this one is the best book .
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love Spider over the regular solitaire games. It is more challenging to me than the regular solitaire. You can do several different things with this game over other games.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I Love It.  I love to keep up with my friends on Facebook.  Now I can check in even when I am on the road.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My hubby loaded this game, (we had not ever seen or played this game) and plays it whenever he has the chance. I will hear him sitting in his recliner in other room laughing and goofing off with this game. Makes me smile if he's smiling. Highly recommend this to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I Love Solitaire, always have.  I have always loved to play Solitaire as a pass time.  It is played a lot at my house.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|How to rate such a classic book? Everyone should read to understand the magic of beauty itself. The great work of Oscar Wilde reveals a lot of himself.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My Great Grandson likes it.  He is 4 years old and he is a strong Angry Bird Fan.  In fact most of his Christmas was Angry Bird.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book, took some time to get into the beginning but once I did I was hooked. Never did I once think I knew what was coming next, the connection these 2 had was beautifully expressed by the author. She did a great job portraying and explaining and finishing the story line. Thank you for writing such a beautiful story!!
B00A757EFW|4.0|My Great Grandson likes it.  He likes this program also but is more interested in Angry Bird.  He just loves to play with game machines.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Fun for all ages.  This movie brings Christmas up to modern day technology.  It is heart warming and has a great ending.  Great Family Flick.
B005LAIIPS|1.0|Some good graphics and something or other from an attractive Weicz (who  deserved a better vehicle than this) or I'd rate it a zero. An insult to the very fine Bourne series.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|This movie is for women of all ages.  This movie has a story line and is not just good looking guys stripping.  I have never seen a male strip show live and probably never will but this movie lets you get a glimpse of what it may be like at a male strip show.  I thought this movie was very funny.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Saw this movie twice in the cinema and was still blown away when I watched it on Amazon Instant the other evening.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This movie was well written and portrayed the characters very well.  There was violence in this movie if you have children.  The movie is very enjoyable to watch.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is better than pacman which is only part of a game. fun to play and longlasting. I would recommend this one!
B0095R6OBS|3.0|My family was watching movies and we ran across this one.  This is not the newly released movie of 2012.  This movie was not a high budget movie.  It was simple and short but my son liked it because he had experienced a death of a beloved dog.  It is more like a very strange Leave it to Beaver type show.
B008OHV5W8|5.0|World Yoga is the best yet in the series...I love the music and we play it every day...thank you again.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The book dragged for the most part, but when I was about 70% done it was when I started to enjoy it.  I'm not sure if i want to read the third book based on how it ended, I feel like what's left?
B001E5CH0G|4.0|I love this Christmas movie with Will Ferrell, but of course he is disgusting in some parts. I would not recommend this for young children, especially if you are trying to teach them manners.
0143038583|5.0|Very interesting read, it is both an expose and a light reading, especially when he wrote about his hunting and gathering experience, I find myself reading quickly and wanting to find out what happened next. I bought it for a class in college as required reading but will definitely buy it just to read it for knowledge sake.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It is always fun to have the action movies. We need hero's in our lives even if they are fictitious.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I LOVE THIS CALCULATOR. nice big numbers, does everything I need it for. and FREE. works great on Kindle Fire.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|My Granddaughter has been anxious to see the Twilight series and this is the years she can start watching them. She wants to get them all.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very interesting how they ended up making the original decision again.  this is a book i will read more than once.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This came faster than I expected and was in excellent shape. It is easy to use. I would rather have blue, but this fit all my other requirements.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's all the Star Wars movies in on collection. EXCELLENT!!! nothing more needs to be said. We recommend to everyone
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I enjoyed the movie so took a chance the book would be as good. So happy I did!<br /><br />I secured my bicycle for the train ride home (late train so it is stuffed so I hang my bike up and sit on my Panniers)and settled to see if the book Chocolat is as good as the movie. I train my ears to buzz me at the Rainier Station (gives me time to close the Kindle, pack the bike before my stop). So I hear \\"next stop Rainier....\\"<br /><br />So I look up and see a huge cop entering and I now have THREE COPS surrounding me --- all I could think of was (poor guys) I actually raised both hands in the air and said \\"it's OK, it's just a Kindle\\"<br /><br />The biggest one asked if I had a ticket (why do I have to be technical?) I said \\"will no\\" the other 2 move closer \\"I have a pass\\" and I then need to remove my gloves, remove my over coat to unzip the pocket with the card in it. Beep all is good. 3 sets of eyes @@<br /><br />I leaned over and asked the guy next to me how long the guards were standing there. He said when the 1st guard came around and saw me 'hiding' he called for the 2nd guard and then asked twice. When I continued to ignore them (duh like in READING) they waited for the 3rd guard. He then asked me what book I was reading because it must be good.<br /><br />In short -- yes the book is as good as the movie!
B005HSG3U6|4.0|The case is good, but not perfect, the color white makes difficult to keep it clean, but worth the price and covers perfectly my kindle
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show seems very plausible in the modern world of terrorism we live in. The scripts are well written and the acting is perfect.
0440244412|2.0|I eagerly awaited this book thinking it would answer all the questions about Mac and Barrons, but I was soooooo disappointed. Maybe  it's just me, but I was more confused than ever. No REAL answers to any questions. The story was way too long and could have been issued as a Marvel comic book. I wish Karen would write another book and really tie up the relationship between Mac and Barrons and explain everything!
B0074EIQQU|1.0|Noctourniquet couldn't be anymore disappointing.  Sounds nothing like any of the previous Mars Volta releases.  This release is very much electronica influenced.  I also am an electronica fan, so I'm not just anti-electronica.  This reminds me of how off the new Incubus release is too but this is even further off and much more disappointing.  Please know I take no pleasure  in writing this review.I love At Thw Drive-In and Mars Volta even more and all of their side projects but this release will for me be that anomaly in their discography. If you do buy this and enjoy it then, please explain to me what I'm missing because I really want to like this or at least understand what it's about.
B0086700CM|3.0|This is a simple game but can get very addicting. Even my son loves playing the game. The only things I wish they would change is: 1. More coins go over the side (where you don't get credit) then in the front. 2. You give away more coins then you win. Which, yes, I understand that's the point of the game but when it's an average of 50 coins to winning 1 or 2. Not good odds. But it is fun.
B00899F0G8|4.0|easy to access worked well on my ipad and other devices.<br />a little expensive. but was a good season to watch
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cool game esta chubidubi si, esta muy bien el juego si lo juego y lo jugaria otra vez<br />Ellen kidding about the Simpson
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a great hidden object game with good story line and great graphics. Not too easy objects are well hidden just have too really use you eyes. A good challange....
B000KFB4PK|4.0|Got it for my 4 1/2 yr grandson, it was fun to put it together, add color and adjust links to fit.  Guess would have been better when he is five.  Box says 6+.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Another one that I bought as a gift. It arrived very quickly, and in excellent shape. I am sure it played alright, but I don't know since it was a gift for someone else.
B009WJ14FA|5.0|I love these guys, its good to see a bit of a throwback style, with a great band and fantastic lead singer.  The singer reminds me of Jackie Wilson...
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I have watched this movie over with my kids and it makes me laugh everytime!!  Highly recommend getting this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play,and easy to operate. I like to play while I  watch TV. For a free app, it has.to be the best adaptation of an actual card game.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Have never read this book but it was a great read. It was great to know Van Helsing is more than a action hero.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I thought this didn't work right out of the box too...but that was because it was upside down. I have a feeling some people didn't think of this and thought it was broken out of the box. Works perfectly, no complaints. I would be hesitant to keep it on my keys though considering how tiny it is and the possibility of it getting cracked. I just keep it in my camera bag.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love Pinterest. It is addicting. I have invited many friends who say the same. But it is fun anyway!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|it's great knowing just how long it will take to complete a full charge. Also lets you know how long to expect the charge to last depending on what app you are using. This is only to second app I ever paid for. I'd do it again.

B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad to see a game that is interactive in so many ways with my Kindle Fire. But most of all it's challenging and lots of fun! Thanks Imangi Studios and Amazon for making it available to us to play! I'm looking forward to other games that will be just as titillating as this one is.
1416550550|5.0|I haven't quite finished reading it yet.  It was confusing in the beginning because it jumps back and for in time among three main characters
B008XNZMOU|5.0|great singer, great album. as long as the teenie boppers don't ruin her rep, she should have a career as long as Kenny Rogers.
1592400876|5.0|I really can' describe this book.  It is full of funny ways people phrase things and their sometimes hilarious use of punctuation.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This quickly became one of my favorites. For once a movie that doesn't give away the only good parts in the trailer. The fight scene alone was better than Fight Club.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is another wonderful book by this team of authors.  This final book in the trilogy did not disappoint - I lost track of the times I thought to myself \\"OMG!\\"
B003WTE886|5.0|great singer, great album. as long as the teenie boppers don't ruin her rep, she should have a career as long as Kenny Rogers.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I listened to three of my coworkers talk about how funny \\"Ted\\" was, after watching it I realized my coworkers conspired to have me waste $2.16.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" was a pretty bad movie.  If I wanted to watch the \\"Family Guy\\" I would have turned on \\"Netflix\\"- correction, if I wanted something good and funny I would have put on the \\"Family Guy\\". I know three people to be ignored forever...FOREVER!!!!<br /><br />Talk about eating spam after a nice southern gravy glazed porkchop.
B000XXGMS8|5.0|no break in period.<br />Bought a half size smaller than usual.  Usually wear 10.5 bought 10, and fit perfectly.<br />Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised and couldn't wait to read what happened next. Onto the next!
B00AE2LJVS|1.0|Hbhihiygytftyfuybiybujbhbiuuih hbiubiubuiih. Hibiuhuihoh ihiuhouhoiooioi.  Ihiuhouhoiooioi. Jiving u. U. J. J. J. J. U j. U. U. Hugh just.  Ju.  J. J
B0083P1QUM|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ITS A PATRICIA CORNWELL AT HER VERY BEST , COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN,THE ENDING WAS UNEXPECTED.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Not bad, not great, but standard Clancy universe.  There was a time I would line up to buy and read New Tom Clancy but I think those days ended after the first collaboration.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was taken with the fact that the very intelligent medical doctor experienced such an<br />out of mind and body view of the after life. Dr. Alexander was at deaths door and was told<br />he would not be their for long. He succinctly told all he experienced while in the coma.<br />It was so interesting I could not stop reading it. I now have no fear of death and I respect<br />Dr. Alexander for writing this book. I look forward to hearing the beautiful music he talked<br />about.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This was one of my favorite seasons. Cant wait to buy the next season. Showtime did a really good job on this.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I kept wondering what his father was going through, or went through<br />and what the poem meant. I don't want to give anything away, but it<br />was moving and I kept rooting for all of them. I love Liam Neeson.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This is a really great book for anyone(Grown ups,teens,and kids to read). There's so much you can learn from this book. Something I've learned from reading this book is to always believe in yourself,and to follow your dreams no matter how many obstacles are in your way. I think Justin is such a great and success full person.And no matter how many people say bad things about him,he will always turn the other cheek. The most thing that I love about Justin is he never gives up,and he loves his fans. I'm so proud of him and what he has accomplished in life.  To who ever is reading this remember to always \\"BELIEVE\\" in yourself.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure, but I kept watching, and before I knew it, I could not wait until the next episode.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers--this was not a good Jack Reacher story.  As a reader, I kept thinking that it is time for Reacher to get out of the Midwest - South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska because he seems to encounter some wierd challenges. Lee Child should have moved Reacher on from there into another part of the country.<br /><br />This encounter involves Reacher, the FBI, undercover work and a terrorist plot and, as ususal, pits Reacher against incredible odds.  In spite of that, it is a very placid story and not true Reacher form such as you found in WORTH DYING FOR. You sense that Jack is getting old and tired and his body is breaking down.  I hope Reacher gets to Virginia soon.<br />(P. S.  Even John Cena or Duane Johnson would have been better as Reacher  than Tom Cruise)
B001FAZYOQ|4.0|A bit sloppy here & there but a blistering performance.  The height of Bowie's early days.  Nice to hear the as yet unreleased Jean Genie here.  The cover of I'm Waiting for the Man doesn't have the punch the Velvet Underground gave it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|this is a very good game. However, every time I deal a hand, an ad comes up, that I must skip!!
B007OTZ654|5.0|In spite of the &#34;plot&#34; of this concept album not making much sense, I love this album.  Sci-fi and rock 'n' roll come together in a way that doesn't come off as silly.  Mick Ronson & Bowie come up with fantastic riffs.
0810983915|5.0|If your child is into reading this is a series they would enjoy having.  Lots of pictures and an easy read for any child.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I USED THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS. GREAT HEADSET, LITTLE HEAVY, BUT AS A GAMER, I DONT MIND SINCE I USE HEADSETS ALL THE TIME. IT FITS NICE OVER MY GLASSES. THE 7.1 IS AMAZING, AND GOOD QUALITY. ALSO FOR GAMES THAT DO NOT SUPPORT THE 7.1, YOU HAVE YOUR BASIC 2.1. AFTER ABOUT A TOTAL OF 20+ NIGHTS FALLING ASLEEP ON IT WHILE CHARGING (CHARGE AND PLAY IS REALLY NICE)IT FINALLY STARTED TO BREAK. THOUGH NONE OF THE ACTUALLY HEADSET IS UNUSABLE, IT IS JUST HARD TO CHARGE WHILE ON MY HEAD, SO I SWITCH IT OUT WHILE CHARGING. WORKS GREAT, AND THE PROGRAMMABLE BUTTONS AND CONVENIENCE OF THE HEADSET IS AMAZING! DEFINITIVELY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM, AND AM ABOUT TO PURCHASE ANOTHER FOR MYSELF!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Once you start playing Flow Free, you can,t put it down. This game is simple enough for a five year old to play, yet challenging enough for adults.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game . I find it very addictive . Hard to put the game down once you start.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was a good Seth Mcfarlane movie. A good bit vulgar but still funny. In all I really enjoyed it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'm a level 13 dragon trainer on my iphone. on my own kindle I can play when ever I want. now I can get even better.<br />I really love this game if I could I would give this game a 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 star rating
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was actually ordered and read by my husband, Ron, on his Kindle.  He thoroughly enjoyed it and one he will keep on his Kindle to read again sometime.  If he likes a book, he'll read it again after a few months.  He felt this was a true Clancy.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Not a bad attempt at a remake of the original movie but could have developed the plot a little more and relied less on special effects. I enjoyed it but felt there is room for improvement possibly in Total Recall Three?
B004LWZWGK|4.0|It is a &#34;must have&#34; and the pricing and combo pack is a great deal.  The digital copy is now on my tablet for traveling also.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|My husband was surprised to see that Santa Clause had left him this game under the tree.  Have not played it yet but it looks like fun.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|For all that have seen Fireproof this is a definite follow up movie.  For those who have not see it anyhow. A great family movie and good message!!  Very good for dads as a gift.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Afraid after all these years it would be the same old thing but was happily wrong. Intense and hard to put it down
B008HK3XU4|5.0|My first Kindle Fire was stolen.  I received a replacement for Christmas and then ordered this cover.  My original had a leather cover, so I wasn't sure about this one, but it is great.  I feel it has more protection for the Kindle and is easy to use and keep closed with the band.  I am delighted with the cover and had, in fact ordered one for my daughter for Christmas as well.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|I love this movie.  The one star rating is for the sound.  I bought this on instant video.  For the price I paid, I expect to get Dolby Digital, just as I would on the DVD had I purchased it (sure wish I had).  What I got was lousy stereo sound.  I am surprised Amazon treats their instant video customers this way.  Needless to say I will not be purchasing any more instant videos from them.  You live, you learn.  Here is a good slogan for Amazon Instant Video.  Expect better, get less.  Least they could do is warn you on the order page.  Oh well, lesson learned.<br /><br />Update:  I checked out Vudu.com.  All my movies on there, including Standard Definition ones, are in Dolby Digital 5.1+.  Not sure what the plus means but I now know the Vudu.com is the place to buy your digital movies if you want decent sound for your money.  No, I do not work for them, nor do I have any interest in their business.  I do however have a keen interest in high quality sound.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Great family movie, funny, exciting, intriguing, heartwarming. And just an all round fun movie for all ages.  I've watched it multiple times and would watch it again.
B007SGM084|4.0|EL James takes you into a world that one can't possibly comprehend. The way she intertwine the lives of two very different characters keeps the reader wanting more. One of the most intense novels I have ever read.
B005HP2JAM|1.0|The scientific story is nice, but the 3D quality and its worthiness are of bottom quality and really a lot less than average... keeping in mind that one would want to keep watching a 3D movie again and again mainly because of its feel and visual effects, this movie really has none of such qualities.
B0000029LH|5.0|History is Michael Jackson and was one of his best collections in my opinion. I've listened to it since it was released, and listen to it still.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This will be a time killer for me. The games are ok, some nostalgic. But the control isn't always there and the ads can be annoying. Just remember this was a freebie!!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|pretty good game.  simple to play but interesting idea for a game<br />did not like how the &quot;ghosts&quot; kept appearing. it interferred with being able to concentrate on the game
B0084IHVGG|5.0|The grandchildren had this on video and neede a DVD version they are extremly happy to add this to their collection!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it because it's simple and fun but it still gets you thinking! I play it almost everyday now.
B0061QD88S|5.0|The grandchildren will love this dvd and spend hours watching it and adding it to their collection, arrived in a timely fashion.
B00447G29S|5.0|super 3d effects. amazing movie. super good quality. every child will love this movie. I would recommend this to all 3d tv owners.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great book. Love NelsonDeMille  can't wait for more John Corey adventures  you gotta love the constant humor in the super serious situations
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Very well made product.  There is plenty of room for everything I need to take with me.  I would reccomend.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Everything Garth sings is awesome and I love it when Martina Mcbride sings his songs. The two of them should make a song together, it would be a country legend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it and I am totally addicted to it.  great way to challenge my brain in a mundane sort of way.now back to playing...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked the whole series. Anew twist on future exsistance. What a way to live your life. The poor children.
0515149489|5.0|This book is charming as well as serious.  Anyone who loves animals will love this book.  It is well developed with a great plot.  I love the characters and how they act and grow throughout the book. This book is an amazing read, and in my opinion one of her best.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The only magic in this movie is the title. What a bomb. From beginning to end it made no sense and the only reason we watched to the end was we could not believe it would not get better. Don't bother....
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and would definitely recommend it to others. Ridiculous u have to add more words to the write up...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE HAVING THIS APP FOR EASY ACCESS, IT IS GREAT, WOULD ACCESS THROUGH FACEBOOK BEFORE, THIS WAY IS JUST AS EASY:)
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have always enjoyed puzzles and this games really gets it.<br />the amount of puzzles and the way you can choose how many pieces is just fight.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I watched the first season awhile back and find the change up of actors playing these new characters very interesting.  Very unusual, different television.  The five stars are for the show.  I'm new to instant video, however, and I'm not so sure what I've got there.  So I would complain about utilizing the ability to purchase the entire season (which I knew I wanted to watch and so felt the ability to have all episodes and watch on my own terms would be a bonus).  What has happened is that I was able to watch six or so episodes in a row (with the last two becoming available soon after they aired on television), but now I'm stuck as the next episode that aired is NOT becoming available going on three weeks.  Maybe this is just because AMC won't release it, but I think Amazon could at least provide updates or explanations since I can't tell if/ when I will ever get to resume watching the next episode and I've already paid for the season.  If that information does exist, then I'd complain that it is not readily displayed where I go to watch the episodes themselves.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|We only watched about the first 10 minutes. A total waste of money. Horrible , scummy, gross. Hated it, it should have had a warning about content beyond the R rating.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Mr. Shore has done it again, creating an evocative and enthralling score worthy of his three previous Lord of the Rings scores.  The music has just the right amount of LOTR-motif to send chills down the spine at the appropriate places, while creating new melodies that takes the imagination soaring high into Tolkien's Misty Mountains.<br /><br />Now if only the film itself wasn't so silly and drawn-out in all the wrong places as to do this score injustice.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Had low expectations going in but was a very amusing comedy. The dialogue is witty and fast paced. Kept the whole family laughing (2 teen daughters)
B00006C7G9|5.0|A great gift for my Dad.  Everybody I know who's seen this series loves it, and most have seen it more than once.  Highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just really in joy playing this game plus I have a little guy I watch at times and he can even play it.<br />Don't know what else to say beside I just really enjoy it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My 5 year old niece loves this game.  It keeps her occupied for hours when I babysit so I can get some things done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Loads real fast and easy to understand for a person just learning how to get around on my knew toy. Having a good time playing the game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy trying to figure out each puzzle and it is good for my 5 yr. old niece as well.  We work on the puzzles together.  She's better at than I am.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show lots of stuff happens in this season it has now became my 2nd favorite show of all time with of coarse LOST being 1 it is fairly close I definitely recommend it and BTW you find out who A is
1423140591|3.0|I have received the book and read it.The story is good I think and so will wait for anorhee book from rick
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts out easy- that's how they get you!  It gets more challenging, but still fun! But then an hour has gone by! Love it!
B00028HBKM|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed as there is no original English sound track.  The choice of languages were Chinese/ Latin/ English ( not native English spoken). The words and sound track are off beat at times. Othis than this, the movie was ok.
0545265355|4.0|I really liked the story. Enjoyable since the first to the last chapter. It's worth the price and its simply beautiful the hard cover.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love the game only wish when you buy your private stash of coins, the  game still will regenerate coins for you.....
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Kinda choppy cut scenes and had weird resolution in some areas but it had great plot for this sort of game and was well worth the money.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Great book ! Very captivating throughout but read it with a knowledge that the ending is abrupt and is a big cliffhanger to get you to want to read book 3
B005HJWWW8|2.0|This arrived with a bad short in the output. I tried several sets of headphones and connectors and none work without shorting. It causes one channel, the left channel, to be cut. I am returning this amp. Will look at others.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love to read a book and learn -- learn about wounded people coping the best they can while facing challenges. Very creative in using the flowers to communicate the story.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Misérables is a breathtaking masterpiece that has climbed to my favorite spot. As one of my already favorite musicals, I found the movie to be one of greatness and emotion. Heart wrenching, yet lovable, Les Mis is a film to savor.
0765316994|5.0|Really enjoyed this story, and loved all of the Star Trek references! Scalzi doesn't really make fun of the old show, but it seemed like more of a wink, wink, nudge, nudge type of homage. I don't know if it will make as much sense or be as amusing if you've never seen the original Star Trek, but I found myself nodding along and laughing out loud at times!<br /><br />Ensign Dahl is excited to be assigned to the flagship of the fleet, the Intrepid. It's a prestigious assignment, but then he begins to notice odd behavior from the rest of the crew. Their habit of disappearing whenever certain officers appear, and their strange reluctance to go on away missions. Comparing notes with other new crew members, they begin to realize that something is not quite right.<br /><br />Very glad that Scalzi wrote this story, though I'm puzzled why no one else beat him to the punch as you have to admit, it was a story begging to be told! Why did no one on the original Enterprise ever notice that away missions were so dangerous when the senior officers participated? And why would officers be allowed to go on dangerous missions anyway? Leaders never fight on the front lines, so why would the Captain and his senior officers? Seems a little irresponsible to me.<br /><br />This was a very fun read that I finished it in one sitting! Loved the ending, as it made me laugh. And I really enjoyed the codas at the end. Not really necessary, but a nice addition. Gave this one a 5/5 as I really loved it, love Scalzi's sense of humor, and am looking forward to reading all of his other books!
0812993357|5.0|Grace is a great story teller and its wonderful to hear her tell them in her own words. A must read
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|As everyone else has pointed out. But it's still a good album, a great mix of the different styles on the show.
0517543052|5.0|I bought it when it first came out and along the way , lent it to someone and you know the rest... It had such an impact on me then i wanted to reread it and i am happy i did !
1433502410|5.0|This Bible version has proven to be perfect for my needs.  It is an easy reas and is full of informative notes and commentary.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was hilarious I couldn't breathe I loved everything and I would recommend this to everybody I know  succinct by v
B000JIHP88|4.0|We purchased this mobile to match other Fisher Price Rainforest line items. Great mobile - adorable, good selection of music. We appreciate the handheld remote to turn it off / on. Easy to attach to crib side.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I have so enjoyed this Cd through this Holiday Season. Zoey has the most incredible voice! I think people should look her up on YouTube.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I made sure to read this comic before actually seeing the movie and the reaction of the average movie goer was exactly what I thought it would be. I really liked it a lot, since I knew what was going on with the movie. I highly recommend it; but warn that it is not your typical super hero movie.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|I love the first two Home Alone movies (after that, not so much).  They're so much fun and remind me of earlier Xmas fun.  If you've never seen one, do yourself a favor and watch it.  If you've already seen it, relive the magic.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I understand how so many women love this movie as Channing looks good.  Unfortunately, the movie needed a stronger storyline.  The movie was going along fine but I felt like the end lost a lot of steam.  This will be fine if you need a mindless movie for a girls night.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an amazing and exciting book must read and read the next book because this was great recommended. Good
B009JBZH54|5.0|best  super hero  movie ever the dark  knight # 2  was  the best  an a  most excellent price...well done mr nolan
B00004YRQA|5.0|My son was very excited to receive his brand new memory card for the ps 2, it came quickly and in excellent condition - since it was brand new in it package still.  Would definitely buy here again!
B0097L29KM|2.0|I loved the idea behind the way they recorded this album. I own much of the same recording gear and have always been inspired by the way it shapes music.<br /><br />But, opening the album with an essentially two chord song that needlessly meanders for nearly 30 minutes is a bit too much to ask anyone to endure, especially when played by a band as unexceptional as Crazy Horse. I kept thinking of that scene with Chico Marx endlessly playing a song after claiming he'd forgotten the ending. I now sypathise with Groucho's sentiment of, \\"That's funny, I can't think of anything else.\\"<br /><br />And does music get any less involving than the pointless and musically flat Born In Ontario? To add to my disbelief, the album sequence goes right into another song with the same rhythm, flat melody and key immediatly after. This band needs a producer!<br /><br />And speaking of unexceptional, the recording, although praised by *some* audiophiles, is bland and unremarkable. It's like eating at an expensive restaurant only to discover the chef refused to add salt. I guess the AAA process is truly more important than the outcome in the audiophile world. The only way to make it sound good is to turn up the volume and engage the Fletcher Munson curve.<br /><br />I'm sorry I spent the money on this one. Uninspired, relentless and boring. But other than that, at least the records cost a lot.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is so cool and scary. When I first saw the game  I though it would be  garbage. But then I saw the reviews and I had to try it. And when I did, the first time I saw slender I jumped and screamed. Awesome game. Really recommend it
034580404X|3.0|This time of year as everyone was or is purchasing merchandise as presents, Amazon is asking for ratings. All I can say the person that I gave it as a gift was impressed.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book was really good, though I almost cried at the end. I fell in love with the characters, and really liked how the author wrote so descriptively. :) Totally deserves 5 stars
B0042RJWTC|4.0|Good movie, believe I already rated this item.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is a lot of fun but the part I would change is add more characters but the game is still really fun even with the short amount of characters I wish I could give it 100 stars I recommend getting it and ITS FREE can't go wrong
0307595579|4.0|Gave as gifts, cannot write a truthful review
B00992CF6W|3.0|Mine craft is so creative, but I don't like how the graphics are so poor, but besides that, the game Is so fun.
B0034G4P9E|3.0|This time of year as everyone was or is purchasing merchandise as presents, Amazon is asking for ratings. All I can say the person that I gave it as a gift was impressed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I personally loved the book. I cried when rue died. It was a book packed with a very strange feeling that was almost frightening and left me sitting on the edge of my seat. I would fin  my self staying up unroll midnight not realizing what time it was because I was so engaged  in the story. My favorite part was in the cave with the star crossed lovers. That was my favorite part because that part of the book was so filled with detail that I felt that I was in the scene with them.
B004SUDPWI|4.0|Have this on DVD and decided to purchase the Blu Ray version. Still a very good movie and better on Blu-Ray
B00A757EFW|3.0|It's is a very good game and easy to play I think you would buy this game today or now.<br />.
B000WC39SG|4.0|Have this on DVD, but wanted to see if it was better on Blu-Ray, it is. Excellent picture and sound.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The  meaning of this book   is  to love while you can because you never know when your true love is coming maybe they can be right in your face and when you do find them give them the kiss they deserve
B001EO748M|3.0|The reason why only three stars with this I had to repurchase Season 2 because that season would not play. The other seasons played fine.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Here we have a movie where nobody says anything, almost nothing happens and somehow people think it's art.  What makes Drive a little unusual is that it is both hyper-violent (I mean, disgusting) and at the same time, so slow that you'll wonder if the DVD has stopped spinning.  The \\"actors\\" in Drive seem so utterly disinterested, I expected them to curse, walk off and leave the screen blank.  I didn't think Drive was a terrible movie; I just wasn't sure it was a movie.<br /><br />As an afterthought, I read some of the positive reviews about Drive and no, it doesn't have brilliant acting, lighting (it's normal L.A.), dialog or music.  But one person pointed out that it is reminiscent of some of those desperately sad, essentially pointless movies we saw in the late 60s-70s.  I'm not saying Drive is 1/100th as good as Electra Glide In Blue or even Vanishing Point but it does share their life sucks and then you die viewpoint.  In those days, when we were sitting around, waiting to be sent to Vietnam, Drive would have fit right in.  Except it would need to be an hour longer.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|Saw this on TV and had to have it. Very good movie, lots of action. Since have purchased on Blu-Ray even better.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is great fun! I would compare this type of movie to: Butter, or Best in Show.<br />The singing was fun to watch/listen, and didn't last too long.  I really liked the cast--some older and new faces mixed.<br />Definitely worth the rental fee, and much cheaper than going to the theater!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter who is just under a year old, it is the perfect size and seems to be very durable!
075669812X|5.0|I gave this as a gift & it was recieved by a very happy 7 year old who stated this was his favorite gift he recieved!  He loves reading about all his favorite characters!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is extremely fun and addicting! It starts off deceptively easy, but it gets increasingly harder. I think I'm being tricked into exercising  my brain! ;-)
B002GL92K0|5.0|My grand kids like all kind of lego's so I'm sure they like this one as well.  The more lego's sets they can get the better!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|jgjgjgjgufjvjjvvv z. s s s s. ss s s s s h. g h gu u gugj hjh hi hi h h h h y y h un j k k k h. g f#!6 j h h j j u h uhghhv hy h hy uh uh hy uh fun
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I Got this for my son-in-law as a Christmas gift.  He loves this group so loves this gift and was playing it alot when I was there.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|for some reason i avoided this movie for a long time, so the ideas put forth by trailers and reviewers were for the most part absent from my mind. i didn't want to decide going in what kind of movie it was supposed to be, i just wanted to watch it. and then i enjoyed the hell out of it.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Great choice to make when buying an editor for a good price. Well worth the 99 cents, with lots options(:
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I'd heard the novel and series was very good, so I wanted to give it a shot. While it wasn't the best I've ever read, I'll read the next one.
B000056HE9|5.0|My boyfriend mentioned this movie to me months before Christmas as one of his favorite holiday movies. We watched it together shortly after he opened the gift. It is a nice story and the acting is wonderful.
0765348276|2.0|I expected this to be a good read as it seems so popular in the SF world, but it's really bad. The plot is cliched, as are the characters. There are a few genuinely interesting ideas here, but they're lost in the utter banality of the rest of the story and the terrible writing.<br /><br />I abandoned this book about halfway through because I just couldn't take it any more. There was no nuance, no depth and the characters, and I mean ALL the characters, are like the cast of a cheap, badly-written sitcom. It's like a constant string of dad jokes, wisecracks and cheap gags that simply are not funny. It got to the point that reading this started to feel like watching your old dad dance at a party and I'd had enough.<br /><br />A real shame, but I simply do not understand all the love for this book.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I don't think I can truly share with you the wonderful expression and excitement I received by my boyfriend when he opened this Christmas present. He LOVES this show...
B006LSZECO|4.0|Suspenseful to the point where you don't want to put it down! I'm required to type more words yay! Nonsense
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I thought that it was a different app than what is was, but I still like it. Give it a try.
B0030MM68O|4.0|Honestly, I don't understand this movie's rave reviews and awards. Was a good movie, but didn't think it was that great.
B005AERS74|5.0|This is a great CD - upbeat and fun! I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it in the mail!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Love this movie. Seen it like 4 times, and it gets better each time. Intriguing and very suspense-filled. Highly recommended.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|i bought this app because the free download wouldnt let me run any other apps while it was playing. now i can read a book on my kindle while using the white noise to help my baby sleep longer. only complaint i have is that i wish it was a littIe louder.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|I bought this because I watched the pilot and thought it was great. Am a few episodes in, and, I have to saw, the episodes I've seen are OK, but aren't anywhere near as good as the pilot. Haven't seen the whole season yet, so maybe it'll get better. But it's been disappointing to watch what I thought be be a great show just be an OK one.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|it wasn't coming at you 3D. More like simulated 3d, but sine is a terrific movie i still enjoyed it..
B0001HAISG|5.0|I saw this film many times ever since I got the DVD. Also, to me, it is an adventurous film that I liked since I got it.
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|Witty, funny, great characters, great story. Will watch again and again.  Love Tim Roth in this as well as the other actors.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I may have seen this a lot of times, but I liked this film and the bonus features that came with it.
B00846REIS|1.0|I don't see how people are comparing this book to 50 Shades, mainly because they are practically the same. I feel dumb spending $10 on this book and will not buy the others even if they are a penny. Now if they are free, I may just consider.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|This is a great movie. Watching the character, who is out of control, get her life back together and the choices she is forced to make after getting out of rehab.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it on vacation and finished it in two days. The characters were pretty well developed, Holder just seemed angry for no reason to me. I understand what happened to his sister could make him upset but he just seemed way to angry all the time. It also annoyed me that Sky called him Holder throughout the book. Um, he's your boyfriend not your buddy, why not just call him by his first name. I don't see how a sequel could be made after this one, but if there was one I would probably read it. Good job Ms. Hoover!
B003OCWF6I|5.0|Loved this movie,fast going,great story,good laughs. Only thing crappy was,as always,betrayal by one of the group. Rest of the guys were pretty funny.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Have this on my Kindle Fire and it is very responsive. Runs smooth and no complaints. Would highly recommend this app.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this app is amazing I live it cause I love littlest pet shop so it fits my personallaty so I would and do love this app its amazing
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie had me laughing from beginning to end.  The movie did not disappoint me. I would recommend watching this movie.
B0047685I2|5.0|Best Cinderella movie ever!  Excellent acting, directing, and producing! Very entertaining with drama, comedy, and even a little action, and of course Drew is a knockout!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I hated this movie.Poor lttle kids that went to see Batman. He looked more sinister then the villians when he did show up.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|why would the producers release a \\"soundtrack\\" missing so many key songs.  maybe to sucker people into buying this,realizing its missing a lot and the the producers release the full sound track to entice people to double buy.  what a crock...while i loved the movie and the music such a badly lacking album  merits only 1 star
B004GTLFNW|5.0|This book is a great resource for body weight exercises and gives you many variations to make them as easy or as challenging as you want them to be. The associated app has video examples of all the exercises as well as some other great features so it pays to get the book and the app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was probably the best one so far. I loved it so much. If this became a movie I would totally go see it.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Great game for kids and adults, the levels get quite challenging as you move on so it's not as easy as it looks.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Four stars. The personage of Mr. Lockwood makes a slightly unsatisfactory and unnecessary narrator and is my only qualm. The remainder of the story is staggeringly brilliant; I've encountered nothing like it before.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I don't usually play these types of games but everyone else in my family is playing Dragonvale. It's something we can do together.
0547564651|5.0|Excellent research and supports all my beliefs as a teacher and parent.  I  have recommended this book to many of my collegues and friends. A must read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book!!  The twist and turns were many.  Loved how it all came together.  Great characters and storyline. Colleen Hoover never disappoints.  She is officially one of my favourite authors.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very useful tool to keep everything in a notebook and share with friends. espacially when you are out on a tour.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I like the game, but don't believe the hype about it being \\"history.\\" The \\"history\\" portion of the game is a very thin veneer - VERY thin - over the puzzles, and the puzzles are all the same type: a match/remove/drop game similar to a very simple Tetris/Tetris Link. I have also NOT failed a single level; there's an \\"explode everything\\" sort of button which somehow always manages to free the pieces you need.<br /><br />So, it's cute, it's fun, but it ain't all that...<br /><br />EDIT: actually, it's better to compare it to Jeweled/Bejeweled vs. Tetris...
B004KKX80A|5.0|My son was surprised it can &#34;switch modes&#34;.  It was a great deal.  This is not commonly available in stores.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i just love this game!!!!!!!!  i would recommend this to everyone.  I can play this game for hours and hours.
B0000DD79B|5.0|I believe the Essential Simon & Garfunkel is the best introduction you can possibly experience from Simon & Garfunkel.  It doesn't include EVERY one of their fantastic tunes (for that you'd need to buy all their regular albums as well) but it does include all the familiar classics (every single one of them in fact) as well as giving the casual fan more incentive to go a little deeper and check out the rest of this collection instead of just skimming around and playing the hits.  For that, it's a successful and well-made 2-disc set of quality songs from start to finish.<br /><br />\\"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M\\" is a beautifully quiet folk tune with Paul Simon's trademark vocal style.  So warm and cozy, you'll feel like you're well-protected listening to a piece of music like this.  Guaranteed.  \\"Bleecker Street\\" is slightly more upbeat... and when I say \\"upbeat\\" I'm not necessarily referring to Whitesnake here, haha.  \\"The Sound of Silence\\" is a classic.  The vocal melody that makes me think about peace moreso than any other song ever recorded.  When I was younger the melody would instantly make me think about death, however I don't really think it's as devastatingly surreal like I once did.  However, it still makes me cry almost every single time I hear it.  What a melody.  My newfound interpretation of the lyrics is that silence can be a rewarding and beautiful moment.  \\"Leaves That Are Green\\" has lyrics we can all relate to- the peacefulness of time passing by and the people we've met that are either no longer a part of our lives, or passed away years ago.  The memories shall be brought to our attention once again with a melody this splendid.<br /><br />The lyrics to \\"A Most Peculiar Man\\" reminds me of myself!  I'm not peculiar am I?  No, not last time I checked.  Alright alright, I do peculiar things sometimes.  Like I insist on cleaning the salt and pepper shakers before I go to bed.  That's strange.  I like to make sure those shaker holes aren't clogged next time Iuse them.  I take a shower and wash my body parts in a certain order every single time.... I suppose that's unusual.  But anyway!!!  This song has a pretty solid melody.  It's all about Paul Simon's warm vocals that make it so unbelievably touching.  \\"I Am a Rock\\" is another magnificent song that captures the spirit of the folk scene in the mid 60's.  Somehow Simon & Garfunkel had a way of making their music seem BIGGER than a time period piece.  The Hollies covered this song and did a pretty awesome version but *this* is clearly the best version ever made.  \\"Richard Cory\\" picks up the pace.  This song rocks.  Well I mean, not necessarily rocks but is significantly more upbeat than the previous 6 tracks.  \\"Kathy's Song\\" takes a tad longer to get into than the other songs here.  Not really sure why.  It's another mellow example of Simon & Garfunkel's distinct style of folk/rock genius.<br /><br />\\"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\\" will always be associated with piano class in either 10th or 11th grade when I had to learn how to play it.  When I finally figured it out I felt so much relief, and I loved showing off my piano skills by playing this song at rocket speed in front of others, haha.  It's not meant to be played so fast however- it's a mystical-inspired melody that captures the feeling of inner peace and for me, the precious days of childhood.  I will forever connect \\"Homeward Bound\\" with the Disney movie that came out in the early 90's involving a golden retriever, bulldog and a cat finding their way home.  Of course it also captures the joy of returning home after being away for so long (for people as well as animals).  It captures that feeling quite perfectly in fact.<br /><br />\\"The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)\\" is a pretty straight forward song that's probably not technically much different from \\"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\\" but somehow, it's radically different.  Huh?  Make sense?  Let me try to explain- only a talented act like Simon & Garfunkel cantake two songs with a similar style and effectively make them give off radically different emotions and mental pictures.  \\"The Dangling Conversation\\"  features a creative set of lyrics.  The meaning sounds to me like another way to interpret everyday life.  The atmosphere is really elegant and almost classical-like.  \\"A Poem on the Underground Wall\\" is perhaps a partial poem in the sense that the melody is caught between reciting a poem and singing.  Really cool song though.<br /><br />\\"A Hazy Shade of Winter\\" is perhaps even better than the Bangles version!  Seriously, the Bangles have a pretty solid version too but nothing beats the one that captures my favorite time period for music- the 60's and 70's.  \\"At the Zoo\\"... oh!  OH!!  I know what song this is, haha.  I didn't recognize the melody just by glancing at the song title.  This has a really steady-paced rockabilly style rhythm that sort of reminds me of Jim Croce's \\"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\\".  That can only be a great thing!  \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" will always remind me of my 8th English teacher, Mr. Robinson!  Alright so he's not a Mrs.  Oh well.  Close enough!  He had/has a wife.  Anyway he was one of the nicest people I've ever met.  He'd basically let the class get away with murder because he was WAY too polite and easy going.  Kids would walk all over him constantly as a result.  Anyway he lives right up the road from me, and since we both live out in the country and Simon & Garfunkel reminds me of the country life... you can probably see how I'm making a connection between my old English teacher and this wonderful tune!  At least I hope you can. :)<br /><br />\\"Fakin' It\\" has a groovy melody with subtle \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\"-type arrangements in the background capturing the psychedelic period of rock music so wonderfully.  The vocal melody is nothing short of brilliant.  \\"Old Friends\\" has pleasant orchestration elevating an already pretty good vocal melody.  Perhaps the orchestration isn't necessary, especially the overdone portion near the end.  Either way I enjoy the song.  Getting caught up with a long lost friendship is of the highest order apparently.  The orchestration really merges into \\"Bookends Theme\\" quite well.  This is all about lovely-performed guitar playing with somber vocals.  \\"America\\" is another fantastic song.  How many times can I compliment these wonderful songs?  For all eternity!  A perfect vocal melody to slow dance to.  I can't put into words how awesome I think this melody is.  It's really anthemic but in a subtle folk-ish kind of way- not in the typical sense.  In other words, the atmosphere provides a different interpretation of America that makes me want to stand up and solute my country whenever it plays.  Actually it captures the feeling of being on a ship and coming towards America while wondering about the curiosity that awaits (if you're a foreigner that is).  \\"Overs\\" is a lazy day ballad.  What WILL I get into today?  This kind of melody begs the question.  Not a favorite of mine to be honest.<br /><br />\\"El Conder Pasa (If I Could)\\" begins with a rather enchanted Spanish guitar before flutes and a *spectacular beyond words* vocal melody appears.  Paul Simon turns heavenly about halfway through- not sure what he's doing to his vocal range at this point.  Perhaps it's the flutes in the background changing his tone.  Whether intentional or not, it's a perfect song.  \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" has the perfect build-up of emotions.  The way this song develops is unlike anything else, seriously.  Dramatic is one word to describe it, and hard to resist from crying.  \\"Cecilia\\" is my dad's favorite song and the main reason I bought him this Essential Simon & Garfunkel set.  I knew he'd love not only this song, but the entire album.  Anyway \\"Cecilia\\" is notable for being upbeat with strange drumming in the intro and, once again, a vocal melody that's out of this world awesome.  \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied\\" feels almost out of place being in between so many ultra serious and compassionate pieces.  This song is all about being fun and captures the spirit of the mid 60's rock scene the likes of which the Monkees and Mamas & Papas performed so well. \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" is a softly sung ballad more fitting for the first disc perhaps, but I welcome it with love and support on the second disc as well.  I wonder if Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel really DID harmonize 'till dawn.  Did they?  Nice flutes at the end that reminds me of the early summer mornings when the crickets stop chirping and the sun comes up through the trees.<br /><br />\\"The Boxer\\" has a vocal melody and atmosphere that reminds me of being lost in the woods and not sure if I'll ever find my way out.  Every turn I make is one that makes me cautious and confused.  Another, more alarming feeling is whether I can accept death or not.  Something about the tune makes me think about these confusing and mysterious questions.  \\"Baby Driver\\" is for anyone that likes Paul Simon's \\"Loves Me Like a Rock\\"- two exciting songs structured in a similar fashion (at least during the verse melody).  \\"The Only Living Boy In New York\\" is sort of depressing and incredibly mellow, and maybe more appropriate for the first disc (much like \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\").  \\"Song For The Asking\\" doesn't seem like much of a song at first- repeated listens reveal an element of beauty that lingers and makes you want to cry.  \\"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her\\" begins with some really gorgeous guitar chords and a tender sung vocal melody that lights up my senses.  Really beautiful.  How a ballad SHOULD be written.  I have \\"My Little Town\\" on Paul Simon's Still Crazy After All These Years album.  Art Garfunkel got back together with Paul Simon for a short time just to make this one excellent song.  My favorite song on that album, but on this Essential Simon & Garfunkel set... it's just another in a long list of quality tracks.<br /><br />If the first time you play this set you're not blown away, listen to it again.  The second time through is the key to finding out what makes this music so fantastic.  Oh, and some of these versions are supposedly different from the other more familiar versions.  However, I fail to hear what makes \\"The Sound of Silence\\" for example much different from the one I've been hearing on radio stations for years.  If there's a difference it's really subtle and the average person wouldn't be able to notice.  The 7 or 8 live tracks are all really good too- the audience only cheers at the beginning and end of the live tracks as to not distract from the overall listening experience.  STRONGLY recommended for a purchase.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|My husband requested this DVD and I was happy to have found it at such a great price at Amazon.  I do not like this particular genre of movies, but he loves it and watches it over and over.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a cute book with a familiar unrealistic story.  Low on steamy sex scenes. A quick read.  Loved Connor at first but then not so much.  And why doesn't Megan have friends?
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Cool spin on the original.  Energy can run out quickly so you have to watch that. Overall I'm enjoying it so far.
B007RJJVSO|5.0|This album can never get old and I've had it playing over and over. From the acoustic harmonizations to the eerie ethereal aura of uncomfortability only Akerfelt and Wilson could put together, this album never ceases to surprise me. Get your copy now. It is a must.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was purchased as a gift for someone else.  They have enjoyed reading the other books in the series and have said this one is just as good as the others.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Adobe can not be used on android devices. This is a shame as now there are magazines I cannot read on my kindle fire HD. Very disappointed.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great read. Very well paced and written. Anxious to read more Connelly books! I like the clean uncluttered story line.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Excellent! I can't stop playing.  It's a lot of fun!! I keep starting over and over to better my score.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Lots of different activities to keep you interested. Fun story storyline to keep you entertained. I totally recommend buying it.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|The writing in this story is as soothing as a cool drink on a sweltering day. I kept stopping to read bits of paragraphs and sentences to my husband; I relished every single page of this book. I just love the way that Lionel Shiver brings the story to life, and the exploration of ambiguity in motherhood is something that you just don't get to read about every day.<br /><br />Kevin's character was a bit unbelievable (I don't believe in a baby being evil from birth), but he served well as a device for Eva's development. Eva Katchadourian is one of the most memorable characters I've ever had the pleasure of being acquainted with. Honestly, I really want to read another book by Shriver, but I'm a bit nervous that her others may not live up to this one, so I haven't done it yet.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This game is great. I played edge extend on my PC so seeing this newer version on mobile made me really happy. The puzzles begin simple and increase in difficulty quickly but I guarantee you'll be hooked as you revisit levels to get that A or even better, an S. Get it now, you won't regret it!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|This is the best bodyweight exercise resource I've ever found. There are so many exercises and variations in this book that I've never even heard of, let alone tried.
B003297I1U|5.0|We ordered the Scania crane over the Mack version due to availability (the Mack was sold out at the time).  My son couldn't believe it when he unwrapped it on Christmas morning.  I was able to give him a Bruder catalog several months ago and he hasn't stopped looking through it and making his &#34;wish list&#34; ever since.<br /><br />The crane is awesome and incredibly detailed.  My son loves it and has played with it non-stop since Christmas.<br /><br />We can only hope it will hold up to his constant playing with it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|really fun and quite surprisingly relaxing puzzle game due to the nice piano music playing in the background, that you can turn off.  quite challenging too!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a very nice solitaire app. It's a lot of fun. get it, you won't be sorry. Ads arent too annoying.
B00241YHMU|5.0|An amazing movie. Brad Pitt is at his finest and it is a beautiful story for both men and women.
B008K6DU4Y|2.0|This application kept closing a few minutes into the video.  Tried it several times.  Maybe it needs some tweaks for Kindle Fire HD?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I choose this rating because I really enjoyed reading it. It kept me hooked and always wanting to know what happens next. I would definitely recommend this book to read.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I tried another player that worked on an Android tablet first, but it had issues.  This seems to be working well.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|Fun,crazy,strange, and did I mention fun. Not hard but not to simple either, just right to settle down with. I agree it is addictive.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The writing is very clear and concise.  While I am not sure how accepting I am of what he relates, he definitely gave me something to think about.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|can't get enough of this game! perfect time killer! It's so much fun. you can do this and watch Tv at the same time and always move on to the next level!
B008QE9VJI|4.0|I like all of his movies, it's a must see. the price was just right. he is a great actor.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I don't normally spend $3 on a game, but this one is worth every penny! Interesting story line keeps you guessing, a great combination of hidden object and puzzle, I have no complaints other than waiting for part 2! This had just a touch of creepiness, which I enjoy, and was suitable for my whole family. Highly recommend!
B005LAIIS0|4.0|I'm a fan of lian neeson, he was great in this movie, i liked it because its ending wasn't the usual some one gets saved. really good movie.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I have never read a graphic novel before this but loved it! I started out watching the show and was surprised at how much was fit into the first volume, it went so fast.<br />Illustrations were amazing and storyline was awesome! Very very addicting.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|i have all the seasons, can't wait for the fifth season. Breaking bad keeps you wanting more. I'm hooked on this show. this is must have.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game. Very much like Mario except w a leprechaun. Fun game w great controls. Music not great.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|this was one of the most stupid movie ever, it didnt even finish watching it, carmen diaz wasn't  really acting.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Won't play on my metro Huawei Activa :(  But, I heard and saw it was a pretty good game anywho! Just wish I could play!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|He's an ass - not intentionally, just obliviously an ass. She's frustrated and sad. She wants to fix the marriage, he thinks it isn't broken, but - see, he's not a total ass - he goes for the counseling to please her. It's a nice story, honest without being maudlin, with a happy ending. Go for it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is a normal app... for Face book, who would guess.  The thing I do not like about the app is the fact that it will not STOP running even after I tell it not to update, keep wifi off and end the process.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|Wow. A French Girl in New York is a Cinderella story, about an orphan living in Northern France with a foster family that treats her very poorly. Forced to work from dawn to dusk, caring for the family children, cleaning, waiting on the mistress of the house, and expected to attend school and do well in her classes at the same time. Maude Laurent teaches herself piano on Saturday afternoons while her mistress is with friends. For five years, the piano sessions are what keep her going. At the age of 16, she manipulates a grade to be allowed to go on a day trip to Paris and her life begins to change.<br /><br />A French Girl in New York is a story of new beginnings, of misunderstandings, of family, love, betrayal, and triumph. The sole shortcoming in this book is that the lyrics to the songs aren't very good. I don't hold that against the book because if you actually listen to most lyrics, they really aren't that good. That doesn't stop a song from touching a chord with people or from becoming a huge hit, and these lyrics in no way stop this story from being both believable and touching.<br /><br />The story is well written. The insights on the music industry are plausible, which matters because music is at the heart of this story. The author captures the confusion of being a teenager without ever descending into parody or becoming melodramatic. Adults and teens both will love this story. Teens can recognize the turmoil of being a teen, and adults can recall that turmoil without being embarrassed by the characters. That is a difficult balance to strike. Author Anna Adams deserves praise for this beautiful, touching tale.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Pretty good game, a little confusing at some times but that is the whole point.  Not my favorite puzzle game but, it is a good time on mobile
B000W9399S|5.0|The first in the Discworld series, this is wonderfully hilarious - laugh out loud and read it to strangers on the bus hilarious. Pratchett writes a fabulous story and the Discworld series is immense, so once you read this one, there are many more to satisfy that need. Best of all, they are all re-readable, infinitely so. Everytime I reread one, people around me end up asking &#34;What is that?&#34; because it's not an occassional chuckle, it's page after page of rib-cracking laughter.
B00005AXKF|1.0|This movie was the German version. Did not realize that when I ordered it and it does not have an option for English so it is u usable here in the united states
B0007TKNII|5.0|Almost as great as seeing it on Broadway! My 13 year old daughter and I still get goosebumps during the roof top scene!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Got this app thinking that it would entertain the kids.  I love playing it just as much as they do!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|No words except wow! And I guess more because it's required by the review. This book, and I can only assume the series as a whole, is AMAZING! Onto book two. :'D
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Josh Brolin did an great job as a younger Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K). Enjoyed this movie as much as the other two.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Niece loved it and can't wait to add it to her collection.  Nothing wrong with this purchase and I would recommend it.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I am a total fan of all of the Resident Evils but this one by far is One of the Best. Was disappointed in the fact, after Resident Evil<br />Extinction (2007) where she burnt up all of those crows with her mental power, I would like to see that again in what of the Resident Evil sequences.
B009NOVCSS|2.0|Two of the five cd's have skips in them. I'm gonna try cleaning them and see if that fixes them, if not guess I'm screwed!!!
B007FZ7QZA|5.0|I actually only purchased this CD for one song so I'm giving it 5 stars. I scanned through only a few others and they were ok. If you are a Chris Brown fan, it's probably good.
B006O6F932|2.0|I is not very good quality. When folded up it doesn't stay together, always wants to open. Purple clips that hold the backdrops pop off all the time. My daughters don't even want to play with it because it is so cheaply made. They told me I should return it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW! Just wow. I don't think I have ever noted, bookmarked or highlighted any book as much as I have this one. I almost instantly fell in love with Holder the more I read him the more I fell.<br /><br />The chemistry between these two is just amazing, they way they are written its like you're right there experiencing it as you read. There's so much I love about this book I can't really write it all down here, just know that this is definitely a MUST READ!<br /><br /> As a warning I have to state that there is a twist and things get serious, but that's as far as I'm going with that.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, I am very interested in NDE&#34;S.  Their were some areas which was a wee bit technical for a layman.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I liked the comics books when I was a kid, and this film really brings them to life.  I think the Hulk really was true to the way he was portrayed by the original writers
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's like the real game at the arcade . I like that u get more coins often w/in the day . and you can turn in prizes for coins.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The film is interesting though I feel over hyped for what press it got.  I did not read the book so I don't know if it is true to it or not.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|good game with enough challenge to make it interesting but not so much as too make it frustrating.<br />Great game.
B009IQG5LK|4.0|Warren Beatty's DICK TRACY followed the release of Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and, to a degree, was undoubtedly influenced by the 1989 blockbuster -- from Danny Elfman's urgent underscoring to campy performances from a rogue's gallery of villains in heavy make-up (Al Pacino being the primary heavy), \\"Dick Tracy\\" sought to capitalize on the then-hot comic book film/TV genre. Alas, while the genre would soon stall out again (at least until \\"Spider-Man\\" launched the \\"Marvel era\\" over a decade later), the movie has surprisingly held up over the years -- and ranks as superior to the original Burton \\"Bat\\" as well.<br /><br />Part of the reason for the film's enduring elements come in Beatty's artistic vision: the Vittorio Storaro cinematography and Richard Sylbert production design completely evoke the 1930s design of Chester Gould's original comic books, making the movie a virtual comic-strip come-to-life. Every frame of the movie looks like a panel from its source material, and the Jim Cash-Jack Epps, Jr. script (reportedly enhanced with contributions from Bo Goldman) mixes campiness with candy-coated action effectively. The movie also works because of its amazing cast, not all of whom are recognizable under heavy make-up: in addition to Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, James Caan, William Forsythe, and Mandy Patinkin pop up as some of Tracy's nemeses, while Seymour Cassel, Dick Van Dyke, Michael J. Pollard and Charles Durning are more recognizable in other supporting turns.<br /><br />If the movie has a shortcoming, it's in its female leads: several years prior to Beatty working with Annette Bening and subsequently falling in love with his co-star, the actor/director fell for Madonna and promptly cast her as femme fatale Breathless Mahoney. Complete with original songs penned for the film by Stephen Sondheim, Madonna`s night club dame could`ve ignited sparks with Beatty`s Tracy, but her scenes end up fizzling out and stopping the movie cold while Beatty, the director,overly admires his then off-screen prize. Also a disappointment is Glenne Headley, who proves to be merely serviceable as Tracy's Girl Friday, Tess Trueheart. Sean Young claimed to have been lined up for the role but was rejected by Beatty when (she says) she refused his romantic advances -- a claim that's not hard to believe given Beatty's relationships with his leading ladies (and it's too bad as well, since Young would've been preferable to Headley, particularly in that type of period role).<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Dick Tracy\\" is great fun to look at and particularly captivating for movie buffs because of its cast. Disney's Blu-Ray edition of the film, which also includes a digital copy, doesn't offer any extras, but does, fortunately, offer a spiffy, if somewhat \\"soft\\" looking, 1080p AVC encoded HD transfer with a dynamic DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Our 7 year old loves anything angry birds, and this was no exception.  This can be used as a stand alone, or interchangeably with other sets.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|With \\"Lincoln\\" currently in theaters, it's no surprise that several of director Steven Spielberg's past works are being released on Blu-Ray for the first time. Though a commercial disappointment and the recipient of numerous mixed reviews at the time of its original release, Spielberg's \\"Empire of the Sun\\" remains - for me - one of the filmmaker's finest achievements. A towering adaptation of J.G. Ballard's autobiographical novel of a young British boy (Christian Bale) separated from his parents during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai in WWII, Spielberg's film - scripted by Tom Stoppard - follows \\"Jamie/Jim\\"'s subsequent internment in a POW camp and efforts to survive alongside contrasting parental figures ranging from a British doctor (Nigel Havers) to an American sailor (John Malkovich).<br /><br />\\"Empire of the Sun\\" has dozens of indelible cinematic moments and remains incredibly compelling for all its two-and-a-half hour running time. Though many have argued through the years that Spielberg only \\"grew up\\" when he made \\"Schindler's List,\\" \\"Empire of the Sun\\" proves otherwise thanks to its evolving story - one that bridges the gap between a child's initial view of war with the character's coming-of-age and growing adult instincts of survival and responsibility. Stoppard's smart, well developed screenplay is brought to life thanks to impressive work from frequent Spielberg associates like cinematographer Allen Daviau (whose efforts here rank with his finest) and especially John Williams, whose glorious music enhances the picture without overscoring its emotions. Unlike Spielberg's more contemporary films - which have often employed \\"movie stars\\" like Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise - \\"Empire of the Sun\\" utilizes an ensemble-driven approach for its casting instead, with Bale a revelation in his first feature performance, and Malkovich memorably essaying the cynical \\"Basie.\\" It's a brilliant film - entertaining, enthralling and emotional - and one that continues to agegracefully as one of its director's best.<br /><br />Warner has brought \\"Empire of the Sun\\" to Blu-Ray in a wonderfully crisp 1080p AVC encoded transfer with DTS MA audio. Extra features include the vintage \\"China Odyssey\\" 50-minute documentary, narrated by Martin Sheen, as well as a second DVD offering an hour-long, Spielberg-narrated examination of Warner Bros.' war pictures. The two discs are housed in one of Warner's Digibook packages offering glossy photos and behind the scenes information. Highly recommended!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. I highly recommend this book to a mature audience. Just as the characters were revealing their raw emotion I was feeling their pain, heartache, and passionate love. There were some amazing, monumental lines in this novel that speak try to humanity and LOVE!
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|There's nothing in \\"Pitch Pefect\\" - the tale of a college student who joins an a cappella singing group and battles her way, with a group of fellow disparate students, to challenging for a national championship - that you haven't seen before. Yet there's a reason this good-natured film became a sleeper hit at the fall box-office, generating over $60 million in domestic returns: it's simply fun. Anna Kendrick is likeable as Beca, an aspiring DJ who doesn't entirely fit in with the right clique but finds herself accepted into a crew of wacky types including Rebel Wilson as \\"Fat Amy.\\" The songs are upbeat and the comedy in Kay Cannon's script is nicely developed, with big laughs and engaging performances making for a formulaic but fully satisfying piece of fluff ideal for holiday viewing. Universal's Blu-Ray includes deleted/extended scenes, featurettes, commentaries, a 1080p AVC encoded transfer, DTS MA audio, Ultraviolet streaming and a standard digital copy as well.
B001UEBHYS|5.0|Very well crafted movie that brings to light the severe class inequalities and prejudices in India's society. Don't want to be a spoiler so that's all I will say. Loved everything about it!
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Having not been a big fan of the original \\"Men in Black\\" or its terrible 2002 sequel, this belated third entry in the series comes as a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Here, Will Smith's Agent J finds his world being altered, wiping out the entire existence of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) along with it. As it turns out, an extraterrestrial menace has broken free from a prison on the moon, gone back in time and terminated K's life back in the `60s. In order to save the galaxy and his partner, J heads back in time and meets with a younger K (Josh Brolin, brilliantly mimicking Jones' mannerisms and delivery) in order to stop the vile Boris the Terrible (Jemaine Clement).<br /><br />The first two \\"Men in Black\\" films got by due to the chemistry between the stars, although I found both pictures to be hollow, one-joke pictures that relied too heavily on special effects. Despite a great deal of trouble behind the scenes with this third installment (production had to be shut down for several weeks while the script was reworked), \\"Men in Black 3\\" relies more strongly on its characters and what turns out to be a poignant story line as opposed to a neverending succession of wacky aliens and make-up FX. The film does have - as cliched as it sounds - a lot more heart than its predecessors, with Smith seeming more engaged, Brolin giving a lively performance, and Michael Stuhlbarg chipping in a particularly noteworthy role as a benign, Mork-like alien who spends his life perpetually analyzing possible future outcomes.<br /><br />Director Barry Sonnenfeld helms the material without as much of a frenetic hand this time around - something that might disappoint viewers expecting a larger and louder sequel, but a decision that makes for a more satisfying and developed dramatic experience than its predecessors.<br /><br />Sony's Blu-Ray offerings include a good looking 2D presentation of the film (1080p AVC encoded transfer, DTS MA audio) as well as a fairly effective 3D rendering with decent depth-of-field effects. Extras include an Ultraviolet copy, DVD, and fairly light supplements taking viewers behind the scenes with roughly an hour of content on the 2D BD and a couple of brief extras exclusive to the 3D BD (including a very short look at the conversion process).
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book went well beyond the typical murder mystery genre.  The characters are incredibly engaging, and often I had a hard time tearing myself away.  I cannot wait to read her other books!
B005LAII8K|3.0|In Rian Johnson's latest film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a \\"looper,\\" a hitman named Joe in 2044 Kansas City where time travel has been invented - and outlawed - and nearly 10% of the world's population has developed a telekenetic mutation. That hasn't stopped crime bosses from sending their targets back from the future, where Gordon-Levitt and other loopers dispose of their bodies so they can't be tracked. The loopers themselves become their own targets after their contract runs out 30 years after the fact - something that becomes a problem when Gordon-Levitt's future self (Bruce Willis) manages to escape from his assassination, and tries to convince his younger incarnation that the world is going to be destroyed if a crime boss dubbed \\"The Rainmaker\\" is able to have his way.<br /><br />Johnson's picture is most effective during its first half. Working with a modest budget, \\"Looper\\" mixes the familiar with the futuristic in a dirty, dank environment, and the movie's use of time travel eschews standard genre devices - at one point, Willis' character even tells Gordon-Levitt to stop thinking about past/present \\"space-time continuum\\" rifts, as if to urge the audience not to get hung up on technical details (in this movie, unlike \\"Back to the Future,\\" changing the past doesn't erase one's future existence, but rather clouds over one's memories). The story, though, shifts gears completely in its second hour, with Gordon-Levitt's younger protagonist venturing onto a farm, encountering a young mother (Emily Blunt) and her son while Willis' older half searches for the child that will eventually become \\"The Rainmaker.\\"<br /><br />It's during the movie's later section when \\"Looper\\" loses its momentum and asks the audience to shift gears into something resembling a remake of \\"Firestarter\\" - something that comes off as unexpected and not entirely satisfying. The movie never regains the forward narrative thrust of its first half, and is also hampered by characters who are almost completely unlikeable - Gordon-Levitt's distracting make-up also doesn't seem to have been entirely necessary, as the actor would've been capable enough to mimic Willis' persona with less prosthetic involved. Willis himself is fine, and Emily Blunt does believable work as the child's mother, but none of them are particularly engaging or sympathetic. Johnson's script also, frustratingly, dangles questions in front of viewers without making a strong enough connection to whether or not they make sense dramatically (as it's impossible to go into these aspects without spoiling the plot, I won't comment any further, but they partially involve the picture's ending). It's one thing to be ambiguous, but it's another when the dots are so weakly connected that the suggestion of certain concepts seems to come out of thin air due to a lack of development.<br /><br />\\"Looper,\\" then, is a cold and unusual film - less a \\"groundbreaking\\" genre picture than it is an interesting B-movie with intriguing elements but something fundamentally lacking in its center.<br /><br />\\"Looper\\"'s Blu-Ray includes over 20 deleted scenes (17 of which are exclusive to the format), featurettes (including a profile of the scoring by Nathan Johnson), commentary from Rian Johnson, Gordon-Levitt and Blunt, plus a BD exclusive \\"Sci

B000BJS4TO|5.0|This a wonderful movie with an outstanding and really remarkable soundtrack. The story line is so poignant and rich, the performances by all are perfection.

B005WYFLNU|4.0|I bought this for my daughter, it's ok..not the greatest. Pieces are very thin and flimsy and bend easily, not like the colorforms from years ago.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|...because this brand new QT masterpiece has a lot of elements of the 1975 blaxploitation-Western 'Boss N*****', in which he wrote the screenplay and co-produced. DJANGO UNCHAINED brings this rare and forgotten subgenre back to life in a big-budgeted way with Jamie Foxx in the title role as a slave in pre-Civil War Texas rescued and trained by Dr. Schultz, a flamboyant German bounty hunter (Waltz steals the entire show once again). Together the odd duo go on a mission to save Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of plantation entrepreneur Calvin Candie (brilliantly mean and villainous Di Caprio) and his Uncle Tom/Ruckus house servant Stephen (hilariously over-the-top Sam Jackson). With Don Johnson and cameos from James Russo and Tom Savini, if you've been a fan of any of QT's work in the past then you do not want to miss this little blast of a film.

B002T9H2L0|4.0|After seeing Django yesterday I decided to go back and review Tarantino's previous film as the revenge theme is well in the forefront of both films. This one however couldve been shorter by 40 minutes and tends to drag in many parts. Great movie but not quite the masterpiece alot of people are painting it to be.

B001974DG0|5.0|I have read this book many years ago and absolutely loved it and had to read it again. The dog Einstein has such a great sense of humor and yet he still has the qualities of a dog that are very endearing. If you are a dog lover you will want to read this book and still enjoy the suspense that Dean Koontz is well known for.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book was really good - very entertaining and action-packed, though it had, of course, a fair amount of disturbing and depressing deaths. Unfortunately, I could not give the book five stars for I didn't feel the ending really met my expectations.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I gave this book three stars because although it was an adorable book with a pretty good story line I got easily annoyed at how the author kept portraying Travis. I know that he had to be portrayed in a certain way to make the book make sense, but it got annoying when he kept fighting all the guys that looked at Abby or even tried to befriend her. It almost seemed to me that with how overprotective Travis was portrayed, some could assume that he would be abusive. Maybe that was just me! But overall the story was good besides the annoyance of Travis' portrayal and the constant fighting and bickering. If you want a break from mainstream love novels that make the relationship seem picture perfect with no problems and guaranteed happy endings then you definitely need to give this book a try. Because it is not your typical love story. It has ultimate highs and lows that make you not want to put the book down. At the end it will have you begging to know more about their future lives together or not. So go ahead and dive into a beautiful disaster, I promise you won't regret it! Oh, keep in mind Walking Disaster comes out in April and it is told through the eyes of the one and only Travis Mad Dog Maddox! Happy readings!

B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Didn't think I would like it - but the story line surprised me.  Am looking forward to reading Book 2 in the series.  A neat dystopian retelling of Cinderella...
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I have every CD put out by Maroon 5 & I feel that this one is definitely the best due to the fact that it has a variety of different sounds. I look forward to what comes next
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a brain exerciser that is disguised as a game. Everyone in my family - adults, kids &amp; teens - have a blast with this app!
141659521X|5.0|I love these Mitch Rapp novels. Only problem is, I get it, read it in 2 days, then I wait for the next. The Last Man has a few surprises that really keep the action moving. I hope one of these Vince Flynn novels makes it to the big screen.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Excellent shipping, time frame, price, movie- very very happy and satisfied customer who highly recommends this movie! It is one of a kind.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Fantastic finish to the series. I think this was as good or better than the first two. The only complaint I'd have is length- the content in this movie could have easily been broken into two stand alone films.
B000AS4L16|5.0|For grim, there is nothing quite like this series. Lanzmann has interviewed all sorts of people involved in the holocaust. Lithuanians, Germans, Polish, etc., all involved in the camps in some way or another. Guards, train drivers, farmers around the camps. He goes to the places and does many interviews right there. He leaves no stone unturned. He deals with every detail imaginable about transport to the camp, the happenings in the camps, the terrible sufferings and cold brutal treatment. He is very hard on the Germans but what he covers is a terrible thing. There is one major dynamic he misses. That is the spiritual dynamic. He makes no mention of the evil etiology of the whole matter, that is utterly satanic. He takes a humanist social ethos position. While most of the people systematically murdered were Jews, Lanzmann's main focus, there were also many political enemies of the state and Christians also murdered.<br /><br />It should be born in mind that most Germans, fighting for the Wehrmacht, were not hard Nazis but just drafted. In general they were patriots, fighting for Germany. The officer class was often not at all sympathetic to the situation of the camps. How much they knew or thought about the camps varied. They had all they could handle obviously. Of course, Lanzmann is dealing solely with the camps.<br /><br />He keeps asking or implying how could you do this. Why?  It's another time and people thought very differently about things then.This was not the 21rst century food stamp program or 75% taxing the rich of today's France. The times were evil.<br /><br />This is a must see for anyone who wishes to know about the camps.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Another of Steven Spielberg's awesome flicks.  His signature is all over this. I still wonder however, why anyone would want a clingy robot to  love them. But hey, that's just me.
B004I744AS|5.0|I really like this as a dictionary, but I also use it to see how a word is pronounced and to get the weather.  There are a couple of word games that pass the time if I am stuck waiting.  All in all a really good little app.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a good app that is fun and easy to use. Runs smoothly on the tablet. Picture quality is great
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!! The author did a great job telling this story! I love how all the character are connected!
0316069434|5.0|I bought this book because I always follow Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.  I was not disapppointed. For anyone who likes suspense and good characters they should try it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is such a fantastic writer. This book is one of my favorites! Another book I could not put down until I know how it ends. Love Sky and Dean's relationship.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|just like all other versions this is great. Love the Star Wars version, would love to see a Star Trek Version as well using same concept.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|It was the  worst book that I have read in the last 10 years.  I was bored to death with the introspective protagonist and found that the plot moved at the pace of a very sick snail.  Would not attempt to read another book by this author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I literally read all three books in a week and a half. I couldn't put them down, and I have a feeling I will be reading them again and again. I really hope she writes a 4th book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The twists and turns of this book keep you drawn in from the start.  Knowing there is hope for children who have survived sexual abuse is life affirming.  Couldn't put it down til I was finished.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|The boys of One Direction haven't failed to please readers once again! The 5 boys narrate their lives before the X Factor through 2011 and their hopes for the future as a band. I recommend this book to any Directioner looking for a good read!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Good movie rental - more convenient than going to Redbox & having to worry about returning it (often late)!  A good movie with a good ending.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie was both entertaining and educational for couples who have similar issues in their relationships. Great acting as well!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time waster for kids or adults. will keep. fun to watch the wife play and hear her growl at the game when time runs out when she is so close to the goal.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther<br /><br />Fast paced and humorous, this book kept me hooked from beginning to end. Although a work of fiction, this present day terrorist novel seems as if it could fit perfectly into  the international section of the daily newspaper. My husband and I both enjoyed it.<br /><br />Background information on Yemen and drones alone,  beg for even more google info. It's fascinating.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got this on my on my Kindle for my son - great for when we had to sit around in a waiting room.
1400067820|5.0|It's fitting that Taleb discusses Le Corbusier and Jane Jacobs in Antifragile because this book is different from the average NYT non-fiction bestseller in the same way that Brooklyn is different from Brasilia.<br /><br />I imagine that if one approaches Antifragile prepared for such a bestseller they might come away frustrated. This book is a natural forest, not a neat scientifically managed one. The style is conversational; I think of it almost as a transcribed lecture. The structure is emergent (as opposed to imposed, i.e. there is no attempt to string the sections of the book together with a narrative). And the author shares centre stage with his subject matter; we learn about his weightlifting routine, eating habits, and family history. A further departure from NYT bestseller orthodoxy is that there is no attempt to maintain a measured tone. Frauds are unequivocally called frauds, and absolute statements abound.<br /><br />Crucially, the above characteristics are what make Antifragile a natural forest of a book; they lend colour and vitality to Taleb's exposition of the following point: in many domains it is impossible to make reliable predictions about the future, however, in these domains, we can make decisions that insulate us from negative randomness and expose us to positive randomness thus obviating the need to make predictions.<br /><br />This idea is presented many times using examples from medicine to mythology to markets. The redundancy of this approach gives the reader ample opportunity to digest the simple, yet nonobvious, implications of viewing decisions in terms of optionality and convexity.<br /><br />The compelling style and interesting content aside; ultimately, the only reason I recommend you read Antifragile is because I had fun reading it.<br /><br />Note: James C Scott's [[ASIN:0300078153 Seeing Like a State]] is an excellent companion to Antifragile. It is as if Scott and Taleb are eating the same meal but sitting at different tables. Scott's concept of legibility is useful for examining our (as in we the modern-day humans) aversion to randomness, uncertainty, disorder, etc, that leads to many of the problems of modernity that Taleb addresses.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had more than a few twists and turns, you think you'll know where the story is headed and turn out to be completely surprised!  I don't mind vulgar language in my reading but be prepared if you aren't one for profanity…won't add this book to my all time favorites but definitely a good, suspenseful read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded right after I received my Kindle Fire for Christmas. I love it!  I've already reached level 14 because it's easy to play and addictive! My kindle makes it especially easy  to play several times a day. Just a tap and I'm there. I would love to be able to download  the game onto my daughter's meep tablet  as well so she can play too. Thanks for an awesome game!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Muy buena la trilogia, Batman se levanta es La mejor pelicula del 2012, Batman es el héroe súper Mejor de Todos.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I love these types of games. I have found very few that are as good as this one. I tend to like solving puzzles and not staring at the screen randomly tapping trying to find hidden objects. This game was perfect! Puzzles, puzzles and more puzzles. Great graphics and a good storyline. UI was pretty intuitive. And they added in a hint area if you need it. I finished this one pretty quickly, but I always do with these types of games. I'd say none of the puzzles were too hard for anyone, but like I said they have the hints there if you need them.<br /><br />Great job icoolgeeks! Please do more games like this. NO HIDDEN OBJECTS! ;-)<br /><br />This one is a good bet and worth every penny. Just get it!<br /><br />Also, if you like these types of games, may i recommend The Lost City and The Secret of Grisly Manor. Both are by Fire Maple Games. They are great too!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|By now most people have seen this movie so I won't waste time reviewing the movie content.  But, if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD, you should do it.  Even though this is a movie from the 1940's, the quality of this DVD was excellent.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Connects quickly and cleanly So far so good even using CM10.1. I am thus far enjoying being able to connect remotely.
B009NT0I06|4.0|Good cd. Mix of country and pop. I bought it for one song but there are 6 songs that will be big hits.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|I enjoyed this title while on my Dreamcast many years ago, now on my phone its pretty truthful to the original, but the controls take a white to get use to. If I didn't get this app for free I wouldn't spend more then a dollar or two on it.
B008476HBM|5.0|This classic is a great love story for the ages. A must read for everyone interested in literature. Will be read over and over again.
0307477479|5.0|Excellent writing; surprising range of perspectives and voices, but it works. I wanted to start over once I finished, because I felt like there was much that I missed.<br />But then there is so much else to move on to...
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Twists and turns, and new characters. I just can't stop reading. Only problem is I look forward to book 4, but reviews are less than I expected at this juncture in the storyline. Oh well, can't stop now because I know my favorite characters will return in book 5, so onward I go.
0062068423|5.0|I've been on a bit of a kick of reading Scandinavian mysteries since getting hooked on the Steig Larson's Millenium series. Nesbo is now my favorite of those I've read. It is perhaps unfair to make the comparison; they are very different books, and I would more closely compare Nesbo to Michael Connelly's style of mystery.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|While the first  book in the Crossfire  series  may have had some similarities  to James' novel, this second installment  stands all on its  own. Day's writing goes far and away beyond E.L James Both in terms of vocabulary and a much better developed and far more  interesting plot. On top of it all this  book is far sexier  than 50 shades. Definitely not to be missed!
B0078X2LKY|4.0|Just a fun book. My daughter loves to see what will happen next! I definitely recommend t his book to any family with sesame street loving kids.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|We loved it so much we sent it to a very special family for Christmas.  An endearing story that makes a serious point about our terribly wasteful, throw-away society without preaching.  Heroic faithfulness wins against evil.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is good app full of games for my kids but don't like that it just starts you off with ten games and wants you to buy buy buy my kids keep trying to get more then they earn

B001ED7C58|5.0|My daughter and I really enjoy listing to the sounds and figuring out where in the movie it was.  Only one song do we not find on this Sound track.  Its good!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I always enjoy solitaire but with the Kindle Fire it is so easy to read and have fun. Good game for relaxing
B002BWP49C|5.0|I can't wait to own my copy of the part 2, Breaking Dawn.  We seen it at the theater and just waiting for it to be available to purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't  put the book down and I can't wait to read the next one!!! I can't wait to see what the next one has to offer!
B002RKSZS0|2.0|Not the  best book from Austen. Still fun to read though. Like the description of English country side and life
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My an my kids play this game they like it to .they really like when they can unlock a new game
B0064W65SO|5.0|As others have noted this is a Bat-classic. Hands down no exceptions.<br /><br />Miller's treatment of Batman is amazing. He is driven, focused, and human. His impatience to begin his crusade to rid the city of the evils that created him leads him to be less the superhero that we know and love, but rather a poor imitation. These early events in his crimefighting career give the reader a peek into the sometimes frightening, sometimes comical world of Batman.<br /><br />Batman, however, is not the main character of this graphic novel in a literary sense. I state this because Batman never truly changes. After the death of his parents, Bruce Wayne chooses his path and doesn't deviate. As seen in many other graphic novels, Batman is the catalyst for the character development of other characters such as Jim Gordon, Selina Kyle, and Harvey Dent. This is my only complaint about Bat-stories in general, and this in no way takes away from the story. In fact, I think it is a better story because of the focus on those other characters.<br /><br />Overall, a solid story and stunning visuals which create an amazing story.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has been the best game I have played,(in 3 days I got over 1,000,000 coins) it's entertaining and very fun! When it's time to distract myself I play jet pack joy ride.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a very interesting, somewhat scary, and fun game.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes hidden object games with a twist. I can hardly wait to see what the sequel is like.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Greg truly is wimpy and that is part of why he is so funny, Rowly pairing up with Abigal was sort of unexpected and to me Abigal was unexpected. I greatly recommend this book to anyone! I hope everyone loved it!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|At the 3rd level it tells you that you have to pay more money unless you have 3 stars at all levels.  I went and got 3 stars at all levels, there is some hidden level that won't let me advance.  I wouldn't recommend the game because of this.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it so much!what a great story.<br />From beginning to end  and I couldn't put the book down<br />Can't wait for the movie!!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|When it comes to making inane, pointless movies that don't even bother to entertain, count on Hollywood. These days, the trash coming out of LA is worse than the Chop Socky flicks of 1980's Hong Kong. In fact, this movie would have been funnier had it been dubbed in Mandarin with Spanish subtitles and out-of-sync with the actresses lips, ala Millie Vanilli. The number of 5's is creeping me out. Has our society become THIS dumbed down and accepting of whatever Hollywood serves up? Oh yeah, right...I forgot November 6 2012.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|It is hard for little children it is fun at first then it gets hard and harder and this is why I'm saying this if u are getting this for children the are not going to like.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was the best experienced book I've read it was the best way to explain that love can over power anything if you put your mind to it. I loved all the hunger game books. They made me think about how live could be a lot worse than you think and maybe live. It was very happy and also very sad but that's just life itself
1451638647|3.0|Ivan Vorpatril has always been the nice-guy patsy for Miles crazy schemes.  In this book, he's the star and Miles makes only a short appearance.  I enjoyed seeing this nice guy getting tested in really tense situations.  The book has a good plot and really fills out the Ivan character.<br /><br />But I want to know what Miles is up to!  He makes his cameo in the Vorkosigan residence and it's very domestic and non-crazy.  Does this mean that Miles has settled down and become boringly like the rest of us?
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Pretty good, mindless entertainment. It is a little up and down, almost annoyingly so but in the end it all works out. I had a hard time putting the book down. There are a lot of typos, which could be because it is digital, but it still really bugged me. Three stars to my first tablet read.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read and cherished Albom's prior novels. In keeping with tradition, this one does not disappoint. I read the entire novel in one day because I was so enthralled by it!

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Diffenbaugh manages to highlight the intricacies of what happens when the challenges of a child welfare system is confronted with the needs, hopes dreams and challenges of a young girl with a strong personality. By her generous description of the language and meaning of a wide array of flowers we are reminded of the power of symbolism in making meaning in our lives. This young girl's life is focused and shaped by her love of flowers, beyond their beauty to their purpose.  She is able to find healing and meaning for herself as she offers her knowledge of flowers to symbolize the same for others.  I look forward to reading more of this author's deeply research and well-crafted stories told through the life of fascinating characters.<br /><br />Muryah
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Watched with my 23 year old daughter and we both enjoyed this quirky little comedy. Beautiful artsy locations. Colorful. Sweet. Understated.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Random read.  Big twist and turns. You won't be able to put it down. Is there a sequel? Would love to see what happens next.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Helen Mirren is truly of the greatest Shakespearean thespian's of our time.  This is a must see performance in a world of media that has all but forgotten Shakespeare and 'grown flat and unprofitable'.  This is a true revival of the immortal barb's imagination.  True lovers of good theater should learn to enjoy something unique. Great dialogue Shakespearian poetry and morals matched with stunning special effects make Helen Mirren's performance the best she has ever done.  Don't miss this performance.  I get so bored with the rehashed dialogue from screen writer's guild with no imagination but plenty of political correctness.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although I guess some might poo-poo the fact that it's not Star Wars with endless hi-tech special effects and action (there is action, and there are special effects) it is stories and the characters are the real gem of this series.<br /><br />I know some don't care for the show (though candidly I've never met them.... I've only seen their reviews here on Amazon) just look at the insane number of 5 star reviews.  And consider the fact that a TV show spawned a major motion picture after it had been cancelled mid-season (Serenity is the movie if you don't know... but watch the series before the movie, that makes it even better.)<br /><br />One tip though (though it sounds odd) if you're a little hard of hearing (I personally have some hearing loss from injury) sometimes you may miss some of the more subtle lines spoken in this show (if, like me, you are hard of hearing, you're used to letting those go).... DON'T do that.......use subtitles.  You do NOT want to miss that stuff.... it's GOLD!
B005LAIIJY|3.0|It started off entertaining then fell off the cliff. I thought the film worked up until the character played by Christopher Waltz (who was great in this) was killed then the story meanders and falls apart. Other things that bothered me. The sequence where they played the Jim Croce song \\"I got a name\\"......why in the hell did Tarantino pick this song? I understand the Morricone cues scattered throughout the film as well as the opening theme which was ripped from the 1966 movie Django, and somewhat the rap songs since it is a blaxplotation film to some degree. But the Jim Croce selection from 1973 brings up images (for me anyway) of gas stations,18-wheelers,and bell bottoms. Also the huge shootout I had issues with. How many white henchmen were on this plantation? 25? 50? I was thinking to myself \\"where were these people when they came up on the plantation?\\" And then Django is magically protected from dozens of bullets by a cabinet??? The character played by Samuel L Jackson, a slave, yells at the white people to \\"Stop shooting!\\"........and they actually listen to him????? Django would have been killed on site,not saved by a slave then sent off to a mine to break down rocks.Perhaps I am being too critical and should have just allowed myself to enjoy the film for what it is. And about my previous issue with all the white southerners that were shot. I guess in most Tarantino films you have unrealistic mass killings. In Inglorious Basterds you have the Nazi who is in the tower and shoots a hundred or so soldiers. In Kill Bill you have Uma who slices and dices about 20 or so Ninjas in a scene. I will close with this. Django Unchained in this day of mindless 3-D action movies, remakes, and dime a dozen romantic comedies is a breath of fresh air. And the first half of the movie is great. But..... the final 30 minutes or so for this movie just killed it for me.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The  most insightful book I've read in the five years we've been married. Really enjoyed it, and it was a very quick read.

B008RYN44U|5.0|I absolutely love every single one of the songs on this album! I've always loved No Doubt and even loved Gwen Stefani's solo albums, so when I heard that they were getting back together, I was super stoked, and this album did not disappoint! My favorite songs are the title track, Push and Shove, and Undone! If you love feel-good music, this is the album to buy!

B00899F0G8|5.0|I gave this series a five star because I am really enjoying it. There are so many twists to the plot. Something new is always happeningThe acting is very good for all the characters. I already have recommended this series to ny relatives. I will continue to watch this series as long as it is on the air.
B00APUQKDG|2.0|Tedious and pretentious. Some critics will have you believe that this is a rich experiment in filmmaking -- it isn't. This is student-quality writing and direction packaged with movie stars.<br /><br />I enjoy intellectual and artistically abstract movies, but Cosmopolis is shallow intellectualism hiding behind obtuse, silly dialogue and poor acting. Robert Pattinson does his career no favors by maintaining the dead-behind-the-eyes \\"acting\\" technique he mastered for the Twilight series. The only good thing about the film is Paul Giamatti, but only because he is eminently watchable. Unfortunately, Giamatti doesn't show up until late in the film, so you sit through a lot of suffering to get to him.<br /><br />**Best scene**<br />Robert Pattinson undergoes the longest prostate exam in the history of mankind while discussing business in the back of a stretch limo. That pretty much sums up this movie.<br /><br />**Best dialogue**<br />ELISE: There's something else I wish I could forget...<br />ERIC: That's my penis you smell.<br /><br />Ugh.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for this book it rose beyond my expectations. My hope is that the textbooks the same.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not want to put this book down. Even though I saw the movie first and knew what was going to happen, the suspense of the book was too much to stop reading for long.

B00318COS4|2.0|I love a good RPG, but this one left me cold. No characters, just puzzles, and no dialog at all. The puzzles are also counter-intuitive, to me, and the whole \\"adventure\\" is relatively pointless. It isn't terrible, no major bugs encountered, and some of it is a bit clever, but just not fun.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price and awesome movies. The special features are pretty good and the picture and sound is good.  The case it self isn't my favorite but its ok.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book.  Each character, even those with minor roles, have a rich depth.  Terrific crime drama.  Just when you think you've hit the most twisted part, you get a wonderfully twisted surprise.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Excellent - have watched it twice now!  Would recommend it -highly!  Did have some sound streaming issues- but nothing serious.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|As noted above, this is perfect for the Amazon Basics line -<br />It works fine, easy to use, does the job.

B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is the best flight simulator that I have found so far.  The flight characteristics are very good.  With the start of a new simulation, you don't know if you will be flying during the day or night or in the rail.  Very challenging.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book plays greatly on the idea of a naive girl and a over confident boy who has issues/secrets. Sort of reminds me of Edward and Bella from the twilight series.  Do to the nature of this book I would love to see who they could get to fill the rolls of Ana and Christian. Also how they incorporate the book into a movie while staying true to the sexual nature of the book. This is a page turner however it does gets slow at times. However I recommend this for anyone who likes crime/love stories
B0086700CM|2.0|I really do enjoy this game, but on my Kindle Fire it lagged occasionally and after about two days it wouldn't tilt which was very frustrating...fix it please!
1451648537|5.0|It is a simple book, similar to any Apple product but yet very elegant and meaningful. A book that Jobs would write.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is the first app I check in the morning and again the last thing I look at when I go to bed
B004U52VPS|4.0|My 6 year old son loves playing with this game! The adults found it a little tedious- it takes a long time to build the buildings and is hard to knock them over.  We had to adjust the rules- giving double points or unlimited shots.<br />My son, however, does not tire of this game. He has spent hours-  3 hours in one day- playing by himself.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I've always enjoyed watching this movie and especially listening to the music, which is upbeat and delightful. It certainnly makes a wonderful addition to any musical library.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love this movie!  It is definitely one of the best of the bunch. It's been great watching these kids grow up as characters and as actors.  Emma Watson went from appearing very forced in her acting in the first film to truly embodying the essence of Hermione Granger in my opinion.  They all did a wonderful job.
0553381709|5.0|A little slow getting started, but it got better and better all the way through. Martin is amazing in how he keeps you mezmorized with all the characters he presents and their experiences. My son is now reading it and he can't put it down.
038533348X|4.0|I really liked the beginning of this book and the setup.  I thought Vonnegut did a great job of enticing the reader and in creating an atmosphere of mystique around what the main character was doing and researching to hook the reader.  I thought it devolved in to an over the top story at the end, but I did enjoy it.  I don't know if that's typical for Vonnegut or not to compare to other novels of his.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|more of a country flair but do love their music.  arrangements much simpler but the musicianship still is apparent.  as usual love the lyrics.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game play and the fact it keeps running g when your not there. Just hats that you need to spend money o. Some things. Other than that I love it.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Do like this music very much.  There is a simplicity to the music itself with a refined but not overly engineered sound.  Playful quality in a number of the songs.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This is not Grisham's greatest work but still a good read for his fans. The characters are not as well developed as in some other works.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Can't stop playing. This has been one of the easiest of the flip art that I've  played. Love flip art
B009D0LBRO|5.0|My whole family loves it - especially my 6 year old who now obesses with being getting all 100 mums on every level! Haven't beaten all 4 extra levels yet because they are so hard, but its fun to try.
B002SJKWZ4|1.0|Can't get this thing to work at all!  Waste of money!  Wouldn't recommend it at all.  Don't be fooled by the reviews!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't really want to join the Hunger Games bandwagon, but after hearing all about it, I began to get curious and now that I've read it I want to read the rest of the books! It's an excellent book and it's easy to follow the story of what's happening unlike other books that skip around. This is know one of my favorite books.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|My grandchildren showed me how to use Kids Paint quicker than if I would have had directions to read for it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|But it is lacking. I just feel like there could be so much more to the main plot and aftermath.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie and great story! I watched it twice before my 48hrs expired. Tom Hardy is becoming one of my favorite actors.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|After you pay fifteen dollars for this mediocre program that other programs can do better, it then tells you you have to buy fonts for it for another five. They are starting to believe themselves apple employees and us ISHEEP. BAAAH  BAAAH TO YOU!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Got this for a friend who loves her music & ended on like it too. Going to get a copy for myself.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|This book was recommended because I have an aging dog.  I found the first couple of chapters interested then it got somber and boring.  Very predictable and sad story with predictable turns and endings.
B0017HEX76|5.0|its very beautiful, i love it its what i wanted and i am glad i found it thank you so very much i will be doing so recomending for this is a very beautiful piece.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I cannot wait for this movie to come out! Couldn't put the book down·…as always full of the unexpected. Now onto the third book!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|its very beautiful, i love it its what i wanted and i am glad i found it thank you so very much i will be doing so recomending for this is a very beautiful piece.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I would recommend this book highly as a general guide but it is important to remember that relying only on body language to firm a final opinion about the individual is &#34;not good enough&#34; as Joe Navarro mentions at the end of the book
B000068CNX|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I am shocked that this movie was made in the 1960's and looked so amazing. I have not seen the original, so I will not be able to compare the old to the new. What I can say is that the story is great and the picture quality is stunning. If you are at all contemplating this movie pick it up.
B00005S6K6|5.0|JUST LOVE IT IT WAS A GIFT FOR A CO-WORKER THAT LOVES  AND AS FOR HER BIRTHDAY I ORDER AND SHE TOTALY LOVED IT.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a beautiful book. The twists and turns and a box of tissues later made me read this book in a day! I loved it although sad!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|JUST LOVE IT IT WAS A GIFT FOR A CO-WORKER THAT LOVES  AND AS FOR HER BIRTHDAY I ORDER AND SHE TOTALY LOVED IT. THANK YOU
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought slammed and POR were my fave Hoover books but I have to say I absolutely love this book!  She is an amazing writer... and I don't think I have ever had so many different emotions go through me while reading than I have reading all 3 of these books! Hopeless was amazing!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|its very beautiful, i love it its what i wanted and i am glad i found it thank you so very much i will be doing so recomending for this is a very beautiful piece.
B003I55BIA|5.0|What an great story. Perfect Chemistry is the first book in the Perfect Chemistry series by Author Simone Elkeles. I've never read a story by her before so I had no expectations going into the book.<br /><br />I loved both Brittany and Alex from the beginning. Brittany has the best of everything but she's tired of trying to be the perfect person her mother wants her to be all the time. She wants to be a normal teenager. One that doesn't have to worry about her hair, makeup and what she's wearing constantly.<br /><br />Alex is her complete opposite. He's a gang member and has followed in his late fathers footsteps. He joins the Latino Blood so his family is protected. Although Brittany and Alex start off on the wrong foot the chemistry between the two is apparent from the beginning.<br /><br />I enjoyed every aspect of this story with the exception of one thing. There were quite a few instances where spanish was used and no explanation of the words were given. Don't get me wrong, I love latin heroes and reading dialogue that includes Spanish. It's pretty sexy. I'm just used to it being followed up by what the words actually mean in english.<br /><br />I'm so happy to have found this series. I'm really looking forward to reading Rules of Attraction, Book 2 and Chain Reaction the final book in this series.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|JUST LOVE IT IT WAS A GIFT FOR A CO-WORKER THAT LOVES  AND AS FOR HER BIRTHDAY I ORDER AND SHE TOTALY LOVED IT. THANK YOU
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Would have liked more abou the raid. Seemed as though first half of book was about his life as a seal was looking for more detail about his ideas leading to the raid.  However still an intriguing read!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a fun game and it plays well and looks good on the Kindle. It's a good thing it has hints because it'd be pretty difficult without them, though I'm not much of a puzzle person, so it may be easy for someone else.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Such an interesting view about Presidents behind the scenes.  Things you never really know and how some presidents make better use after being a President!
B008D36INE|1.0|The Deep Blue Sea.  Terrible, stiff acting. Dumb lines. Skip it! One of the worst movies we've seen this year.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Can't say enough about this book.  The first hundred pages or so are tough to get through which set the backstory of the Rivals, but once you get into it, you can't put it down! Highly recommend!
0345803485|1.0|I succumbed to curiosity and bought this book to see what all the fuss was about. I wish I hadn't bothered.<br />In a nutshell, it comprises accounts of a variety of colorful sexual encounters between the heroine, with the unlikley status of a 27 year old virgin, and the hero who combines Gatesian wealth with Olympian sex drive and more than a passing knowledge of the works of the Marquis de Sade. All is described in lurid detail, and losely stitched together by a story that wouldn't tax the immagination or writing skills of an adolescent wannabe author.<br />On finishing it, I couldn't decide what genre it should fall into, but garbage bin comes closest. I admire the chutzpah of the author in attaching her name (surely a nom de plume?) to this trashy effort, and allows us to avoid any future efforts from her pen. My advice is NOT to buy it.<br />If real literature is your bent, you are spoiled for choice in works that explore human sexuality in a more probing, sensitive way. If pornography is your thing, buy Hustler, which at least doesn't pretend to something it most definitely isn't (good photography,too).<br />This is easily the worst book I have ever read, and its' success astounds me. Surely a leading candidate for an IgNobel literature award?
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Great price!  I downloaded it on my Kindle.  It is the first album I have downloaded and happy that I did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|NOW!! It's a wonderful story for anyone who enjoys ya books, the characters are stunning and you can't help but fall in love with holder as sky does.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading this book I am a complete fan of the author. This book is so beautifully writen, it literally took my f-ing breath away. I absolutely love both characters of this book, but the character of Dean Holder is perfection. I was amazed every couple of pages by merely things he said that were always so PERFECT that it made my heart melt. Great work Ms. Colleen this is the third book from you that knocks my socks off. To say I love it would be an understatement. Five F-ing Stars!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|as my review title says this game is corny...but I found myself enjoying every second of it! the dialogue is really entertaining!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|its awesome with me it rocks my grandpa loves it he plays it all the time so good so ggooyoijjjjbb
B009RH973I|3.0|I just got the Kindle Fire HD 7inch and found this case. I loved it when I opened the package, when I went to put the case on the Fire it didn't fit. This particular case is for the Kindle Fire (the older version) not the HD. So right now I'm in the process to return it. I did find the exact case in the right size and LOVE it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. Love the big buttons and its great for a free app. Works fine on the kindle fire.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|This was different than I thought it was going to be but it had alot of things that are real life if you don't pay attention to each other.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips has a voice that has won many people over.  He has stayed true to his beliefs and is the same person that we all watched and really enjoyed on American Idol.  This CD was a gift for my husband for Christmas, and it is one that we've listened to 5 times already and will get many more years from it.  You will NOT be disappointed with this.  The music is great and we're looking forward to more from Phillip.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The book was very good. It kept me drawn in and wanting more. The authors do well and I wasn't able to predict the end as I can most stories. Which is nice! I'm excited for the third.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|The pictures of the weather on this app is quite amazng and the quality is solid. I dont have any major issues with it but there is one small problem. Its the fact that i cant see how much its going to snow or rain, it just shows what the current weather is and honestly, you can just look out side for your self to see what its like.<br /><br />Id like to see how much its going to snow and more options with things of that nature
B007TNS6JI|3.0|This is a good game for the entire family. My boys ( 11 &amp; 13 ) love playing it. Needs alittle more instructions on how to perform moves.
B0081SRJSY|2.0|Unfortunately, it will not work on my Asus Infinity.  It did in my gtablet. It keeps saying the app has stopped. I'm hoping the next upgrade will fix it. On the gtablet, it was great.
B001UG56ES|5.0|An epic, beautifully shot and meticulously crafted. Wonderful acting. We need more of these types of films in an age of cynicism and pseudo-violence. Very romantic. Deserved more critical acclaim than it received.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|My brother put this up in landing between stairs. It is prefect. Very bright and only stays on for 15 seconds or so after motion light senses you. Great idea for on the stairs!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this an easy, fast-paced read! I would recommend it to all who like suspense novels. Read it now!
B007Q35PLI|5.0|this has now become my go to movie when I need a good cry.  wonderfully acted & an excellent story.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The very best trilogy I have and ever will read sad happy unpredictable mysterious and absolutely every opposite packed into a book that is absolutely blissful. THANK YOU James Dashner for this lovely trilogy that I miss reading it and the world needs more of these books that  you have written.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Awesome game but needs an update to fix problems you can't visit others people's land which is required to complete the game
B009LA1QW6|3.0|I got this on sale for 5 or 6 bucks. I really liked &#34;born to die&#34;, but didn't care for &#34;paradise&#34;... music is different for everyone but I really just didn't care for this album.
B008476HBM|4.0|An amazing book. After watching the movie more than 20 times I always wanted to read this. It was as great as the movie and a must read/watch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|From the moment I started reading this book I could not put it down. I read it in 2 days. Love,<br />love, love it
B0070Y46UY|5.0|If you like adventure stories interwoven with moments of interesting philosophy and higher meanings then you'll like this book. The movie was good but the book goes deeper. Wonderful word paintings. It's a good lesson in survival at sea even without involving Richard Parker. But he really adds a lot. The book gives us an interesting and uniquely personal education about animals, from a zoo keepers viewpoint.
B0051GOB26|5.0|This was a great item, shipped fast and couldn't be happier. Great present for anyone who likes the big labowski.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It works and I wake up. It has good choices and fun clock faces. This is the best alarm clock I have gotten so far.<br />&lt;3Chao&lt;3
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I rarely give 5 stars to a movie. This is a very good movie, for the genre. It is a good popcorn and friends movie.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|And seated on your left is a macho skydiver who insists on telling you about this crazy dream he had last night, featuring him and a hot babe flying around on a butterfly.  A nerdy surgeon on your left describes a coma case.  The bug-eyed guy across the table is saying even though you think you know God you don't know God and you can't know God until you hear about his Ohm, but unfortunately, words can't describe Ohm, but heck, you two have the whole night so he'll give it the college try, and he starts talking about what it's like to be a yolk inside of an egg shell.  All three guys are wearing bow-ties.<br /><br />If this sounds like a fun evening, this is the book for you.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Outstanding game.  WELL DONE!  Worth every penny.  Enjoy the pace.  Hints are there if you need help.  Alawar games are great.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|This is a brilliantly crafted book. The writing is excellent, pace is perfect, & the way the suspense & horror gradually build left me unable to put it down. But possibly more than these things even, I was almost in awe of the structure of the book - the alternating chapters from two time periods, along with the opening & closing court transcripts, add so much to the heightening tension, and create a wonderfully rounded storyline. And the ending was incredible, what a climax - I read the last page multiple times, wanting more, but knowing it was exactly perfect as it was. I will be thinking about this book for a while.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of those books that rather defies description. The fascinating characters and layers of mystery are captivating and I really had trouble putting it down when I had many other things I should have been doing! The examination of the human struggle with morals and ethics when presented with choices outside the normal context of life is excellent.<br />Not only is the story intriguing, the writing is such a pleasure to read. I highly recommend this book.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have been a Scarpetti fan for many years and couldn't wait to read this latest installment. What a disappointment. The plot was old and the writing painful. Though determined to finish it was like slogging through mud. Cornnwell can do so much better.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book takes you on a true journey of the heart. It is highly unusual and imaginative and all I could think when I finished was what a great movie it would make. Can't give it enough praise.
B006885LZM|5.0|Awesome show!  Its nice to get it online, instead of getting physical DVDs in the mail. That way, I can watch what I want, when I want to.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I didn't feel particularly enthralled like I would. It gave me an existential feel, so I would assume that is why it was somewhat bland. I had the impression that the author was trying to have the style of The Stranger, hence the existential roots, but he had a so so performance.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Starts out great.  Its nice to get it online, instead of getting physical DVDs in the mail. That way, I can watch what I want, when I want to.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I can't remember but I would like this more as a chess learning app.  Clear graphics.  Timely because my nephew is into chess.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Started good, lost interest by Season 3. v Its nice to get it online, instead of getting physical DVDs in the mail. That way, I can watch what I want, when I want to.
B006O3MU96|5.0|I enjoy the simplicity of this game that is fun for all ages!  Relaxing diversion!  Good on different screen sizes.
B005NPCBI6|5.0|I am a Pink Floyd fan forever.  The transition made even to this day carries on the glorious moments<br />of the past to the present.  I shall always transport my mind to the moments of my life that relatte to<br />their music.
B00881PPTO|3.0|This service would be better if I had a mobile device using this!  These things are usually geared towards bigger cities.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 3 little sister likes it , and likes making ponies new home's. I would give it 100 stars. This is the best game ever. You should buy it for your kids.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I received my order on time and in perfect condition.  I have seen this movie many times, so I knew what I was buying. I'm happy to add it to my movie collection.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good fun game. it kept me entertained for hours. I love these types of games and would recommend to friends.
034580404X|5.0|Characters are very visual. A lot of good hot sex and lot's of laughs. On the second book now, but been so busy with holidays have not had time to sit down and read more than a page.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This works great and will protect my Kindle Fire.  The only problem was I would have preferred it to be like the one I had for my Kindle.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series continues to entertain and surprise as it focuses on both the story of the survivors and the horror of a zombie nightmare. I will be anxiously waiting for the rest of season 3.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't even begin to describe the beauty of this book. Half the time I was balling like a baby. It was wonderfully written, the characters well crafted. I highlighted nearly everything and book-marked so much I doubt it can be called a bookmark. If you know what's good for you and really want to feel something, read this book.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is by far the funniest sitcom I have ever seen! If you haven't watched this show you need to check it out!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I got this and thought it would be boring as ever but I have this good empire and I still have lot's to do!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never read a book that had so much packed into it. I fell in love with the characters, and was shocked more than once. Excellent book, I highly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book five or six times and I love it sooo much! Just decided that I HAD to have it on my kindle as well. I am a Harry Potter freak and the HP books are my ultimate favorite. However, with this book I actually considered Suzanne Collin's novel a very close second. That's pretty miraculous because I am so obsessed with Harry Potter! Anyways I am in love with The Hunger Games! :D
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Since my daughter is a fan of Tinkerbell, we've seen all the movies. This one could be our new favorite! I'm not a big fan of all kid movies, but I do enjoy the Tink movies. I don't hear or see any subliminal messages in these like I do in some other children's movies. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it talked about having a boyfriend in one part (which I believe is encouraged way too early, considering the age group that usually watches these). Overall, it's a great family movie! Even my husband didn't mind it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is absolutely the best puzzle game I have ever played. I recommend this game for anyone who likes puzzles, young and old.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this game it is so addictive and so many different boards so I don't get bored playing it. Thank you for making this game.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I could hardly put this down. I've found a new thriller/suspense author to read. I plan to buy more by this author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Bought this for my husband and he says it's very easy to read the cards and an enjoyable game to play.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We watched the first season on Netflix and really liked it, so we had to catch up on season two. We think this season is even better than the last!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an excellent read.  It felt like I became the character and felt her pain & frustration. Very well written and simple
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|sat home with the kids and watched this movie, didn't have to leave the comfort of our couch, we all love it!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good story. Read in three days, worth every penny. Looking to read the rest of Nicholas sparks books. You will not regret purchasing this book.
B006P96PAO|4.0|... fathers across America would watch this movie and take it to heart, then we could see real, positive change
B009LROCJI|5.0|I would expect no less from Max Richter — very respectful, yet brings in newness and an alternate perspective on the familiar melodies. Not sure if I'd know it's Max Richter aside from the cd case, but I'm not sure I'd want the M.R. signature on a recomposition of familiar classical music? I.e., there's no voice underlayering.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love this entire series. This one was excellant with a lot more Harry personal stuff. I love it. I would like some more on what Harry looks like in each book as the time swing across the series is considerable.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|inexpensive and effective, this case is fine. it comes only in black, but that is fine if you want yo save money
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I absolutely freaking loved this game(s) -- it was so refreshing to play a game for the pure sake of enjoyment! I didn't realize how far astray modern games have become, where you're just 'grinding' out hours with filler and fluff, trying to 'get to the next level' etc. This game, for me, was a celebration of beauty and childlike wonder -- I felt like I was 12 again, playing wide-eyed and loving every minute of it :-)<br /><br />Now back to reality lol...<br /><br />Yes, the game is shorter than expected. At first this bothered me, but as I thought about it I realized that it's a 'quality vs. quantity' thing. Kind of a 'less is more' philosophy that actually has something wholesome about it. It reminds me of this expensive dessert place I went to in NYC where they only served really small desserts but man I got gooseflesh on the first bite -- it was amazing, almost a spiritual experience. Yes, the dessert was 'short' but total experience was better than enduring my way through 50 Walmart pumpkin pies. Also, the game is low $$ especially considering that you get 3x games for $30...
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this one..but I must say it was far better than I had expected
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|No matter the media, the phantom of the opera is an amazing work of art. Any fan would love this in their collection and watch it time and time again.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It was fun to play around with at first, really liked it and some friends downloaded too. Got bored and moved on to new games.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|It would have been fun if it worked,wouldnt rotate mags and motor woudnt stop running. I felt bad that I bought something that didnt work for my grandson.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies. Good to own it for those times I want to spend a few hours checking it out again. Great service and delivery. Recommend to anyone looking to expand their collection of DVD's
B000AA4JMK|4.0|Love it. Not the best quality casing but the movie and cd play as expected. If you like musicals the songs in this are great. My grand - daughter nearly 4 years old is learning all the words.Would buy again.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great app for access to your twiitter account on android...Quick & easy way to get into account & follow your favorite stars...
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I was absolutely engrossed in this book from the first page. It is beautifully written with twists in the tale.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once I started reading I could not put it down.  I have read all of the Harry Bosch novels and have come to love him.  Each novel reveals more about him. You just have to root for him to not only find the killer, but to also best his adversaries.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book, can not wait to read the next one. The movie was good but the book makes it better.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie. My kids and I were not fans of prior Dr. Seuss movies. We didn't like Horton hears a Who. We all loved this movie. It's like an environmentalist movie for kids, but that's okay. My son's (1 & 4) watched the whole movie, the 4 year old is asking to watch it again. They loved the music, it was just the right amount. There were some edge of your seat moments, where my son was perched on the arm of the couch emitting a squeal.<br />Definitely recommend.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|Unsure whether this is a one star effort but have given Diana the benefit of the doubt.  Overall, very disappointed with this album...the acoustics and recording were just garbage.  Whomever produced this album really did Diana no service.  I have tried to \\"listen\\" and give this album every chance to make its impression with me,  but really just a failure on all levels.  The expression \\"stay in your lane\\" comes to mind and wish Diana would stick to the style from her earlier works.<br /><br />An 1890's Steinway was used...sheesh, I am absolutely sick and tired of the need for authenticity and nostalgia to get that justSoPerfect Sound.......I absolutely hate this album, hate the vocals, hate the music, hate it all.<br /><br />However....Can't wait for her next album which takes on Polka, complete with 1800's era authentic Accordians and String Bass....Chicago Honky or Chicago Push style or just basic Polish Polka....Can't Wait!
B0077EBWVI|2.0|Not sure what the point of this remake was. We only watched it because some of it was filmed in my partner's home town. Dennis Quaid was not at all convincing as a Southern Minister. Much of the movie was similar to the original (again, what was the point of making a remake?) Where there were differences, some of them were insignificant and others were just plain stupid: the game of chicken on the tractors in the original was replaced by a school bus race that turned into a smash up derby. Really???

B00AAI4W4M|5.0|Just a backstory on LEGO trains for people who are unfamiliar. LEGO is not a toy train company. LEGO is a brick company that among its many products produces trains so they don't really get all the loving treatment. The high end trains like Horizon Express don't come with any tracks or power functions to make the train move. If you want the train to move it will likely set you back at least another hundred. I also have a bit of a beef with LEGO not supplying fans with the tracks fans want and of the tracks they supply they are terribly overpriced. So why even buy a LEGO train? Because if you're willing to pay the pricetag they are awesome.<br /><br />I can't say I was originally blown away by the Horizon Express the first time I saw it. The train has a 70's European look and a whole lot of orange. It's based on a French train the runs between Paris and Lyon designed back in the 70's so that explains its look. LEGO has done a very good job of accurately representing the original train. It wasn't until I began building the Horizon Express that I really started to appreciate it. I was astounded by the creativity of the design. The white arrows on the side of the engine, for instance, are managed in a way that I never would have expected and the way in which the lower section of the train angles in slightly is creative genius. This has to be the most enjoyable build I have ever done and I've done my share of builds.<br /><br />The train is classified as Expert but I really didn't find it challenging. Most of the challenges I've had in the past are do to design issues for instance in the front roof of the Camper Van (10220) and the forecastle of the Queen Anne's Revenge (4195) where I had difficulty placing the pieces simply because they weren't attaching in a sturdy manner. The Horizon Express is sturdy and the only issue I had was in the roof on the rear car and even that just took me a few moments of careful pressure. The bags are numbered 1 through 3 for the engine and two cars. Since there are more than 3 bags that means you have 3 bags labeled 1 and so on. For these larger sets hunting for pieces is most of the work.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the Maersk train is in how weakly the engine magnetic coupling is attached and it has cntinually become unattached. I was very happy to see that the problem has been corrected with the Horizon Express. Lengthwise the Maersk is listed as five inches longer than the Horizon Express but the Express is a lot more brick dense which explains its higher brick count (1351 for Express, 1234 for Maersk). The Express has more than 100 extra pieces despite the Maersk also coming with the truck. For the Express all the bricks go towards the train. The two cars are much nicer on the Horizon than the boring box cars on the Maersk. The Horizon Express also comes with 6 minifigures rather than 3 for the Maersk. The higher brick count and additional minifigs would explain the slightly higher price tag. Judging just the engine I prefer the look of the Maersk but overall the Horizon Express is a superior train.<br /><br />One final thing I'll mention is that LEGO trains tend to be quite good as investments. New Maersk Trains in the box are selling for almost $200 on EBAY and that set was retired just last year. The Emerald Night is selling for almost that much. Part of it may be the scarcity of trains as well as the fact that train sets seem to get retired faster than other sets. To the best of my knowledge Horizon Express is the largest train for pieces and the costliest new train ever created by LEGO. I really enjoyed this one tremendously and look forward to getting the power functions to get it moving.nd two cars. Since there are more than 3 bags that means you have 3 bags labeled 1 and so on.

I loved the moment when I found out what \\"Hopeless\\" really meant. Very sweet. Holder was a great character. The only complaint I have about the book was the font. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but paragraphs alternated in font size. I have never had this happen in an ebook before and it was a little distracting.

0525953728|5.0|I ordered this book for my Kindle on a Saturday, and finished it within 24 hours - getting sunburnt in the process, as I forgot all around me. I lived in Kabul for a while, and have seen and experienced Afganistan, and heard from Afghans about their experiences during the Taliban rule. I thought the bok absolutely amazing - this man is not out for personal glory, he describes himself as having weaknesses, making mistakes, and relying on his comrades. This is what a team is all about, and especially what a team in such a profession must be like. I met quite a lot of \\"shooters\\" in Kabul, and - on a personal level - this explains quite a bit about them and their personalities.<br />I read this book a couple of months after ten of my former colleagues were killed in a suicide attack in Kabul - I needed to read about the man who started it all (in my opinion).<br />I admire the men that did what had to - again in my opinion - be done.<br />This is a book that I will recommend to everyone - and if I was younger, I think I would try and be part of the men that fight this war, that will not be over for a very long time.

B00003CWPL|1.0|I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for a true fan and she LOVED it!  HOWEVER, I bought it from Barnes and Noble. I ordered it from Amazon twice, and got the wrong thing twice.  I received the cheaper, \\"international\\" version both times.  When returning the second one the very nice service rep assured me they would pull this from the site and get to the bottom of the confusion.  As far as I could see, this never happened.  They also issued me a $15. Credit for future purchases.  My biggest beef is that when I received the e-mail notifications for my credits on both items, the reason for the credit was stated as \\"delivered late\\".  Ever wonder why Amazon is consistently tops in customer service?  They just spin negative feedback into something not so bad.  Whew, thanks for the rant.
B005LAIISU|5.0|AS good as the first. Kept you entertained through the entire movie. I recommend it.  Love, love, love, love, love it.

B007EDYN36|4.0|After reading several books by Gene, it was nice to read another view.  Not sure I buy all of it.  Peter doesn't really take any responsibility for anything.  It was all Gene/Paul/Aces fault.  Not that they weren't also to blame.  Poor individual decisions really did him in.  All in all it was a good read.  Now on to Aces book.
B0011UBDTK|3.0|The problem I am encountering is a technical one, I was told by tech support for my widescreen tv that the dvd's are not formatted to show the image in its original old tv scale size. What is happening is on a widescreen tv it pulls the image to the width, and chops off the top and bottom. I tried making setting adjustments on the dvd player and the tv, but nothing happens so it must be the way the dvds are manufactured.

B008QTVNUI|2.0|I realize this series is a huge hit, and I watched it in large part because the male lead (Damian Lewis) did such a fabulous job in Band of Brothers, but I really couldn't summon up any interest in either his or Claire Danes' characters.  Nor did I get why a Marine sergeant who has been turned by al Quaeda would be such an enormous security risk that half the CIA is on his case.  (I'm sure there's a reason--I think it's that he wants to shoot the VP, but I'm not sure, it wasn't clear to me.)<br /><br />Understand that the problem may be mine and not the drama's, but I didn't get more than halfway through episode 2 before throwing in the towel.

1400067820|4.0|I have reviewed and briefly summarised Nassim Taleb's book Antifragile from three different perspectives; `what is antifragility, what can we learn from it and what do I think about it'? I have made these distinctions in order to not confuse `what is antifragile' as he describes it with `what I think it is' as well as providing space for `us' to consider what we can learn about it.<br /><br /> What is it? Antifragile is a state of mind that prepares us to deal with randomness, uncertainty, disorder, risk, shocks and the volatility and non-linearity of life. This is the central argument in the book. Someone is antifragile when there is more upside than downside in a situation where volatility, randomness, errors, uncertainty, stressors and time arise. Time is here considered the same as disorder. Taleb says however that antifragile is more than just the opposite of being fragile, i.e., being able to withstand the shock of uncertainty, disorder and `black swan' events, rather antifragile is about being able to thrive in a world of randomness, uncertainty, disorder, risk, shocks and the volatility of life. Being in an antifragile state however will not help improve your ability to predict uncertainty but it will help prepare you for when uncertainty happens. The challenge becomes then, `can we just accept that there are things that we can't understand and therefore can't predict'? Most of us fail in this because we reduce what we don't know to what we do know which in turn makes us fragile when things go wrong. He adds that probability is primarily a qualitative rather than quantitative construct. Our tendency however is to quantify the unquantifiable which he equates with naïve rationalism, i.e., the modernist scientific tendency to believe that everything is knowable. His recommendation for thriving in a world of uncertainty is not however to become `more robust or resilient' but to become more antifragile.<br /><br /> What can we learn from antifragile? Another wayof asking this question is what are the consequences of Taleb's insights that might be relevant to the rest of us? Perhaps the principle thing we are reminded of is the limits of linearity and how much of our experience of life is `non-linear' and unpredictable, i.e., there is much more chaos, disorder, uncertainty and change in our world than our scientific rational mindset might have us believe. For instance a good example of non-linear effects exists, \\"when you double the dose of say a medication or when you double the number of employees in a factory, you don't get twice the initial effect, but rather a lot more or a lot less\\". In our desire to be more rational, itself a noble objective, we may forget what Pascal said, `that the end goal of rationality was to show the limits of rationality'. We moderns suffer from the illusion of control, which Taleb says is making us more fragile and susceptible to unpredictable black swan events. Taleb goes on to talk about responsibility and the skin in the game/captain of the ship rule. One of the big problems he mentions is that our bureaucrats and bankers (and indeed our academics which he reserves some choice comments for) tend to share in the upside from their words and actions but none of the downside. This should be addressed with a, \\"no opinion without risk\\" approach, particularly when dealing with the public. He also mentions how doing something is often not better than doing nothing. We are very familiar with this concept where in the build up to the recent financial crisis the bankers took all the risks and where now after the crisis the public have taken all the responsibility. Taleb call this a tendency to Iatrogenics, the harm done by the healer as when the doctor's interventions do more harm than good. Stopping to think about the potential harm from an intervention helps us to think in reverse, to reason backwards or as Charlie Munger encourages us to do with all arguments; to invert, always invert. There area number of other interesting terms that Taleb introduces such as Neomania, a love of change for its own sake which can result in forecasting the future by adding, not subtracting. He says that predicting the future by removing what is fragile from it is better than naïvely adding to it. He also speaks about Opacity and how things remain opaque to us, leading us to suffer form illusions of understanding. Technically he speaks about looking for convexity effects rather than concave effects; convex is good [☺], concave is bad  [☹]. Convexity affects emerge from nonlinearity and are generally considered good. The more nonlinear, the more the function of something divorces itself from the something (p.298). More generally, he also makes interesting references to the lack of correlation between educational spending and GDP growth. Money spent on education maybe good for society but is not correlated with GDP growth.<br /><br /> What did I think about it? I liked the book and while I found parts of it difficult to read and understand and therefore need to return too, I nonetheless found it stimulating, thought provoking and informative. Perhaps most of all though, I thought it was courageous. Taleb pokes his stick at many of the scared cows of modern economic and social thought and reminds us (drawing from the ancients such as Seneca whom he greatly admires) of some common sense `home truths' of human behaviour that we have perhaps forgotten. He particularly mentions the Robert Rubin violation, the Alan Blinder problem, and the Joseph Stiglitz problem, as examples of people who had options for the upside with no exposure to the downside - i.e. they had no skin in the game and no consequences to their actions. There are however some things I think that he misses. For instance, the attachment to order management and linear thinking and it's corresponding lack of preparation for randomness and non-linearity, is addressed in Ian McGilchrist's The Master and His Emissary;the divided brain and the making of the Western World which Taleb doesn't refer too. As McGilchrist outlines, the left-hemisphere has a narrow focus and seeks order and certainty. It lives in the world of the known and in `how things work'. The right-hemisphere' on the other hand has a much broader focus. It is more comfortable with uncertainty and the world of the unknown. It wants to understand `what things mean' in context. While both are needed, the naïve rationalist and scientific worldview is associated with the former whereas the broader more embodied worldview is associated with the latter. The naïve rationalist is perhaps the `half-knowledge' that Taleb talks about (p.257) which itself can be integrated through development which is something else he doesn't talk about. As outlined in Kegan's The Evolving Self and In Over our Heads or in Torbert's Development Action Inquiry, as individuals break through the conventional ceiling of naïve rationalism and begin to see the `subjectivity behind objectivity' and the constructed nature of reality, including their own, they can also see that it is not a case of either or but `both and'. Both hemispheres working together are required to function in a complex, changing and uncertain world. Taleb doesn't necessarily expresses it like this, but giving him the last word that he perhaps deserves, this maybe the kind of integration he is hoping we can achieve in becoming more antifragile. Finally, this book has caused me to reflect on how antifragile I am and how in following the `barbell' strategy he recommends that I may become better prepared for the kind of second-order effects that inevitably arise from randomness, uncertainty and change.<br /><br />Edward Kelly

1891252089|2.0|I really like this book and purchased it thru Amazon to replace a copy I (accidentally) left  with my daughter (who lives in a different state)  after a recent visit.  I figured she should keep it  since she also practices yoga.  It's perfect for a beginner to Ashtanga Yoga, since it can be used as a reminder of the sequences, focus points, breath and alignment.  Being new to  Ashtanga, I really needed the replacement.  It came after ~ 1 week.  I was excited to receive my copy, but  found  a damaged cover when opening the box.  It's a small dent, but the spiral binding is slightly misaligned.  The spiral-bound  hard cover makes it a beautiful book, practically and visually, so even though its small, it's an eyesore.  I guess I could  call customer service.  I've not received an okay to return it  from Amazon/Seller  nor have they issued  a return label after I sent  photos and filled  out an on-line description of the problem.  It's not worth it, seems too much inconvenience and I'm needing it to refer to sooner than later; it's been weeks now without this reference guide.  I've held off looking at the book because I  wanted to return it as is......

The concerto in G is played with a certain vivacity and clarity no other recording I have heard presents, and the D major for left hand is played so passionately and precisely.  I have not found a single other recording that has come close to Zimerman's for Ravel's concertos. The Valses are also a nice addition to the CD and are excellent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this book had me reading incessantly.  The twists and turns and changes in the story had me wondering what was going on but in a good way. It was one of the best books and most different books I have read in a long time.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|I really consider this the best deal I have ever gotten on Amazon; I purchased this NEW for around $30.  This set includes a majority of Stravinsky's works, and definitely provides the most important ones.  More importantly, all of these recordings are conducted by  STRAVINSKY himself, which is most definitely a huge plus.  The audio quality is great, and of course nothing can be said about the interpretation since they're his own.  The price for this many works is astounding, and I highly recommend this to any classical enthusiast.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The best hidden object game I have played.  Long but not boring, and just challenging enough to keep my attention.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Intriguing series with a wonderful cast.  Ordered this immediately after we enjoyed season 1.  The staffs' problems alone made it worth watching again and again.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|A bit too short - finished in less than three hours.  Enjoyed the story line  - puzzles were somewhat easy.
0812993292|5.0|Another great find and a must read. A boring old goat finally takes a chance and goes for it to live his life out without methodically thinking it through. Walk Fry Walk!!!!
0439023513|5.0|this a great book and its perfect to read it so you got a good idea how the movie would be
B00992CF6W|5.0|As a long time fan of the desktop version of Minecraft, the Pocket Edition simply doesn't cut it. But it's still fun for a few minutes at a time, especially on a tablet or phone with a larger screen, more for touch-control space than actually seeing the game world. It runs great on my original Kindle Fire. Your experience is largely determined by two factors: the device on which the game is running, and your prior experience with other versions. For me, I gotta have the PC version, up to date and in all its glory, but the temptation to play is always there and I can always get a quick fix on the go if I need to.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The product itself was good, the packaging wasn't damaged and it arrived on time so that was good.<br />  The movie was amazing, but if you're buying this you may have already seen it and just want it in your collection. If you haven't seen the movie, don't hesitate to do so it really is a fantastic movie and if you can, watch any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The animation is amazing, the story is kind of silly in the best way, the characters are likeable and even the English dub isn't half-bad! You can't complain when Anne Hathaway, Tim Curry, Cary Elwes and Peter Boyle are in the same movie. Oh, and Andy Richter, too. And for Ghibli fans expecting a Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata masterpiece, give Hiroyuki Morita a chance! I'd definitely say this much more light-hearted film than most Ghibli productions not quite as epic feeling, a little more in line with a Disney movie (which it is, even if only in &#34;presented to American audiences by...&#34; sort of way).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is unbelievable.  Eva and Gideon are hot and creative.  Can't wait for the next one.  Bring it on!!!
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I have read the Malazan series twice through now, and have not lost interest either time.  If you have the patience to allow plot lines to develop, and the characters also, you will be taken on an amazing journey across years and continents of the Malazan world.  You will be party to rich landscapes, amazing characters, and a wonderful story nicely balanced with humor.    In edition to:  I have now read this through a 3rd time.  This is an amazingly complex series of books.  It can be seen as difficult to get into, as Erickson just drops you off in an unfamiliar world, with unfamiliar characters, and unfamiliar settings.  But, this is one of the deepest, and richest creations I have EVER read.  For me that's saying something.  I have a personal library I have built over the last25+ years.  I peruse bookstores and the internet, always buying, never selling or trading.  I own several thousand books, and have read almost all of them.  This series is very much one of my favorites of all time.  The only detractor, is that when you get to the end, it will be very very hard to pick up another book and continue to read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A book hangover is when a book is so good that you can't get into another one. This book was amazing, it ruined my next three books that I read. I can't wait for her next book to come out!!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The item arrived on time. This is a very good movie. It's very inspiring! It's true to life! The movie is very intriguing!
B008602KQI|5.0|Good music, fast download, was worth it I will use AMazon again for ordering music again and again and again.
B000093BDX|5.0|while some of the recordings are not in &#34;stereo&#34;....it makes no difference.....turn up the volume and you will love to hear the beach boy's music which never gets tired and keeps the baby boomers young.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Good music, fast download, was worth it I will use AMazon again for ordering music again and again and again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She keeps you in your toes with this one. Makes you wonder if this one day could be a version of our future.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Good music, fast download, was worth it I will use AMazon again for ordering music again and again and again.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Better than I expected.<br />Will be reading the other books. Could have done without some of the long winded plays early on.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I am reading this book now and would really appreciate everyone else to read it it is well written and the aurthor<br />has really said it all in this book about Michael it couldn';t have been written any better...you can see and here how the love of michael is in her heart..so i reccomend this book to anyone..i give her thanks for writing it and i don't read much but just bought it from amazon and already on page 775 snf do far i have gotten tears in my eyes twice..michael was the king of pop and nobody and i repeat nobody will ever out do him..they may try but they will never do the things he has done ...i can see already that the charity's that he has domated to are in havoc..we need michael back so the world can be a better place...without Michael the charity's that he donated to and did stuff for is going down hill bad...michael did so much that people don't relaize what he really did do...i loved michael and have alot of stuff of him and i believe the person that put him were he is today needs to be done the same with for killing a great intertainer and killing a great humantarian he was super..in all the things he did..i protect michael i here any negative talk about him i jump in and tell them what i think...he is so missed and will always be in so many fans hearts...i listen to one of his albums a day and never forget what he really meant to me..and that is alot..and then people trying to destroying him god wasn't going to let that happen..but instead a dr that didn't know his butt from a hole in the ground ...he should be stripped away from all his medical licenses and never be able to practice medicine again ....but anyway this book is the best read that you could possibly read this arthur is the best when it comes to writing books about michael she is so good at it and if you buy it you will understand what im talking about...wow she is good..Karen Moriarty she is a awesome writer.....<br />So buy the book if your a michael jackson fan you will not everregret it im not a big reader but i bought this book and put it on my Kindle and im addicted to it..so much in it and such good reading all i can say..so go buy it and see what im talking about...it AWESOME !!!!<br /><br />MJ FAN FOREVER!!!<br /><br />BOBBY
B007FJFDXS|2.0|I' m rating this game two stars because it is very difficult! I'm not sure if it's because it was not developed well or if it's just because I'm terrible at it. ;) Either way, I will be uninstalling.
0385535147|5.0|I love John Grisham's novels.  They are very well written.  The Racketeer didn't disappoint.  Some twists and turns that make it interesting.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great physics game with lots of puzzles. Also if you're a programmer or computer geek you'll like some of the extra humor from the sign painter.
B000002L5I|4.0|I bought Trouble Is by Kenny Wayne Shepherd for my son as a Christmas gift.  He was very pleased to receive it.
0470901071|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best book for reviewing or learning the CCNA material. Good examples in the book
1400076943|5.0|Terrific story about a place I knew nothing about previously.  Her books are page-turners with magnificent explanations of people's feelings and the country itself.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|my kids were surprised and lovd the fact that they got this  for one of the presents this year they wanted
B004SIIBGU|5.0|There would be nothing i would compline about this site thay are always on time an there products are always in the best condition
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|The movie was a lot funnier than I had imagined. It definitely has some crude humor and is geared towards adults. Overall great adult humor.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This is my favorite Renee Olstead cd. can't wait 'till she makes some more. It's amazing to consider that she was only 15 years old when she made this album.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book probably rode to popularity piggybacking on the success of 50 Shade of Grey. The style of writing is not imaginative and not as titillating as its predecessor. The characters, both having issues, are not as lovable as Christian and Anna and I was not as drawn to anticipate a forever relationship. However it was fun to read of Gideon Cross' rich way of life.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|This is my first Renee Olstead cd and now I am a big fan. Looking forward to her making another.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Nothing to say about such an amazing book... just as good as The Name of the Wind was. I'm trying to read other books now but I just can't read because all I want is to know what happens next to Kvothe, and most other books seem boring if compared to Patrick Rothfuss trilogy
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|this movie was bad, full of plot hole. not worth $3.99 to rent. just wait until it plays for free on spike or something..
1433502410|5.0|I really lke the historical aspect this version provides for the reader.  As a result the book his heavy and a little cumbersome. It is not a standard go to church bible but may be useful during classes and definitely for the home. I really liked the fact that they included a downloadable application within the book that I will definitely use.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|The sound quality of this CD is poor.  I have to crank up the volume really high to hear some of the songs.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this movie!  It's one of my favorites that I can watch over and over and I'm so glad that I have it on DVD!
0425252868|4.0|I've read hundreds of books on WWII over the years and I only keep the &#34;good ones&#34;...those that I may want to re-read, reference later, loan to a close friend, or save for my daughter.  This is one of those books.  The book flows well without getting stuck in the mud by going overboard with extreme details.  It reads as a story, not as a text book.  Anyone interested in true WWII stories outside the &#34;norm&#34; should read this book.<br /><br />Also really recommend: Blood Red Snow
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Got this for my niece and she loved it! Great price & arrived on time for Christmas! If you kids like these dolls, they will love this!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I just got the Kindle Fire for Christmas and love playing Angry Birds on it. The space version is a lot of fun!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wow.. this book was beyond beautiful. I'm glad this was the first deep book I picked up in awhile. Charlie opened up my eyes about people not that I already knew about them, buy he made me realize how everyone is unique and is far from perfect. A must read for everyone.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very much enjoyed this book. It's light and fun, but with a nice (albeit expected) emotional development.<br /><br />Megan and Connor meet in Vegas the night before Megan's cousin's wedding. They have a drink and talk and talk and laugh and talk and drink... and the next morning Megan wakes up married. And can't remember a thing.<br /><br />But Megan had a plan. And that plan didn't involve a husband. Connor, on the other hand, doesn't want a divorce.<br /><br />The story was both expected and unexpected. The two characters are very stable, balanced people, but with an inherent emotional flaw. Each for his own reason.<br /><br />Sweet story, HEA, and some swoony and amusing moments.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I wrote this review bcuz I hate this book cuz its a dictionary for Americans  and that's dumb bcuz people have to buy it but you can go 2 the library and borrow it
B009B50QOU|2.0|I've been a Green Day fan since 1994 when I was around 11 or 12 years old. Three watered down CDs.
B005K2YXHO|5.0|its a tight fit but works.  Bought it for work where it is really filthy and things get knocked around.  Like that I can use double-protection, but miffed there is now a new, better kindle
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This film pulls all of the loose ends together, and you feel satisfied with the story ending. (Even though you doubt Batman's ability occasionally!) Great film!
B0040IAP3K|5.0|I love this show. I abandon my husband for 2 hours a night to watch it. I am sad to finish season 1 because I only have another season left and then it is over. I hope they make a season 3 or I will be so disappointed.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Slow and confusing to follow easily....each chp uses characters names as if you should know about them, but little is revealed until towards the end....Peyton place, anyone?
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is such a great series.  I especially like the captions as sometimes it is difficult to understand the English accent at times.  Maybe I need a new sound system :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|please put in a coin round where u get 2 collect coins. Just a round dedicated 2 coins. Other than that, this is SO AWESOME! I'D LIKE 2 THANK THE MAKERS OF THIS WONDERFUL GAME. PLEASE TRY AND PUT IN A COIN ROUND PLEASE. THANK U.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|After reading good reviews of this film, I was expecting much more.  I was left unfulfilled after watching.  It could have been much better with better script writing.  Overuse of gimmicks ruined it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVED this book.  Five stars.  Would give it ten if I could.  I could not put it down.  What a GREAT story.  Colleen Hoover did an AWESOME job with this book.  I read Slammed and Point of Retreat and they do not compare to this one.  This story will stay with me forever.  I will definitely read it again and again.  If you have not read it stop what you are doing and read it.  Immediately.  Make sure you have time because you will not put it down once you do.  It drags you in and you HAVE to see how it is going to end.  You will not regret it.  If you loved Beautiful Disaster you will love this.  Holden is just amazing and Sky is such a strong girl.  I thought Beautiful Disaster was great but this blew it out of the water.  I can't say enough about his book.  I would say this is one of the best books if not the best I have read in 2012 and I read ALOT.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Very intriguing story, love Liam Neeson! I had never heard of this movie before, did it even make it to the theatre?  If so it was overlooked as a very suspenseful did not see it coming plot.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Read the book after watching the movie. Loved the movie even more after reading the book. It is a splendid read
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Two of the best games ever  made on one disc? Um yes. Shadow will always be one of my favorites of all time, and the updated graphics for it and Ico are a great touch. They're still PS2-esque, but if you go compare the original version with this it's very apparent. Whatever. Graphics mean much less when you have a game this good. If you haven't played either game, do yourself a favor. They're both considered classics for a reason. You deserve to play these games. Go on and treatchaself! Dooo ittttt.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie cracked me up...Rebel Wilson especially!!  I was worried it would be a little Glee-ish (corny acting and obnoxious singing) but it was anything but!  Definitely worthy of 4 stars!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book very sad but also sweet. I can't imagine living my life the way they have to!
B000063TS9|5.0|I heard the Jazz Suite #2 on my local classical music station and had to have my own recording.  This one is excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great! The details that the movie misses out on is the best part. Can't wait to read the other two!
0374532125|3.0|I found this book to be an interesting if somewhat basic and slightly irritating and exaggerated contribution to the debate about the downside of the West's policies concerning aid to developing countries. Rather too tendentious for my taste, but I'm sure that many readers will find their principal prejudices confirmed by Dambisa Moyo's critical examination of various policy failures.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It is a very good album, worthy of anyone to enjoy, you'll love it.so I highly recommend this album.thanks a lot.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Want to get away from all the &#34;noise&#34; for awhile?  Play this game and a least for a little while you can just consentrate on doing some mindless fun to help recharge your batteries.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day tells the story of DEVGRU, an All-Pro team of Navy SEALs hand picked to kill Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan. These are a group of hard charging military perfectionists who sacrifice everything for the next mission. Kevin Maurer tells the story of 13 year old boy growing up in Alaska who comes across a book about the the first Navy SEALs in Vietnam out on a mission getting in a fierce firefight. He decides right then and there that he wants to be the guy in the firefight and that the Navy SEALs are the way to get there. Once onboard he starts a steady rise to the top of the food chain until he reaches team leader on an elite unit of the Navy SEALs DEVGRU.DEVGRU is operating out of Afghanistan after 9/11 infiltrating Taliban strongholds at night with small SEAL teams. The stories are exciting and informative and lead up to the main mission, Operation Trident Spear, the killing of Osama Bin Laden. This was a great read from start to finish and really gives you an idea of the personal sacrifice it takes to become a Navy SEAL. Can't wait for the movie!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Now I know what the buzz was all about concerning this series.  It is engaging and entertaining.  The whole group of actors in this series makes it all the more of a plus.  No weak links here.
0374214913|2.0|After reading the blurb for this book and a few reviews, I immediately purchased this book. I wasn't looking for anything too special or deep, but is it a crime to ask for anything? The story was completely author-driven which, as anyone with good taste in literature can tell you, exhausts the reader's patience fast. But still I read on thinking maybe there will be an interesting mystery. No. Things were thrown in that were never resolved. The main character just happens the get the next step so easily and there are no negative outcomes. Some might argue with me that the Google thing was a negative outcome, but it wasn't written with enough emotion and the main character fell right into the next step of the game. The only reason I finished the book was to see if maybe this \\"hidden message\\" was at all interesting. Not life-changing, not empowering, not even agreeable. Just interesting. But no, it's the same-old same-old.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. I kept giving it second chances, but I'm writing this review for the other people like me: the ones who enjoy well-spun stories with lively and real characters who do what they please. This book will not please you. I feel as though I've wasted the two days I spent reading it. I really don't like disappointing authors and it's awesome that he's been published in the first place, but hopefully his next will be better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author, and I am not disappointed. Her writing captivates you from the beginning and you are taken on an emotional roller coaster right along with the characters of this book. Couldn't put it down.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A clean romantic book sharing the revelations of a married couple whose courtship amounted to one night. This book could be described as a bit predictable but, the characters were well developed.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I understand that there was a civil war and that the rebellious districts lost. I understand that to the victor go the spoils. I don't understand how the hunger games do anything whatsoever to benefit the victor. Tribute in the form of forced labor or forfeited wealth I can understand. Tribute in the form of kids killing each other doesn't seem like smart resource management. Subjugating and oppressing the rebels is one thing. Pissing them off by making their kids kill each other seems like a certain recipe for further rebellion. Intimidate the districts by giving them a spark of hope because \\"hope is stronger than fear\\"? Does that make even the slightest bit of sense?<br /><br />Even assuming the districts put up with this nonsense, what's with the lottery? Why wouldn't there always be a volunteer? Has the world changed so much that districts don't have goth kids who want to die or jocks who want to prove their manhood? If victory is the ticket out of a life of assured misery, I'd expected dozens of kids to volunteer for the games.<br /><br />With such a preposterous premise, why am I giving The Hunger Games four stars? Because, premise aside, it's a riveting movie. In the end, I was willing to forgive the premise because there's so much here to like.<br /><br />I loved the editing. The quick jumps from scene to scene give the film energy, even early in the movie when nothing much is happening. The camera's brief focus on held hands and grim faces tell the viewer more about the people of District 12 than an hour of dialog would manage, and in a more meaningful way. During action scenes, close-ups are used effectively to heighten tension. It's just a pleasure to watch, and get lost in, the action.<br /><br />I loved the performances. Jennifer Lawrence sold me. Woody Harrelson sold me. Josh Hutcherson convinced me that he's not just a pretty face.<br /><br />I loved Stanley Tucci's hair.<br /><br />I even liked the writing. It's subtle when it needs to be. It isn't cheesy. I love the way the movie conveys emotions without using words.<br /><br />The whole rule change shtick is a little ridiculous -- our favorite characters didn't see the second change coming? They're smarter than that. The game managers' ability to create beasts out of -- what? -- is senseless. Again, I'm willing to forgive the silliness because I enjoyed the movie so much. Can't help it, I just did.heesy. I love the way the movie conveys emotions without using words.<br /><br />The whole rule change shtick is a little ridiculous -- our favorite characters didn't see the second change coming?

B006LSZECO|5.0|It started out a bit slow but within a chapter I couldn&#34;t put it down! Loved it! Would like to read more of Gillian Flynn's books.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Amazon needs to add more of these types of games on the Kindle Fire's, because they are very enjoyable.  They also need to add too that list of game selection, games like hidden objects and finding three or more objects because these are very good games people would like to play
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Impossible to read without comparing to the tv series, because I'm a huge fan of the hbo epic.  I'm not sure if it would have been enjoyable without those images. I think this is one time when I don't care if the books are better. Bring on season 3!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain inspires you to withdraw from the hustle and bustle of life and consider how effective and inspiring our own lives can be through an unwavering persistence and determination to achieve our ambitions, goals, and dreams. It stresses the importance of never losing faith or giving up on the values in your life that form your character. These values you hold on to are truly recognized and appreciated by only your dearest of friends.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I love all the versions of Angry Birds .This one has to be my favorite version though.The bird powers are great and I even love darthpig. Entertainmenting and worth the money.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Has a few too many references of crude humor for me but the kids love it. Another good addition to my fourth graders' library.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. Watching via amazon is so convenient! I watched the whole season over 2 days. Great value!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I thought it was boring and had words i never knew. but to say it was very educational. this is why i give this rating. also it look like a dictionary to me. so i didnt want to read it
B004SBX112|5.0|My 5 year old grandson loves playing Angry Birds seasons. We have really bonded over this and other games. Great value for $.99.

B006MW3V6U|4.0|I loved the show itself, but had technical difficulties with the amazon player. The acting in the show is wonderful, and the storylines interesting.
B005LAII12|4.0|Good movie i would recommend it to friends!! Mark Wahlberg and Mia Kunis headline in this movie I probably wouldnt recommend it for children
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Just see it! It will not be boring at all. Even if you are an adult dont miss it, it eill make you laugh!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the first calculator I've used on my Kindle but this calculator is simple to use and works great for the tasks I use it for so I have not tried another. Good job to app creator.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child never fail to thrill and entertain.  Bringing the saga of Pendergasts wife to a close and the introduction of his sons was very satisfying.  I'm on board for their next novel.  Hurry up guys.
B008476HBM|5.0|Wonderful look back into a more romantic time. When ladies were proper ladies, and men were true gentlemen.  Sweet love.
B00AS1Q93S|2.0|Having read all of the Jack Reacher books in the series, Tom Cruise does not fit the description of the books' character. Jack Reacher has frequently been described as being 6'5\\", about 240 pounds, with fists like hams. Cruise is no more than a \\"Mini Me\\". Jack Reacher was an MP Major and criminal investigator, now retired who travels about the country with no luggage, no ID, buys his changes of clothes, has no permanent home and during his travels finds himself projected into local criminal activities in which he is an innocent bystander who seeks non-involvement. Quite an interesting and addictive series. This movie, although interesting and full of action, does not follow the format of the book series. Newcomers to the Jack Reacher epic may be impressed, however, long time series devotees will be dissapointed.

I learned it was from &#34;Passenger&#34; and I decided to buy the cd on the strength of that one song. I am so glad I did. I absolutely love every song on that cd! JoAnn
B003C1SPX8|5.0|Yes, like others wrote, video quality is not as good as a typical DVD would be. It is equivalent to good VHS video. However, the sound quality is very good. If your goal is to count the hair on Mark's face (I doubt it), you may be disappointed. Overall, the DVD is *very* successful in capturing the live atmosphere of this amazing Dire Straits performance. I think it's simply impossible for a Dire Straits lover to regret this purchase. Don't miss it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very moving book. Charlie was a very good guy to every one and put everyone before himself. I can relate to him because I take everything as it is in perspective. Charlie is my favourite character EVER to be in a book.<br />I rate this book a five because it was such a wonderful story and the great language everything was put together well.<br />This would be a great book for a person who is trying to find themselves. Great great great book.. I recommend you all read it!
1609613937|5.0|John and Mary are genuinely ready to help anyone get to good health! The science is evident as the references are readily available. A must read!
B000089770|5.0|Forest Whitaker and Harold Perrineau also played an interesting roles in this movie along with other more famous actors.  It is the kind of movie that makes you want to find the book for this movie or find writing like this movie that comes close to it so that you can spend more time in the story telling.
B004I744AS|4.0|Dictionary always word of the day and interesting knowledge. Just learning all that is on this apt. and will continue too.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is very impressive  for being FREE the game play is challenging but , if you like dungeons and dragons you'll like this game for sure I think the company puts out a lot of good graphics games and the game play isn't to far behind I give this game a ***** out of *****
B005D0RDKW|5.0|OK, I just had to get that title out of the way. I wish I'd been at Cleveland to see this show. It's a great set. The only Rush Shows I've seen lately have been at Red Rocks, so Snakes and Arrows twice and Time Machine twice. If you're a Rush fan and you haven't heard the audience recordings of the Time Machine shows at Red Rocks, you're missing out on some treats. I've read the critical comments by other reviewers here and I see it differently. Great performance, great A/V. Is it like a studio recording? Of course not! Rush has processes they use when writing that can give a certain snap-shot view of a song that very well might have progressed by the time it gets to your local venue. During the Time Machine tour, you could hear it by listening to Caravan from the studio with what it had become by the time they reached Denver. It was alive! You simply have to see Rush live - and often. People have been reported to behave inappropriately if deprived of their Rush fix. Get this and laugh a little, smile a lot. It's an awesome set.
B004U52VPS|5.0|The boys are 6 and almost 9 and the first thing they wanted to do is build and shoot them down.
1451683405|5.0|The book is short but powerful in content. I read it during my vacation to Oman. Just sat down one day on the beach, read it from cover to cover, and when I got up I looked at people differently. It changed my perspective of how I see people and their behavior. To be honest, I'm far less judgmental of people now than what I used to be. And that's a great thing.
B003Z49LYO|2.0|I was hoping for a lovely story with redemptive attributes. However- this series was the most depressing miniseries! Don't waste your money.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I bought the kindle edition because I read on the Clancy website that China and cyber warfare were central to the plot of this book.  Well, they are, but it takes a while to get there.  I speak fluent Chinese and have lived in China.  I usually am disappointed in how China is portrayed in fiction and how two dimensional Chinese officials appear.  I don't have any of those complaints with this book.  He does get underneath the surface and look at some of the complexities of China politics.  Clancy, as usual, has done his homework.  Clearly, if he didn't know, he found out.  Clancy has also come along way since his Netforce book.  In Threat Vector, there are some very believable and plausible situations.  Spoiler Alert.  An accounting systems prof that I had told us that not making the source code available was good enough security.  Here we see in Netforce that there are people out there who do think on the machine language level (assembly language), and they are the ones that we have to be worried about.  Thank you, Tom Clancy, I feel better now that this book is on the best seller list and my old prof wasn't.  Just  be patient, though the book starts out with allot of action, it takes a while for the plot to unfold.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I understand this is a story about a war in the middle east, but four deployments !!! What a wife to stay with this guy. Then he is teaching his son to handle a gun when bearley out of nappies. No wonder the country has a gun problem.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved the raw emotion of this book. I also loved the kind of zombies in this book, the feeling that it's just this huge inescapable wave that never stops coming was amazing. I highly recommend this book and will absolutely re-read.

B008Y1YJ90|5.0|My kids love this movie! It is a fun movie and it explains how Santa may work today! Since a sleigh and 8 reindeer are becoming harder to believe in for my kids. This movie had a great idea of how it might all work now days!

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who wants a good browser.  I use GOOGLE on my desktop, and find it just as good on my hand-held.
B000001EUN|5.0|Animal Magnetism was the second in a string of mid-career blockbuster Scorpions releases that ultimately defined their sound and their worldwide success.  This is a hard working band on the stage and in the studio, and it is evident on this classic album that features their timeless classic and tribute to New York City, &#34;The Zoo&#34;.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was okay. Rambling sentences & not long enough. Could have went into more details about the incident with his aunt.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|If you are a serious or casual Billy Idol fan, this album has all you need.  Great selections top to bottom.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome and a lil sad. Loved the characters. wish I knew more about their future. Really thought it was good.
B000001EUR|4.0|This album produced the best-known Scorpions hit of all time (Rock You Like a Hurricane), but also the timeless &#34;Big City Nights&#34; and the eponymous &#34;Bad Boys Running Wild&#34;.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|it is fun, I like it, my cousins like it. simple game, not very attractive but challenging, hope to improve this game.
B000001EUL|5.0|This is the album that put Scorpions on the map in the US and worldwide.  With classics such as Coast to Coast, Loving You Sunday Morning, Another Piece of Meat, Holiday, and of course the title track, this 1979 release would stand well on its own in any classic rock fan's collection.  But importantly this was the first of a string of blockbuster releases over the next four years that had Scorpions headlining stages around the globe (Bon Jovi opened for them on the 1984 tour!).  The controversial album cover was originally replaced with something innocuous for their US release but is now available in its original form, showing the band's tongue-in-cheek humor that lies just beneath the surface in many of their songs and also demonstrates that they never take themselves too seriously.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|So let me start by saying that I'm an Iron Maiden fanatic and own every album they've ever put out (even everything recorded during the Blaze Bayley era).  I absolutely love this CD.  There are a few selections, such as Revelations, Hallowed Be Thy Name and Powerslave that, quite frankly, were probably slightly better performed on Live After Death.  The only reason is that the guitar solos differ quite a bit from the recorded versions, which usually I don't like.  Also, I wish Adrian Smith had done his own solo on Moonchild because Janek Gers' solo is sort of all over the place whereas Adrian's original solo was more precise, but these are only minor gripes.<br /><br />Now onto what's excellent:  The Evil That Men Do is the best live recording I've ever heard of this song.  They take the tempo up a notch, and Adrian Smith and Janek Gers absolutely nail the solo in unison.  Listen closely and you can hear a slight addtion to the guitar part courtesy of Adrian Smith that I think is very cool.  The Trooper is also a standout with Adrian and Janek once again soloing in unison.<br /><br />This live recording also contains my absolute favorite version of Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  Adrian Smith once again takes advantage of Maiden's three guitar lineup to add a few things to the guitar riffs, which I think absolutely enhances the song.  He also changes his guitar solo very slightly in a way that I think is really cool, and Dave Murray pretty much plays the solo nearly identically to the recorded version.  The same is true of Aces High during both solos by Murray and Smith.  I think it actually sounds slightly better than the Liver After Death version, which I know is really saying a lot, but I'll stand by that opinion.<br /><br />And then there are newer Maiden standout songs, such as The Talisman and especially Dance of Death (written by Janek Gers with Steve Harris) and The Final Frontier, that are included and make this CD an absolute must own.  It's also a great value because it comes as a two CD set.  Up the Irons!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I may be 14 but I am in love with game! I love my little pony. If u love my little pony get this game!!!!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|It has good progression to different levels, is colorful and has good sound effects.  I enjoy playing it and would recommend it.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Grandson loves it.
B0086700CM|1.0|At least I'd like the opportunity to get close to a good score.  I've tried and my husband tried and we can't get far in levels in this game to make us continue to play it.  I'm certain others have climbed the level ladder, but not us.  Don't like it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I could not put it down. It really had me reflecting upon my own life and my faith in God.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It allows a good progression in levels, has great sound affects and is fun.  I love playing it.  I mean, pigs and birds, how fun is THAT.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|I LOVE this book!!! If you think it's just about cooking you're in for it! I haven't even made a recipe from this book because I am busy mastering my learning techniques and decided to conquer Japanese using this book! This book is so jam packed with knowledge it will take you FOREVER to read so luckily Mr Ferriss has also included helpful hints for what to skip and how to use it as a choose your own adventure type book.<br /><br />I 100% recommend this book for anyone who wants to accelerate their learning process and become their very own version of \\"The Most Interesting Man\\" or Chuck Norris :)
B002JVWQSW|5.0|...that really caught my attention and kept it. As for the rating, 5 stars because I got what I ordered when I wanted it, which was AQAP [quick there]. Very pleased.
0439023513|5.0|So, here it is: the Mockingjay, third and the last book of the hunger games series, and the book where the readers get to know where the romantic story settles with and which side the war finally favors on. The first two books provided the sparks and the fuel, and motivation sets them ablaze, ready to burn through the pages of the epic final.<br />The hunger games were never about the 100% \\"so they lived happily ever after\\", but for the determined Katniss sacrificing, and struggling to keep the loved ones close and alive. The ending emphasizes on the point, and I, for the most part think it was a good book to read.<br />Though it was a good book, I am sure a lot of people would disagree, and I can see the point: it was not exactly the fairytale ending the wanted, and didn't focus much on the romance element as they would have liked. However, I think the author had her own idea for the books and the whole point in which the first two books are left to be sacrificed by the last, to create much more of the \\"drastic\\" effect as possible.<br />The storyline goes like this (spoilers): Katniss is rescued from the arena and transferred to district 13, 12 is bombed to serve as another lesson to the rebels, and Katniss agrees to be the rebellion's \\"Mockingjay\\". Peeta is unfortunately captured in the capital, and he becomes the role model of the capital to call for a \\"seize- fire\\". However, the rebels march on; successfully reuniting all the districts into arms, and finally, (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!) defeats the capitol.<br />(spoilers ended) I think it was very exciting, detailed, emotional, and... and so much more. It deserved a 5 star, and I am giving it right now. Recommend young adults to read the grand finale of the hunger games, Mockingjay
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Bane was a good villain with a vision. The Joker was a menacing villain sans vision with exception of his insanity and chaotic &#34;method&#34;. I'd buy from this vendor again. Received the DVD in under week with Prime shipping and it was ordered right around Christmas.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|lf you've read the first two books in the series, you must read this. I give five stars to the first two, and four to this though it probably deserves five as well. The dropped star is purely subjective: this was also a wonderful read, but it didn't completely possess me as did the first two. While reading it, I had a life which continued alongside it, whereas with the other two, I was nowhere to be found outside of the world created. Don't expect a Disney ending -- the conclusion is real, not made for a cheap catharsis.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I loved Buffy, so when I found out this was made by the same guy, I knew it would be good too.  And it was! Definitely worth the buy. Awesome show with and interesting plot.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is considered a Young Adult novel, but I would quibble with the category, as it appeals as strongly to an adult audience. The only specifically Young Adult features I could detect are (1) it is a quick and easy read, and (2) the main characters are young adults. It is as engaging as the first in the series: Hunger Games. Though it deals with a dark and fear-ridden dystopian future in what was once America, the dark setting serves to bring into high relief what is good in the human heart -- kindness, love, hope, commitment -- all without a single lapse into Pollyanna-land. The world described is at first so different from our own, but soon we find echoes of the present everywhere: the dystopia can be seen as the logical conclusion of tendencies working through our cultural and political life today.

B008S80OU2|5.0|The year is 1972. An FM radio DJ announces a new album and he's gonna play the single from it. \\"It's called Cities On Flame With Rock and Roll,\\" he says. The 15 year old boys' ears perk up as the first chords and sinister guitar lines stream out of a 6\\" speaker. He instinctively turns up the volume. He's transfixed. Who is this band? Later he finds out they're called Blue &Ouml;yster Cult. \\"What a good name for a band,\\" he says. But WTF? does it mean?!<br /><br />True story. After that, I tore into B&Ouml;C like nobody else's business. As a fan of Lester Bangs, I read every word he wrote in Creem magazine. But when Lester wrote about B&Ouml;C, I read it 20 times. I idolized B&Ouml;C. Eric's college years watching Star Trek while on a certain psychedelic medicine. Check. Buck Dharma and Lester wrestling in the hotel room. Check. I started looking like my hero, Albert Bouchard. The details, like hot pants and glitter socks, weren't lost on me either. Back then, that was suicide for my social life. It still is.<br /><br />This box set brings it all back home for me and much MORE. I've been listening to it exclusively every chance I get now for three weeks. In the truck (cranked). At home (cranked). Just turn it up and leave it there. The early albums, which I know really well, sound even darker and more brilliant now. And, as another reviewer mentioned, the levels are not brick walls, but clean, clear, and dynamic sheets of metal even at a loud volume.<br /><br />I hate to admit it but there are albums in here I've never heard before. I stopped listening in '77 after Spectres. Blame it on punk. But I never stopped loving B&Ouml;C. So the albums after Spectres and before Imaginos, which I have loved since its release, are sort of new to me. The standouts are Mirrors, Some Enchanted Evening, and Revolution By Night. Every album has merit though, even Club Ninja.<br /><br />7 Screaming Random Thoughts...<br /><br />1. Secret Treaties is either one or two on my list of the best records of all time.<br />2.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its a SPECTACULAR parody to Super Mario Bros.I think I would give this to a friend that knows to play Mario.
B007URCTOG|5.0|I loved this movie! It was so inspirational about love, and I couldn't help but want to see it. The actors had such chemistry.
B005ONTD42|4.0|I have had some moments though, when the sphero will not sync with the cell phone and won't work at all, but after shutting both down and up again, they'll connect. Good to play with cats and little kids.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This culmination of games is fun and exciting but could use better player sensitivity controls. It's sometimes difficult to get the games to follow my reaction on my kindle fire. Overall it's fun.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I chose this rating because the hunger games is very  boring.  The only interesting thing is the fighting.  I disliked everything except for the fighting. Everything but the fighting was exciting. I liked the fighting. The reason I liked the fighting is because it was intense. I recommend this book to someone who doesn't like a lot of action.
B005HSL626|5.0|How can i put the awesomeness of this game into words? I know Epic It is a great way to pass time also this game is so awesome
B0038M2AZA|5.0|It helped explain issues that we deal with as a family with a child on the spectrum ... issues that are otherwise hard to put into words.  Thank you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing. The beginning may seem a little boring but at the same time anxious to read what happens.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|always love the Piano Guys.  No complaints.  Sounds nice.  The package was sealed.  What else do you want me to say?
B007FH9GA6|5.0|WARNING: There are two very graphic rape scenes! VERY GRAPHIC, But those are by far the worst parts and the rest of it isn't graphic at all.<br /><br />However the rest of the movie is excellent. I love the acting, the overall atmosphere is wonderful. The suspense is intense and the mystery will thrill you. Anyone who loves a good psychological/suspense thriller will love this!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|This processor is really amazing. Very fast and can give me higher FPS and it is easy to overclock. I strongly recommend this to all.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Another excellent tale by Mr. Gaiman. The story is witty without being pretentious, full of clever little twists yet never becoming tacky and predictable. And like most of his stories,he wraps things up in a way that is satisfying, not an agonizing, terribly sad end but also no overly optimistic happily ever after. His stories tend to be upbeat and whimsical in a really solid, grounded way, and I like that.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!!!!!! The l love that Travis had for abby was so heart worming!!! I practically high lighted the whole book! Great love story!

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This works fine- not the same as a normal alarm clock but gets the job done<br />I also like the weather gadget
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was by far the most tear jerking, heart warming, awful, mean, sweet,and funny book that I have ever read. How can books be mean? Well, bends the fact that I cried throughout the whole second part of the book. My feelings were quite hurt to be honest. In the sense that I read this book in matter of hours, I was white offended whenever I got to the last page. I turned the page and my heart sank. I was no longer reading one of the best books ever written. It was an awful feeling. Sure I can go back and read the book again but it will never be the same.  I will never get that awful but amazing feeling of finishing the b look that completes mg life. So. Goodnight and Well Wishing to all.

B003ODIZL6|4.0|That book is so big that I can barely even get out of it. But it is still useful in a way. I have a kindle fire and on that kindle tablet I just saw two random dictionaries in my book category and I got emotional. I was happy and mad. I had thought someone else put them on there but no way my brother or anyone else (mostly just my brother) would not do that. Maybe they were already on there. By the way I got my kindle for Christmas :D

B00A7Z8KAU|1.0|Another falseto art program that cannot compare to the use of real art utilities. If you are ok with finger painting till it feels like it will break or have it in the way all the time, or trying to use stylus type utilities that wont work properly either than you should be ok; but if not these things are still centuries behind real art utilities.

0783230079|4.0|Mr Downey Jr is always very easy on the eye, an enjoyable film that has you smiling most of the time
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The series has good plots, characters and story lines. However, the writer likes to ramble on needlessly a lot. I had to do a lot of scanning to get to the point. I finally gave up on the 4th book and looked up the story line just find out what happens.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I'm going to write something that surprises even me:<br /><br />I am not sure I have enjoyed a movie more this year than I enjoyed Les Misérables.<br /><br />Yes, really.<br /><br />Please note: this does not mean I think it was the best film of 2012.  One of the topics we discussed each week in my Epic Cinema was the sincere difference between Good/Bad and Like/Dislike.  I'm not sure I've seen a better film this year than Lincoln (to be fair, I haven't seen Zero Dark Thirty yet, and that looks like it might eventually hit the 'leader-in-the-clubhouse' level).  But that said, I'm not sure I enjoyed a film more than I enjoyed Les Misérables.  And this surprises me beyond measure.<br /><br />And so I write this with some confidence: If I like it--and do know that I'm no fan of musicals--I bet you'll dig it to.  I did not arrive in the theatre on Christmas Day with any warm spot in my heart for the musical, as I had never seen it, nor the source material, and Victor Hugo is a blaring omission on my continuing attempts at becoming a well-read lad.<br /><br />If you don't know the story, I cannot give you a a synopsis that would be meaningful in less than 500 words, and that's not what this rant is about.  And if you do know the story, you'd criticize my synopsis.  So I'll avoid all of that nonsense.<br /><br />But I will write that I simply loved the music, the singing, and the story.  I had a feeling Hugh Jackman could sing, and Anne Hathaway sang at the Oscars a year or so back.  But my heavens, even Russell Crowe belted out a good tune, and he played a fantastically fierce antagonist.  Sacha Baron Cohen owned every scene he was in (this, along with Hugo makes me think that guy has talent beyond his Ali G characters).  And mark my words: Eddie Redmayne (Marius) is going to be a huge star.  Very soon.<br /><br />Perhaps embarrassingly  I've listened to the soundtrack all day (what the hell is wrong with me?!).  I love it.<br /><br />The sets and costumes were fantastic, and the mise-en-scene was continuously spot on.  If Eve Stewart (the production designer), Paco Delgado (costumes), and Grant Armstrong (art direction) don't get nominated for some kind of shiny gold trophies come award time, then something is amiss.<br /><br />The worst part of the film?  Helena Bonham Carter.  But that's par for the course, for she is the worst thing in just about everything she is in.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|There were many funny and clever parts. If they had condensed it to an hour and left out all the fluff of them just flying through the air I would have enjoyed it more. I was getting bored and falling a sleep towards the end.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Wow. What a cool book. It was a mystery full of wonderfully quirky, lovable characters of all ages. It was set in lucious places like a 24-hour bookstore 3 stories high with ladders and shadows, trendy living spaces, and a secret, underground library you can only reach via a passage hidden behind a bookshelf. It involved elements of so many things I enjoy: books (!), nerds, art, technology, sci-fi, fantasy, puzzles, codes, and treasure hunting. Then, it added perfect embelishments like references to other books and movies I enjoy (like the hamster McFly and a secret society hinged on hidden codes) and created new references as it ran parallel to a fabricated sci-fi/fantasy series. On top of that it was funny and never took itself seriously.<br /><br />I did have a few annoyances like too many characters wearing cardigans and too much blue and gray and only disgusting food being mentioned. (Do most San Franciscans really eat that stuff?) I also found the depiction of Google to be distracting in its unbelievability. And, the cover---I seriously didn't read this book for a long time because it seemed too generic. With all the creativity packed in this novel I'd have expected more than that boring cover. But, alas, none of my complaints amount to a hill of beans with this charming novel.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We thought for sure they would drag out plots until we didn't even care any more...like they do so often in other series, but they moved it along and kept it interesting. Love their mix of humor throw in.
B002APU580|4.0|Movie is excellent but this version is not remastered so the image quality is not great even for DVD standard.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I. enjoyed this game it had fun puzzles and were not so hard that I was unable to solve them
1451695195|5.0|It's wonderful to find and read something positive and supportive of one's spiritual beliefs when we seem surrounded by increasing Godless behavior in the American descent into the emptiness of atheism.
B004J64QSI|5.0|this is the greatest Les Mis cast i have ever heard. they all have amazing voices. i've heard other versions where i believed the people they chose for certain parts had the wrong voice  for that part (like choosing someone too old for Marius's part). anybody who buys this will not regret it! i bought the digital version for my ipod when this first came out. i don't even know how many times i have watched it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I love Christmas songs and I love the voice of Michael Buble'. How could I ever go wrong on this album? I couldn't and I didn't. When I wear this CD out, I'll buy another one!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is easy to play.  The graphic are good.  I would recommed it if you do not want a hard game.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I love and have every Rolling Stones album that these songs were taken from. But when I want to hear a compilation of the best of the Stones, I play Grrr! It's a great Stones album; one among the many of great Rolling Stones albums. I love it!
B006CUDDUG|5.0|I like the author's use of spy terminology. The jargon may be completely fictional but it is gripping the same way good fantasy fiction pulls you into the world of Hogwarts, hobbits, etc.<br /><br />I also was moved by the philosophical questions the spy faces: loyalty to what, what is the point of doing good work and toppling regimes. Also the rootlessness and disturbed nature, the search for structure and belonging of the spies was insightful.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I love Paul McCarney's voice. He is certainly entertaining with this album. It's not his best but it's not the worst in my collection either. I really do like it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is addicting.  Causing this reader to loose sleep, be late for work, and not keep relationships together.  If you want your life to fall apart pick up this book and start reading.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I still watch this movie at least once a year. It's a great story with a great ending! It's almost as good as the Godfather trilogy to me!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I chose this rating because the book doesn't try and impress.  It doesn't waffle on about pointless crap like many health books do.  I gets straight to the point, delivers answers to questions and doesn't promise anything either.  It simply points out a whole heap of home truths about the world we live in and it is left up to the reader to subscribe or not.<br /><br />I like the way in which the book is written, it is simplified and without overly technical jargon that Joe Average will never understand.  Where there was a requirement for a technical explanation it was delivered in an easy to understand way.  I highly rate this book.<br /><br />I am by no means an obese individual, in fact I'm quite athletic and above average build, for my age, my body fat is around 10% (which is low) and I am active in the gym daily.  I have dropped 2kg in 3-4 weeks just from cutting down on sugar and cutting down on carbs.  That's not even cutting them out completely, just massively reducing my intake of either, as the book says, has produced a result.
1401322786|5.0|If you like MItch Albom and you like his stories and you like his writing, well, you probably already have this book. If not, this is a good book to introduce you the Mr. Albom. If you like this, you will probably be a fan for life! I know I am!!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|If you like Transformsers the movie, you will certainly love it in 3D.  The 3D version is very good and since I bought this on sale during black Friday it was great deal.
1592332803|5.0|Highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to eat healthier desserts. Also includes tips for substituting eggs and dairy.
B006UKC566|2.0|I watched the 3D version of Transformers: Darkside of the moon and was very pleased.  It would appear someone decided to make a 3D version of Immortals after the fact and the results were disappointing
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I could see that a lot of effort went into the movie, but it just felt a little forced.  The premise, setting and pacing just didn't seem quite right.  It would have felt more familiar to have events occur in darkness, and I think I would have enjoyed a more capable (and paranoid) protagonist who used his spiffy gadgets instead of just straight brawling. It definitely had some pretty neat moments, but overall I think this may be my least favorite of the trilogy.
0425263916|4.0|Bared to You was too much like 50 Shades of Gray.  This book was good.  It really drew you to keep reading.
0786939532|5.0|This whole series is awesome, just buy it read it, get addicted move on to next book and repeat.  Seriously great books, awesome authorship, love it, love it, love it.<br /><br />Worst part about the series is as it is with all good series, it eventually ends.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I thought this was the best app for me and everyone should get the application because of the pudding! JK! I think this was a great app and maybe even better than cut the rope with all the challenging puzzles. Holding they will update soon with even more types of pudding! (My favorite is the purple one!)
0345529057|5.0|Great Series, Book III is my favorite so far, currently on book IV, and slowed down quite a bit, I think book VI is supposed to be where everything really picks back up, going slowly at this point though.  But overall LOVING THE SERIES!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play and understand. Love the color graphics and easy to touch and move cards around.  I have arthritis, so it was easy to play.
0316779989|5.0|I am thrilled.  Sedaris never disappoints, and I feel like I am next to him while he tells me details from his mishap adventures.  He is totally my style; I should be, or wish I was, a Sedaris.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|I'm a Dylan Fan.  I grew up in the middle 60's and listened to Bob Dylan from the get go, But didn't buy too many album's, now I can afford them.  I'm old school, so this album takes me back!!!!
B001LMAK88|5.0|We'd had the VCR tape, but had never replaced it with DVD for some reason.  We love this movie as much now as we did the first time we watched it.
B005LAII3U|4.0|I went into watching this movie with the mindset of not comparing it to the original. With that said I was expecting an enjoyable sci-fi action flick, and that is what I received. The special effects were really great except for a little too much lens flaring going on. I thought Kate Beckinsale did a terrific job as a badass in this movie ( they should consider her for a Tomb Raider ) I also thought Colin did a good job, not great but good.<br />I really enjoyed this movie for what it is, just a fun sci-fi ride and you shouldn't go into this movie comparing it or you'll probably like it much less.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Awesome for a Joe Bonamassa fan.  Purchased as a gift; individual never tires of watching it over and over again.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|hi im ten and this game is the best salon game ever! you can curl,dye,cut,or grow the hair. i wish there was more charaters to choose from though.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Like many highly gifted people, Dr. Alexander relied on proof for much of his life, until experience opened his intellect to other types awareness. The easy dichotomy for anyone is that between religion and science. For Dr. Alexander, a near death experience revealed the weakness of reliance on concrete evidence. He offers us a lesson in the limits of being closed to alternative beliefs or possibilities.
B002SEQ8ZM|5.0|love this movie. have watched it dozen of times w/my daughter. dark but cool. buy both 3d and 2d versions.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This Movie is one of my favorite on all time!!! but I don't have to warn you, be patient with the movie cause it has a slow start.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|It kept me wanting more. The story brings you in so you feel as though you are standing next to Langdon as he is moving through the story.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This is not a book I will read again. In fact I'm pretty disappointed that I bought it. I really wanted to see the movie when it came out,  but now I'm glad I didn't waste my money.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Anybody who has enjoyed seeing Les Miserables on Broadway, on public television or the 10th anniversary show will love this version! I had to download this lovely music as soon as I watched the movie. Amazing! I cannot stop listening to this!
B007TK77QE|2.0|After the Harry Potter series which I really enjoyed, this book is a let down.  It is bogged down in long winded detail and slow to get into the story.  It is also often repetative to the point that I thought I had lost the page.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Pretty cute, and the beginning goes along at a nice pace. Only thing I don't like is that this is a &ldquo;wait for the building to be constructed&quot; game, so you might do an action then wait a coupled hours for it to actually finish. Often makes the game quite boring when there's nothing left for you to do except wait.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud I love the diary of a wimpy kid series they are good books to read for fun!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Good app &  works as stated. Easy to navigate through & a nice choice of sounds & melodies to choose from. Definitely one of the better apps I found on amazon!
B000059H98|5.0|brand new works perfect. my favorite older movie of al time. highly recommend if you have a weird sence of humor.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I purchased the HD version & while it is good, the picture still isn't as clear as it should be. The show however, is awesome!
B0086700CM|4.0|It is a rather fun game that will help with the down times in the hunting blind when I tend to close my eyes for a rest...lol
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great app! Had been trying to find hidden files to delete through customer help etc. Downloaded this app, and within a few minutes it found what I was looking for. If you sync with your pc, you could be picking up alot of unwanted stuff everytime you plug in...making this app a great tool for managing files. Navigation is a breeze!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|5 star<br />I like about it because I really don't know why I like it I just do LoL o_O
B008469DGY|5.0|Too addictive<br />Needs way more courses than it has it is a really fun game it could be used as a drinking game
1451695195|5.0|This book was fascinating and definitely thought-provoking.  I've bought copies for two other people, so that I can discuss the author's very unusual premise.
0385344333|5.0|I have read all of the 'Reacher' novels and enjoy the character and the story lines. And I'm a retired US Army CID Agent who is 6'5&#34; and 250 lbs so I identify with the main character.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Got it quickly and packaged fine.  Was a gift for a teen who<br />wanted a fun movie for a winter day.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|I really like Depp. His quirky style is unique and fun. But this was /not good/ at all.<br /><br />My wife bought it for me for Christmas, and when we saw that it was PG13, we decided to preview it before showing the kids. Good thing we did.<br /><br />The reviews said it was \\"hysterical.\\" I found nothing in it funny at all. One scene implied oral sex on Barnaby Collins the vampire. Not only is that uncool, but downright creepy--he's undead! Do I need to explain how...yucky that is?!<br /><br />Another scene, my wife and I zipped over was when vampire and witch...um...tear up the place. Not funny. Not entertaining. Not good.<br /><br />This was supposed to be dark humor. Nope. Just pathetic. Every single person in the drama. In the end, you feel sorry for only one person, Mrs. Collins, and she's nasty. When someone complained to her that Barnaby is killing/eating people, she says that he's family and is bringing the business back. Wow. Now that's deep.<br /><br />No sympathetic characters (with the trifle exception of Mrs. Collins). Everyplace you'd expect some kind of development or moral evaluation never materializes (think of Alice in Wonderland's Hatter when Depp realizes that to Alice he was just fantasy).<br /><br />Again, wow, that was nasty.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For just $30 this boxset gives you the entire trilogy. Hard to beat that. Also the bonus book they included is really nice too
0307730697|5.0|This book is so greaat, he was so full of couragw,but some how lost his way, only to turn his life around, and was such a soft hearted and kind person, a true hero! God Bless HIM, I was truly touched! Eric BLehim, nailed it! I pray for his wife and children. What a heart breaker.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I just got the Edge Extended, free, which was quite the deal.  I have been using the regular Edge for quite some time and really like it.  It is an amazing creation, very unique and challenging.  Not the easiest thing to master, but quite fulfilling when I do.  I basically work toward attaining an A rating for each level.  Over time, 95% of the time I am able to do it.  I still cannot attain the higher ratings, S ratings.  Not sure how to actually do that, except possibly by going on edge while having to wait for something else to happen before I can move again.  Which in the end gets subtracted from my time.  So this is really a review for Edge in general.  I imagine that EDGE extended is just more  levels.  I would highly recommend it.  It is not only a game against time, but also a puzzle that one has to figure out, some of which is not visible.  Requires dexterity, patience and intelligence.  I love it.  Thank you, creators!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The best book I've read in years! I literally couldn't put in down. I'm really looking forward to reading more books from this author!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As always, an engaging story with twists and turns to keep one guessing. I love geting to know his characters.

B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for the most part but have enjoyed reading the books more.  Very action packed and adventurous.
034537410X|5.0|I have been practicing lucid dreaming for last few years. Its like climbing a mountain or building a house. This book gives you shovel, cement, armature, planking, blocks, hammer, nail, carpentry and other tools and stuff.<br /><br />Exploring your dream world is an endless adventure that will push you to the edge of your known perception and pull you to hidden word of the unknown.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The last movie of the trilogy.  It is a great finish, the action and surprises are unending. Do not pass over this one.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart has a great voice.  This was a great CD to play while  we were wrapping Christmas presents.  The Best.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|This movie is disappointing.  Thought it would have more singing and adventure in the countryside and not witchcraft/magic. Just to unrealistic.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|My favorite movie series, and Blu-ray makes it that much better. Has interactive links, but haven't tried the options yet while the movie is playing.
B009FB3XTA|3.0|I do not care about this album as much as the other albums, especially the first and second albums but need to purchase to complete collection.
B00573YVVY|3.0|I found the continuous introspection a bit tiring. Apart from that the book is very well written an gave me an insight into Obama's background which have obviously influeneced his policies as President.
B004YXE438|5.0|This a very good game if you like puzzles. Really like that you can pick # of pieces and difficulty. Enjoyed this game immensely.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I chose this book because. It promised revelations of what Steve Jobs was like.  I enjoyed it very much, but it got too detailed with regard to specific  products.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Love it! It's nice to see a modern Christmas movie that is already a Holiday Classic. I wish I could write a better review.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My granddaughter  is the one who played the game and really loved it.  I know she will play it often.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An ending?<br /><br />I guess you are to imagine your own ending or what a terrible, frightening life they will have.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is one of my favorite's I've always been a fan of Percy Jackson and always will be.<br />- Ili
0307352145|5.0|My wife wanted to read this book but I ended up reading it.  I have 18 of the 20 characteristics of introverts described in the book.  Until now I used to think that there was something wrong with me, but now I know that I am a perfectly normal introvert!  Now every time my wife wants to take me to a social event and I don't want to go, I have a perfect explanation -- I am an introvert!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Best batman film ever. A must see for batman fans and everyone who like action packed films.  The streaming was perfect, no peoblems.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|All cute story good voice acting decent music and pretty shiny styled graphics. So far it is a little lacking in challenge but I'm only to the second stage, Greece after completing Rome.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great show! Not so violent I can't show my kids, they love the super hero aspect.  Very intriguing overall story going on.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I started reading this book I was skeptical, the story takes its time, slowly developing it's characters and in the process binding you them. The pace picks ups and then you're done for. You're hooked.<br />This book is a smart book.  What I mean by that is, at no point do you think to yourself, \\"Now why would he/she do that?\\" Which is often the case in many other books. The characters are realistic and I love that. By the end of the book I was so involved with the characters I could not wait to purchase book 6 and 7.<br />Please read this.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn's Mitch Rapp books just turn out ever more intriguing plots! Vince Flynn spins tales that could have been ripped from today's headlines. The Last Man is an exciting read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really good app ...... I enjoy that the buttons are a decent size on my kindle fire HD and a simplistic flow of the function buttons. PS it's a free app so what more can I say .......... Amazaballz !!!
B0086700CM|3.0|its a lot of fun but its always freezing up and stopping I got the update and it did the same thing.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|This show itself is the best. It may be a little hard to start it, because it doesn't have all modern stuff, but once you've started, you are attached and can't finish before you are done with all episodes. Characters are all different, but facinating. Music in it is amazing and show doesn't have any negative sides.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Def not a legal thriller like the firm. Not a thriller at all. It was an ok read but he has done better.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|My husband was stationed in Korea for a year with the military, and as a birthday present for our daughter, I bought this for him to record for her.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Our students for our private school enjoy reading this book. It has many life lessons and themes. A great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't get enough of the way Sky & Holder connected.  The author did a great job of bringing into focus how to deal with rumors and self-worth and guilt.
B0000001PW|2.0|When comparing with LPs like \\"No Mistery\\" these Elektric Bands sound like \\"elevator music\\". And the eletronic drums with SOUND of eletronic drums is too bad for my ears. I don't like these CD. Sorry Mr. Corea !!!
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was awesome!!! I loved it, awesome action and the battleships had amazing fire power. Great alien movie and we kicked butt. Sorry I did not give this movie a chance when it was in the theaters. But again great movie
B000O78KW4|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase! This is an awesome movie. Thanks!  I will definitely keep it I'm my movie favorites!
B000FC146C|5.0|This is the 2nd reading of this book for, and I loved it just as much as the 1st time. The major characters are very well-developed; they seemed real, and I could feel for all of them. Descriptions are wonderful; I could picture everything.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|EDGE EXTENDED;  ENGAGINGLY  AGGRAVATING ;  I got a noneuclidian head ache  trying to navigate this M C ESCHER Inspired dextarity testing little addiction.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love Diary of a wimpy kid books and I love love stories and they fit great together from Brooke Danna
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|My two favorite authors.  Wish they could write faster - I can't wait for the next book to come out.  Two Graves keeps you waiting to turn the next page.  Three separate stories within a story that comes together at the end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play - works quickly - a good time waster/user<br />It is set up like I do with playing cards on a table.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Portia has over come a lot to finally be able to accept who she is. She has written a very honest book that truly shows how she was feeling and what a wonderful person she is.<br /><br />Portia and Ellen are an amazing couple that deserve all the happiness in the world. I loved the book!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Romantic, suspenseful, realistic, and completely heart warming.  The ending presented a little unexpected twist. I can't wait to see how they transfer it into film form.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|wonderful my dad loves it it was a christmas gift and a toy for him since he isn't able to do much.
B004LUS390|5.0|works great and is easy to use on my phone or tablet.  i use many autocad or autodesk apps and they all work great..
B004GJDQT8|5.0|great game got on tablet for my dad and son they love to play this every day it something to keep them busy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I always was a minecraft fan and minecraft Is Awesome but 1 question, can you play multiplayer with the internet
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a great find. The entire series for a very affordable price. Loved watching the last movie. I recommend this if you are a Harry Potter friend.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|very repitious - lost interest about half way through but okay for the money i guess. it was too short also the play time could gave been much longer.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So much fun and entertainment... my kids love it too... never a dull moment!!!  Ever need a neighbor, pick me!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent read.  I couldn't, put it down . I look forward to the next book. Being forced to write a commentary is ridiculous.
B005HSL626|5.0|The kids love their Fruit Ninja app.  The Kindle fire got passed around a little on Chrsimas day and even Grandma had a blast playing this game.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was one of the most brilliant business minds of our time, his loss was such a tragedy. Great to read about his early life.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|Everything I expected. It was a great action/Syfy. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Worth watching, it will keep you entertained.
B001HC8516|5.0|So tired of having friends &#34;wonder&#34; why guys aren't acting the way they want them to. People when a man loves you, you will know it, it will not be complicated.
B004D2A04M|5.0|I am an Auxiliary Police Officer and use this holster with my Fenix TK-21 and also my SD-168 stun-gun/flashlight combo which is larger. I have used this holster for over 1 year now and found it to be everything I need it to be. The swivel works smoothly and holds in place at every notch setting. I have used it in some extreme duty and it has not shown any fray or wear. I don't understand why some are complaining about this holster. I can only stand up for the Fenix reputation of quality and reliability which, to me, is built into this product.
B005COO1X6|3.0|ok but I wasn't very into the story, actually had to force myself to get through it. Must have been something he wrote after dinner one night, not very filled out.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of the first half of the seventh Harry Potter book. Dividing the book into 2 parts was the only way to tell the whole story and not leave important things out as they did with the 4th book. Buy this Potter fans!!!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|it is so cheap and you can get a demo free so if I were u I would get it it is the best game yet
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Its Disney!!! Whats not to love?! I have almost every Disney animated movie ever made. If you love Disney this is a must have!!!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Very interesting and intense. I could not keep my eyes away from and ended up finishing the book in a matter of hours
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is one of the best book to movie screen adaptations that I have ever seen! I'm always hesitant about watching the movie version of a beloved book series and have been disappointed with several (The Sword of Truth series was butchered!!!). If you have read the books, this will not disappoint! If you haven't read the books and love epics, buy it!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Yes this is what you Want. just get it all ready. it will be doing yourself a favor. also it has derpy.
B0001I561E|5.0|Its Disney!!! Whats not to love?! I have almost every Disney animated movie ever made. If you love Disney this is a must have!!!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|This was a replacement controller for my original Ps3 controller. I was incredibly surprised, I thought it was just a cheap controller but it was amazing! Its very durable and charges in like 2 minutes. The buttons don't get stuck and the shipping was very fast. The best 30 dollars I've ever spent!
B0015AARJI|4.0|It responds well. The analog sticks are accurate. Holds a charge for a long time. Nice rumble functionality. Not five stars because, like all PS3 controllers, the shoulder buttons have a tendency to slip from under your fingers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was one of the most interesting reads in months!  The characters are interesting, the plot unfolds slowly, and there are surprises at the right times.  If I was writing this book I might have spent more time talking about the silo's creation, but I acknowledge that might have become preachy rather than leaving the reader to contemplate the information provided.  I found myself thinking about this book long after finishing it.
0553328255|5.0|i've read all these stories and must say conan doyle knows his stuff. but the snarky holmes drives me crazy with is know-it-all attitude and lack of humility. however, this is a must read and a must have.

B005LAIIPS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and the fact that it expanded on the Treadstone story line, while introducing new characters. I was all set to give it 5 stars until the very end when it was left rather open-ended and clearly inviting another sequel to be made. Still a great movie and well-enjoyed by men and women alike. But I wish that the movie had been more self contained with the bad government guys getting what's coming to them in the end. Guess I'll have to wait for the sequel.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My 7 yr old read it half way through in 1 setting. He loves it and it has apparently lengthen his attention span. So, I love it too!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Not much to say except I love this album. FUN is just now getting the recognition it deserves. Well Done!
B009LREA1S|5.0|Movie was great actually the best batman movie and for a movie that is almost 3 hours long I think 14 dollars are worth it.
B007X3DQGM|4.0|Good book!  Found lots of great ideas and several informative instructions.  Could use a little more picture detail.  Sometimes a picture is worth more than words.
B005544V6A|5.0|this show is incredible and week after week delivers drama, laughs, and intrigue. The ability to watch each episode over and over again is very high.
086571701X|4.0|A great introductory book to start your aquaponic library with.  I wish it had more info on the barrel system.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I like the game.  I wish there was more direction as to how/what to do but I am slowly figuring it out.  There may be a place that has directions, but I haven't found it and honestly haven't looked too hard.  It is addictive though!!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not his usual can't put the book down page turner.  I put this book down quite often.  Found it a struggle to read.
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|This was purchased for a Christmas gift.  The teenage boy who plays both classical and electric guitar was excited to receive this as a gift. Great timely arrival. unfortunately I have no insight of the products functionality.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Pretty typical of other pop science books, but the few points Duhigg made are ultimately useful. It is what it is-- ideal reading for an airplane ride.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this set for a 13 year old girl, she was very excited to get the books.  An enjoyable heart felt story.
B000FC12C8|3.0|Though a little out-dated the basic principles still apply in today's market.  A good read for the average investor who wants to understand what has worked for years..
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I can't stop listening over & over to this album--something I haven't done in a LONG time! Each time I do play it, I like it even more. This music is melodious, dreamy, yet urgent & 'hardcore' in its own way. Kevin Parker is no 'throwback to 60s acid rock,' but I AM reminded of super-early Pink Floyd (only better) when I hear certain of his riffs, as well as the Moody Blues, King Crimson & lots of other acid-rock bands I was too spaced to catch the names of at the time.<br /> Parker's lyrics perfectly match his melodies. He tells you just enough of 'the story' so that you, the listener, can fill in the rest from your own experiences. Then, it becomes YOUR song, too. Sometimes, I just ache as I listen to this album--<br />it is cathartic as heck to know another person has been to these secret places. You realize that it isn't just you. Others have felt these intense emotions, too. It's part of life.<br /> Kevin Parker, aka Tame Impala, is one brave soul & one wildly talented musician! He lets us into his mysterious world fully. I'm 61 years old & I LOVE rock. Still, the last Stones album I ever bought was 'Exile On Main Street.' You just have to move on. How else do you grow? I have always listened to all kinds of music, & I am thrilled that I stumbled onto Tame Impala. It's just a great album that flows perfectly from song to song, taking you for a glorious ride on stacked harmonies within beautiful melodies & deep lyrics. I think everyone should buy this album & play it over & over. You'll love it, too!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The relationships in the book were well developed. I enjoyed the way he intermixed the past into the story. Was a very good book didn't expect the twist at the end.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy my Kindle Cover.  It not only protects the Kindle but makes is easy to spot across the room.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I loved the first one and was not disappointed with this second movie. Action packed, like the first, it definitely holds your interest.
