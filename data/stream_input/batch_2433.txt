B00CDT41RY|5.0|I GAVE THIS MOVIE 5 STARS BECAUSE I LOVED IT!!! ,IT A MIX OF OLD CLINTS SPAGHETTI MOVIES & BLAZZING SADDLES BUT STILL BEING ORIGINAL.ONLY QUINTIN CAN DO THAT.ALL THA ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB  PLAYING THEIR CHARACTOR. WOULD RECOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE THAT LOVE CLINTS WESTERNS
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent is my second David Baldacci book!  I first read The Forgotten. Robbie is a government assassin with a heart, if that is possible! He has extreme talent in all skills, yet truly cares for Julie which is unusual for him. I like the character and will buy The Hit next. Shocking twists and turns as Robie unravels the mystery. Great read that will keep your pulse racing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game and I really enjoy it. There really are no flaws in the quality whatsoever, and it never lags. I love it a lot!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story kept me coming back for more, I was really into it, then the disappointing ending.  Author could have done a better ending.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved this particular season of Downton, if you're into history and romance in early 20th century Britain.  The characters are charming, witting, and very entertaining.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock helps me to wake up. I am a heavy sleeper and it mostly wakes me up. I suggest you get it plus a bonus addition is it is free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome how you can collect stuff and win stuff and do missions and daily missions. Love this game!!
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|I literally stayed up until 4am reading this novel. I could not put it down until I finished. The storyline kept making tiny turns that would just sink me deeper into the story. Definitely not predictable. I highly suggest reading this book!
B00499NHLC|4.0|Good storyline, unpredictable plots, and well wittingly scripted.  I don't recommend watching this right before bed, though.  It may mess with your dreams.
B005N09L5C|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars for the buffering issue. The picture quality was very good. Much better than the first time I saw it.
B007S7U4AY|5.0|Una historia conmovedora que muestra como a veces, sobre todo hace algunos a&ntilde;os, el machismo y las pautas sociales marcaban de manera inexorable la vida de las mujeres y tambi&eacute;n de los hombres que ten&iacute;an que seguir en el rol que la sociedad les impon&iacute;a. Me encant&oacute; la forma de narrar la historia. Recomendable totalmente!!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is so much fun! I have been playing this for 2 weeks and haven't experienced any of this &quot;spying&quot; the other comments are talking about. This game is totally worth it.
1451695195|5.0|This book will keep you reading until you finish it.  It is fascinating and you want to know what happens next. I would recommend it whether you are wanting to know more about near death experiences or just a really good book to read.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|roomate hates when I control my music from far away while he is asleep.  Also great for grabbing files when you really need them.  But the tricks are better.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I have not watched it yet but Im sure its as good as all of the other episodes, I havnt seen any I didnt like
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This is one of the coolest puzzle apps I've played so far. No, it is not your traditional mahjong game. All I can think of was when I first bought my nintendo 3ds system and started messing around w/ the AR card games (which came w/ it). I love games that involve &#34;getting the angle&#34; of things. The touch screen on my samsung galaxy note 10.1 seems to be just the right size for me to comfortably play the game. It is also clever that the designer of the programer made it so you can also select the tiles from the back side (blank side) so you don't have to move around the puzzle all the time. I normally don't go for games that involves racing against time but this one was an aception. Try it out, I dare you.........  :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first I thought this is for kids but boy was I wrong I'm so addicted can't get enough hope you guys have more countries. Soon
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Very fun. I just wish there was more to do while you wait to collect coins and you didn't have to use so many to expand
B003THHIEM|5.0|I just love every one of the episodes, I wish I would have started watching this when it first came out
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I purchased Mahjong Deluxe HD (from the play store) a little over a month ago. This one doesn't have the hokey look of most mahjong apps. The color is great! The graphics is top notch! The music and sound effects are awesome! The options are endless. Playing this game is very relaxing and mahjong is just one of those things I can't live w/ out. There are so many levels to this app and I have yet to scratch the surface of it. I would recommend this to anyone who is a mahjong fanatic like me.
B0000261TE|5.0|Neal Schon is such an amazing guitarist! Love, love this album!  Very soulful!  I can't believe how he can make his guitar sound like a howling wolf.  Crazy cool!
B009HNDSL4|5.0|We love watching this as a family - even though there are definitely some &#34;inappropriate&#34; spots, it's hilarious and the characters really do love each other, so it's not meanspirited.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like I own pc not as good as it but good for road trips I would get  it gets my seal of approval
B004KKX80A|5.0|this is my favorite bey. I love bey blades because they have powerful strength. I need to know if this bey changes modes please tell me when you able to. this is a very cool bey and pegisus is also very cool too I really love this bey.<br />  thanks for shipping this bey to me i'm a girl but I love beys for some reason but thanks.
B00000JQ0E|1.0|I dropped the needle on this record and immediately was thrown off at how bad the mastering is. The balance is totally wrong and the tone is way off. The mids are completely lacking, and the drums are almost totally missing from the mix. Huge disappointment, real shame...especially for a 40 dollar record. Im truly amazed at how bad it sounds. The music is fantastic though, amazing album!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|It is odd to have a book about war to be a feel good story but A Higher Call does so rather well.  Much of the book is told through the eyes of a German pilot so, for me at least, the perspective was an interesting change.  I recommend this book to people who enjoy reading about WW II as well as those looking for a human interest story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My Bible is always with me, and I can find scriptures I need quickly and easily. And I have a daily scripture to read.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I'm telling you people this game is the funnest safari game ever(that I've seen)I wanna play this game forever love love love it tootle loo
B005PTQPU0|4.0|I admit it: I think Kate is the greatest female singer EVER. Look her up on youtube.<br />Music  review is almost impossible so i can only admit I believe she has her own genius.<br />No other singer has her individual stamp. She basically taught herself piano and even won<br />an award for such. When her original recording of Wuthering Heights came out she captured<br />the UK audience of all ages. WH was the first external recording in nature and the first real<br />acted recording. Kate was the first person to think of wearing a microphone.<br />Her beauty was stunning which made her dancing and her own style of dress even more<br />captivating. So try her out. Check out &#34; man with a child in his eyes&#34; which she wrote aged 11.<br />That video alone will help you decide if you desire more.<br />VM
B008ELUEQC|4.0|It was a Christmas gift for my wife and what can I say. She love Rod. Nice to play it around Christmas too.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|Downloaded it, could not open it, said it could not be used with the Kindle  :(  No worries, there are a million other apps
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I have this book on my kindle and have share it with many, It's an amazing story<br /><br />Best of luck to you and your girls..
B003O86FMW|3.0|The book was hard to follow at times. Not as good as the first book, in my honest opinion. Will read the next one though!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game I would recommend it to anyone!!! its worth every penny that it costs!!! each level is new and so so fun
B006LSZECO|4.0|A compelling read, with a lot of unexpected twists and turns. Only problem was I did not really like any of the characters. But I did enjoy the book and story very much
0684857219|5.0|Really live up to its name as the bible of bodybuilding! Guys into bodybuilding should really get one! Love it!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I thought  it could  have ended with both men being safe. Was a,very overall  good story.  Be nice for anyone to read.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Great evening with Bonamassa.  The boy genius has blossomed into a master.  In a nutshell, his eclectic performance was well worth the wait.
B001993Y3G|1.0|I just assumed that it would work when I went to play it. So a few months after I received it,  I opened the package to play the movie.  The disc was unrecognized.  I tried it on other dvd players in my house including my computer dvd player.  No luck.  I've got a non-playable disc.  Amazon's return policy is limited to 30 days so I'm screwed.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I just downloaded this ap and thought it was ok until I read the reviews ... apparently it was much better before the last update.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I mostly check on my PC but once in awhile I'll use it.  It's ok and nice to sit in another room and check my Facebook or when my hubby is on the PC  I can check in the other room if I choose.
B003VVFGWC|5.0|The first season of this show is great, and the second season manages to be just as good as the first! I love this show! The mysteries keep you guessing and the first two season finales are crazy suspenseful, and her attitude is just so awesome! This show is amazing,that's why the movie is still coming out even after being canceled for 6 years.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, very different to what I would normally read. Hugely entertaining! I would recommend this to my friends.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Awesome!Awesome!Awesome!Awesome!Awesome!Awesome!Awesome!Awesome!<br /><br />Well, I guess I should really write why I like it, but...  too many requirements just to say an album is just Awesome!<br /><br />did I meet the minimum number of words yet? :)
B0051MKNV8|4.0|The movie plays great but I received it a day later then what was expected due to them not having my paperwork, or so the tracking information said that's the reason.
B000002KIT|5.0|its great music but its not the live and dangerous released in 77 cause that one had some non live song this one has all live songs its actualy kind of better than the original cause I think some of them weren't released before
B006TF6WAM|4.0|My only grip with this book was that there were a couple of places where the story dragged on a bit. Otherwise and very easy read with some deep messages. It was entertaining and gripping.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is neat because Jeff Kinney well I think he put feelings in the pictures because he did them in expression in the drawing. And I think everyone should read this book.
B0046K6JV4|4.0|Easy listening. I remember a lot of these songs. Loved the music in the 70's when I first heard his<br />music and still enjoy it!
B001IYVUEW|5.0|I love that it beyond a comic story.  It has very strong legendary and epic quality in the film.  Thank you.
B002CMXAYW|5.0|To me, this is the movie that invented the mockumentary. Just love it. The core cast went on to other great films like Best in Show and A Mighty Wind.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Daniel Craig is the epitome of Ian Fleming's OO7; what the character was meant to be. This movie is filled with suspense and action, from beginning to end. Daniel Craig's icy blue eyes lends to the sophisticated, cold demeanor of the character. Dangerous, yet sexy and deseriable.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Installation is a little tricky but directions are easy to follow and the end result is a brighter light with a simple push button operation.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Works perfect and is easy to set up using your gmail account.  The controls are very intuitive, which allow you to control your PC very easily.  For anyone on the go that needs access to a PC remotely, this fits the bill.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Starts slow but this gives time for the characters to develop. A modern classic of the current American psyche. All the characters have dysfunctional behavior but everything turns out okay in the end. The end is especially good, a real tear jerker.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Just an amazing read. I wish I had discovered John Scalzi years ago. His inventiveness, style, and sheer gripping story telling made this a book I could not put down. Now on to the next one!
B0085YAGMA|5.0|this is the british version from 2007. much better than the recent remake. watched with my mother and all had a good laugh
B00881PTRC|4.0|The game is fun, entertaining and efucational. The graphics of the hanging man and the executioner are great. I love to watch thier antics.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The entire series by Stieg Larsson is riveting.  I generally don't enjoy &#34;mass appeal&#34; books so I ignored this one for quite a while when I noticed it was highlighted in all the book stores.  That was dumb.  This -- and its companions in the series -- is a stay-up-all-night-can't-put-the-daggone-book-down-ohhhhh-just-one-more-chapter kind of book!
B00BMT9SQA|4.0|it was not as funny as i thought but had a good message for anyone that has family they don't understand.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This movie was fast moving, and a little bit scary. Quite the twist on Snow White! You WILL enjoy this one....it's a grown up version!! We REALLY enjoyed it. I always get the best DVD's from you folks. Thanks!!
0307887448|5.0|Awesome book for any hardcore gamer.  While I didn't get every reference (there are a LOT) I got the majority so the story was great.  I am really looking forward to Armada!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|it makes you think on several levels. has a good plot. i would not recommend to watch in front of children
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I really do love all the Hobbit and Lord of the Ring movies. I REALLY hate the parts where they put in the SPIDERS!!!! I know it is a part of the story (Just like the Harry Potter movies) But, oh how I HATE SPIDERS!!!! I get the best, when I order from you guys!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is a well-written, emotionally complex, charming and lovely little movie with wonderful performances by the entire cast.  I kept thinking of The Goodbye Girl while I was watching -  a movie that also had incredible chemistry between the lead actors and was an instant classic. David O. Russell is a tremendously talented director. I can't wait to see what he does next.
B00AYLTMMM|2.0|hard to watch and extremely deep. it was more than i bargained for. could have been a bad day will try to watch again
B005LAII0I|5.0|I and my family, as well, really enjoyed this movie. I was impressed on how quickly I received it.  I always look to you guys for all my DVD wants! Thanks!
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This set has every Van Morrison song I wanted and then some, the sound quality is excellent. This is the one to have in the &#34;best of&#34; category.
B0013D89YM|4.0|I really must say I love ELO , but most of the song I can hear on HEART radio , I purchased the music because they had all the songs I know and like  right together ,but imagine my  surprise when altogether group of songs show up on the CD that I was not familiar with after I brought the CD , I wasn't angry ,just felt a little mislead.<br />I just wanted customers to beware of the way Amazon has the CD set up to buy ,I just assumed the set-up ment the songs on the page are the ones on the CD that wasn't the case but I have new music to listen too I'm just glad I love ELO and it wasn't much money ,I must say the sound quality is great ,Amazon is still tops with me YAY!!!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I work for Disney, and I collect the new as well as the older animated DVD's that come out. But I NEVER pay full price! Why? Because Amazon sells them at a lower price. They have speedy service and excellent quality!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This small LED motion-sensitive light works well even in a hallway that is very dimly illuminated, which is great because some similar products require absolute darkness in order to operate properly. Easy to set up & install and throws a decent amount of light. Very good product!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is the best game I ever played better then temple run 2 and subway surfers who ever looks at my coment should already no that they should get this game a not the space taken away from you
B009AMAM9S|5.0|When I try to figure out if I want to watch a movie...based on reviews, I look at one thing, how many stars.  If it's 3 or above, I'll give it a shot.  When people take the time to actually REVIEW a movie, based on their own opinions, I find it hilarious for the most part.  I mean, COME ON PEOPLE!  Reviews are opinions...that's it.  Don't waste your time reading this junk, just go by the POPULARITY, clearly shown via stars.  If you end up hating the movie, move on.  If you like it, WHOO HOO!  Either give lots of stars, or hardly any.  It'll all be revealed in the stars...(see what I did there?).<br /><br />Either way, stop making this review area a big douche-fest.  OMG!  I haven't seen it yet, but Tom Hanks is in it...so it gets 5 stars!  HA!  Suck it.  :)
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I love this series of movies. Having Tom Selleck in them is always a bonus. Great story and witty dialogue.
1568363931|5.0|My favorite recipe is the mini hamburgers. Although sometimes I'll add some extras it always turns out delicious. A wonderful book
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read every book written by  Mary Higgins Clark. I  have not been disappointed.  Can't wait for the next book
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|if u like temple run then this is a good deal for u because this game is exactly like temple run
B00005B36H|5.0|This is my personal favorite Tool album. This is a CD you can just put in and let go. The whole thing is truly amazing.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart...In fact it is severely intense from the first ten minutes of the film all the way to the extremely climatic and shocking end.  But, artististicly, well done with an all star cast who really made this film come alive.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Why are you still reading? Seriously did you not see the subject title? Stop reading this and go watch it!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|It was kind of funny in spots but overall I lost interest in it quickly and was turned off by the sex scenes, foul language to and from children, the 40 year olds were acting more like 18 year olds.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|I have been using reason 6.5 recently, and have recorded several orginal works mainly for purposes of providing demos to musicians that I intend to perform the music with live. I never thought that I would produce music to hand to a listener for simple enjoyment of a good recording.<br /><br />Recently I decided that I wanted to go to a pofessional studio to record something to distribute. I wanted to be able to talk with the engineer in his own language, so i decided to educate myself by reading up on the matter. After reading three different books, I stumbled across this one. I noticed that it had very high ratings from significantly more readers than the previous books. This book was an automated Amazon suggestion. I rented it. Started reading, and it sucked me in.<br /><br />The only downfall to reading this book is that I'm a law student, and i really needed to be reading my law books. I let this book take me away!<br /><br />Any way... Cut to the chase right?!<br />Each chapter gives an assignment, and I decided to actually do these assignments reading the book in order. This is very imoortant if you want to really gain from this book! I chose one of my songs, erased ever plugin and modificatn that I had previously made and went to work using mainly headphones. Will be buying avantone mixcubes soon... After following every suggestion and experimenting where appropriate. I came up with a very good mix!! I WAS AMAZED....<br /><br />I re-recorded all of my audio in a better acoustic environment using mainly household products for treatment. Miced guitar amps and Vox, DI'ed the Bass, used MIDI keyboard parts, and the ReDrum pulggin for drums and purcussion. Any MIDI part was mixed down to audio to save CPU before mixing. After that, I hit the book for instructions.... This is not a recording book.... It is a mixing book. Just remember, get good signal first!<br /><br />So first BALANCE BALANCE BALANCE!!!! He takes a lot of time on this aspect, but for very good reason. Balance first, then worry about the rest. I will save the rest of the details for when you read this book. But I will say that I have learned that I can achieve very professional sounding products now with very little to work with.<br /><br />I use Balance with Reason 6.5, a fender acoustasonic amp (mainly used for its pre-amp out as a DI), a fender power chorus amp, an M-Audio Large diaphram lollypop consenser, a Shure beta 58a, a Shure SM 58, a MIDI controller, and my stringed instruments.... Oh, and lots of time! You must be patient!<br /><br />I am now very comfortable, proud even, to hand my mix over for mastering. I actually mastered one version myself using the MClass mastering suite in Reason 6.5. I let differnt people hear it and compare it to some profession recordings. Most say they assumed I hired out a pro studio. Some have even said that they thought my mix was better made than some of the pro tracks... But that comes down to taste.<br />By the way, it is very important to let other people hear the mix... Don't be bashful, just do it, and get some informed opinions if you can.<br /><br />Much of this does come down to taste, but if you have never read material like this, or had help from someone in the know, and you are trying to record, you probably do not have any idea what you are doing. I recommend this book very highly. It is the fourth book that I've read, and only one that I will likely go back to consistently.<br /><br />THANK YOU SOOO MUCH MIKE SENIOR. I LOVE YOU MAN!!! You saved me tons of money now and for the rest of my life. My music is sounding great now! I now need to learn about mastering in detail.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so fun I have the game. You should get the game and on the computer to.  :) .get the game.<br /> It is so fun !
B009FKZ9AM|5.0|Loved the first CD but didn't warm to this one at all on the first listen but it didn't take long before it had me. The Ramones meet the Bay City Rollers. I now have both albums burned to a single disc and it never leaves the changer in my car.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Plot is decent, not as action packed as I expected it to be.  Tom Cruise is believable in his role.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It seems like I waited forever for it to come out, but it did not disappoint.  I just hate that the series ended.  Robert Jordan is by far my favorite author, and Brandon Sanderson did a great job finishing up the series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like the accuweather for the Kindle fire hd. It has a lot of features that are very useful. It is also very easy to work with.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Since my wife and I became aware we were expecting, we have slowly been buying all the Disney classics and other movies we loved growing up on Blu Ray, and this was a great addition.
B000S1LUE6|5.0|I'm so grateful to have learned how I might love others better (in a way they'd receive it better)! This book is great
B00BJS7104|4.0|Time watching this movie was, in my opinion, well spent.<br />Always have liked Tarantino, as director and also as an actor, even in small roles
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I just click on it to see how it was and I love everything about it but I don't like the part where the little man runs and runs and I don't have any control on him. It happen every time I miiss doing the other part of the game. I would recommend it for everyone over the age of 3. It it so intertaining and when we go some place in the car my grandchildren are busy playing the game and not bothering us.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Spectacular book! Eric Ries balances theory with experience to produce an inspiring way to run startups in today's world. Great advice and examples, written in an entertaining way. I love the term \\"vanity metrics\\", very appropriate and unfortunately so common in most companies! I have always had ideas about beginning a startup and now I have what I need for kick off and, most important, I know how to apply validated learning in the process.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy takes you into a world of war that you probably hadn't considered.  I know I had not thought of it and how it is waged and the possible consequences of that war.  I hope we have our people in the world that are fighting this war for us in the USA as told about in this book.  Couldn't put it down.  The story behind the headlines in today's news.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|After purchasing and returning three cases, I ordered this one.  I like it for all the reasons that the other reviews state.  I especially like it because it is a rigid back case that doesn't fall over when I put it on my pillow on my stomach when I am reading in bed.  I am keeping this case.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|I installed this yesterday on my sg2 and on my desktop. It slowed down my desktop dramatically and crashed my phone. Never got past the set up.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This film struck me as a hollow (hence my review title) Oscar vehicle meant to appeal to those who have never truly dealt with people in positions in which they may benefit from their complete lack of morals. A lot to digest in one sentence? So is the naivete engaged in by the writers of this loose, wholly unrealistic film. Unfortunately, a good performance by Washington was wasted because some Hollywood writer who was obviously out of ideas, felt the need to make the character an abusive, selfish heel rather than giving his character other conflicts.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Washington plays a narcotics-addled alcoholic airlines pilot who (after getting completely pissed & coked-up the previous night) manages to crash-land a mechanically-deficient airplane in a heroic act. That is the high point for Washington's character. As the movie progresses, you'll see his character devolve into a verbally abusive, soused, completely unappreciative (of friends and family alike) ___hole who is hailed by the media as a hero until questions arise as to his blood-alcohol level immediately after his rescue. To save time (and I'm not exaggerating) Washington's character spends the next one hour and thirty minutes in a beer and drug-induced stupor which spans literally right up to his tribunal before the FAA.<br /><br />The kicker? The reason why spineless syndicated reviewers hailed this weakly-conceived film as \\"Powerful?\\" Just as he is about to go scot-free despite being three-sheets-into-the-wind AND freshly revved on cocaine (AT the hearing, mind you), Washington's character decides to come clean and tell the truth that he was on a coke binge the previous evening before the fateful flight. That's right. His character - after almost 2 hours of repetitive unredeeming character flaws - decides to FINALLY tell the world that he was drunk AND high while piloting the airplane.<br /><br />Did a child write this movie? This was nothing more than typical Hollywood candy-coating and extremely weak, amateurish writing. Think of the ambitious, upper management types in your life. When faced with the option of: A) getting away with a heinous crime and being hailed as a hero, or B) admitting wrong doing when they don't have to and then going to prison - which do you think an ambitious person would choose. I pointed out \\"ambitious\\" people because make no mistake, had Washington's character simply lied, he would have been lauded as a hero and easily could have coasted into retirement on a book and movie deal. But, he chose prison instead? Yeah, okay.remely weak, amateurish writing. Think of the ambitious, upper management types in your life.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Got this set as an intro into the Dexter series, got hooked, & have been fans ever since. Looking forward to this coming season (which is supposed to be the last one).
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my visiting Grandaughter.  The quality was excellent, just like being at a concert.  She playted this DVD so much until I learned the words.  I ordered it before her visit and received it before the arrived.  This is a true gift to any teenage girl.
B006MPKAOI|3.0|This mystery/thriller novel gives insight into what it must be like to life with OCD. Apart from some glaring 'convenient' moments to move the plot along, and bizarre behaviour from the protagonists' friends, this story had some real suspense. I enjoyed the construct of the parallel timelines versus standard chronological storytelling, and couldn't wait for the resolution of both.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|They used violence and a well known and respected actor to sell this movie. I just do not recommend this movie.
B000O59AFW|5.0|Came on time and was in good shape. The only thing wrong is I dont have time to sit here and write about every transac tion so this is the last one.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|I had not seen this since it was in theaters! My kid had never seen it, so we had movie night at the ranch. Anthony Perkins' portrayal as Norman Bates was spot-on psychopathic nut-job good. Since we are watching the new &#34;Bates Motel&#34; on the telly, I thought we should get some reference points to help add to the enjoyment. Well played, Anthony!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Truly all the hits! Had the cd at some point and loaned it out. It was never returned and I've missed it. So great to have it again!
B003UESJEM|5.0|Who has it, who doesn't. I've been laid off twice. Restructuring was the phrase they used. It was then that I learned what real friends are-hint-you probably won't find them on Facebook or Twitter. You learn how important family is and you realize, if you've been stupid enough to forget, what a blessing a loving wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend or &#34;significant other&#34; is.  You also learn about values in this movie. You may already know and appreciate these things before you see this movie, but, it doesn't hurt to be reminded.
B009ICQ6KO|2.0|Loved Ben Harper's &#34;White Lies for Dark Times&#34;, but this is nothing close to that. The songs are slow and downbeat, way too much for my tastes. I'll try another one of his and see if it improves. You might like this, but I would sample it first, if possible.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting.  Interesting story lines.  Good flow.  Keeps my interest.  I'm invested in the characters and story line. It's good adult drama.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book really kept my interest all the way through. I like the way the past and present are woven together to tell the story and the writing is sharp enough to keep you guessing at the answer to the mystery all the way through. I won't give anything away (I wish that were true of all reviews!) so I will just say that I found the answer to the mystery to be clever. However, it isn't an ending that makes me feel like the author cheated, like some mysteries do. Very well done!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|not sure how I have missed this series all these years but looking forward to catching up through season 5
B0084670FU|5.0|Brad Pitt's best performance since Fight Club. Kind of a Pulp Fiction like timeline. It all comes together in the end. Great movie.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Characters just keep on giving us some fabulous one-liners.. the creativity and genius is amazing!  Hope this show goes on and on!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game and I really like it . My friends do to we play it all the time and we get so excited that we could run around the world 2,000'times . But only if we are playing. That is what I think about subway surfers.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good variety of characters and I liked the fact that the older actors didn't steel the scenes. The ending leaves you hanging and hoping for a sequel.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Very entertaining. Puts some interesting thoughts about politics and the personal bias that our governmental officials have always had.<br /><br />It is a shame that our current politicians are paid to behave as poorly as they do. It would be nice to roll the laws back and have volunteer politicians instead of our over paid brood.  At least then their behavior would make sense.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Love this movie.  It's funny and not PC.  If you're an uptight person that gets offended easily, this is not the movie for you.  Not suitable for kids.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I'm a Tommy Lee Jones fan and this part suited him perfectly. Good characters and plenty of suspense. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed this book alot and  learned  what different flowers  mean. I could really relate to the characters. A very good book.
B0031RG846|3.0|it was ok for the price, nothing outstanding.<br />she liked it so all is well in our house.<br />beware of the unicorn apocalypse !
B004KBSQOW|5.0|This is wonderful music!  I love this unique rendition of Somewhere over the rainbow.  Iz was a very talented musician.
0817439390|4.0|This was an excellent book for beginners.  It's also a great book for the more experienced.  It is useless for a pro or advanced amateur photographer.  The author gives a very easy to understand method for getting the correct \\"creative\\" exposure on any camera. He explains the three most important aspects and how to use them.  They are ISO, aperture and shutter.  He explains white balance. He explains the use of the flash.  He tells you how to meter. He really helps get you out of using the \\"Auto\\" mode.<br /><br />I already knew that a smaller aperture yields a larger depth of field and vice versa, but the author made me much more comfortable knowing which aperture to use in which situation.  He explains what he calls the 'who cares' aperture settings of f/8 and f/11 and when you do want to use the and why.<br /><br />It really is an excellent book for understanding exposure, which is at the heart of a good photograph.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give it five stars is because there were some things that were glossed over and some things that were not as well explained as I thought they could be.  Mind you, they were mostly minor.<br /><br />For instance, I think he could have explained a little bit about the appropriate lens to use in different situations.  He does do this a little, but I think it would have been nice if he had used different lenses in the same situation and compared the photographs as he did with white balance and F-stop.  As an example, I've been having a problem shooting people moving about in an indoor venue.  Going with a prime focus (not a zoom) lens with a lower F-stop would help this situation.  Sure it won't cure the problem.  Sometimes, you just don't have the light to do what you want, but he didn't even mention this.  I think he could have had a whole section just for lenses.<br /><br />It seemed that nearly all of his shots were done with a tri-pod.  There was a brief explanation of what to look for in a tri-pod, but I think he couldhave been more in depth with that.  Yes, it's not directly related to exposure, but considering his heavy use of the tri-pod, I think it would have fit into the topic.<br /><br />He mentioned that he thought the histogram was highly overrated and said nothing more about it.  I will have to seek that information elsewhere.<br /><br />He does explain a bit about HDR photography.  This stands for high dynamic range and involves combining multiple photographs of the same subject at different settings to yield a single photograph with more detail or special properties that cannot be achieved with a single photo.  During this discussion, he mentioned using bracketing on the camera.  I've heard of that but I have no idea what that means.  I was hoping that would be something he would explain.<br /><br />He explains a little about how he gets extreme depth of field for landscape shots.  He says something like this, \\"I set my aperture to f/22, my lens to 35mm, meter on the sky to get the appropriate shutter speed.  Then, in manual, I focus on my foot and shoot using that focus.  It will be blurry in the viewfinder but everything from about 2 feet in front of me to infinity will be in focus after I take the photo.\\"  I like this because I had no idea that the viewfinder could be out of focus, but the picture would be in focus.  I also like that he shows how to get a very high depth of field.  This technique is called hyperfocus.  He never mentions that term, but in theory, if you set your aperture differently or use a different lens setting, the focus would be different than his foot.  You might have to focus 10 feet away.  If you look up hyperfocus photography online, you will find charts and even phone apps that will tell you how far out to focus with different settings.  Maybe it's not that important.  I don't know because I don't have a lot of experience with this, but I think it was a missed opportunity for him to go into a little more detail.  I was paraphrasing above, by the bye.<br /><br />Every photo has information about how the photo was taken.  I think he did a great job with this, but I do wish he would put all of the information for every photo.  Every photo had the focal length, shutter speed and aperture, but he usually only included the ISO when he was discussing ISO.  It would have been nice to have it on every photo.  In fact, I would have liked to see what camera he used and some details about the lens, too.<br /><br />As some others have mentioned, the humor was a little odd.  I agree with this, but it's not so odd as to be creepy or anything and at least he tried to lighten the subject.  I'm all for that.<br /><br />I would like to emphasize that my complaints are minor and that the author does a great job of really getting into exposure.<br /><br />The most important thing to know about this book is that it is called \\"Understanding Exposure,\\" not \\"How to use your camera,\\" not \\"How to take a picture.\\"  It's all about getting the proper exposure so don't expect any detail on purchasing decisions, specific set-ups (shooting cars, shooting babies, underwater photography, etc.).  There are no diagrams in this book only photos.  Some of them are truly stunning and he gives loads of information to help you produce similar photos.  I highly recommend this book.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Less electro pop rock than past albums, good story telling and overall good sound. Its like a slightly more grown up killers.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game!  It never requires you to buy anything and your able to play everyday!  Loved it on facenook and so happy its available for the kindle fire now!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|The story and cinematography are excellent....truly enjoyed the movie. Jeremy Iron, Liam Neeson and Robert DiNero  made a great ensemble cast
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very insightful, practical and convincing. I learnt a great deal from it. Looking forward to other works by the author.
B009AMANH4|2.0|I had high hopes for this but this was more boring than the worst history class you've ever had. I made it about 75 minutes in and had to call it. I would have liked to see Lincoln's early childhood and life and a lot less of the politics. I HATE politics with a PASSION! There Will Be Blood and Gangs of New York blow this out of the water.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway suffers is a fun game good for any age. I love to play it when ever I have time, it's a good way to wind down after a long week full of craziness.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game, its so addicting! The graphics are great and love that it gives you objectives to complete.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Pretty fun game. Love that you can send gifts to friends of enough free games to play a lot. Also love interaction with Facebook friends.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is the best album I have listened to in a long time. Smart lyrics, great beats, and a conscience!
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Loved the continued story of something borrowed. I hope they make a movie of<br />this book as well<br /><br />  I would recommend this book
B006A9JFGU|5.0|Another great transaction.  A classic hit by the Rolling Stones.Another nice addition to my ever expanding CD collection.Sounds better with age.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was beyond amazing, the twist and turns in this book, the connections, the sadness, the love. This book was a surprise, everything Colleen writes is gold, I should not have been surprised. I love Holder, could he be anymore sexy and sweet. His tattoo says it all, and how he not only helps her heal but needs her just as much. I can only imagine what Colleen has in store for us readers with this book in Holden's point of view, can't wait to read it. This is a must read, it is a hard, emotional roller coaster of a ride but it is so worth it and it is a book you will be calling your friends about and remembering for days later.
B005L38QK2|5.0|This mouse works great at a moderate price.  It also matches my favorite computer game, Diablo III.  I love it!
B003W77SAS|5.0|This music brings back great memories of seeing ELO live.Saw the on this tour also ! Never disappointed with ELO on stage.Great transaction
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is cool but it would be much better to walk where you like.It would also be cool if you play multiplayer and if the suits were less expensive.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|I found this processor to be ok with normal every day computing and internet usage. If you enjoy a nice quiet and cool chip you will be satisfied with this and baby!
B0043RGXJS|5.0|Michael Buble never fails to deliver! I  could listen to anything he sings and be happy. Crazy  love  equals great music!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Very fun kept me busy for hours, best game of this type of seen so far<br />And best of all its free
B0064W65UM|1.0|Excellent story by Moore, terrible awful Kindle interface for the graphic novel that ignores layout and panels, and how people read comics. Do not buy the Kindle version. I was forced to re-purchase from Apple iBooks to get a decent interface that gave some flexibility. Same with WATCHMEN, another great story by Alan Moore.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Every person in this movie lived up to expectations. The movie had action packed to the very end and it made almost everything bring you to tears and a smile to down right laughter. I loved every second of every clip of this movie.
B0028ER4PK|5.0|When I opened the box and took the record out of the sleeve my jaw hit the floor, this album MUST be listened to on Vinyl format all the way through, this record is obviously a classic but the sound of the vinyl version is so much more clean and sound quality more crisp than the cd or mp3 versions, so much infact that I recorded each side from my record player to a USB stick and edited each song on my PC and saved them as MP3 for my iPod. the album sleeve is as impressive as the album itself. its a brown rounded corners sleeve with a clear plastic picture of the band printed on the plastic and the yellow paper that covers the record comes out. MUST HAVE for true Doors fans and rock lovers period!
B00014X8KO|5.0|MEMORIES employs different styles that complement each other on the disc. Great Japanese animation while avoiding the typical Anime look. The themes and concepts are well-thought out and reflect a point-of-view clearly post World War II that is well-aware of the consequences of War.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|This movie had some big names and gave the impression that there would be some action added into the story. this movie might as well be written for the SOAPS on TV..yuck!!!! I got tricked into thinking something would develop.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|First time we saw this, we thought &#34;Feh. Another Disney suffering-parent film. Bambi's mom, Simba's dad.&#34;<br /><br />Then we tried it again - and started seeing the Pixar subversion. And the chess game!<br /><br />Chess game? Well, since making &#34;Alice in Wonderland,&#34; haven't we always wondered about &#34;Through The Looking Glass?&#34;<br /><br />Here it is: brave girl with long red hair, going through a portal, riding a horse and making knight-like leaps, assisted by three little pawns, all trying to protect the queen, sort of backed by an overly-enthusiastic king, - and then, when the board goes bad, the queen, with all her terrible powers, moves into battle and uses brain over brawn.<br /><br />And what about that tattoo'd boy? The one who wants to make his own love choices, fights like a girl (sorry about the stereotype), and focuses on another of the boys. Hey! I'm not the one giving all the background characters personalities - and it wouldn't be the first time Pixar slipped things under the notice of Disney.
B000SEJHRA|3.0|Good book. A series of entertaining stories that don't really follow each other nonetheless it's interesting and fun to read.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This movie set out to do exactly what was promised. The actors were great and the whole movie right down to the last word. Loved this Movie all The way.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|When we saw this back in the '70's, we were like everybody else, including the '70's - WTF?<br /><br />Having developed into hopeless movie geeks, we now see this as a seminal film. So much film and television today is made with the taste of American Graffiti.<br /><br />A classic, and always worth another watch.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Another fantastic addition to the series!  Martin does an excellent job at providing unexpected twists and turns to keep you hanging on!
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Barbara stressed me out, and Seth Rogan's a nut job. The combination of the two make for a less than delightful evening in this nagging psuedo-craptacular shoot-me-in-the-face-fest.
B009AMANBA|4.0|We got to see this amazing film in a small theater, crammed with an excited, politically-aware audience. Gorgeous. Hilarious. Moving. Wonderful acting. And every character actor and actress they could get their mitts on. From &#34;True Grit&#34; to &#34;Boston Legal,&#34; they're all here - especially James Spader, who grabs hold of the movie and never lets go.He is something to see.<br /><br />Sally Fields as Mary Todd Lincoln - let's just say we give her the Imaginary Oscar. She is intense. And of course Todd was tough - look who she was married to. Neither one of 'em was a wimp. Lewis and Fields play the couple well.<br /><br />Look! Lincoln used email to run his administration! That is, he spent all his time in the telegraph room.<br /><br />They even found a blue roan - if a small one - to play Lee's &#34;Traveler.<br /><br />BUT - it' s too dark for a TV screen, so it doesn't work so well as a DVD. No matter. We'll still be watching it again and again.<br /><br />And we agree with the New Yorker reviewer - Spielberg never has known when to end a movie. You'll see what we mean. And learn to hit the &#34;stop&#34; button at that scene.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Relatively good intertainment with good plots. The writers have good plots. Sometimes, to much skin and sex which distracts from the plot.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love movies with a strong fearless female lead.  The cinematography was awesome. The storyline was easy to follow and the characters had depth.
B000002GY9|5.0|I had a former boyfriend who was insistent on listening to this record every day - so, I got used to it. The imagery was interesting & unusually put, in some circumstances, but I rather enjoyed it. BF & I parted ways a long time ago, but I still like the recording & listen to it from time to time.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I love, love, love this album! From beginning to end, it is true Fall Out Boy, with its intricate musical nuances and classic Patrick Stump lyricism. Can't stop listening!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie is really cute, entertaining, and clever.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is and really enjoyed watching it.
B007REW8DO|1.0|My only issue is that the actual CD, has no cover or film. So it is indistinguishable which side is the top side. From quick Google searches, I don't believe this to be the indent of the artist, so I just got a bizarre mistake from the manufacturer.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a good story.  It isn't a page turner but very entertaining.  The reader's relationship with the book's characters grows as the story unfolds, somewhat like real life friendships develop.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Everything an action movie should be including a great plot, not just a bunch of action.  RDJ is the bomb.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|Kang's book reminds us not to forget those unfortunates locked away by their own govt for the desire for basic human rights..or who just happen to be related to someone who desires them. Great read. I recommend it.
B001ANYDAO|2.0|While the concept is intriguing and some interesting facts are revealed, the the author is long winded in some areas.  For example, during the chapter on cultural differences corresponding to plane crashes, though interesting to a degree, I found myself repeatedly checking to see how many pages were left in the chapter.<br /><br />If you've looking for inspiration on how to become an outlier, look elsewhere. The book actually paints a picture of the opposite. I was left feeling that I am at the mercy of fate and that the stars must all magically align, rather than feeling inspired to change my own actions to be a stand out in the world.
B00B935SUY|4.0|Very nicely done documentary about the Sound City Music studio. It really helped you understand how hard the performers had to work at their craft back before computers.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|Like most Wheel of Time fans, I've followed the series eagerly awaiting the conclusion for a number of years, through all the endless tugging of braids, smoothing of skirts, the dragging pace of the series in the middle, et cetera.  Brandon Sanderson has done a wonderful job of writing the final installment and I found it a riveting read.  There are certain parts which are definite favourites (Egwene, for example) and parts which feel a little glossed over.  Some may complain the ending was a little too neat and contrived (i.e. you could see certain things coming a mile away) but overall I was pretty satisfied.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It took a while the get my attention but by the end I was jumping at every noise.
B00AO3K05S|4.0|This book contains useful practical advice on selling. It is relevant, current and easy to follow. Good advice if you're new to selling or just need a fresh perspective
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Not for kids or a date, but a great movie. They don't make them like this anymore. A classic movie if ever there was one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I picked up w/this DVD thinking it was going to be a piece of cake...even kind of chuckled thru the workout.<br />Finished and felt very invigorated.  Woke up the next day and could NOT walk.  My thighs felt like 2 huge pieces of bruised meat! Not to mention my aching pecs and arms....Jillian totally kicked my ass in under 30 minutes.  And I love her for it.  I have done it now every day for a week and I can feel the difference in my body.  I will continue to do this for 30 days...and then move onto some other JM videos...this woman knows her physiology.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|This was my initial impression after the first two episodes: \\"Part of the time I love this show. Part of the time the theatrics bore me. They are trying too hard to impress, but forget that first and foremost we need to fall in love with the characters.\\" BUT, then I bought into the fantasy. I still think it's predictable, but it is not ordinary. Prepare to be disgusted and amused all at the same time.
B007URCTOG|5.0|Good romantic movie.  Love both actors and the chemistry was great.  Sweet and romantic and not overly cheesy.  Recommend for an evening in
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|The bottom line is, it's simple and it works!  Been on this plan for 3.5 weeks and have already lost 6 lbs.  The Fast Days are not very difficult and seemingly get easier each week.  The best aspects of the &#34;Diet&#34; are not the weight loss but the metabolic markers such as blood glucose, IGF-I, blood pressure, BMI and, astonishingly, NGF (Neurotrophic Growth Factors)!  I'm
B00787IR2Q|5.0|This is a classic!  It's super fun and lets children use their imagination to explore our world at only an inch tall!  A favorite!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is great, there are so many dragons. It's kinda like Viva Pinata, which I also love. It's time consuming which is good for when you wanna kill time or take your mind off your annoying day. There are so many things to do, decorate, build habitats, breed for dragons, buy islands &amp; feed you dragons. There is also a race track where you can win prizes. Just when you think your done, a new dragon comes out or decorations to add to your dragon park. It's fun to compete with family &amp; friends. You do have to buy coins, gems or food for your dragons to progress faster... but that's kinda cheating. The more you decorate, the more dragons you have &amp; the more islands you have equals more $$$$. Great fun!!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My daughter saw this movie 3 times in the theater and has watched the DVD 2 times in the past 10 days
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved this book.  It made me think and offered a wealth of solid information as well as a compassionate viewpoint from the person with Alzheimer's disease.  I offered to read it for my book club, then lead our discussion of the book.  I didn't expect to LOVE the book but I did.  I highly recommend this book.  Warning:  If you're over 50, you will immediately ask yourself, \\"Do I have this?\\"  Every one of our club members tells me she was asking herself that!  So we can't ALL have it!  But this book has left me much more compassionate toward my mother-in-law who is in early-stage Alzheimer's.  And I relived the 12 years my grandmother lived through the disease as well.  All of our members liked the book - I believe all but one loved it.  Buy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game that really brings attention to me.I love it and I think that you should like it too.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if Matt Damon had been in it but great action made up for a poor and often confusing plot.  Fast moving, fun and definitely worth the watch!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I enjoyed the hell out of this movie. Yeah it is a very slow film, but I can totally dismiss that. After all it is a drama about a president.<br />Most people kind of find these types of movies boring, and that's understandable. I actually went through the same thing with \\"The Pianist.\\"<br />I caught that on TV one day and that movie started out slow as well. I was so close to changing the channel but something told me to<br />hang on and stick with it. I'm sooooo glad I did. \\"The Pianist\\" was a great film. So I kind of had the same experience with \\"Lincoln.\\"<br />It's just one of those movies you have to give your undivided attention to. But if people still didn't like it or found it boring then that's fine. No judgment. We're all different and have different tastes in films. But I really enjoyed this film and will be buying it soon. Good day... :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am happy to say that 0.7.0 is coming out later this week they are supposed to add a whole bunch of cool stuff like severs and buckets<br />I am really looking forward to it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm new at games ; and this is perfect for me . I enjoy getting gems and collecting coins. The challenges are so much fun to reach.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hard to put down!<br />Have to know what will happen next, lots of sleepless nights! Must get the next one now!
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Lets start off by saying I do not care for rap, I actually went in to buy & download Three songs &#34;Same Love&#34;, &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; & &#34;BomBom&#34; but Amazon was having such a killer special price on the whole album that it did not make sense to buy one or two songs when the entire album was so cheap...fast forward, I am loving the entire album and there is only one song I do not like &#34;My oh my&#34; how is that for a strange turn of events...anyway, I have Bose speakers in my car, I like to crank this up and enjoy the beat and the bass...as an older man, I have to say I get odd looks when I stop at a traffic light but, hey you are only as young as you feel :-).
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it gives kids a challenge of fun and excitement. brain feels awesome playing this app. i absolutely love this app. thanks amazon.com
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|Even better than I remembered! I had it on vinyl, but I had to sell my collection to move into a smaller apartment. Now, with new speakers it is a great experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.... It is awesome...[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]  i thought this game was fun. I think you will to.
B000E5KUK6|5.0|I have always watched this on TV when it aired.  I finally brought the movie and continue to watch it over and over again.  I've always wondered if they ever came out with a Part 2 to this movie?  Does anyone know?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|FIRST of all...TO ALL THE READERS WHO MIGHT be checking out this book for the first time--jump to the beginning of the reviews and read those first, so you can get an equal review of both good and bad. Recently, this author has been hammered by very bad reviews which really baffles me...anyway.<br /><br />It was a great great read! I don't give a 5-star rating very often, but I was sucked in by from the first page to the end of the trilogy. LOVED IT! I've read them numerous times. Wow!!--We have a few haters out there, concerning this book! There were a few good points that other readers have made about this book, like Ana using \\"Oh, my!\\" a lot. Okay, I'll give them that. It was kinda over-kill. And there was the mention on a few posts that she 'came' on demand and had never 'touched herself'. Yeah, that may have been a bit of a stretch--(no pun intended). But all the other stuff that was said against the writer and her book with such anger...meh. WHAT EV! IT'S FICTION!!!<br /><br />Having said that, the characters were awesome. The book was a quick read. It was hot! It was intense! It was sexy as hell! And if a woman is going to dream...DREAM BIG! Which is exactly what this book brought out(at least to me). Christian, the strong, ambitious, closed-off guy, meets Ana, cute, shy, and adorable. Their relationship really builds fast and Ms. James writes the emotion Ana is feeling SO WELL!! When her heart aches, so does yours. When she's giddy, so are you. When she's on fire...so are you. I cannot say enough 'awesome' about this trilogy, one I will keep probably forever. If you're into the type of book(series), keep an open mind and give it a chance. I believe you'll enjoy it as I sure did!! THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE FROM IT, so it's got to have some appeal...A LOT of appeal!!
0425252868|5.0|This was an outstanding book to read. Very well done of a time<br />in history. Made very real and believable.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I  reading for the second time and I am still absolutely mesmerized by the beautiful imagery in this book.  It reminds me of my favorite Ray Bradbury book, Something Wicked This Way Comes. Thank you Erin for writing this book!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Not as weak as the last part but not as good as the first one. Repetition of phrases and scenes. Unhealthy relationship of two young people living outside reality. As a whole trillogy it reminds me of the Twilight saga (which was more interesting for me). Simple plot and language.<br />Good for relaxation.<br />I would recommend it to readers who feel the need or curiosity to know how the first part continues. But why is it called &#34;Darker&#34;? I really do not know.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Okay this app Is a hit for my little one. Some folks freak over permissions,I have seen worst on other apps.this is a cute game that has stages and power ups earned in the game and not with real money.
B0031RS8UI|4.0|Witty, good humor, easy to read, funny scenes, entertaining language and plot.<br />I would recommend it to all women who want to relax and have some fun during reading.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is exciting from beginning to end! It may be a little far-fetched but still an exciting read. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice and exciting fantasy to read about.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|The weakest part of the trilogy, sometimes too sweet (romantic). Repetition of phrases, especially during sex scenes - reading of which becomes quite boring. Predictable actions of the main characters who are both showing unhealthy dependance on each other. Their life is far away from reality. The ending is also overhappy.<br />The book reads easy and well, the plot is quite simple.<br />I would recommend it to those who do not expect much from the plot nad the language, to those who want to relax and do not want to think much during reading.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is a great show that really keeps you riveted to your seat. The writing and acting our awesome. I just hope this doesn't end up in a who shot JR type ending - it was all just a dream.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|This move have Been one of my favorite moves sincen I was a child. I know that is not for child but onece I was a child I did love to play that I was a cop and to know that are corrupts cops I didn't like that. And Hannibal is a bad person that make a \\"good service to te community\\" that actually kind of weard.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|interesting personalities interwoven with two or more plots exemplifying the character of the &#34;upstairs&#34; and the &#34;downstairs&#34; with some history intertwined.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This app allows you to really analyze what the math equation and solutions are. The the beauty if it is that you can make changes or even undo your mistake at anytime.
B003M6WERG|3.0|The wife and I laugh all the way through these shows. However they run $30 - $40 per season, which is very expensive.<br /><br />Since I bought this Netflix has released them on DVD, so I switched to that to catch up with the series.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This app is good for everyone in the sense that it has different categories and if you do not find any you could create your own list. As a teacher, i use it boost up my students confidence. I use it for all subjects. I create a list and children play.  Yes i have then thinking in the subject or topic we are learning but it helps students to concentrate.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Intriguing look at the history of a man raised by nuns and priests in Ireland - very well written - very emotional!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|its okay i guess but there is nothing to do. really hard to get money and u have to pay for everything
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is the best game on the planet because every year they cange were it is at so it will not be boring and they give new carecters for good prices.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and why not? It would be hard to find a better cast and the story was great. I was surprised to find that the song &#34;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&#34; by Gene Pitney wasn't part of the movie. I thought it would be the theme song.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Great looking, very comfortable to carry, and it protects my Kindle well.<br />The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because when it's flipped out in stand up mode,<br />the screen doesn't quite tip back far enough to read comfortably.<br />Besides that, it's a great product.
B001DTTG16|5.0|I hadn't seen it in a long time. I forgot how good it was. Loved the music. Super dancing as well.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|It you upgraded your Mac like I did then I definitely recommend repurposing your old adapter with this little gadget.  It uses the existing magnet so you can't even tell it is not part of the main unit.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love this book a lot kids should reed it its fun to read i love this book till i was 7 years old
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love this show i recommend it!! Very addictive to watch!!Great story line and awesome actors and actresses!!! Cant wait to move on to season 2!!
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Couageous is a celebration of fatherhood.  It offers several situations of fathers.  The story is based on Christian principals which is very refreshing.  It is touching but a little cheesy.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|I'm a big fan of Disney and musicals. Some people can't stand this movie(probably the fact its a kids musical) but I actually enjoy it. The dances scenes are amazing and make you wish you can get up and dance around like the characters (well at least I feel that way). The ending to a great franchise.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This movie has it all!  It is historically correct depicting trench warfare and the use of gas.  It really teaches the audience more about World War I. The stunts are amazing especially the one where the horse jumps over the tank and the part where the horse becomes entangled in barb wire.  But most important it is the heart warming story of Joey the gorgeous horse.  Joey is portrayed by a truely gifted animal.  He owns the screen.  When I first watched War Horse I expect a tear jerker but is surprisingly up beat.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Informative , great story , to short of a book, to many acknowledges . To be raid by someone going to health difficulties
B0057VDGNK|5.0|Love to drive to this soundtrack. Good mix of vocal and instrumental tracks with an 80's vibe. I recommend it.
B00APAENUI|5.0|I re-read this series every 2 years or so, and each time, it makes more sense both as a series and as an education about what's right and what's wrong. There are very few grey areas, and this series just reminds me of that over and over.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Started watching this on my iPad while I workout & now I'm completely hooked! I'm not usually a courtroom drama fan either. Highly recommend this series!
B009NOVCSS|5.0|NOTE: THIS APPLIES TO THE HUMONGOUS FIVE-CD SUPER-DELUXE BOX VERSION OF GRRR: I finally bought this set this week, having found a (relatively) inexpensive sealed copy (around $100) at a local music store. On the plus side, ABKCO has done wonderful work on the sound, upgrading and tweaking and generally improving on the work that was done for the SACD-hybrid remasterings on the 1960s Rolling Stones catalog a decade ago. Yes, there are edited versions of a handful of songs, but it's not as though anyone likely to care deeply about that isn't almost certainly going to have the uncut versions of everything here somewhere in this collection (let's face it, anyone dropping $100+ on this set is on the fanatical side of the word \\"fan\\" to begin with, so let's stop kidding ourselves with histrionic complaints). What the makers have done is create the best sounding renditions of a lot of the material here that have surfaced so far -- the guitars, the bass, the keyboards, the drums . . . they often feel like they're in the room with you, even the acoustic instruments on the opening of \\"Not Fade Away,\\" recorded all those decades ago (you can feel the action of the guitar strings -- the same with the opening of \\"Salt of the Earth,\\" six years later on the next disc. And if there are omissions, then it is perhaps the absence of true rarities such as \\"C-cksucker Blues\\" (which I advocated for inclusion on THE SINGLES COLLECTION when I worked on that 20+ years ago) or the live \\"Let It Rock\\" from 1970, which was actually released on a limited basis (and of course, the latter is the property of the Stones' own label).<br /><br />And for this listener, whose interest in the band drops off precipitously (it downright plummets) after EXILE ON MAIN STREET, the third and fourth discs are pretty much all I'll ever need on this band in terms of that end of their catalog. Yes, it would have been nice if ABKCO could have gotten a real tape source on the IBC demos, but at least they set the precedent of issuing those long bootlegged sides (for some of us the first unauthorized Stones sides we ever heard) legitimately (and might we see more like that?). And the song line-up, though not exactly chronological, makes for a downright intoxicating 4 hours-plus of listening.<br /><br />That's the good part. The bad part is the packaging, which is -- as is often the case with sets like this -- difficult to store or use as intended. The box is too big to fit on any size shelf that most of use are likely to have in our homes. And opening it and accessing the CDs is an awkward, stumbling process (it's probably best to put them in separate jewel cases on a regular shelf, separate from the box). On my copy, discs one and two had come out of their holders, but the packaging was designed in such a way so that they had no place to go or get damaged, so that was okay (the makers of the Layla Anniversary set from 2011 should only have been so smart).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and fun and you can visit different places and go on world tours like right now I'm in Tokyo!
B00C3N9O9K|5.0|The combo of Richard Thompson and Buddy Miller is just stellar. The choice of songs and the guitar work are some of the best from Richard in years.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|An 'OK' film but lacking the 'punch' of the previous Guy Ritchie movie.  That said, I'd like to see a 3rd effort by Ritchie, Downey Jr, and Law.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|This is a fine and original sounding new Deep Purple.  Don Airey's third release with the band finally sees him shining - the keyboards are very prominent in the mix and he does some nice organ work (there's even a bit of synth, something which Purple hasn't utilized a lot, except maybe in the Coverdale days).  The overall sound is very polished and easy on the ear, but the band still rocks quite a bit - I was worried this album would be too mellow (the first track released on the website is a ballad, other reviewers have complained it doesn't rock, and the first two minutes of the album are really mellow).  But, overall it's a good, rocking album - not a riff-fest like \\"Abandon\\" or \\"In Rock\\", but kind of the diverse-but-rocking style of \\"Purpendicular\\".  Although recognizably Deep Purple (modern Deep Purple, that is, they haven't sounded like the early 70s since - well, the early 70s!), this album definitely has it's own new sound, again like \\"Purpendicular\\", the band has given us something new and interesting.<br />  I can maybe see what the band means by it being \\"in the spirit of classic Deep Purple\\" (particularly the diverse Fireball album), but don't expect it to SOUND LIKE the \\"Machine Head\\" era.  I mean it's jammy, melodic, hard-rocking music, so it's alike in that way . . .<br />  For something new and Deep Purplish, this is very rewarding.
B00C4SUEJI|3.0|If Kiss Each Other Clean wasn't your cup of tea, then this is in the same ballpark, but it's not nearly as much overload. In fact there are some great songs here. \\"Sundown\\" is really great. The whole enterprise feels like AM gold, in a good way. It's worth a listen and might have a lot of summer evening re-play this year.<br /><br />I don't think this album will be as divisive as Kiss Each Other Clean. For some fans, Sam Beam could put together a 257-piece band and people would say it was the greatest thing ever because Beam is \\"branching out,\\" and then rip on others who have a different opinion. Meanwhile, others who just want another lo-fi solo acoustic album could be disappointed again.<br /><br />What boggles the mind is why the latter isn't okay. Fans have been turning away from musicians for years with one simple statement: \\"I prefer the earlier stuff.\\" People said it about Dylan, The Beatles, R.E.M., The Stones, etc. People have said it about virtually every act that went through a dramatic, mid-career shift in sound. Why isn't it okay to state a preference?<br /><br />For I&W, if you say something like that, you incur the wrath and judgment of fanboys galore. You're uncultured and uncool if you say that about I&W. Only \\"real fans\\" listen to the new stuff. Right. But it's a fanboy badge of honor to say that about virtually any other band that puts out a couple lo-fi albums to start and then hits it big with a later record? Come on.<br /><br />A LOT of people take umbrage at the apparent disregard this guy has for fans that have been there since the beginning. I saw him on the KEOC tour and it was a mess. There were so many musicians on the stage at the same time, some were standing behind the PA system and you couldn't see them. People in the audience were booing and visibly frustrated. All the while, Beam was in the front, arms in the air like some preacher at a revival, or maybe thinking he was George Clinton or something, not really looking back at the size of his band or connecting with his audience. He seemed oblivious, or he just didn't care. Mostly, it was ridiculous. If he could've gotten 20 more musicians on the stage, I'm convinced he would've done it.<br /><br />People did not become I&W fans because of his ability to put together a massive band and put on a P-Funk show. People got on board because his songs were spare and light and beautiful. He drifted far away from that. If Fugazi or the Pixies or Spoon or Wilco brought 20 more musicians on stage with them with horns and strings and xylophones and jaw harps and jugs and sitars and banjos and dulcimers and pedal steels and toilet seats and plastic buckets, their fans would say the same thing. Less is more.<br /><br />At the show, my friend said, \\"I'm all for this guy going in new directions, but it looks like he's forgotten why he got famous. If he just played one or two songs solo acoustic, I'd be happy, but he's not even doing that. He can't even throw his longtime fans a bone?\\" It was off-putting, willful disregard. He seemed to have forgotten a huge chunk of his fan base. Even Dylan occasionally plays a more sparsely arranged song, or rearranges a classic in a new and interesting way that doesn't sound like a horrible mess. Dylan even did two late-career solo acoustic albums, did an unplugged show, etc. Beam isn't in the same class as Dylan, but throwing your longtime fans a bone isn't difficult. It's a kind and generous nod to those whose attention got you where you are now.<br /><br />So yeah, some people prefer his earlier stuff and might not like this one. That's okay. But it's not nearly as chaotic as Kiss Each Other Clean, so if you're one of the \\"uncool\\" who prefer the early stuff, it's still worth a listen to decide.<br /><br /> Just don't listen to the judgmental folks who can't deal with you saying, \\"I prefer the early stuff.\\"e of his band or connecting with his audience. He seemed oblivious, or he just didn't care. Mostly, it was ridiculous. If he could've gotten 20 more musicians on the stage, I'm convinced he would've done it.<br /><br />People did not become I&W fans because of his ability to put together a massive band and put on a P-Funk show.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a very interesting Series of books , Great story, Sorry it had to come To an end. Easy read and I enjoyed reading it on my iPad! Guess now I can watch the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So far subway surf is one of the best games I've ever played. It is really fun. I play this game ever day every chance I get. On a scale of ten I give it a ten.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a story about one of the orphan trains that went thru Minnesota from New York.  It is a beautiful story about our history.  It makes me think how lucky we grew up in this generation.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I like the stories, the acting and that I can retrieve them on my I-Pad.  I do love the program.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I really like Bon Jovi and was excited that he put out a new CD of music.<br />The price was right and having it delivered to my house is great. no need to go to the store and deal with all that nonsense.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I wish that there are a lot of seasons for The Good Wife.  I love the whole concept of the program and I love the actors as well.
B001DHXT20|4.0|I like it, it dove-tails in with rest of the 'Avenger' movies... with of course the ability to stand on it's own.
0800141601|1.0|I love this movie, but I was completely dissapointed when I unwrapped and opened the apparently new DVD box. I was the given the correct DVD. The box said the First Knight, but I did not receive the movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|You can step up throught the levels, or go back & repeat any that you didn't do so well on.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great for kids. My grandkids love this game a lot its a little hard to control but they get the hang of it
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's cute & I can imagine a younger neice or nephew really enjoying it!  But for the moment, I have removed from my device to cloud storage.
B00C6TUXN2|5.0|Who would have thunk it. (if you had not heard the other two albums of jazz he did) Very good album!!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Great place to make notes, journals, projects, etc. It's great that you can customize each one for a different purpose.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|Watched a 60 minutes interview with Glen, he is his music. His calm and graceful demeanor comes across in his music he must be a wonderful lover.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's challenging and I really like the incentives when the country<br />changes and there's way more characters in the game, so it's fun<br />to play!!! You should play it too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002HWUU1I|5.0|My title reveals it all. Look into this wonderful singer/song writer, words most of us can relate too would love to see him in concert.
0802130208|4.0|This book offers a quick trip to New Orleans and the opportunity to meet one of its most colorful denizens. Ignatius Reilly and the slightly tattered Belle of the mississippi Crescent are a perfect match.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The cats is evolving and changing, not stale. The new characters are great. Hope to see the next season deliver as well.
B0073QNIH6|5.0|IGreat service and fantastic item!! I am a fan of SCHLEICH prehistoric figures and am not always able to find them in this area. YHANKYOU once again.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of my favorite shows.  Well written, well acted, and definitely right on target where human interactions & dynamics are at the forefront.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci is one of my favorite writers. His books are always superb!  I've read them all and look forward to the next one.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|What can I add to the comments of thousands of Walking Dead lovers?  It's absolutely awesome.  Especially the first season.  I had never watched it on AMC the past few years, and finally decided to catch up, as I was left out of conversations due to my lack of viewing experience. So I watched the whole DVD in one day.  I love the characters - even the annoying ones - (Andrea, you know who I'm talking about....and Dale, once in a while you expound too much....Lori, I'm reserving my opinion of you - it can go either way...)  and the whole premise of the show.  With Dexter coming to an end, I hope The Walking Dead will fill the void in the next couple of years.  TV basically is stale.  I hate &#34;reality&#34; shows.  Ditto for the news media.  Give me the escapism of The Walking Dead any day......action all the way.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|i can't wait to start watching this first season i actually started watching it in the middle of the second season i also purchased the second season so that i can catch up...
B00CL0J99K|4.0|You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this movie!<br /><br />First off, I will admit to being a total Shane Black fangirl, having enjoyed his other work immensely, so I was giddy when I found out he was hired to direct.<br /><br />I must say, I think he did a great job and for those that are familiar with his other work, you'll notice just seconds in that this is definitely \\"A Shane Black Movie\\". Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than that of it's predecessors, but in my opinion it's a very welcome change. I've seen some reviews say that they disliked the fact that the story had such a dark tone and that it felt too emotional for a superhero flick. I understand where that crowd is coming from. Heavy storylines and superheroes seem to be almost an oxymoron. Usually, the plot for a comic book movie is pretty linear: (Solely my opinion) There's a hero/and/or heroes, a conflict/villain, said villain then causes destruction and the hero(es) face impossible odds but then figure out a way to save the day and the movie ends on a high note.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is *not* that movie. In fact, I think I enjoyed the third installment that much more because of it's emotion and darker storyline. I enjoyed seeing Tony shattered and desperate, doubting himself, waging an internal war with himself in the wake of the events seen in \\"The Avengers\\".Even though it's a movie intended to entertain, I think by showing the audience a vulnerable Tony Stark, it let's them know that even \\"superheroes\\" struggle with everyday problems like everybody else.<br /><br />Besides, we see him struggle with personal issues, guilt and self-doubt all the time in the comics, I found it refreshing that they chose to deal with Tony's anxiety and nightmares directly rather than, presenting the problem, kind of dealing with said problem and then either sweeping it under the rug or forgetting that they put it in the script altogether like they did with Iron Man 2.<br /><br />Now, that doesn'tmean the movie is exquisitely perfect. There are plenty of plotholes too and in my opinion, the use of flashbacks really mess up the whole cinematic timeline of Iron Man as we know him and that was the only thing that *really* bothered me. Also, the movie essentially takes several storylines from Iron Man's history and puts them altogether. I'll admit, that's not what I was expecting. I thought the plot would focus more on the Extremis virus than it did, but I didn't mind at all. I think that's one of the main gripes that people have with it. When they said Extremis, I think everyone expected something very similar to Warren Ellis' beautifully written comic.<br /><br />Another thing that will rub some people the wrong way, especially if you're a die-hard comics purist, is the fact that there's a pretty big twist involving The Mandarin. This is another common gripe I've been seeing on various sites. I personally didn't mind it, but judge for yourself.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was a really fun, entertaining movie and a great way to get the summer started! If you're willing to keep an open mind, silence that little voice in your head that screams \\"inconsistency!\\" or \\"Plothole!\\" every time something differs from the comic and just have fun and enjoy yourself, Iron Man 3 definitely satisfies!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the whole series.  Book 3 summed it all up.  It helps you realize that everyone is not always as they seem.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love it as so much that I am ready for premium. Don't know why premium is soooooooooo expensive. I wish I had premium...<br /><br />Otherwise this is a great game!!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|It is like the same author who wrote the 50 shades trilogy also wrote this one under a pseudonym. Either that or they took they same steamy novel recipe classes.The story lines are so similar. Trouble is I will probably read the last one to see if the author changes her recipe. I live in hope.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing who ever plays it will love like that who ever made it I love you thank you<br /><br />Caden
B00BCX2F66|4.0|Bought this to protect my new shiny phone and though it's a bit of a pity to cover the gorgeous bodywork of the One, this does the job well.<br /><br />The screen is totally unobscured and all of the external ports/buttons are not affected.<br /><br />The materials used make it nice to hold and use, as well as looking good!<br /><br />The build quality can't quite match up to the phone itself however and some minor niggles such as a lack of a proper fold seam at the back hinge lets it down a little. It would have been nice for the notifications lights to have been visible too.<br /><br />The stand function works really well though and overall I'm pleased I got this case compared to a plain bumper style one.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|_big of the movie this just like all the games like it. it takes money to play at a faster pace or weeks and days to do the smallest thing. but the graphics are nice and it kind of has a calming feel watching the fish swim around. bottum line if you like these type of games then this a nice change plus you might learn something.<br />I.u
B008XG1X18|5.0|best resource for artists ideas and inspirations on the interent. never have to worry about going through folders or loosing your hard drive. as an artist i love it.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|The storyline is not a predictable one, but the stereotype of Wall Street greed is well-portrayed as quick snapshots into the minds and motivation of the various main characters provide their reasoning for work at a Wall Street firm. The Firm's executive management is faced with a decision to save itself while ruining its reputation with its counterparties on the Street or face its demise due to its own desire to &quot;beat the market&quot;. If you are curious about how Wall Street really works and makes decisions from day-to-day, then this is a must-watch.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Very impressed with this series. I was somewhat hesitant being a Anthony Hopkins HL fan, but Mads Mikklesen is extraordinary as Hannibal. This is a top notch series, and I am looking forward to season 2.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I want to petition for the screenplay to be written immediately! I can see several actors in the starring roles already!<br /><br />This is Sophie at her comic best! Hysterical, sweet, bumbling, twisted and just a delight!<br /><br />More! I want more!!
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|NEVER EVER WILL I DOWNLOAD THIS APP BECAUSE THE COMPANY STALKS YOU. AND THE APP ISN'T EVEN FREE. if a company wants photos of your self and the apps you have up that means that they want to stalk you. anybody who rated it over 1star probably didn't know about the companies stalking habits.
B007RI56NY|5.0|I love Train.  There is not a song on the CD that I do not like.  I really enjoy it
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Seeing this as it was on the stage, is so far  superior to the film.<br />The music was beyond gorgeous, and not to ruin it for anyone, but at the end, there is a wonderful surprise.<br />  Alfie Boe delivers as no one else can!<br />  It was beyond wonderful!<br /><br />  So far, I watch my dvd 2x a day.....and am not tired of it yet!
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Extremely well acted, beautifully filmed. Of course, I am a huge Jane Austen fan. I've seen this film at least 3 times. It's perfect for an afternoon diversion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it helps you with hand eye coordination. It can challenge u in multiple ways. Try it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The size of this calculator makes it easy to read, easy to enter on the keyboard, and easy on the pocketbook, too.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book is a very harsh look at a poor family, but lots of funny moments, too. The writer's memories are of his struggling mother, his alcoholic father, siblings, school, and the Catholic church. It's a miracle that they survived. This book is a fairly easy read and I clipped right along with it. It's the first book I've read on my Kindle and I really enjoyed it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this for almost all my daily tasks when lining up all my ducks. Anything I need to remember such as my grocery list, appointments, or a word or a name I need to put to memory;  this is my sidekick for just such purposes.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The Shield is good. The reason i ded not rate it &#34;Five Stars Great&#34; is because of my love for NYPD Blue; which I watched last year in it's entirety on Amazon Prime Videos.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love this game but there are a few bugs.  The biggest one is that sometimes puzzle pieces or the whole puzzle disappears.  It is an easy fix though.  I just go to the main screen and continue my puzzle.  I didn't discover that until I restarted a ton of puzzles though.  There are a lot of free puzzles so you don't have to worry about running out and having to spend money to continue using the application.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A great classic story that everyone should read at least once.  This story really fills in the missing pieces from the famous movie.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It was fun at first, but it really gets old quick.  It is the same thing over and over.  It's okay if there is nothing else to do, but I wouldn't call it addicting.
B005T87QCI|3.0|My kids love it and so I would have given it 5 stars if not for a very big problem: the in app purchases do not work as advertised. One of my kids decided to buy a character pack for $5 and it said it would be available on all devices connected to account. This was not true - it was only available on the device the purchase was made on. Then the game was accidentally removed from his Kindle and when re-installed, there was no way of getting the upgrade back. Amazon came to the rescue and refunded the upgrade so I could repurchase it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The movie was good enough to watch more than once. The production aspects were top notch and the story was good when it followed the book. The parts that were added were not bad just not needed. I look forward to the next part of the series.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I had a different case, I like this one better.  The folding part that lets you watch sideways works better than my previous cover and the price was great for me too cause I had a amazon deal to get it 50 percent off.
0783225903|4.0|There were parts of the movie I had not seen before they must have been edited out for TV. The movie was funny and sad but I will watch it again when I get it back from the friend I lent it to.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really like the first book but I like this one better.  Can't wait for the 3rd one I already preordered it.
B004FN1T3A|1.0|Kindle edition has no way to access the CD and it refers to the classes constantly. Dissatisfied with this version. If there was access to the CD or mp 3 I'd be ok with this purchase.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Got the second one and preordered the 3rd.  I don't preorder books very often.  If you liked 50 shades then you will enjoy this series too.  Maybe even more.
B002A9OJ0Q|3.0|Living in the states, its been harder and harder to keep up with A-ha.  Luckily Amazon still gives me the chance.<br /><br />I didn't get to preview this album and bought it simply off reviews.  Maybe that built my expectation a little too high.<br /><br />Two things stuck out to me on this album.  There is a lack of dynamics and a lack of the top notch hooks that I'm used to in A-ha's music.  Usually I can look through the titles of songs and hear the song in my head instantly.  This album just doesn't have that kind of glue.<br /><br />That said, I kept it in my car CD player for weeks to see if I just wasn't giving it a chance.  I did start to find some tracks that stuck out.<br /><br />The Bandstand is probably my favorite song on the album.  In fact, its why the CD stayed in my player as long as it did, because every time the CD started over, I found myself enjoying this song again.  I find the funky bass synth in the background really adds to the enjoyment of the song...as well as the melodic twists and turns that A-ha is known for.  This one will most likely stay in my \\"best of A-ha\\" collection.<br /><br />From there the album seems to lose some edge.  Riding The Crest is good, but not memorable.  What It Is started to find the skip button for me.  Foot of the Mountain has a hook, but for some reason, I just don't get excited about it.  Real Meaning usually gets skipped.<br /><br />Shadowside has more of that melodic lyric that I know and love.  This song will probably stick with me a bit too, but I don't go out of my way to listen to it.<br /><br />From there, the album seems like filler tracks.<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled...Lifeline and Minor Earth Major Sky had some great memorable tracks and so did Morten's solo stuff (I haven't bought Analogue yet). They all seemed to make me think I would continue to love anything that A-ha put out.  But this seemed like an obligation album, not one with a lot of heart and soul buried in it.  This and Scoundrel Days will probably be the only two albums in my A-ha collection that don't get a lot of play.  Everything else is brilliant.<br /><br />Add this to your collection if you want some good music and love that A-ha sound...but I wouldn't put this as a \\"must have.\\"ays will probably be the only two albums in my A-ha collection that don't get a lot of play.  Everything else is brilliant.<br /><br />Add this to your collection if you want some good music and love that A-ha sound...but I wouldn't put this as a \\"must have.\\"
B002BWP49M|5.0|The product was definitely brand new and I was very happy with the price. I bought it because I wanted to complete the series. It also shipped faster than I thought it would.
B00CFOGCAG|4.0|For some reason ever time I start over my saved game starts over...<br />Can't wait for that to be fixed. Could be an isolated problem, though.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Tons of blood and fighting, and an interesting look into how vikings live from day to day.  Also a very cool religion.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|loved the photos, I wish for another book with even MORE photographs. the only thing missing is some writing from lady gaga for each pic.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, a little short but good thinking fun. When is the next one coming out. Can't wait to play it.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|Its entertaining, but it does not rate 5 stars.  I like the acting; each regular character adds some depth to the plot.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I am just getting into this one and finding it different from any puzzles I've done before.<br />I love mysteries and this is definitely one.<br />Will recommend it to those I know who enjoy puzzles.<br /><br />My rating may upgrade when I learn how to do this better.  Right now I'm stumped.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Having read the Hobbit and the accompanying trilogy, I really wanted this film to be outstanding.  In some ways, it was - the props (including Bilbo's home) was quite realistically portrayed in the film.  The blue-glowing mini sword, and the golum character, and many other scenes were fun to watch.  But some of my favorite events in 'the Hobbit' were downplayed or ignored, and I didn't like that.  The film was not as good as the book, I'm sorry to say.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I like puzzles of any kind and this was something new for me.  Usually do word games & puzzles but this one is fun!
B005RZ8WIA|5.0|My 19 year old son just introduced me to this band a little over 2 months ago when I heard &#34;Warriors Call&#34; on a local rock station, I have since bought 3 of their cd's, with this being the 3rd. Let me say I am not normally one to like live music releases because they more often than not, sound bad. That definitely does not apply here! This is simply the best live performance I have ever heard!! And the lead singers voice is amazing! This is a MUST OWN!!
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game,  I like the different categories to choose from.  Having been an elementary school teacher I used this format for classroom games - especially spelling drills.  All ages will enjoy this if they like to play word games.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Excellent watch for everyday usage.<br /><br />My first watch that I wear everywhere I go.<br /><br />Very comfortable and convenient.<br /><br />Extremely accurate.<br /><br />I love the fact that I do not need to constantly get distracted by my phone by checking the time. A quick look to my watch and problem solved.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast moving couldn't put it down routing for all the characters I can't wait to see what happens between the three would be lovers

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app.  I think it is really cool. I think it. could be better if they had free coins though.:-)
1476734941|5.0|I do not find this hard to follow at all. I can have yogurt, grapefruit and crackers for brunch and then a large salad with a small amount of chicken or albacore tuna with a little fat free dressing for dinner and still stay under 500 calories.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This was a great book to read how ever needs a funny book to read this is perfect for you
B001NEI96O|3.0|I have to imagine that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews were from people with an existing interest in the story or Philippe.  I found this story interesting, but not riveting and not &#34;the best documentary ever&#34;.  It was slow and could have been done in half the time.  But if you are a Philippe Petit groupie, then you'll love it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This has left me as speechless as the first book. I can't wait for the third to come out. If Maxon doesn't choose America I will be very disappointed.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I found myself holding my breath in the water scenes.  It was very touching to see how compassionate they were even though they faced their own tragedy.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|Will consider the book to read, great information.  Also, it give you insight on a personal level of habit and more.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game to play. Easy purchase and download from Amazon. Gives enough of power-ups, gives you enough time to check all four cards. Great chat room!

B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|It's a perfect  flight book, and has the potential to be an enjoyable movie.<br />I found the end of the book a little bit forced.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I haven't actually bought this item, yet.<br /><br />But maybe I should.<br /><br />It's in my \\"recommendations,\\" from Amazon, which is why I clicked on it. I was looking through the apps to see what might be recommended for me and saw this and it caught my eye and I thought \\"I'll take a closer look at that,\\" and then realized that whatever algorithm had decided, based on my past browsing history, had been on the right path.  Maybe I will buy this thing, maybe I will not, but something out there guessed that this thing might be something I'd like, and that thing-out-there was close enough that this was the ONLY app I clicked on, and it was on the third screen.  I scrolled past maybe twenty other things before pausing and clicking on this.<br /><br />I wonder what made me stop?<br /><br />And was it what the system, or should I say The System, thought would make me stop?<br /><br />There is a link below the app that says I can click it to see why this was recommended.  I clicked it, and then did not read it, because I wanted to work on the mystery that is me.<br /><br />\\"The unexamined life is not worth living,\\" said Thoreau, or maybe Emerson.  It probably matters less who said it than that I remember the saying, and it matters more that I put the saying to work than that I remember it, although it would be hard to use the thought without consciously remembering it.  Hard, but not impossible: I could examine my life (making it worth living) without remembering that a dead Brahmin thought lives should be examined to make them worth living.<br /><br />Let me unpack my life and see whence came this desire to click on, and perhaps buy, Cubistry, the App.<br /><br />It is colorful, that picture, hinting at three dimensions and hinting, too, at more dimensions -- those little cubes within the larger cube all suggesting colors and patterns and something cosmic, but not in a dark way.  The patterns are too childlike, too bright, to be darkly cosmic, to suggest meaning beyond humor or fun -- but yet they do have a mysterious feel.<br /><br />I am drawn to the froglike man, or manlike frog, in the upper left corner, too small to identify, but I have made it human, or humanoid, almost as if Cubistry has a hieroglpyhic message, but one that -- because of the bright colors -- would almost certainly turn out to be a humorous joke, like a birthday card from aliens in a distant past.<br /><br />Then, too, there are the multiple dots in there, suggesting dice from simpler games.  Perhaps a bit of nostalgia, remembering playing board games as a child, rolling dice and moving pieces, tiny Roman-numeral armies marching across the Ukraine and Kamchatka in Risk, mortgaged properties in Monopoly, games more of chance than strategy, but they felt strategic to us.  Perhaps it was that which made me pause on this.<br /><br />One reviewer I saw mentioned Rubik's Cube, and this certainly suggests that.  I suppose that for people of a certain age, every cube suggests Rubik's Cube, now, so prevalent was Rubik's Cube in the 1980s.  People who were too old to be affected by Rubik's Cube, or too young, will not know the strange sensation of always, always, always, equating the word \\"cube\\" with a toy that turned out to be a trick.<br /><br />Because it was a trick, remember: the idea behind the Rubik's Cube, for people like me, who were kids when it came out, was that it could be 'solved,' that a by twisting and turning and analyzing and more turning, one could solve the cube, returning it to its natural state.<br /><br />But that was not so.<br /><br />It could not be \\"solved,\\" like a mystery.  It had to instead be solved like MATH -- there was a pattern, and when you twisted the cube in the pattern, it was solved, regardless of how mixed up it had been, or who was doing the turning.  A robot, a blind man, my cousin Joe -- any of them could \\"solve\\" Rubik's Cube, learning how to do so the way I learned to do math: not understanding, no insight, just rote application of rules.  That is how I got through Algebra, and Geometry, and how I almost got through Calculus, but I didn't -- I got a D-minus, and I dropped the class and went into law, instead, defeated by math that could not be simply applied, but had to be understood.<br /><br />Now, 26 years later, I understand that math is not mechanics, the way Rubik's Cube was.  Math is not simply systems into which go numbers and out of which come other numbers.  Math is a language, a concept, a way to understand the universe, and I look back at an earlier me and think \\"If he had understood that, if he had KNOWN, would he have stuck with math and science, and would he now be able to understand the mysteries I only grasp at?\\"<br /><br />He might.  I cannot go back and know.  Instead, I look at math and want to learn, and try to learn, but the building blocks are not there.  It's like knowing that something is written in code and knowing that there is a way to solve that code, but not being able, quite, to do so.<br /><br />That is math, for me, and that was what I imagined the Rubik's Cube to be, as a kid: a secret language, a glimpse into knowledge, a test of mental skill.<br /><br />Imagine my disappointment to learn it was just a trick!<br /><br />Perhaps that is what drew me to this cube, then: the wonder of whether this, too, is a trick or if instead it would be a way inside, a way back to the beginning, a way to go and learn the necessary things that would allow me, now, to look at the world of mathematics, the world that can be opened by understading those sublimely abstract concepts, and not just to look, to gawk like an outsider at the zoo, but to UNDERSTAND them, and make use of them.<br /><br />As it is, I still do math, the old mechanical way: I calculate, in my mind, how many miles to the gallon I am getting, how many minutes it will take me to get home if I go 70 miles per hour as opposed to 60, how many times in a day I could listen to a song if I did nothing but that.  And when I do those things, I feel as though I am standing outside a house, and inside the house wondrous things are happening, but all I can see are flashes of light from the window and the occasional puff of smoke, glittery and full of exotic odors, out the chimney.<br /><br />Maybe I'll buy this.<br /><br />Maybe.<br /><br />But I know one thing.<br /><br />I'm not going to go see why it was recommended for me.  Because I like what I came up with, better.<br /><br />I give this item five stars.ation of rules.

B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Perennial comic relief Ivan is the story here. And a good story it is. Though, to some extent it's a wrapping up of many plot lines complete with cameos by many old bit players, the story holds up and brings pleasure. What more can one ask?

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Before buying the ATR-3350, I thought &#34;lav mics&#34; were all expensive, and not necessarily providing good sound.  Definitely not the case, at least with the ART-3350.<br /><br />I use this mic to record people speaking for video presentations, or for teaching or training or promotional videos.  The sound is not &#34;professional,&#34; I'm sure (not that I would know the difference), but it is really good.  And certainly MUCH better than the recorder on my digital camera.<br /><br />I find the Microphone clip to be a bit &#34;fiddly,&#34; and have to mess around with it to get it attached securely.  I have no idea how long the batteries last, because I didn't want to run out of batteries in the middle of recording something so if I were in any doubt about how much power the battery had remaining, I would use a new batter.  For the cost of the those small batteries, I just bought a 5-pack or 10 pack and kept them with the microphone.<br /><br />I also read in the reviews about the mic draining the battery after some period of non-use.  (which COULD have been &#34;operator error&#34; from the user not switching the battery to the &#34;off&#34; position after using it.)  I went one step further, as suggested by another reviewer, and turned the battery upside down inside the lav mic case after using it.  That reminded me to turn the mic &#34;off,&#34; but didn't actually matter if I had turned it off or left it on, because the battery was in upside down and didn't drain the battery.<br /><br />I used this lav mi with a Zoom H1 Handy Portable Digital Recorder, and it worked just great.<br /><br />This is an excellent, cost-effective lav mic, and a great place to start with lav mics.

B00AA0U046|3.0|I really enjoyed 'Valleys of Neptune' and was hoping for material of that kind of quality.  As you can probably tell by many of the other reviews, this one falls short of the mark.  While any Hendrix is good Hendrix and it's interesting to here the variations, this one probably would have been sufficient to pick up on MP3, and not have sprung for the vinyl.  The minutiae of which version of which piece of which track was recorded on which date is kind of amusing to me...  I'm okay with knowing who's on the recordings, the origin of the song, personally I don't need a breakdown of each of the 24 tracks in every single song particularly when the pedigree is as .. uh.. somewhat lackluster as some of these.  Reminds me of the Hendrix biography that is about half verbal descriptions of the solos from the albums.  Just kind of overkill to me but I am glad that the overdubbed stuff from Crash Landing & Midnight Lightning have been released without the b@stardization.<br /><br />I do agree that this seems more fitting of a 'Dagger Records' alternate take release as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.  If you're a going for a copy of everything ever released featuring Jimi than you'll want this one.  Otherwise you might wait and hold out for a used copy of the CD, cause there will be people selling this one back.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I read a lot of books dealing with abuse, sad lives, etc. The further into the book I got the sicker the relationship became and both seemed so sick to me. For some reason as I read it it became clear I wanted to just quit reading it and toss it out. Would not recommend to anyone. I told my daughter she could take my Kindle and read it when I finished. Now I would tell her don't bother.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fifty shades is a little less crude. The characters are developed well enough, but again Fifty is that much better. Having said that, I've read both this one and the next in the Trilogy, Reflected in you, and I've pre-ordered the next one coming out in June, 2013. I can't wait to see what happens with Gideon and Eva. :)
B0089LOG02|4.0|A good book that left you with one question after you finished......why? Without spoiling the story that is the one question I had, Ms Kline is a good writer but she leaves you feeling like there is more to the story than she is telling you . I would give her a B .....read her and see if you feel the same way.

B003UBTX6S|3.0|I kept finding myself comparing it to Twilight. The similarities bothered me. Otherwise, it was on okay read. The rest of the series gets better.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|First of all I have to admit that I'm a huge fan of good musicals, and not-so-good musicals (except Mamma Mia which was a step too far, even for me). Pitch Perfect is definitely not perfect. In fact many of the jokes fall flat and some of the humour is questionable, but overall I really enjoyed this movie!    When I started watching it my expectations were pretty low. After a s*** day at work I needed a pick-me-up and was ready to forgive a lot of its sins if the music was good. The music is very good, and the audtion sequence with Kelly Clarkson's Since You've Been Gone is gold. Another stand-out scene is the improvised rif- off between the rival acapella groups. In a lot of ways this is Glee / High School Musical type of film, but at the same time it pushes the boundaries in a really clever way that will not alienate fans. It's both a parody and a tribute.    What elevated it for me was that some of the humour comes straight out of left-field and is completely unexpected. Most of the characters are weird and over-the-top, but they work, and Rebel Wilson's deadpan delivery of her lines is one of the highlights of the films (although I am getting sick of seeing her play exactly the same role in every movie she's in. Makes me wonder if she has any range beyond the funny fat chick). Anna Kendrick was perfect in the lead role and Skylar Astin is great too. (he's way too young for me to perve on but what a cutie).    The only sour note was the depiction of the predatory lesbian character who takes any opportunity to grope women. In this day and age it's disappointing that homosexuality is even an issue. The vomit scenes were pretty disgusting, but the scene were the women are all struggling to get away from Aubrey as she blows chunks is like something straight out of a horror movie. It's very funny, at least for a few seconds, but the \\"vomit angel\\" took it a bit too far. Both my husband and I agreed that the Treblemaker's performance at the end was actually better thanthe Bella's, but this is a mnor thing. Do I recommend this film? Most definitely woth a look.

B00BSBY38A|3.0|I'm not sure what all the fuss was about this movie. It's premise is ridiculous, and whatever mystical/theological connections are meant to be interpreted by the viewer are simply not there in my opinion. I assume the book was much better.
1574216988|4.0|A VERY EASY BOOK T \O FOLLOW .  EASY TO UNDERSTAND DIRECTIONS.  ILLUSTRATIONS ARE VERY WELL DONE.<br />BEST BOOK SO FAR.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Cheap, but better than cheap that I have gotten in typical convenience, grocery, or department stores. Serves purpose at work, but gets abused at home.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This was a great movie and I'm glad I watched it. $4.99 for an instant rental is kind of steep though.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This review may be a little biased  OK it may may be a LOT biased.  I am a Cirque du Soleiloholic.  I love Love LOVE them, all of them, cannot get enough of them.  I have the DVD Box set and I have seen all the shows in vegas, some multiple times.  The reason THIS dvd is so wonderful is that it covers ALL the Las Vegas Shows (well not Zarkana as it took over from Elvis and was not on when the Movie was Filmed)  and as NONE of the Vegas Shows are on DVD it is a real TREAT to watch them again.  They have managed to get some of the BEST acts from the various shows  and weave them into a simple story.  The 3 D effects make the whole thing seem real  although even without 3 D this is a wonderful wonderful film  ESP if you have children.  It is a MUST view for anyone who loves to be amazed by the incredible tenacity, endurance and skills that some people have.  And the things they can train their body to do.  I am always completely mesmerized by the artist and performers.  This DVD is AWESOME  rent/ buy/ enjoy.
B00AO2TREY|5.0|I found out about Hurts a couple of years ago listening to their single Stay.  Their new album is more of the techno euro sounds like older Depeche Mode.  It is worth a listen.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|The singer has a great voice, which made him stand out among the rest. Also it is easy to sing along.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I don't write reviews, but had to after I watched this at home. The 3D was AMAZING! Especially considering that it was not originally 3D. Much better than several I've seen that were actually shot in 3D - they did an incredible job of converting it.
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|This game is so much better than Team Lavas version City Story. You can do what you need to then watch the people move around your city while you wait for the energy to recover.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|My wife twisted my arm to watch this movie, I did not want to see it as I am saddened and uncomfortable thinking about this period in our history.  This movie was not so much like that.  Jamie Foxx rocked it (as usual) and it was through many parts, a feel good movie.  I don't want to put ant spoilers in here so, suffice it to say this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a good while.
030758836X|1.0|First, let me say this is my first time ever writing a review, however I felt compelled to do so after reading this book. I am a mom of two small kids. I never have time to myself but I heard about this book and took the time to read it and am so disappointed that I wasted my very limited spare time on this book. I was so in to this book I could not put it down and was anticipating the ending as I could not wait to see what happened in the end. Well what I got was a whole lot of disappointment. I mean the beginning and middle are fantastic but the ending of this book is pointless and leaves you wondering what the author was even thinking. Horribly written ending with no resolution.  The last 20 pages I was saying something better happen here and when it didn't, I couldn't believe this book ever made the best seller list. Horrible, Flynn...horrible. Would never read another one of your books!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing this game ALOT, the graphics aren't bad and is suitable for all ages in my opinion.<br />It can get a bit boring, but it's kind of addicting!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I have yet to be able to play as it won't load!  I just get a blank screen.  Not worth the headache.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love this guy! And the Cd is great. I am so glad he<br />'s finally getting his due.Thank you.
B005PK57IK|4.0|I really like this show, but I'm very frustrated that after I have watched 3 seasons I am expected to pay 1.99 per episode for seasons 4&5. I guess I'm done watching the show for now.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I'm sorry but it really wasn't very good. Long and boring. Very interesting subject, just not a very well made movie.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the most addictive game I've ever played..and on Kindle Fire it is beautiful. I paid for the Blood and Guts to help support the dev and it was well worth it!
1401937519|4.0|Gives the reader hope that cancer can be beat!  Very authentic and enlightening.  Easy Read.....fun.  Get this book.  2 thumbs up
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series transports us to a time when everyone knew &#34;their place&#34;.  We find ourselves rooting for both echelons of society as they struggle to realize their true potential and &#34;place&#34; in the world at that time.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is the second book in The Mortal Instruments Series and it continues to deliver action in a new and different form that keeps you entertained.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe should be examined to see if they have chameleon DNA. They are able to transform into each character they play.  Anne Hathaway was heartbreaking as Fantine.  It seems as if she has been promoted from a &#34;princess&#34; to a &#34;queen&#34; of the screen.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|We are enjoying the shows without any commercials.I do wish Emma would have married will instead of the dentist Carl...
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Mr. Jackson has mysteriously absorbed the very essence of J. R. R. Tolkien's magnificent imagination and brilliant narrative.  We, the viewing public, are extremely fortunate to have such a talented director to present these extraordinary epics.
0547884591|2.0|I gave it to my daughter because I did not like it.  I don't know if she likes it.  It's not really a cookbook.  I should not have spent<br />the money on it.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Danield Day-Lewis proves once more that he is the quintessential performer.  He can always be relied upon to embody and project the inner realms of each character portrayed.
B008M721MS|1.0|This app doesn't work for 1st Gen Kindle Fire. I was very disappointed that there has not been an update to Skype for 1st Gen Kindle Fire
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|my son got a kick out of it. we keep drawing him differently. this type of interact games are a lot better then the run of the mill adventure game. I just wish that it was longer.
145210655X|5.0|My son loves this book! Even though he read it in the store already, he really wanted it to read over and over - and he has!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I've enjoyed NCIS from the very beginning.  The relationships between the characters has an ebb and flow that is realistic and interesting.  It isn't just a &#34;cop&#34; show, it's tons more.  The background stories are more interesting than the &#34;murder of the week&#34; IMO, and keep me coming back.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Subway surfers is a great game w/ good graphics and many places you can go to. I love it!So does my family
B008MM9630|4.0|It's soooo entertaining:) and I love it whenever I get bored I just play it and my siblings love to play
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Really a disappointing treatment of these wonderful books. The director seems fixed upon this Gollum character. The Hobbit was an unexpected hero doing what no other Hobbit has ever done. They treat this like a side story.
0143122061|1.0|I won't go on and on, because other one-star raters have done an excellent job. Ferguson's is of the narrowest perspective, most Western-cultural-centric book I've read yet. I recommend: Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. 2012.
B007SGM084|4.0|in book 1, the sex scenes play an integral part of the story.  In books two and three though, they simply get in the way of what is otherwise a decent story.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is a great series. I wanted to keep reading. The storyline is original and the writing is excellent. Anyone who enjoyed the Hunger Games, Matched, or Divergent would love this series.
1475143389|4.0|Not a bad training guide but definitely for the beginner.  The routines get the job done and the downloadable content was pretty good but I got bored with it after about 2 months. I would recommend this guide to anyone that has no idea where to start with their fitness goals.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that the author (Mike) will get back to you pretty fast with any info you're looking for. As you can see from this post, he has  a vested interest in both helping people and backing up his products.
B009FZFONO|1.0|I have been watching Netflix on demand with little problems and wanted to purchase the newest season but had to move to amazon.  Waste of money!  The stream constantly times out or has to rebuffer.  Would rather order the discs than sit through the streaming sessions.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Well I just have to say this is fun but 1 star off because the stark credits are hard to earn but I have 3 suits now and 1is not built so pretty much 2 I would recommend for non-lazy gamers
B009R659L8|5.0|As usual an excellent mystery by Mary Higgins Clark. She weaves a story that keeps one enthralled to the end.
0679805273|5.0|I think this is a great book for every graduating senior.  It's much deeper than the surface of the words!!!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love it. It keeps you guessing and draws you into the storyline before you know it. Can't wait to see where it leads.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wanted the story to never end. Very connected with the characters and what would happen in their future together.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This is the first game the boys choose when given a chance to play video games. They are laughing constantly.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|hot is model fab buteful goolfey betey as a cang candy spider soldlo swing hot foyol baby kiss my lisp
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Funny movie with a romantic twist. I laugh basicly the whole time of the movie. I would highly recommend to watch this
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I already had one of the Broadway CDs and I love it too,but I think I understood a little more from the movie version.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Brilliant piece of British television illustrating the great divide of the aristocrats from the servants.  The writer has truly captured the era and how war changes their lives and roles in society.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Listen people you should only buy stuff that spell it with minecraft not mindcraft  so if anything is spelled mindcraft it's going to suck<br /><br />Also read what the guidelines say<br /><br />This game is pretty good since its is spelled minecraft this game is a good one it is like minecraft xbox  you can create survive etc.<br /><br />So when you want another minecraft game remember read the reviews see the spelling and read the guidelines.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|It's fun when you first start but after a while you get pretty used to it . All you really do is spin and sneeze to all the other planets. And a crab comes and kills you.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Great episode. Tony Curran was excellent as Vincent. All the thrills, intrique and emotions I've come to know from the good Doctor.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Even though this e-book is quite expensive, I'd recommend it for everyone who's looking for inspiration to make more complex desings, consisting two or more kinds of ties. Instructions make it very easy to learn how to tie single types of straps etc. and show many ways of finishing your work in the way that makes it useful.
B008IJHIAA|5.0|The songs on the document cd are awesome. The live cd brings back memories of seeing REM in the early days. I have it on steady rotation.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|I expected a lot more from this read and found at times my mind wandering, which has not been the case with this series. It lacked the intensity created by well thought out characters who the reader cares about. In my opinion this is the worst book in what I thought was otherwise a very entertaining series. I don't read Baldacci expecting some great piece of literature that changes my life, so the expectation of pure entertainment really isn't that hard to achieve. But this meandered along, as did my attention.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|This is simply wonderful.  I had no idea how great her pipes were til I saw her on a morning talk show.  I want to sing like her.  I used to want to sing like Streisand but Emily seems a little more approachable (if I could carry a tune, that is.)
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Any reader who pays attention to what the story they are reading will easily figure out who the shooter is about 2/3 the way in. The reasoning not all that clear but over all the book was still an enjoyable read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The relationship that emerges between Clark and Will is believable.  You cheer for both of them, individually and as a couple, appreciate their choices and why things are the way they are.  The author provides enough inishgt into the minor characters that you understand their roles....without being a diversion to the central characters.  Worth the time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was worth every penny.  I love this game. It tests your thinking and what to build. Plus if you use the pocketinveditor you can switch it from survival to creative.
B009A882D0|5.0|The music is fantastic, it was great to dance to then and it is great now.  I turn on Grapevine, and even my treadmill time is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was the best game that I have ever seen and played before. The game has good graphics. How cool!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I had another app for weather and it kept freezing up so I decided to give the &#34;ole&#34; standard a try. Thank goodness for standards :-) I find this the one app I open every morning before heading out to work. I would be lost without it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love this show.  I am only on episode 5 but it is really addicting to watch.  Don't start it if you don't have time to watch multiple episodes in one sitting!
B005XN31LY|5.0|The BEST way to get caught up with the story and re-watch those favorite episodes. I love to pause the action and examine the detail of the costumes.
B005IQZB14|4.0|It's like you are there with her reliving the journey. It's inspiring that she made all the way to the end.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I was looking for a calendar to work on my kindle andn found this one for $7 it is great I can keep up on my phone and my kindle now  this works great with gamil
B005IQZB14|4.0|It's like you are there with her reliving the journey. It's inspiring that she made all the way to the end.
B002PEP4EG|3.0|Compared to other business management books, this book provides very little directly actionable detail and examples. I expected a few more tools/practical guidelines.
B00BYKIKJS|2.0|Kind of frantic for the sake of being frantic.<br /><br />I like Jennifer Lawrence a lot but this performance is not worth an Oscar.<br /><br />Winter's Bones was much better!!!<br /><br />Charles.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I absolutely cannot get enough of this adorable game! Very cute, addictive, and tons of fun. So happy I downloaded it, the graphics are wonderful and its actually free, you don't need to buy things to advance :)
B00007KQKM|2.0|To begin, I am not a Ken Russell fan.  Nor am I a Joley Richardson fan (after seeing her in the first season of \\"Nip/Tuck\\" that is).  Therefore, I am not surprised I did not like this series.  I did not find the acting very good.  Sean Bean was a nice looking, sexual man but his scenes with Joley Richardson were dull.  There was no chemistry between them.  James Wilby, who plays the husband, was playing a James Wilby character - he didn't have to act too hard.<br /><br />Honestly?  Boring production.  Unrealistic ending - even if it was part of one of D.H. Lawrence's books.  Not one to watch.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|These guys are so awesome! Their performance was so good it was overwhelming for me. I cried a little when I thought about how 2of them had passed away (the wine might have had a little to do with it also) anywho; there was  a tribute to Andy as well, that was touching also, and a guest appearance by Celine Dion OMG! Man that gal can blow, and she does it effortlessly. All in all, I can watch this DVD over and over again.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good movie. Recommended. The only downside is Denzel always plays Denzel. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but sometimes seeing someone not playing themselves is nice too
B005K17RU0|5.0|For a weather  geek  like myself this one is the best I use every day<br />I have 5 other apps this one comes first
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Just like potato chips you can't have just one.  These books don't have a conclusive ending, and when you finish you want to go on to the next book to see what happens.  it is fantasy without being too far out. The characters are colorful and interesting.  Unexpected things happen.  It is a fun read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I so like the first two seasons that I bought this one. I just can't wait to see season 4.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Nice story, but very hard to understand some of the very harsh accents.  Kids got bored with it pretty quickly.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I could not enjoy this as much as I wanted to. You get all the way to 32 percent before the author gets to Tesla story! I almost gave up on it. I downloaded to read about Tesla, not 32 percent of other stuff concerning drive and ambition speeches. Sorry but you should have started out with tesla and integrated your ideas into your story. You almost lost me before you got to the best part.
B00CHILW64|5.0|I never even new about this movie till I saw it on amazon. It provides a realistic perspective on what it was like to be man handled by mother nature.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great way to kill time and I've been playing for awhile and have spent a dime. Best iron man game I've played in a long time
B008602KQI|3.0|Enjoyed the movie - but it's one of those that I am glad I did not pay to see in a theater.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Vic Macey is the all-time dirty cop that somehow always squirms out of trouble with his superiors.  Walter Goggins, his sidekike, Shane, is the ultimate screw-up that seems to recover just in time.  The action is fast and furious with character development at the highest.  Have to go to Season 2 next!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is the  best book ever because there is so much action in it. I love it! It's for children
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Have you ever been in a crowded but quiet place and your 6 year old and your 9 year old are bored and starting to get a litttle noisy and wild? What you really need is a fun multi-player game to keep their attention. This is it. The game is simple to learn, has pretty deep strategy, and each round is quick so losing doesn't cause a tantrum.
B004WJRFYE|5.0|This issue is a very clean and flawless audiophile grade pressing loaded with extras for McCartney fans with the inclusion of a bonus disc. Highly recommened.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|These lights turn on when they detect motion. They are bright and don't chew through batteries. They only light up when they are needed. The only problem is the glue for the included Velcro can't hold the light on the wall. However, the kit includes screws; use these instead.
0790729407|5.0|By far and away the most interesting, if not completely factual, portrayal of Michael Collins and the attainment of Independance for the greater portion of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland. This is a truly great and very inspirational movie with nary a dull moment.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It is so helpful in writing and editing! The price is also great!  Just wished I could get it on my android phone.
B000059MEK|5.0|This is my first favorite Daft Punk Album, so I purchased it. The digital download looked like it was bootlegged and then given to me from Amazon. Album covers didn't match for different songs,and there where very different kpbs quality for different songs. It was ridiculous, I felt like I downloaded a bootlegged copy from amazon.com. Crazy. If you want good quality when purchasing the CD, wait for it to come in the mail, and don't bother with the digital download.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Mt wife loved this as she is loved all older movies and stories. It has become a classic on many different fronts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game! Keeps you interested with the change of scenery.  I would recommend this game.  If you enjoy temple run,you will like this game
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The music contained within the application is good for weekends. I found it a nice change from the jarring noise maker that I use during the week.
1861085257|5.0|This is the BEST food book I have ever seen.  She rates the projects as beginner, experienced and expert.  There are many types of canes explained.  Her food looks perfect.  Very well illustrated each step of  the way.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The Show is GREAT.  Kevin Bacon nails it as a burnt out, under appreciated Ex-FBI agent.  The Bad Guy (Cult Leader) is a Bad Guy's Bad Guy.  Hannibal Lector creepy.  His Ex-Wife (also appears on Justified -- another entertaining, well written show.) is gorgeous, bright and although consistently in overwhelming situations, doesn't over act.  Like 24, you never know which character is going to be eliminated. It will be interesting to see where the writers go with the second season.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Great (but sad) story twist, excellent special effects. I enjoyed it very much. Not a date night movie, but still very good.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|A modern day sherlock holmes with new stories and all the latest techniques.  I have been enjoying this series, and look forward to see what happens with the confrontation of Moriarity.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Out of all the Pride & Prejudice movies made, this is my favorite.  I have watched this soo many times and never get tired of it.
B009GED3HS|4.0|This is a great show and this season is no different! Some episodes are better than others but definitely worth seeing, especially if you have seen seasons 1-7
B004J4XGN6|5.0|The book is very good and every entrepreneur need read the book. In simples keywords, The book is perfect and excellent.
B005LAIIA8|3.0|This product arrived, and the 2D disc was scratched. I was enjoying the film and then 10 minutes in it skipped ahead a few seconds.<br /><br />Taken to Blockbuster to get disc buffed and it works better. Beware though.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Suspenseful and very fast moving. Kept you on the edge and you wanted to get to the next page as fast as possible.
B009ERK35W|1.0|I remember seeing this film when I was younger and being mesmerised by it. When I saw it was on Blu-Ray I immediately bought it.<br /><br />Too bad it's region-locked to A. It's a great, bizarre, scary film (from what I remember) and hope a B-compatible release comes out soon - check out the film! It's kind of suffered the same fate that Dark City suffered...
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|this film could have been better<br />it 'dragged'...very slow in parts<br />some parts were okay<br />could have been more sinister and suspenceful
B0032JTV74|3.0|I'm kind of a gleek but not really, this first show's very soapy and teen drama and thankfully not overly filled with songs. Works fine in Aussie players.
B0060AY85C|3.0|For a Toni Morrison book, I was surprised by now quickly I finished it. The themes addressed in &#34;Home&#34; are almost never addressed anymore, and are quite different from my experience with reading her books. This is a book about a man's experience, something that is not usually associated with the author's body of work. The ease of understanding should not be a reason to skip this book.  I gave this book three stars because in writing &#34;Home&#34;, Morrison take s a straight forward approach in relating her story, If you are ranking it against her other works, you might agree that this is a fair rating. However, don't miss reading it when you have time, because the story is touching and psychologically informative.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I watched this the other day, it's a brilliant movie. You need to pay attention, this ain't Transformers.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is great, and there's a freakin' genius scene in the middle of the film where it intercuts between a battle and a flashback which is pure cinematic genius.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love being able to calculate at any time and any place when the occasion arises - so this app is good for my needs.
B001NXDSLG|5.0|The film is four hours long (!!) but I made it through. It's amazing to be able to experience Woodstock over and over, three days in four hours, without tripping bad or getting knocked up or anything.<br /><br />The extras in this UCE are great, including a replica admission ticket. I love this set.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I like Google Chrome better - to choose any word or words I want to search rather than be limited to categories.<br />It's okay for some things - but not always helpful.
B005FITILO|4.0|Charlize Theron nails it. Simple as that.<br /><br />It's also unorthodox arc for her character. She kind of learns nothing. It's frustrating for the viewer but...I found it such a rewarding and refreshing experience.<br /><br />Patton Oswald is gold in this and should have been nominated for an Oscar or something, seriously.
B0009MZ7WA|5.0|arrived on time in perfect condition. Very underrated movie. Beautiful cinematography.Great performances from the two leads but Jean Seaberg is a little weak.
B0025KW29U|4.0|The little web series that could - Dr Horrible is the ultimate experiment in &#34;will people do something because they care about it?&#34;<br /><br />The show presented in 3 parts is brilliant, NPH is gold (especially in the last five seconds) and the whole thing is pure genius.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Really enjoying this read and learning the answers to many of the question I've had since the HBO series  began
B009FB3XTA|4.0|Despite the fact of lack of Muse (I thought St Vincent's The Antidote was performed by Muse when I first heard it) the final Twilight soundtrack is great addition to the collection of soundtracks.<br /><br />Love Speak Up by Pop Etc, Bittersweet by Ellie Goulding and The Antidote by St Vincent of course. Skip The Forgotten by Green Day. I usually like Green Day, but this track's terrible. Other than that the soundtrack rules.
B0084670FU|3.0|I like Brad Pitt but I couldn't follow the story line that well.  I decided not to finish watching it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love this book .<br />I'm reading the whole series .<br />I wish there were was more of them.It will be sad then I have finish them.<br />It's a great book.-A must have
0385535147|4.0|As usual, Grisham is a master storyteller.  The character deveopment and all the action make for a good read. I cared for<br />the people.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|It would be very interesting to hear this recording in Hi-Fi as well. I have often relished the idea of hearing old records in high fidelity. Why not release The Jazz Age both ways? I would love to give both a listen.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|A great portrayal of a hero... Selfless, determined, loyal, fearless... and human. He earned the respect of everyone that he worked with due to his attitude and work ethic.
081243238X|5.0|Fantastic book to add to any child's library.....purchased it for my newest grandchild....a must have for those night time stories
B001N3EZW2|5.0|Some day it will probably be remade with up-to-date CGI special effects, but this classic still has its chops. Elsewhere you may read that it has roots in Shakespeare, and is one of the inspirations for Star Trek and Star Wars. But I remember seeing it and having my jaw drop when the Krell labs were revealed. The sheer sense of wonder! And the one-of-a-kind music by Louis and Bebe Barron was a daring choice back in the day.
B00942S4OY|2.0|The little girl whom I bought this cd for was excited when she opened the package and saw that it was the One Direction cd she wanted. After looking at the case, she asked &#34;This is used, isn't it?&#34; ... She shouldn't have cause to ask that question if this is a &#34;brand new&#34; cd. Secondly, the cd stopped playing after multiple tries on different devices. I am not pleased with how this went down, but she is 8 years old and has found other things to occupy her mind.
0062059963|1.0|I don't buy any part of the book. It tries to sell you on a caste system that feels superficial and unimportant. Setting up a kingdom in the future feels silly to me because generally speaking, monarchies involved some kind of divine right that seems frankly silly now and in the future it will likely seem ridiculous. Who just creates a monarchy out of nothing because of some hard times in a country? That's a very hard sell for me. It can be done, but it takes a lot more work than what has been presented here. The personalities are shallow and boring. During the entire book it never feels like anything is truly at stake for the characters. The writing is fair to poor. I wish I had more positive things to say because I want to encourage young authors, but I feel like Kiera Cass should spend a lot more time making tighter plots with more at stake for her characters.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Action, Aliens, Humor, Aliens, Drama, Aliens, a giant crescent wrench, Aliens, great cast, did I mention Aliens? I'm pretty sure I mentioned Aliens!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The ending is a great &#34;twisted&#34; twist!  Enjoyed it more than gone girl, but the preteen drinking and drug abuse in the story isn't for the faint of heart!
1400064287|4.0|This is a very interesting and easy to read book that breaks down why some ideas stay with us. This book will definitely help you out if you are an entrepreneur or in marketing. If you only read the summary in the Epilogue, this book will have paid for itself.<br /><br />The only reason for the 4 star review is that I read another book, covering the same subject, which covered a very similar breakdown, but did so more effectively. Out of respect for the authors of this book I won't name the other book, but in comparison, these authors could have used less anecdotes to illustrate their breakdown.  You too may find yourself skipping sections of each chapter to move the material along.  That being said if you are interested in this subject, you will not be disappointed. As I said, the Epilogue is worth the cost of the book.

B007T9UIMA|4.0|My granddaughter wanted a One Direction CD for her birthday. I saw the Up All Night DVD and thought she might like that better. I was right, and for a day, I was her hero. I can't speak to the music because I haven't listened to it, but she says it is great.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I was never able to attend the stage production of Phantom. I primarily bought this movie because I appreciate Ciaran HInds's work. I had no idea the phenomenal beauty I would experience in watching this work of art. The dancing, singing, screen play came perfectly together. The acting was superb in this jaw dropping performance. The lush set designs, costumes and extreme attention to detail were brilliant. For me everything worked.<br />  Please watch this film. It truly is awe inspiring.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I dont know why women were so gaga for this movie. I am more embarrassed for these guys then hot for them.

I kept asking my husband if people really live like this. Terrible movie... not at all as funny as I thought. Honestly if you have seen the previews you have seen all the funny parts
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|This should have been the start of the Lord of the Rings Quadrivalency.  It has a good story, characters, and atmosphere as the original 3 had.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it dealt with so many issues common to everyone:  love, family, overcoming obstacles, friendship, heartbreak.  The characters were so clearly defined, you wanted them all to be happy.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Robert DeNiro, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence all did a great job filling the roles of their complex characters.  The movie showed how mental illness and tragedy can really devastate lives and how difficult recovering from that can be.  Even with all of the sadness the movie was very uplifting and motivational and by the end I felt myself really caring about the characters.  Hands down a great film, it definitely lived up to the hype.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's not that I don't like the game...it's great...it's just that I've had to download the game at least three times due to loading problems since I started playing it. Very aggravating . Also having game boot me out when in Japanese garden.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Tough to accumulate in game cash, but fun to play.  Big file size for secondary download.  It runs well on my kindle fire.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I really like this but the time gives people like 10 minuets. I wish it was like 2 hours. Then I could get a feel for the game and buy it. 10 minuets is too short.

B00C5W3SBE|3.0|I guess Disney is listening to everyone's complaints. Home Media reports that we can now purchase a 2D copy for $5.99 plus shipping if we buy the 3D version.  Here is what I copied and pasted from website since I can't post a URL link:<br /><br />***<br />Walt Disney Studios, creator of the Blu-ray Disc/DVD combo pack, has come up with a new configuration designed to simplify matters for the consumer -- and at the same time recognize that 3D for the home, at least for now, is still a small but growing business.<br /><br />Instead of making Oz the Great and Powerful available in an everything-goes combo pack, the studio is releasing the film in a Blu-ray Disc-DVD combo pack and individual Blu-ray Disc, DVD and Blu-ray 3D configurations, each with a digital copy.<br /><br />Previously, the studio packaged Blu-ray 3D in with the regular Blu-ray-DVD combo pack. With Oz, buyers of the Blu-ray 3D can still get the 2D version for an additional $5.99, plus shipping and handling. And buyers of the regular Blu-ray Disc can get the 3D version for the same amount.<br /><br />\\"We strive to give our consumers the best in-home experience and consistently evolve our mix of product offerings,\\" said a spokesperson for Disney. \\"We know that our 3D consumers enjoy that experience as well as the ease of use and functionality of digital copy. With Oz the Great and Powerful we're offering a single, simplified version for their in-home and on-the-go viewing needs. And, for those desiring a 2D Blu-ray version of the film, there's an offer included in the package.\\"<br />***

B0038P80CO|2.0|Wow I saw this years ago and thot I remmemberd really liking it. I am a big sci-fi fan(but not a horror fan) but I must a been drunk out a my mind lol. The first 2/3 is so monotonous and caters to mindless horror. I watched it again tonite and could barely force myself thru most of it--if I hadn't been drinking a little I wouln't have been able to! The first 2/3 is so monotonous and boring but after they meet the black guy it gets creative;its more sci-fi and interesting--I love dennis quaid and only wish the whole movie had been like after that part. :)

B00BHXUC8E|3.0|Really think this thing was a bit of a wasted opportunity. Some of it like the live Forevermore title track, Best Years etc, that's all really good. But stuff like Lay Down Your Love and Evil Ways etc, from the bonus \\"soundcheck\\" CD, that stuff needed to be in the full set - the DVD is just over an hour long, and that's with a probably a 5 minute drum solo and about 8 or 9 minutes of guitar duelling. Most of the songs were already on Live In the Still of the Night.<br /><br />If they were gonna do a DVD they needed to sit down, work out what songs needed to be on it, rehearse it, do the show and film it. Not do a short festival show show and think \\"oh, lets put this out on DVD\\".<br /><br />Stuff that they've played with Reb and Doug that *isn't* on DVD that should be because it wasn't on the last DVD :<br /><br />Good to be Bad<br />Walkin in the Shadow of the Blues<br />Slide It In<br />The Deeper the Love (full band and also acoustic just with Doug)<br />Now You're Gone (last year UK tour)<br /><br />They're on tour in Japan (again) at the moment, they're playing Can You Hear The Wind Blow, Guilty of Love and Gambler.  THAT stuff needed to be on a DVD and live album, not a bunch of stuff they've already done.

0756405890|5.0|This is a great and wonderful read for a debut fantasy novel or even a seasoned veteran -<br /><br />I had read somewhere that people did not like that the story changes from 3rd person to 1st or that the timeline goes back and forth - let me quell this issue here and now<br /><br />First, it starts in the story's present and gets you into the world and the main character before it begins the 1st person and second, when it does the 1st person it explains why, and there is no confusion - I had more trouble following the multiple points of view that had no warning in the Malazan books than in this one, which clearly outlines the present and the past<br /><br />To me, this was like the movie Forrest Gump in the style of story telling - Gump sits on a bench in the current time telling his story of how he got to where he is - this is the same thing - though instead of having a mentally challenged man with a modicum of luck, it follows a musician and a magician through his growth from childhood to manhood, because he is a thing of legend -<br /><br />Also, to say that this is not done, then people need to re-read the fourth Dark Tower novel, Wizard and Glass - that is the same style in that Roland tells his childhood and life story while in the present<br /><br />Kudos to Mr Rothfuss for a well told story with interesting characters, intense action and drama, and magic philosophy that does more than say this is magic and it works - the reasons why are just as important and the proof is in the writing - 5 out of 5 stars.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|Finally, a free game, like be jeweled that is as much fun to play. The Game itself is very similar, like I said, but also has plenty of unique qualities of its own. Yes, there r ads, and yes, they ask you if you want to log on to Facebook often, but frankly it's not that bothersome to click a no thanks or to close an ad. Not time consuming by any means, also not the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. That would be because you only get 5 lives and then your done for however long it takes to get 5 more lives OR you buy them. FUN, FUN, FUN! I'd say get this one!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For the price, this bag is fantastic. It always amazes me how photographers (who are supposed to be creative) can't find a way to maneuver the sections around to fit your needs. At some point, there's no more room. It's a little on the small side for me, but look at it like this, when you're going on a shoot, don't take things you won't use, keep the other items at home or in the car.<br /><br />I've managed to put two camera bodies in there (60d & t3i) along with a 135-400mm Sigma lens - Along with a 70-300mm lens, along with a canon 24-105 lens and an 18-55mm lens, along with caps and all. I took out the wide angle lens, and the 85mm prime lens cause I wasn't going to shoot with those items.<br /><br />There's a place to slide your Tablet or small lap top, the padding is pretty decent, still be careful with your bad full of expensive items in it, but I would give the padding about a 3 out of 5 stars. It's very light weight, and as I've said, be creative and stop complaining about every little detail that isn't perfect for a $29 bag.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful, I always try to be 100% accurate with my experience because we all rely and depend on these reviews.

0385349947|5.0|I don't usually bother reviewing books that already have hundreds of reviews posted, as it is difficult to come up with a unique opinion. However, from the very first pages of this book, Sandberg's comments struck a chord and made me recall many incidents over my 40 year career. As a lifelong feminist, I have waged my own battles against discrimination, misconceptions, false labels, pigeonholing, and outright prejudice. I worked my way up from an administrative position to the upper management ranks in a male-dominated technology company, achieving one of the highest positions of a female in that company. While I had mentors and sponsors along the way, (always men since there were no senior women in the organization, I always felt that I had to work harder and longer hours and be smarter than the men around me. I felt the need to prove myself over and over, particularly when management changed. I frequently saw promotions and bonuses going to less accomplished male peers, and I even had one boss say that \\"you women never should have been promoted to Product Management\\". I \\"leaned in\\" and \\"raised my hand\\" and \\"had it all\\" (family and career), but still frequently felt like a second class citizen, and was often labeled as bossy or overly aggressive or too critical (of poorly performing colleagues).<br /><br />What is distressing about reading \\"Lean In\\" is that so little has changed over these 40 years. I had many female colleagues who, lacking the stomach or drive to carry on the battle to achieve equity, just gave up and opted for the mommy track or a lesser career than what they originally aspired to.<br /><br />I have raised, with the help of a very supportive husband of course, two intelligent, strong-willed and ambitious daughters, and I believe that this book will help to re-energize the conversation about equality for women so that my daughters and all women in the workforce now can achieve their goals on a level playing field.<br /><br />The book is well researched and written, with plenty of factual evidence to support the claims. Though the book shines a light on many issues, it is lacking definitive solutions. Whether or not you agree with all of Sandberg's assertions, you can't argue with the fact that the dialogue about equality and women in leadership roles needs to continue at all levels, between men and women, teachers and students, managers and employees, mentors and mentees, mothers and fathers and daughters and sons. It is only by freely discussing the issues and trying out various solutions that we will eventually achieve true equality in the workplace.rched and written, with plenty of factual evidence to support the claims.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I was way too young when the Eagles formed in 1972 and have not really listened to their music until my older brother bought their Greatest Hits LP. I have listened to the rest of the albums upon the arrival of CD's and iTunes. I became a fan and saw them for the first time live in Las Vegas last November. I love this documentary. I am not at the level of the other reviewers here who already know the Eagles inside out. This gives me a full appreciation of what they have gone through as a musical group.

1609611543|2.0|I am celiac and when I read the book it seems that the author is more concerned about dieting for loss of weight than the fact that some of us cannot eat wheat without becoming malnurished and having severe symptoms and deterioration of health.  When going wheat free in order to get proper nutrients in a diet you have to be very careful not to gain weight because you need cabohydrate intake and the carbohydrates you eat such as rice flour have no nutritional value but do add calories.  I disagree with his suggested diets because they again cut out certain valuable foods and are nothing but reducing diets that you can follow without going wheat free.  There are much better scientific studies done on the effects of wheat and the increasing number of celiac people because they have increased gluten in wheat through selective breeding.  Wheat is in a crisis but he takes it in the direction of gaining weight.  It is far more serious than that.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Not perfect, some standard melodrama and whatnot, but a pitiless window into a different world. At times it is jarringly phantasmagoric. The lead character has an interesting mix of sly boyish charisma, and a cold calculator of power and manipulation.
B004498KPU|4.0|If you think this would be a comprehensive set of all his videos, you're sadly mistaken. But if you don't have any collection, this will be good since all the videos are here - just maybe not the full version.

B001HN694K|5.0|This version with Johnny Depp is a bit darker and has more drama, I think, than the older versions, but it's purely wonderful and I love it.  I watch it over and over and catch new little gems in the conversations, etc.  The female lead, whose name is unpronounceable, is fantastic....strong female lead, but whimsical for all that.  When she says she believes in 6 impossible things before breakfast every day, I have to root for her and hope that I can still do that, too!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Don't be fooled by the title.  This book is not about aliens.  This book is a great book about survival.  I loved it.  I could not put it down.  Between the drama and the science involved in everything that's being done I was hooked.  I highly recommend this book if you are looking for something fresh without aliens but still have a foreign environment.  Loved it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I didn't expect much from this show, but got hooked after first couple of episodes. While a lot of the case work and court appearances are too canned and everything mostly pans out in Alicia's favor, there are enough compelling characters, performances, and story lines to make me keep watching it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is an intelligent, on the edge of your seat book.  Liked it even better than the first in the trilogy.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderful, rich characters. Compelling stories and beautiful costumes and sets. I'm trying not to watch these all at once so they'll last. Or, I guess I'll just have to start over when I've finished them. My husband and I both love this series.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Everything is pretty much what I bought except for the streaming and downloadable versions; a tedious registering process from various websites, some of them don't let you enter from countries outside USA (that's absurdly discriminating) and when you think you have your great downloadable version, you see that there are none of the options from the DVD and Blu-ray (scene selector, subs from various languages, etc). The Ultra Violet quality is not very high, also.<br /><br />Besides that, everything else is pretty great, with a really good Blu-ray and DVD versions, in a fantastic HD versions with subs and stuff.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire - just the simple solitaire. I really like this one and don't get tired of it.  That's all.
B00BWJ91XK|3.0|I am a huge LOtR fan and that's what kept me into this movie. Cinematography is incredible, but far too much liberty is taken with the storyline and far too much added. I guess when you are thinking more about additional movies and monies than story, embellishment is necessary, but true fans soon realize the underlying theme is not keeping to the integrity of the story.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I was able to take my phone into the pool and waterfalls in Hawaii, to help document my fabulous trip.<br />However, the case does make it a little more difficult to hear the person on the other line; the sound seem to be more muffled. It is also difficult to charge the phone with the regular charger, and impossible to charge with a car charger or other generic chargers that you can get for the iphone. If I want to use those chargers, or a &#34;speaker&#34; charge, I have to remove it from the case. Other than that, the cover works great for protection from water damage.

B008393Q2O|1.0|I can't believe it looks like you saved but it did not do so. So if you are going back and forth between tasks and don't save you have to remember what notes you created. Not worth the wasted time and lost data
B00932A4XE|3.0|It was funny and had just enough real life info and feelings to keep it from being just a fluff movie. Glad I saw it and yes I would've paid to seenit in the theater :)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The graphics, sounds, rooms are spine tingling. I would recommend this for all. From 46-15 we absolutely love it. Wow
B00992CF6W|5.0|takes a while to get into it but still a great app btw but we are getting the new update soon
B008YU0AOE|4.0|easy to use and easy on my eyes,,,beside it is free and it is worth my bucks... that's all, Folks!
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|I recently bought a WD Live so I could access my files from the web. No problem when I use my Windows tablet, but I usually use my Android tablet when I'm on the go. This app allows me to use the WD as it was intended. Set up was entirely web based and very easy to do. I can now access any of my files using my home network and through the internet. It is an amazing app.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is quite interesting and has really beautiful graphics. Before long, it gets you in a position where you might have to pay for more things, which is annoying.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Freaking Gameloft stop slapping extra storage of 500mb on your apps right when you open it.  I know it has happened before in most of your apps.  Just put how many bits it will take up right in product details.  I can't use any of your apps that look preety cool, so I'm going to start boycotting your apps until you stop doing this crap.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait to see more of this game! Hopefully it comes soon along with other games like it from this company! Love, love,  love!!!
B004I744AS|4.0|In addition to being a dictionary, this app also hosts several vocabulary games: spelling bee, hangman, vocabulary match up, and words within words. The home page can be customized to provide various features, such as word of the day, this day in history, and today's birthday. It is well worth taking a look at this app if you love words.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Better than Book 4. But a long way from any of the first three. Here's hoping Books 5 & 6 are an improvement.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|My husband watches this show over and over again, it's a shame there was only one season. Hopefully they will make another movie
B001DM1VXE|1.0|hard to get past the first minutes. thanks though. difficult to watch hard to understand.... thank you thank you thank you
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|This game is mostly unplayable. Graphic are nice but don't make the game play easier. Don't waste your data. Avoid thIs game
B005PK553C|4.0|it was a great series. Full of suspense intrigue and thought provoking scenes. personally, I think the husband was dense and deserves everything he got in the end. in fact the end was too good for him. I would have like to know more about what happened to some of the other characters. And then show did not allow was to delve into a lot of their lives. So some questions are still on answered by the end of this series. I wish therehere was another partrt that continue the story.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Boz somehow dips even further into his soul roots. The results are clean and sticky, greasy and dapper. Most excellent.
B002T3A4KW|3.0|Huw Grant plays well and his character is believable. Julia Roberts is not really an actor but she has a great smile. The plot is naive, predictable; dialog flat but with a glass of good wine at your side it is watchable. A pang of guilt for wasting of your two hours comes later.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of the best book I have read recently.  I really got involved with the characters and found them interesting.  I have recommended this book to several of my  friends and they also have enjoyed it.<br /><br />Susie
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson does a great job layering the multifaceted details of Job's life into a compelling story.<br />In so many way Steve Jobs was the epitome of the human technologist - and his characteristics, most of which are the antithesis to business school training, lead to one of the most successful innovative companies in history.<br />This book & corresponding audio book captures the complexities and contradictions that were Steve Jobs.<br />Showing both the frailty and flaw intertwined with drive and genius that made up such an amazing persona.<br />The pace is well laid and the background details complete - making it a enjoyable and fascinating experience.<br />I have many books on Steve, and I recommend this one above all.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great, great adult Fantasy with fantastic characters and deeply engaging storytelling. I was so disappointed it was over when I finished reading it that I started straight again from the beginning. It was just as good, if not better, the second time round.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|omg its so fun getting all the different characters and running from the crazy inspector and his dog that looks like a cat. I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000S586AS|5.0|wonderful old school jazz, was one of my first jazz albums. the best riding music, takes me back to my college days.  D.B. rip.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Whether Ragnar lived or is an apocryphal amalgam (depending on the historian), this show brings to life an era seldom dramatized.  Is it accurate?  Who cares?  It's terrifically entertaining.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|What a true heart beat of movie its one of the best movies I have ever watched. It should be a requirement to watch this movie in all history classes..
B009JZSC9S|5.0|One of the best current dramas.  I would say the best, but haven't seen all.  I am going to jones for this one all summer!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Lightning fast, easy to install, graphics are awesome and installed my windows 8 with complete ease.  I have not overclocked yet and my rating on this processor from WEI score is 7.3
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is action packed from start to finish! Each episode leaves you hungry for more. Once you start watching, you can't stop. Awesome !
B0070DOHQS|5.0|It just works! Really like the mouse interface. Connects very quickly. Works with Real Vnc.<br />Worth the price of purchase.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|This is the most rotten waste of time and money I've ever admitted to having done. The story seems to be about a family and how their lives are all entwined with a zillion other characters.<br />Sentences ramble on for WHOLE PAGES. Characters are unbelievable and are over analyzed. Footnotes (at the back-ugh) can be over 5 pages long.<br />If I could give it negative stars, I would. RUN AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|This story follows The Governess Affair, which is one of my all time favourites, can´t praise it enough. If you haven´t read it I think it best if you started there, it will give you the background to understand this hero. Because he is a hero. It is one of those complicated emotional stories dealing with freudian issues.You´ll get the sweetest of men and the bravest and cleverest of women, make peace with the mother, and keep checking your kindle for the next book in the series. I gave it four stars because I still haven´t found a story to compare with the governess´s, which tops them all.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Very usefull when i need documents on my computer while on the road. I would recommend to anyone looking for a similar use
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|It was plain bad. The only joke was the one on me for watching.<br />I want my time and money back
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love everything about this game.  The look, sound, and feel are spot on.  Play is as challenging as it is relaxing.  Great game!
B00886XQO0|5.0|Had been wanting to get some head phone for a long time and these were well worth the money. I play lots of games and the sound is remarkable. I found my self playing older games in my library that i had not played in awhile and hearing things that i didn't even know that was there!  Will work with Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. It is completely wireless via Bluetooth and will even connect to your mobile phone while you  play so you can answer calls. It is a lot of money to spend but if you can don't hesitate. Trust Me!
1451695195|5.0|I found a lot of peace in the foggy unknown of the afterlife.  It gave me peace to know what my son might be seeing and experiencing.  It made it easier to know he is in a better place than just gone.  I felt it gave relevant proof of heaven for the scientist or religious skeptic, which I perceive myself to be.  It was a great help as I face the future without my little boy.  I recommend it to anyone who is skeptical and has suffered the loss of loved one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is so cool with all the graphics and the control s are nice and does not crash at all I would give this 10 stars if they let me!!!!!!!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|When I first tried the cable and charger my Kindle came back to life. After about a week everything stopped working. Now I'm wondering how I will be able to read the books and other things I purchased because my Kindle seems dead.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It´s a great product! It´ll help you to play easier lot of 3DS games<br /><br />Nintendo just start to sell this product in US, so you will find it t cheaper in the Nintendo web page
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|For anyone who is a star wars and pinball fan this is perfect for them. Great graphics and sound affects from the movie. Well worth the 99 cents
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author spins an amazing tale of humanity's last hope living underground. Filled with human drama and a fascinatingly(and frighteningly) realistic environment, the author does a great job of addressing real human emotion and thinking under these conditions. This is not just another post-apocalyptic novel, it deals with the human side of living underground for a very long time. The first half of the book will raise many questions about the world in which they live, and most of those will be addressed by the end, which is nice, but there are still enough questions that you'll want to get your hands on Shift Omnibus Edition after finishing this one. I know I can't wait to start it! This is another author to keep your eyes on!
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I have bought a number of items from Amazon<br /><br />Music C.D,Jewellery and Books and D.V.D.for<br />my grandchildren I have also bought clothing<br />I am very happy with everything the service<br />contact to track my order alway delivered on time<br />thankyou I will continue shopping on line with Amazon..
B0009QBLA8|5.0|My girls loved this movie, they watched it several times and although they don't think it is that scary, they say it is more a thriller than a scary movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This remonds me of Tetris when it firast came out. It's addictive and fun., just what a game should be.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Best apu out there absolutely love it works good with games and won't lag so much easy to over clock
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Great up and coming band.  This is a great CD.  I recommend that you buy it.  Great songs very talented
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Awesome documentary, it really shows the story of Sound City Studio, the role it played as a living entity itself, that is, within the music industry.<br /><br />You get an inside look of all that was did in that studio, what it meant to all those artists, and how it defined SOUND during decades, even the 2000's.<br /><br />If you are a musician, a music aficionado, a recording engineer, a producer, or just a music lover, this documentary is A MUST.
0553584537|5.0|Once again - same review - Lisa Gardner is one of my favorite authors.  She pulls you in from the very start and doesn't let you go until the final page.  I'm her biggest fan.  Try her first books under the pseudonym Diana Dimond.  They are great too!
B00B8SSWSK|5.0|They always make a great music, fantastic electronic beats, deep bass with dark lyrics and the Dave voice is strong, like always is Just wonderful....
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was logical and the hints were just enough to get you rolling in case you get stuck. Highly recommend. I want more!!!!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I had to get this album although I wish that it could just<br />play through without the spaces between the tracks.  I love<br />every track on here.  If you love Pink Floyd, buy this album!<br />You will not be disappointed!
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I bought 2 of these kits for my 2 AA Mini-Maglites. The beam is a vast improvement over the stock bulbs, not only in clarity & purity of light but also battery life. I use Energizer Advanced and Ultimate lithium in my  flashlights and lasers. They seemed to last forever w/ the stock bulbs and go on longer w/ LEDs. One of the annoyances w/ the traditional twist on/off Mags was that I'd accidentally turn the light on while it was holstered on my belt, especially when sitting in my truck. I'd try to always tighten them in the off position but that did little and would eventually have broken the tool. Another minor annoyance was that the beam had to be adjusted every time one turned the light on. The push-button switch eliminates both of those factors. Now we can leave our beam just how we want it, spot or broad, and click it on & off. The downer is that there's no lanyard hole, something I use on my Mini Mags & Solitaires. Not a huge deal though. Be certain and align the polarities when installing the bulb, I just opened the package & stuck the replacements in w/o reading the instructions and thought I'd gotten a broken upgrade. My fault totally but a lowsy feeling until I figured out what I did wrong. Good upgrade from NiteIze here, hope the bulb lasts longer than the stock Mag bulbs.
B004IPPINW|5.0|This was a facinating book. The style is very different and the main character is intriguing. It gives the reader a unique insight into how an American educated immigrant, who loves the United States, can also see our weaknesses. I can't wait to see the movie!
B00070DK14|4.0|Faithfull to the originalon with as many,good extra tracts as the original.If you like Jethrow Tull then you'll love this albumGreat.
B0043UB0EI|3.0|Frankly,when I saw this series of spartacus,I got totally surprised.Spartacus is a western Myth.and the story should be told for what it is.not what a producer wish to becom.This movies is full of violence and nudity and nothing like what I was expecting.<br />The best Spartacus I saw was made by Stanly Kubric in 1960s.
B007MY4EOA|5.0|Nothing much happens in this film, except the birth of a child, the death of a wife, the engagement of one son, the estrangement of another, the efforts to help a woman suffering from depression, the friendship shown to two lonely people.  One year passes, four seasons unfold, and we get to listen to intelligent people having conversation.  But there are no car chases, no aliens, no vampires.  No, this movies dares to show us life--ordinary, marvelous, full of joy and full of sadness life; a grand mixture of comedy and drama.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I saw this game on my kindle and liked it on computer so I figure  I would get it, I buy it and It doesn't work I had to delete it and wasted money on it for nothing.
0156014041|4.0|I am learning Latin. As I have read the La Petite Prince (in French) I thought I would be able to read Regulus. At present  it is harder than I expected so I must keep on trying.<br />I find iit interesting to know the Latin version of the foxes' secret: animo tantrum bene cernimus. Quad plurimi sunt, oculis cerni non possunt.<br />My knowledge of Latin  is very limited and I am not competent to review this book. All I can say is that the so far as I have read the translation is close to the original and the pictures are as good as I any I have seen elsewhere.<br />I am already familiar with the story so what is interesting to me is the Latin structure. The chapters are short so the book lends itself well to my kind of study.I have a similar interest reading well known Biblical passages in the Vulgate.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is pretty awesome, but you have to be pretty patient. Other than taking a while to figure out, it's a lot of fun!
B007D3WGXQ|4.0|I have just received this Shadowscapes Trato deck and I am amazed at the beauty of it. This is one of those tarots you would like to be three times its size to fully enjoy the stunning beauty of Stephanie Pui-Mun Law's artwork.<br /><br />The Tarot is classic in structure, with swords, pentacles, cups and wands, plus the major Arcana, but the artwork has interpreted every single card in a lyric way, still being respectful to the original meaning of the cards.<br /><br />I dare to say that this is a tarot that will speak especially to women, as most of the characters in the cards, except for knights, kings or the specifically male major arcana, are women. It might not work for self-readings if you are a male or are doing intuitive readings for a man. But this is just my impression.<br /><br />This is a dreamy tarot, with lyric images that are very open to interpretation, with many symbolic elements. Still, each card is clean enough not to get lost in imaginary, but with plenty of elements to get a detailed reading.<br /><br />The deck is quite compact and small in size, very easy to handle and shuffle even for people with small hands.<br /><br />This is my favourite deck together with Doreen Virtues' Angels Tarot, and that is a lot to say.<br /><br />Now that I have it, I regret not having spent a bit more of money and getting the companion book, because the schematic tiny booklet that comes with this deck is the only big downside of the deck.<br /><br />The main downside of the deck is the bad quality of the material used, which is weak. Unforgivable, as this is a pricey tarot or as pricey as others printed on a sturdier paper. If it wasn't for this, the deck will have a five star rating from me.<br /><br />Truly gorgeous.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The subway surfer Tokyo game is great. I love playing the game. You get a adrenaline rush just playing the game. Absolutely awesome.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Iron Man isn't supposed to keep you in stitches! Or tick you off! The poor actors did all they could with such a lame script. I'm very disappointed as were the two people I went with.<br /><br />**Vague Spoilers**<br /><br />Problems we (and others we spoke to/heard talking about the movie) had with the movie:<br />-The Tony Stark we're given isn't the hotshot playboy we know and love. He is ridiculous! Tony built the original suit with scraps in a cave! This Tony couldn't build a cereal box! (Okay, slight exaggeration, very slight.)<br />-The Mandarin is inaccurate. Wrong ethnicity, wrong premise, just wrong.<br />-The bad guys, bio-engineered flame beings, whatever they are...were overpowered. WAY overpowered.<br />-If the one you love is missing and you're not sure where they are and if they are dead or alive, is it time to make stupid jokes? No...didn't think so!<br />-The suit(s) are way underpowered.<br />-I think Tony was in one of the suits a total of 6 minutes? I'd have to watch it again to time it but I won't subject myself to this movie again.<br />-Tony is basically a genius in movies 1 and 2. This Tony? Well, to put it nicely he is a neurotic basket-case.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I conpleted the game of Angry Birds a long time ago. It was fun; I was addicted; I did; and still do; collect the merchandise. Today; I went to re-play some levels (to try to get three stars) and my data was wiped out. Rovio; please fix this!!
B005MMYBXI|5.0|This season keeps you coming back for more! If you like the Vikings era you will love this show. It has all the drama aspects you need. Men and women alike will enjoy this tv show. Can be a bit violent at times, but nothing to worry about or to keep you from checking this show out.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have enjoyed it very much. Combines law company and legal system with detective work and family/people drama. Worth checking out
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love the attention to detail and effort to tell the story of the real vikings--- good and bad. I can't wait until the next season!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Very slow movie until the end. Rogen talks as if he has marbles in his mouth. Streisand plays herself- loud, overbearing, self centered. Predictable ending. Not much entertainment here.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very good depiction of a tragic event. The camera angles brought an interesting to the feel of the movie & the cast was dinamic.
0375842209|5.0|The very serious story is life like. Someone who lived through this period at about the same age had a hard time laying down the book and at times a hard time reading and remembering.
B0058O84G0|1.0|Just could not engage withnthisnstory so disappointing as I have enjoyed allows other books and was so looking forward to this.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The end was surprising, but a bit contrived in my opinion, as if the end had to be put on only two pages..
B003E2UQMS|3.0|Interesting read. Well written but not a page turner. Should read before seeing the movie. Good for a<br />Holiday read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next book! I looked forward to each new chapter. Wow!
B009GED3HS|3.0|I really liked the audio/video quality but considering the fact that it is one episode of 22 min and that there are other 20 episodes in the season, the price is a little steep even if you bundle the episodes (price drop only 10 cents).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I love it so much and I love their world tour for Tokyo so lets all get this game and be proud of who we're when we get this game!
1449325947|5.0|This book is very well explained about CSS.  I really like the way he talks about the various tags and what they mean.  I know HTML but wanted to work more with CSS.  I'm happy to have this book as a fantastic reference.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|one of best seasons, very well written and great character development.<br /><br />I am looking forward to season 8; hope it is not the last<br /><br />i
B00138KEH2|5.0|A must have in any respectable altrock collection.  Chris Cornell teamed with Tom Morello? Doesn't get any better.  \\"Like A Stone\\" is one of my all time favorite songs.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love Diary of a wimpy kid books the are one of th best books I have ever read I can't wait for finish all of them
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|It's a wonderous continuation of the GOT story. Not fully faithful to the Martin books, but the key parts are all there and brilliantly done.
B000B5XOQQ|5.0|I've always marveled that a movie like &#34;King Kong&#34; could've been made in 1933.  The special effects do not seem even slightly lame, even by today's CG standards.  I also enjoyed the commentary and other special features, which include &#34;lost&#34; footage.  A worthy addition to one's film library!
B0045XGRQE|3.0|Iron Man 1 and 3 and The Avengers were all much better. But RDJ is undeniably gifted - but for him, I'd think the movie even worse.
1400052173|5.0|Quite reavealing and informative. I had no idea something like his was taking place.  It is so sad that Henrietta Lacks family does not benefit from her contribution.
1401235417|5.0|I have to admit. It made me cry. I'm a grown man and regular weekly comic reader. This is the first comic in a long time to give me such emotions for the characters and what they go through! I enjoyed this volume way more that the first. And it has all the pay offs you could want after trucking through the first volume.  Oh boy! If you are reading this for the first time get ready to yell out loud cheering and even feel for Bruce and his family, as you grow and learn with these great characters.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|All Muchael Connolly's books are good. Some better than others, but I would highly recommend Mulholland Drive to my friends, especially ones who have worked as Investigators.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|The Shield, season 1 had us in a constant spin, great action and great music.  The actors were awesome.  Season 1 was well written.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This is a great movie and I am so glad I bought it. I hope this brings more insight to the world of mental illness to people who don't suffer from it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|started this epic series a year ago, amazing ending to it.  The only bad part is that there's not another book to read.  Sadface.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|As a Kevin Bacon fan I was thrilled to see him in a series.  Never thought this series would be so thrilling.  Its a great drama and a horror story all rolled into one.  Truly amazing show, you never see things coming - great plot twists and a very real honest feel to the entire show.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Bruce Willis dies off pretty quickly and it was OK...I'd stick with other stuff I guess. Good if you have nothing else to do.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Extraordinarily detailed world and character.  George Martin describes himself as &#34;lost&#34; in the seven kingdoms.  I would say he's quite the guide.  Awesome series.  Haven't seen the HBO series yet, but the writing is very tight and wonderful.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|It reminded me of the LA version of The Untouchables...good story, nice lines, and anything you can do to put the hurt on Sean Penn is good in my book.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis nails the character of Lincoln in a way no other actor has (or possibly could). Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones are also standout performers in this film. This movie does an outstanding job of illustrating a crucial time when Lincoln was struggling to get the 13th Amendment passed before the war ended or he was pressured into making a peace deal with the Confederacy. It is not a biographical film about Lincoln's life, which a lot of people assumed it would be. It's about Lincoln maneuvering this country through some of it's most dark and difficult times, when a lot of the population and many of the politicians they elected would have been all too happy to take the easy way out. This is also not a war/action movie, which I suspect some people might have assumed as well. There is a lot of dialogue, a lot of history, and a lot of character interaction. If you're expecting another [[ASIN:B000Q7LUGA Glory]], you'll be disappointed. If you want to see how American government really worked in the 19th century, you won't. Simply a great, timeless film.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Good...Tom Cruise does a decent job in this one...nothing like Oblivion or MI, but he does well. Worth the two hours to watch.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|....that hasn't already been said.  She can drop you into her world without hesitation or apology.  For those very few who expected something other than fiction.... read reviews.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My friend Nicole told me to check out this show and now I am hooked.  The character development is very strong.  You either love them or hate them.  Unfortunately,  I am hooked.
B007PFD90G|5.0|Fluent, elegant gripping story.  Real.  Critical to understanding our world now.  Sometimes Rushie is arrogant, but he avoids self-pity, and he is insightful and funny.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Stargate Universe SUCKED. Atlantis was dropped to make room for &#34;Lost in Space/Voyager&#34;, and I felt cheated. Like Firefly, here was a fantastic cast, fantastic villians, and unlimited potential. I MISS THIS SHOW!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game great way to pass the time..enjoy playing should be able to buy nuts with coins.<br />but enjoying the game good graphics.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book will make you wanna run to the nearest bar and drink 10 martinis to see where you end up;) I couldn't stop reading. Very refreshing, just wish the ending had more details.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best thing about this item is that the numbers are huge, which is great for me!!! And it's just like your favorite calculator!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I enjoyed how honest it was. Hearing the good and the bad from such a different perspective. It was a really \\"good experience\\"
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|This is used in the classrooms at a elementary school.  This is way cheaper than an Elmo.  You can use this to show experiments.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Well it was boring!!! -__- >_< I'm very tired now it is 8:45 pm and I didn't want to read the whole thing so I skipped ALOT!! ^_^ °_° *_* ~_~ ·_·
B0091X76YA|4.0|I liked watching the movie in HD, it made the movie feel more alive.  I would recommend this movie in HD.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this item because you can use Facebook on your kindle, without going on the computer. Although its free, you will enjoy posting comments and more. I highly recommend this app.
B001EBV0MG|5.0|Even my kids like it... the battle of will vs. the powers that be.  Truly a story for the ages.
B0000524CY|5.0|Just as scary creepy and freaky as I remember it, only in better quality. Great job on this version. Very happy.
B001BR3P0S|5.0|\\"The Breakfast Club\\" illustrates the fact that we (humans) haven't found a way to prepare our future generations to survive. This social disconnect between the parent and the child is vividly portrayed in this film and it (film) accurately mirrors the current human state. By posing its questions, \\"The Breakfast Club\\" allows us (as a society) to begin to assess the damage and can allow us to find solutions. Some films are worth owning and watching to learn, \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is one of them.[[ASIN:B001AEF6BI The Breakfast Club (Flashback Edition)]]
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|The story is fine, but the grammatical errors are often enough and jarring enough that it really takes away from the enjoyment of reading. Type-o's are one thing, but the misuse of language should not be apparent in a published piece. A better editor for any future books would be a good idea.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie.  A lot of action.  Looking forward to the next Hunger games movie.  Great acting, scenery and suspense included.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Movie lived up to expectations fatastically filmed and acted, Petr jackson has excelled at taking the book and turning it to film
1451648537|5.0|This book was even more then I thought it would be. I also think it was fair in reflecting the &#34;good&#34; Steve Jobs and also the &#34;flawed&#34; Steve Jobs. Think it should be a must read for all teahies.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|The UI is easy to use.<br />Installation was a breeze on the computer<br />I got it when it was a featured free app, so yay~<br />There seems to be minimal.lag between the actual computer and what I see on the app. I tried watching a video on the app that was playing on the computer. Although it didn't show all the frames, the ones that did show didn't have any delays.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|While maintaining the style and traditions of LOTR, this movie (after the first 45 minutes — read below) is actually better than the LOTR sequels!<br /><br />If I could, I would give it 4 ½ stars, but that is not allowed. It doesn't deserve the full 5th star (and I am usually generous with movie reviews), because of the first 45-60 minutes (however long it was before the actual &#34;unexpected&#34; journey began, which, by then was not only expected the characters were getting angry on the screen). If this was an unknown movie or author, I would have turned it off after the first 20 minutes of ABSOLUTE boredom. But when the journey began, it was the most delightful adventure that exceeded my expectations visually and story-wise. Could have been a little better, but it is still a great movie, which I purchased and absolutely love... Well... anything (anyone) you love has some imperfections, this one has a very well-defined imperfection in the beginning.<br /><br />Past the first boring part, the movie was a wild ride! Loved it.
B009R659L8|1.0|I have read all of Ms. Clark's book and was deeply dissapointed!!!!!! don't know if I'll buy any other's. You get into the story, turn the page and oops your on to another part of the book without it finishing the part you were reading. You'd be reading and it's in nice bold dark print and oops again, turn the page and it's so light you can just about read it. Only finished it because I paid for it!!!! Had I borrowed it I would of close the page and said, &#34;FORGET IT&#34; now I just don't know if I'll risk it again or go to the store and check the book before buying it at the STORE instead of amazon. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|i feel like i like this book but it is taking me a long time to read it. i usually finish books in a week and have been reading this one for several weeks. guess i don't like it as much as i think
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is definitely the most striking of all the books based on the content. It's emotionally heavy and hard to swallow at times. I'll have to read this series again someday and I hope the films will do justice to all that's happening underneath the surface.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Supertramp never get the credit they deserve.  Their songwriting was exceptional, the musicianship top notch, and they made great ALBUMS.  Full artistic statements on vinyl.  I had the album version of this show and wore it out on my turntable.  How great it is then to finally have this on Blu-ray with additional songs that didn't make it on the double LP.  Song for song(and there is not a bad one here), this is simply a treasure to experience and own.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Turn this album on and just try not to smile.  A very unique blend of not so unique genres.  Synth, yet soulful. Folk, yet funk. Pop, yet punk.  Industrial rock, yet church choir boy. A solid album all the way through.  Highly recommend.
125000098X|4.0|As a a fan of Jeffrey Archer, I looked forward to Best Kept Secret and was not disappointed. Well, a little bit. But in general I am enjoying the tales of the Cliftons and the Barringtons and realize that the author is stacking the deck. We won't find out how things in this novel turn out until we read the next one. One would be best advised to wait a few years and read them all at once as it can be frustrating to wait a year until the next novel appears! But, that frustration is a tribute to how well the author keeps the reader interested. Since I choose to read them as they appear, I take the joy I get and, in my own mind, consider the story ended. I know who the author meant in that last paragraph anyway, don't I?
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma! The casting was \\"spot on\\" in my opinion and the directing was superb!
B002LE8D2K|5.0|I have used the Corsair XMS line of RAM for years.  I have yet to be let down.  You get the correct speed for your board, handle them properly and make sure they are seated in the socket correctly.  Then you power up the system and forget about them.  That has been my experience every time.  They run cool, are low profile for large air cooling heat sinks/cooling tower clearance and the heat spreaders have never fallen off.  There isn't much more I can say about them.  Nothing is perfect, but this is very close.
B005MLP71Y|3.0|We watched it for movie night and the kids really liked it!! It was cute!  Nothing inappropriate for a 5 and 8 yo.
B0055S348W|1.0|This printer app does not work with the Kindle Fire.  The seller does<br />Not have contact email in order to ask questions or to give any support.<br />It feel cheated out of my money, and do not see anywhere a link to request a<br />refund.  Be careful when ordering apps.
B00CBKXGPI|3.0|I am sorry but I could not really get into this game. There is too much going on and you have to keep switching to different screens and it was so hard for me to follow. I kept it but I truly doubt I will try to play it anymore.

0525950079|2.0|Middle Ages trough capitalism ideology glasses, at least seems look like a modern love story of good proffesionals with the background of easy christian morality. I read it in four or five days, Thick but fast. If you loved the fist part, &#34;The Pillars of the Earth&#34;,  just imagine the future by yourself and go ahead for the XX Century new trilogy of the author.<br /><br />And as ever better in Kindle version.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Amazing!  Fabulous.  This is some of the most wonderful music I have ever heard.  Highly recommend it to everyone.  I listen to it over and over again and never get tired of it.  It transports the soul to a realm of musical delight. It even inspired me to write this poem to honor the music of THE PIANO GUYS:<br /><br />Heaven's Music (THE PIANO SKIES)<br /><br />When we come to reside in heaven's skies,<br />The Lord calls forth The Piano Guys.<br />He arranges with His own majestic hand,<br />For angels and all souls a concert grand.<br /><br />Jon masterfully plays a Divine piano,<br />While Steven's bow dances on an ethereal cello.<br />Music so heartfelt makes angels' tears flow.<br />Such rapture sets their golden halos aglow.<br /><br />Then The Guys Mozart and Beethoven invite<br />To perform with them in those heavenly heights.<br />Also to join in are Bach, Cavelli and Strauss.<br />Radiant rhapsodies do fill the Lord's House.<br /><br />By Henry Mancini the music is enhanced.<br />The gowns of angels swirl as they dance<br />To The Piano Guys, the Beatles and Rachmaninov<br />God's creation of music is His gift of love.<br /><br />Each resplendent angel lends their melodic voice.<br />Such beautiful sounds make all souls rejoice.<br />Heavenly music swells for our hearts' delight,<br />Eternally playing in God's glory and light.<br /><br />Dedicated to The Piano Guys (Jon, Steven and all)<br /><br />When you call upon the inspiration of the Divine to enhance the music you create, you have become God's messenger of beauty.<br />PLEASE DO NOT DUPLICATE WITHOUT AUTHOR'S PERMISSION<br />Angel Inspired Poetry by Debby Busse,  April 11, 2013

B007VUA7VO|5.0|If you own a Kindle - get this app! Accurate battery monitoring and conditioning. Much better than any other battery app on the market and light years ahead of built-in Kindle battery monitoring. 5 stars from me!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I haven't had much time with the app but it seams to work better or just as good. Would recommend to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so much fun I mean it is so great you can play all night if you wanted to.You can get money and stuff and spend it on our stuff. FUN FUN FUN
B000023VR6|5.0|absolutely loved it it felt like the first time I got the CD was brand new in the case with wrapper and all I could not ask for more
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show ever!  It is always exciting!  There are many twists and turns through out the show and always an unexpected event!  Very well written and acted.  Don't want to miss an episode ever!  I have seen it from day one, never a dull moment.
B00821OX98|4.0|There are a lot of well developed characters in this series.  The protagonist is someone I can root for.  It keeps me coming back.
145210655X|5.0|My son-in-law's a Darth Vadar fan. So we bought this and the Vader and little princess book for him. Jeffrey Brown is talented.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I think that is a good product, but it will be better if were possible to do collections with the books, like in Kindle devices.
B002722R64|3.0|The movie was released at the right time and spawned a decent video game.<br />Besides it's Bond .. good way to kill a couple of hours.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I usually do not download movies unless they are for the grandbabies, but I am glad I downloaded Silver Linings Playbook, I definitely will watch more than once.
B00000K2UX|5.0|We watched the Movie again this time in 3D on our new HD 3D Blu-ray system and really enjoyed seeing this again as it was awesome in the 3D Format.  Thought I had a vinyl copy of the soundtrack but didn't so I purchased this CD.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|I loved the fast paced dialogue between Cary Grant and Katherin Hepburn.  The premise is silly, but what these two actors did with the story made you thoroughly enjoy their madcap adventures. They don't make movies like this anymore.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Had this movie on both VHS and DVD but just upgraded to the Blu-ray copy now that I have a HD Blu-ray system.  Just a very fun Movie that all can enjoy.
B0060D0S12|5.0|I remember taking my 7 Year old Daughter and 6 Year old Son to the theatre when this came out.  My Daughter was facinated by the story, and when I told her of the real novel, she asked if I could read it to her and her brother as a bedtime story.  It was magic from there on, as she developed a love for great classic stories.  This will give a much softer telling of RL Stevenson's work for the younger children, but if they wish to read the real thing, they will be very surprised at how close it is.  The animation is superb and the soundtrack will give you goosebumps if you have a home theatre setup.  DON'T MISS THIS ONE!
B001BNFR6W|2.0|I was very disappointed with more glitchy dvds. Unless you LOVE the series I would pass on this. The packaging is as it shows in a box set.
B008IGAJJK|5.0|Once I came of age, this was one of the first movies I rented, just to see why it was considered at the time a &#34;taboo&#34; movie. Are you kiddin? This is an absolutely HILARIOUS show, with great acting and great Actors! I've always loved the TV series, but this is the topping on the cake if you will. If you've never seen it, see it.  You won't be dissappointed!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|gets pretty easy once you figure out how to put your places into a formation, but its still pretty fun, very well made game and i can see kids enjoying this quite a bit
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|This blu-ray DVD was very sharp and clear and brought this movie more to being like seeing it live. The movie has a lot of action in it and that really sells the movie for me.
0062020889|1.0|Not worth the read. Utterly predictable and stilted. I am dang sure I could write a better book. Do not buy this thing.  Do not even get it free at the library.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|Very sharp and clear picture...I loved this movie on TV..but even better on blu-ray.  It is Just a real good DVD
B00632HWOG|5.0|Very easy to talk her thru it.  She is  not at all computer savvy. Know she will like Kindle the way we like our 2
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My 4 year old son LOVES this!  The illustrations are incredible and the book is long with tons of different little games to play (read: I actually can get something done while he is involved with this book). It is really my personal interactive book.  ** Scary monster inside** So if your little one doesn't do the monster thing, then move on to a different book.
6305428050|5.0|Great beginning for Elisabeth Shue!  Loved watching this movie with my daughter!  So much fun to see how they get out of each situation!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great gameplay fast and furious but not violent. Children and adults will enjoy playing. It helps improve coordination and is totally addictive.  Stay on top of trains as much ss possible. Look for updates yo different cities.
1475143389|3.0|Gives you the same advice as a lot of blogs out there. This book is really for starters who do not know how to differentiate good from bad. It does talk about a different way of doing your workouts which I might give a try sometime down the line. Overall I will give it 3 stars.
0765326353|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who loves a good story, compelling characters, and a book that is thicker than your hand.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I was slightly disappointed with this show.  It was good but I was expecting it to funnier than it is. Like I said it was good just not great.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book was highly overrated.  Too much sex, too little literature.  I am quite surprised that I have seen children aged 16 and under reading it.  I don't think it should be made available to them.  The way sex is described in the book is not a true depiction of what sex should be like.  It is not how the God of love created it to be.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not as good as the book, but a worthy effort. Casting was as close to perfection for nearly everyone, I thought, especially Lawrence. Harrelson was a surprise as Hamish, but a great surprise- he really did the role justice. However, I felt the two main boys were less than stellar, and that they overplayed the whole wounded puppy dog thing for Peeta. Gale was just so-so, but his role was not as prominent in the movie as in the book. Despite other inconsistencies with the original story that I am sure they had to do for brevity's sake, they got the main ideas of the book across well, and the action was exciting. Overall, very entertaining.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Easy story to follow...draws you in.  I'm reading it slow - I don't want it to be over.  Love the characters.
B008602KQI|3.0|I am actually looking forward to next installment of this saga...I still can't get myself to read these tween books..
B009X01GJ2|4.0|I like the case. but I have a hard time setting it up at times.  I also would appreciate slots for when you have an app that is long ways. The plug in is not user friendly.  It should be accessible at the opposite end.
B000001GQD|5.0|Rubinstein opens in the grand manner, with big sonorous chords and enormous flair. Richter begins in more mysterious, distant tones and swells them up until the orchestra joins in. At this moment, the huge difference in sound quality makes itself felt. The Chicago strings are warm and soft, the Polish strings at the same volume are blurred, even though the mikes are set at a slightly greater distance and reveal more of the space behind them. I mention this because the Richter recording is not in itself defective - here comparisons are odious. When you audition Richter alone, the sound is old, but altogether satisfactory. It's when you switch from one to the other that the RCA sound conveys an impression of great superiority.<br />Interpretively the differences are also very marked. Rubinstein pursues a highly rhetorical manner, the impression persists that he sees the work as an effusion of large gestures, with sad interludes and occasionally protesting gestures. It seems very deliberate in places and artificial, even contrived, especially at those moments when the mood changes abruptly. Richter in contrast grows increasingly passionate, as if he lived inside the music and its soul inflamed him variously to impassioned song alternating with mourning and laments of injury. As a \\"tale\\" or wordless \\"story line\\" this is not just impressive, but thoroughly convincing. Richter takes the \\"Edelkitsch\\" as true coin and treats it accordingly. Rubinstein does not seem to discern the affliction in the music, and substitutes for it the rich filigree of his pianism.<br />The heart of the work emphases this disparity in approach. Rubinstein plays quite fast for an Adagio sostenuto; almost an allegretto, although this may be because he plays each note of the initial arpeggios as single notes. He also doesn't change his touch when the orchestral 'heat' increases. The right-hand tune at roughly 5 min sounds (I'm afraid ) a little finicky, and as matters progress, it seems more like aBernini sculpture than a flow of alternately sad, moody and passionate moments, not emotion-soaked, as the music suggest. Richter makes it very songful, emphasising the welling up and subsidance of moods, almost perfect for this Rachmaninoff trademark. No deliberation, but immersion. and all quite dreamy. Hence climactic moments carry deep conviction; they are not sculpted, but traced out like brush strokes in a dark Rembrandt-like moodscape with occasional lights flaring up and sinking back into the overall brownish colouring.<br />Reiner opens the last movement in real Allegretto but hardly \\"scherzando\\"; in comparison to Wislocki, he seems to be plodding along, trying to make the work sound more heavy than it wants to be, and the comparison leaves the other team as the one who make a more convincing case for slightly more jovial nature of this episode. They also handle the ensuing melodious episode in a more songful and legato manner, suggesting that they are more in tune with Rachmaninoff's creative vision than their counterparts. In addition there are no obvious cuts into Richter's performance, whereas the whole ambience of Rubinstein's piano (and its relation to the orchestra) changes midstream, where obviously a different take was inserted. This can be unsettling. Apart from this, Rubinstein sounds  mannered and wilful, not at all fluent, nor flowing in this central section, whereas Richter keeps up a wonderful sense of legato throughout. The last movement finds him as unquestionably the more singing, musicianly artist of the two.<br />The fill-ups, as always, are a problem. They both demand full reviews, which indeed I've written for albums where those works are the main items on the menu, and I suggest you look them up. Richter has Tchaikovsky No. 1 with Karajan; Rubinstein the Paganini Rhapsody with Reiner again. Both are superlative versions, so choice will depend on your needs. Rubinstein's Paganini Rhapsody is, in my view, a considerably more apposite interpretation than what he offers for Concerto 2. But it is also available in a pairing with Falla; and if you want this work, you have predicament on your hands!<br />To return to Rachmaninoff, It seems to me that Richter comes out as the clear winner as an interpreter, meanwhile his pianism cannot be faulted. The American orchestra is equally clearly superior to its Polish counterpart, but this is of less importance here because it is never asked to play real virtuoso stuff. Finally the RCA recording is undoubtedly better than the DG (which I believe was in any case bought, not recorded by DG). But the DG recording is by no means inadequate, just not as good technically speaking.<br />A clear cut choice, then, for the collector. You ask yourself, where does my principal interest lie? And the answer, I hope, you can extract from my comments.
B0038AL7EW|5.0|Yeah, I cried a little.  Twice.  The actors are so good at portraying emotion, you'd have to made of stone not to leak a little bit.  I love the way the people treated each other with kindness and respect also.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's over. What more can one say? Brandon Sanderson has done exceedingly well in bringing what possibly is the best book series to date to a close, and I am sure Robert Jordan is smiling from his place in the pattern. There were times in reading this final book where I felt as if I couldn't finish it. Or that I wanted to skip to the end to see how things turned out. It drew you in that well to how dire things were. As for the ending.... it ends just as it should... As 'a' ending. One with a twist that can easily be overlooked if one isn't paying attention. It's also an ending which, as all good endings, leaves with us, the readers, able to imagine what comes next.<br /><br />All in all. The Wheel Of Time is a series I will never forget.

Apart from this, Rubinstein sounds mannered and wilful, not at all fluent, nor flowing in this central section, whereas Richter keeps up a wonderful sense of legato throughout. The last movement finds him as unquestionably the more singing, musicianly artist of the two.<br />The fill-ups, as always, are a problem. They both demand full reviews, which indeed I've written for albums where those works are the main items on the menu, and I suggest you look them up. Richter has Tchaikovsky No. 1 with Karajan; Rubinstein the Paganini Rhapsody with Reiner again. Both are superlative versions, so choice will depend on your needs. Rubinstein's Paganini Rhapsody is, in my view, a considerably more apposite interpretation than what he offers for Concerto 2. But it is also available in a pairing with Falla; and if you want this work, you have predicament on your hands!<br />To return to Rachmaninoff, It seems to me that Richter comes out as the clear winner as an interpreter, meanwhile his pianism cannot be faulted. The American orchestra is equally clearly superior to its Polish counterpart, but this is of less importance here because it is never asked to play real virtuoso stuff. Finally the RCA recording is undoubtedly better than the DG (which I believe was in any case bought, not recorded by DG). But the DG recording is by no means inadequate, just not as good technically speaking.<br />A clear cut choice, then, for the collector. You ask yourself, where does my principal interest lie? And the answer, I hope, you can extract from my comments.
B009MO5960|5.0|I put 5 stars because this film is even better in compare with previous. My grandkids love it and it's OK for me too! And I'm sure this is not last film and I hope next will be at least not worst then this one!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A true work of art. I laughed and cried and laughed some more.I couldn't have enjoyed the ending more.  I look forward to the  next  novel by Christina McKenna.
B0091GRI0O|5.0|This is one of my favorite old tomes on human relations and dealing with difficult situations.  As I understand, this was written in his tent after battles, not really for anyone but himself.  Thus, it reads as uncensored, honest and passionate, and is definitely not politically correct text.  To me, that is a good part of its charm.<br /><br />It is very different from Machiavelli, since it doesn't have a rise to power as its desired outcome.  He was already a highly placed military man, and had plenty of power, but there is no ruthlessness in this work.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle version so that I could keep this work at my fingertips.  I've read it so many times in book form that it seemed a valuable addition to my electronic library.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is just what I needed for doodling on my pictures before I send them out or post them online!  Its not photoshop, but it seems to be the best thing for droid right now..
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is one of the few novels that I have read that is truly an epic when looking at the scale of the storyline. Sanderson is able to seam the various character storylines together while keeping each one with its respective identity. His stories are such thaft the reader will guess what is to come next but will then find him or herself wrong. I cannot wait more impatiently for the next novel in this epic saga.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Launches multipal instances and crashes unless you switch back to first instance.  It does not work so well on kolby 10&#34; android tablet.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great app! It has a temple run vibe with an iron man twist. The graphics are great.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|this movie is an abomination to the industry.  never have i been so diappointed in a movie as this one.  the flowing use of racial profanity and F bombs was appalling.  funny how the previews could not represent the true actions of this movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I don't know how I'm going to wait until the fall for the House of Hades...
B00ATPVA78|3.0|I prefer a lot more hidden objects. There was a lot of talking in this. I didn't. Care for that either.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|Greatly historical, suspenseful, and quite interestly! However, for me, the book seemed to drag on and on without an end. Even when I did come to the end I felt I wanted more.
B00AAU7AI0|3.0|The book starts off well, but gets too preachy in the middle pages. Was expecting something novel and intriguing. I liked 'Devil and Miss Prym' which had a good story interwoven with spiritual guidance. In this book its the same spiritual gyaan in different words that you find in Coelho's other books. No story just words coming out of a 'guru's' mouth. The author is getting repetitive with every new release.
B008LD2T6Q|5.0|For a medical type this is an interesting and informative book. The cancer cells from this lady are alive and well in the laboratories of the world.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I just recently read Solstice from the Kindle Single Series, and what a story! It was fast paced from beginning to end. When I read the summary of the story I was not expecting to pick up on a wild adventure ride so soon at the beginning. As I was reading it I felt like I was also watching a movie. There was so much attention given what was going on. I like these Kindle Single Series because they deliver a nice story in a format that is quick to read and full of entertaining value.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really liked this book.  The characters were so likable and memorable.  I couldn't stop thinking about them and wanting to keep going on.  It was a lot of fun reading the &#34;Irish accent&#34;.  I would definitely recommend reading it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Another fun and interesting piece of this series.  The preview into the next book was really exciting and can not wait to read the next one.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|It was not only a movie that had action in it but a movie about a couple that fall in love but had to go their own separate ways.  I miss Whitney I wish she had lived longer and I love Kevin Costner, and any movie he is in.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|The first half of this allegory moves a little slowly.  I could appreciate Harold's discover of himself and life, but it was slow.  Approximately half way through the book the pace of the book picked up when the author adds more of the wife's and their next door neighbors thoughts and actions.  If I were not reading this book for my book club I would have probably not finished it and thus missed a great ending!
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I couldn't download the movie, then tried it again and got charged twice.  I see nowhere that you can get help with this product or dispute the double charge.  Not a great product.  The movie itself was good, would have liked to know the characters more, but the photography is beautiful.  Though provoking, but could have gone deeper.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I lost 30 pounds with Jillian Michaels keeping me going!  This is the one and only workout that I have actually lost weight with!  It is high impact, and a bit intimidating at first, but once you get started there is no time to tell yourself this is too hard.  You just keep going until she says to stop.  It's like having her there in your own living room!  I certainly can never afford a personal trainer, but with this DVD I don't have to!  Jillian Michaels is a Godsend!
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|I think Martin Scorcese directed.  It's creative, imaginative , honest, and insightful. Olivia and Dhani's  invitation to Crackerbbox Condo a real plus. Gracious of Olivia to allow Layla's part of the story in.  Jai Guru Dev.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Watched it late one night , late.  Didn't fall asleep like we usually do.  Very good movie.  Acting was suburb.  We now have the book.  Bet we even watch it again.
B003QSMC18|5.0|This is my favorite &#34;princess&#34; movie because it espouses hard work and discipline like no other film I've seen before. What a great lesson for children! Dr Facilier (dr. easy) is slimy, and scared our daughter (5) a little, but the joys of the movie endure.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Intriguing, mysterious, beautiful graphics, story line and puzzle to boot.  The intrinsic details are absolutely stunning not only in the actual crafting of the puzzle but in the workmanship of the art itself.  A sure winner.  I know I'm close to the end and already I'm feeling dread looming over me knowing that the end is coming.

B000C20VPA|5.0|What needs to be said here? You know the movie. DeNiro. Pesci. Sharon Stone. If this movie isn't in your collection it should be. If you're italian and don't own this movie you should be ashamed. BUY IT!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|this author kept me guessing through out the entire book. There was never a dull moment, I will look for more by Landay.
B00AO686MY|4.0|This is an amazing accomplishment in animation combined with life action.  Disney had done this sort of thing -- \\"The Three Caballeros\\" (1945) being an excellent example -- but not to this degree of finesse.  The animated characters have been made to appear as three dimensional objects in the real world.  Nearly every detail was addressed in this film,  although the reflection of the weasels in the side of their black car was, I believe, missed.  The \\"live\\" cast was quite good here, especially Christopher Lloyd, unforgettably evil.  A few of the original voices were used for some of the animated characters, including the great Mel Blanc and Mae Questel (Betty Boop).<br /><br />But the Blu-ray process has its own oddities in exposing all the details of a given frame.  In the shots combining animated characters with live actors, of which there are several, the evidence of their being process shots is more apparent in the Blu-ray format.  The crystal clarity noted in scenes with actors without animated subjects backs off slightly in scenes combined with animation.  The previous editions in VHS, LD and even DVD could not disclose this degree of information, but Blu-ray is merciless in its divulgence of data and, as the saying goes:  You have to take the bitter with the batter.<br /><br />This is not to say that I didn't enjoy watching this groundbreaking film in Blu-ray -- I certainly did.  But Blu-ray lays it all out in front of us.  Like it or not, it's all there.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It's fun and interesting. You can learn how the settlers developed the state of Oregon and how the people lived in the 1800's!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|materials and workmanship are excellent. it is a heavy duty wood cutter when combined with a wooden baton [aka big ol' tree limb].<br />easily sharpened with my belt sander with 200,400,600 grit belts, finished with a leather belt strop. multiple hand hold options for fine work or chopping. Rockwell hardness perfect for edge holding and ease of sharpening. high carbon steel is much better than stainless for edge holding and durability. you will be glad to have the 6\\" blade and long handle when you start baton work on a big chunk of hardwood. I am a hunter who has harvested over 100 whitetail deer with archery equip. this knife is not the perfect field dresser, but it was not designed to be.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is good but it won't let me upgrade to Tokyo so I'm mad but overall it's pretty good
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It has wonderful characters.  It is all shows wrapped up into one with comedy, suspense, horror, and drama.  It is a great series.
B009MYAQK4|3.0|The book seemed to be written in the style of Kahlil Gibran's book, The Prophet, only less profound. Because it was so directly written as advice, I felt that the message missed the mark as often as it was right on. I did not like it as well as Coelho's other books where the message is more subtle and useful to anyone as they interpret it in the context of one's own life. In most of Coelho's work, there's a story with a moral embedded in it; this time the story line was missing and the wisdom of the advice sometimes fell short.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|This movie had great potential, but fell short big time. If I would have been a movie theater instead of renting it, I would have walkout and asked for my money back.  Again, it is to bad with all these great actors.
B00B5AIB14|1.0|When \\"Live Forever\\" came out I made some negative comments about the sound quality of a few songs and I got slammed by the reviewing community (actually I was just asking if everyone had the same problems, thinking my copy might be defective).  Well, it feels like Island did this Kaya Deluxe Edition release just for me.  \\"We'll show that a-hole.  We'll release a concert where EVERY song sounds terrible, and everybody will love it.\\"  Kudos, Island, you win.  Not only have you put me in my place, but you've made me feel cheated out of twenty dollars, even more so than last time.  You must be very proud.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie more than I expected.  I am not a big Ben Affleck fan, but the combination of actors made the movie.
B004NELBPC|5.0|This app brings different news together and  I like that.  I also like the links to longer articles.  Sometimes the headlines are a bit sensational for what's in the articles.

B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This movies has a couple of great actors, the plot is done well it was enjoyable to watch, thumbs up
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My friend told me about Castle just after the first season had ended. It only took one episode and I was hooked! I've watched almost every episode several times and expect I'll watch them each again another half dozen times before I give myself a break and then watch them again. They are well written and very well acted, and every story well developed - even within the time constraints commercials force them into. Every episode is better than the last, every season more ingenious than the season before. If you're looking for good entertainment, look no more!

B0089TGJ18|5.0|Thank you! I had been wanting a good collection of Blu-Rays with all four movies and I finally got it!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I only grabbed this because it was free. The name was not very enticing. I also think the icon would have kept me from trying this otherwise. I am glad it was free for one day on Amazon because if not I would likely have never used it.<br /><br />First, I love the overscroll feature where you can move the corner of the vnc screen to the middle of your screen to allow you to more easily click on stuff at the edges. I also love how fast you can go from zooming to panning to moving the mouse without having 4 menu clicks.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is the best, the other txting app I have on my kindle never alerts me when someone txts me so I have to check it frequently, bit this app alerts me. Also, if LIKE random people add you to their contacts, you can block them. I also can receive pics, again, unlike my other app. The only problem I have with this app is that lately it has been taking a long time to load, and it can be very annoying.. but other than that, THIS APP IS AWESOME!!!!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book captures you right away.  Though you feel for her expierence you do not feel sorry for her.  She writes with candor and a easy of protraying her journey without being dark.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm thoroughly sucked into this series. I began I to be interested from watching the 1st. Season on HBO. I stopped watching the series in order to read and finish the books first. I have now read all of the books that have been written thus far and I'm anxiously awaiting the next in the series. And beginning to re-start the watching of the series on HBO Go.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|Just was not crazy about this book.  I was very under whelmed. I felt like I have been here and done this already and that others did it better.  Sorry.
B0063M22QO|2.0|The description on how to play the game were hard to understand<br />and not thorough enough for a beginner to play the game. I gave<br />up after trying to play it once.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is a must for all women! Sheryl does an outstanding job of sharing real life experiences in and out of the work place.  I wish I would of had this book 10 years ago!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you are interested in the law, in cause and effect and just generally understanding the dynamics of family and the hard decisions families often face in times of tragedy, this book will keep you interested from beginning to end. It's a little open ended but that also makes it interesting. The writing is very good. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Landay's work.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun. Keeps you wanting to play more. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys playing bingo or slots
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Without any question this is the most impressive and thorough Eagles bio available. Very pleased and impressed! Thanks. It's a no holds barred look at one of classic rocks finest.
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|I enjoy dark series and this is definitely a dark show.  The cast was excellent.  I didn't like that a lot of good people died, but that is also what kept me glued.  I truly like a show that I cannot predict and I could not predict what was going to happen next.  I was different than any other show out there right now.  It was a great dark, thriller.  I would recommend if you like those types of programs.  Can't wait for Season 2.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|It's a real bummer losing David, but don't let that stop you from enjoying Matt. It's still awesome DW. Be warned that under Moffat it does get a littler darker than with RTD but, not so much that it's not enjoyable.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book.  I chose it because it was recommended by a friend and it is not the usual Stephen King novel.  It is perfect for Kindle; the paperback is thick and unwieldy.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|While many other versions of thie Story of the crucefixion have been presented I found this to capture to pain and suffering of Jesus  that so many went through  including his mother  like none of the others have been able or willing to<br />portray.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The visual effects are outstanding.  The story line is moving.  This film deserved every award it was nominated for. Great!
6303637493|5.0|This is an excellent view of  one life of a famous Castra<br /> I had a prior copy but it was foreign and no caption so I had<br /> to peice it together from what was shown  and what I knew<br /> but this has captions so I enjoyed it so much and realized<br /> how much I had missed in the earlier foreign version
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|Found this little game addicting!  Trying to build the bridge with the lightest materials yet strong enough for the trucks is challanging.  This is great for the little builder in all of us.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Quite possibly one of my favorite shows on tv right now.  All in all its has a great cast and great chemistry with the characters.
0738727326|5.0|The art is so beautiful and delicated. I'm a fan of this kinda fantasy artwork. And i have to tell, this deck gave my many lucks lately. Totally love it to the heart.
1597801585|3.0|WARNING: MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />This is a book that I imagine is going to be very polarizing for many readers. Most people will either love or hate it.  Therefore, I hope to provide a balanced perspective on the books strengths/weakenesses.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />1. Bacigalupi comes from the George R. R. Martin school of writing science fiction and fantasy.  Expect graphic rape scenes, important character deaths, a number of different viewpoint characters, and lots of chapter-ending twists.  I'm a huge Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) fan, so this works for me.  However, Martin's books are also very polarizing for some readers, so I imagine a number of people will consider this to be a major fault.  Whether this is a good thing comes down to personal taste of the reader.<br /><br />2. The Windup Girl provides a fairly immersive world for readers who can traverse all the environmental-techno jargon.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />1.  While Bacigalupi is clearly influenced by Martin's style, he's clearly not Martin.  I'd say half the character viewpoints aren't particularly well-written.  I really had to trudge through Jaidee and Kanya's chapters. Likewise, Emiko, the Windup Girl referenced in the title, could probably have her viewpoint chapters removed from the entire novel and nothing would be missed.  Anderson and Hock Seng are both fairly well done for a young author, but when 3 of the 5 main viewpoints are not worth reading, this novel isn't a good novel.<br /><br />2. For all the environmental-techno jargon that the author throws at the reader, it is very poorly explained.  After reading the novel, I'm still not sure what is \\"cibiscosis\\" or \\"blister rust.\\"  There are many references to U-Tex rice and other \\"calorie company\\" products, but at the end of the day, these don't make Bacigalupi's world deep.  All these random terms do is make the storytelling very convoluted. Some people like their science fiction that way.  I don't.<br /><br />3. The plot goes nowhere.  If you read the first 300 pages, the book has the feeling that it is an introduction to a much larger story, in the same way that A Game of Thrones was the opening for ASOIAF. However, the way Bacigalupi ends the novel eliminates most reasons for having a sequel.  Based on the huge cast of characters, I imagine he planned a bigger story, and then just threw in the towel.  So, really, what are we left with?  250 pages of rambling about environmental-techno jargon and 100 pages of a city in revolution that just burns itself out.  I understand character-driven stories don't need a heavy plot, but these characters were not worth the expenditure to get through the novel.<br /><br />4. Bacigalupi often resorts to cheap plot devices.  They don't really advance the plot, so much as they surprise the reader (well, some readers, after the second time he uses one, his style became fairly predictable for me).  Unpredictable storytelling is not the only metric for a good writer.  The reader must still enjoy what's happening between the pages.<br /><br />The Downright Disappointing<br /><br />1. Here's my biggest complaint.  The book is called the Windup Girl, and the idea behind New People was the main reason I picked up this novel.  However, Emiko's role is of so little importance to the plot, and her character is fairly uninteresting in its own right.  To summarize, she's a hooker that gets mistreated throughout the novel.  If I wanted to read that plot line, I'd go pick up something by Frank Miller.  Other than her role in one of the many cheap plot devices, the role of New People has little relevance to the environmental-techno cloak and dagger story that Bacigalupi wanted to tell.<br /><br />2.  The Ending. Really, after finishing this novel, I just feel (gene)ripped off.  For all the hype about Gibbons, the Dung Lord, and Emiko's escape to a land of New People, nothing really happens for any of these plot lines.  I think any of these stories would have been better than the cheesy revolution plot we got.<br /><br />While The Windup Girl is pretty good for a novel by a young author, it's only average compared to most established authors.  The book clearly had potential to be good/great, but I think the author was too obsessed in describing Thailand and coming up with terms for his genetically-modified agriculture dystopia.  He clearly needed to spend more time in figuring out a good story.r than the cheesy revolution plot we got.<br /><br />While The Windup Girl is pretty good for a novel by a young author, it's only average compared to most established authors.

B006PAZMMK|5.0|I love Skrillex, but when I got my hands on this album, I could not stop listening to it. It is rare to come across an album in which you like every single song. Well congratulations, Bangarang has been added to the list. I want to point out two specific songs.<br /><br />Breakn' a Sweat<br />Man, when I heard the first 3 seconds of this song, I knew right away that I was going to love this song. The beat for some reason hooked me to loving this song. From there, I listened to the remix by Zedd, which is awesome btw!<br /><br />The Devil's Den<br />It took me 2 or 3 listens to finally get hooked to this song, which became my favorite song by Skrillex. The song is so different and unique. I cannot express myself.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Sort of a Bond film anyway. I didn't like it, but might be a purist. I vote that you skip it.
0345803493|3.0|I thought the first book in this series was full of emotional tension - it kept me interested, and I actually got so absorbed in the abusive and manipulative character dynamics that it was a bit disturbing for me. So when I was about to read a sequel called \\"50 Shades Darker,\\" I braced myself and dove in, and I was surprisingly bored by the \\"light and fluffy\\"-ness of the relationship. I thought it was interesting during the first chapter, but from there on the progression just sort of slowed - there wasn't much tension or character conflict. I still enjoyed the character development, and some interesting things happened in the later part of the book that kept me hooked. I thought the sex scenes just got in the way - there were so many of them, and they are very repetitive, and they often happened at odd times, interrupting the plot and the bit of story suspense that remained.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is fun and its a great thing to do when you have nothing to do. I suggest this game to anyone who likes temple run or fun run.

B00005JKLZ|4.0|They really did a fantastic job with the remake of this classic.  It is really quite an accomplishment to even come close to the old version by , however these guys did a surprisingly good job.
034580404X|2.0|This book received way more hype than it was worth. The writing was mediocre, the steamy sex scenes were lukewarm at best. I was very disappointed in this purchase.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, perhaps in part because it wasn't like so many others I've read. There was real emotion & lots of conflict. The ending simply blew me away.

B005PK57IK|5.0|We hadn't watched The Good Wife until we saw it on Amazon Instant Streaming.  After watching the first show of Season 1, we were hooked.  We have watched all the Seasons available on Amazon and it gets better.  The acting is top rate, the characters are well-written and &#34;real&#34; and the action never stops.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I tried several others but I like this one the best.  mikey says try it , you will love it too.

B00AWJYJVA|3.0|Where language normally is a main driver for any Carré book, This time, at times, there harly seems to be anything else. Such as a plot, details or sound motivations.<br />A Disappointment.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|For me this book was a real inspiration and understanding of a lot of processes that happen in our society, in my workplace and in my mind. So many things that I felt and experienced suddenly were put into words and I saw them from aside realizing that I'm not the only one who feels this way and that there are things that I can change or improve.<br /><br />The chapter about the impostor syndrom was a real revelation for me. All of my life I've been thinking that I'm just covering up for my insecurity by showing self-confidence. For me it was a show and I thought that I am the only one who does it this way - all the rest are just self-confident.<br /><br />\\"Don't leave until you really leave\\" was one of the most important advices for me. I'm 30, have a partner and we are planning to have kids in 4-5 years from now. I just signed a new contract at work for the next 3 years BUT thinking of having children soon, I didn't even talk about promotions and possible career oportunities. This book made me rethink my situatuion and understand that 3-4 years in my career is a long time and a lot of opportunities that I can miss. I, who took tons of courses about feminism at the university, was shocked how blind I was about my career choices.<br /><br />I can talk about more examples from this book that made me think and made me see things more clearly. I cannot say much about all the studies that were mentioned in the book - if they were right or wrong or one-sided. I just know how a woman feels in our modern society - a woman who works, who loves her work and who is planning to build a family one day in this same society. I know that this book spoke to my feelings, about my hesitations and choices that I make and I am really grateful to the author for writing this book and making me understand so many things inside me.<br /><br />I think this book is also important for us as parents to think about what we put in the heads of our children and how we raise them to equality.<br /><br />I recommended this book to all of my female friends and their husbands.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This band is awesome!!! Love the music. Highly recommended!! This is one of my favorite bands in a long time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. It's easy to use and has nice big numbers! I highly recommend it to everyone.
B002RSDW80|3.0|As a teacher I thought this would be perfect to show in my hs culinary classes. The wonderful techniques and both characters' passion for their craft would be an inspiration to students.. Unfortunately I could not show it due to the one line where Meryl Streep states the manicotti are hotter than a stiff cock. One line ruins a great teaching tool.
B008AX1HD8|2.0|As an Australian I found the attempt at understanding Australia and Aboriginal mythology was very poor. ther were many factual errors
034552554X|5.0|A shocking start kept me riveted to this book.  The changing of years back and forth was dizzying at times, but necessary for the story to evolve.  A very interesting read.
B002JC9RMY|1.0|I can't believe Toriyama would sign off on this. :( They should have renamed the movie, all the characters, and taken away any element that might have connected it to the anime/manga. I MIGHT have appreciated it then. Don't waste your money. Any of you that call yourself Dragon Ball/Z fans that rated this well are traitors.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is just a fun game. The kid love to seethe dragons race and grow up.The older kids like the game to
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best book I've read in awhile. Wow. To imagine negative would of been like if Kennedy wasn't shot. 5 stars for this!!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This is a very nice note app, but I'd love it if there was a widget available. The layout is nice and very easy to use.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Needs more missions and its great other than repeats of missions fun to play keeps the kids entertained for hours
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Recommend for family and kids, this is something that doesn't drive me nuts when watching it over and over again.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.<br /><br />First, I will say that I do not require a &#34;Hollywood ending,&#34; and I don't mind that the author didn't wrap everything neatly in the closing chapters and paragraphs of the story.  My complaint is not that I didn't like the end.  I have many complaints to voice, and they're not all necessarily with the story itself.<br /><br />I am not sure a story of this nature is best told in first person, and it seems the author, himself, was uncertain of his POV.  He switches points of view within the story, and sometimes the 'dialogue' is presented as if directly from courtroom transcripts.  The language and conversation during those exchanges are not authentic (even if the author and the narrator are attorneys).<br /><br />Further, I was not able to identify with any of the characters, no matter how I tried.  That, too, is the fault of the author.  His characters are not fleshed out, and are far from complex.<br /><br />I did read negative reviews prior to purchasing the book, as I am not someone who jumps on bandwagons and I don't necessarily agree with the 'must read' recommendations of others.  This includes the opinions of professional critics.  I can't say I would add this title to my own must read recommendations to my friends - or to anyone reading this.<br /><br />Thanks for asking. :)
B00947N6UG|5.0|Came early, and is the favorite movie around this house. All the characters are great and the story line is fabulous.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a good game and all but the pc vertion is better.  This would be an even better game if it would let me get<br />the update. My brother and my friend got it but it won't let me get it. If you people at amazon can e-mail me on how to deal with this that would be grate. Untill then I'll just ask for my friends help.  -me.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|this movie is good and this is the second time I've bought this item!!! but the first fright night will always be number 1. Collin Farrell is the reason I bought this movie the other actors were okay but Collin Farrell stole the show, to me he did!!!!
B009R659L8|4.0|The book has many twists & turns. You think you have it figured out & something happens that has you retinking everything.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|It started out good then got on the screen with the record player and the last piece I needed got frozen could not get it.I guess I wasted a little money on this one. I hope there are not many problems with more apps.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I cant even open the game it never loads ever. I thought this was going to be good but I cant even play it.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|I really liked this book.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of the full 5 is because some parts drug on.  The plot was really well executed, and I look forward to reading the next book.  However, there were a lot of instances where sentences could have been combined or pronouns put to better use.  Other than that it was an enjoyable book, and I most certainly will recommend it to my friends.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Engrossing.  good character descriptions.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good mystery and also inter- relationship stories and analyses..
B005IA9JZO|4.0|This was a good movie. Blu ray makes it some better but not worth the extra cost. Stay with your regular movie on this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and I love it.  It works very well and does not require wifi.  AWESOME GAME!!!!<br />>KC
B00A4OALL0|4.0|What am I doing here among all these knowledgeable Wayne Shorter fans?  I haven't listened to him much since his Weather Report days.  However I've been buying a lot of vocal jazz and needed a change of pace.  I read an article about this album in Downbeat and decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did. Shorter plays both tenor and soprano sax and I've never been a fan of soprano sax.  However it works for me on this album. I hope I have just a small percentage of the energy and creativity that Shorter has if and when I approach 80. I've only listened to this album about a half a dozen times but I like it better each time.  And I'm getting more of an appreciation for Danilo Perez's piano work.  This is not an album that works as \\"background music to my life.\\"  I have to set aside some time to listen to it more carefully.  It is worth the effort.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It's loved the free version and now this one is the full version. I love this game. This is the best stick man adventure game ever.
B0053O89JM|5.0|House is the most annoying character on TV, but the show is not only entertaining, but it can be educational.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|It plays back your PDFs and remembers where you left off when you come back.<br />With the added voices, mentioned in an earlier review, this product is fantastic.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I like this show, but would have liked Peter to have been more involved. Tried harder, perhaps. I love these characters Gold is funny and makes for a great addition
0385349947|5.0|Amazing book!!!<br />Without apologies discusses the issue that it is 2013 and women are still denied equal opportunity. It also discusses some of the self imposed roadblocks women incur to rise to the top of their field or organization.
B0060FXDCG|4.0|I enjoy these movies because I like the transformer idea and remember when the first transformer type toys came out when my children were young, in the late 70's.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|The  reviews I read stated that this was a different style for NS.  Well i found it was the same. a typical predicitable sappy story.  It reinforces my prior resolve to avoid Books by NS.
0783230370|5.0|These 3 are such a good group. Danny Davito keeping things going while Arnold deals with raging hormones and pregnancy appetites, Emma Thompson was soooooo funny, naively stumbling about the odd happenings that keep coming her way. Lots of giggles and laughs.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This product is excellent for playing Role playing games on the nintendo 3DS. The only downside to this this product is that it is very bulky and has trouble fitting into your pocket afterwards, which is expected anyway.
B00003CWRX|5.0|While he lost his family and bravely faced the tobacco industry's lies about noncarcinogen cigarettes, he's come out smelling like a rose, very successfully and fruitfully lecturing around the country. I'm glad his children know how truly wonder this honest and courageous man is.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|I was very disappointed in this movie, it seemed like a lot of liberal clap-trap.  The hero in this story is a murderer and the villain is corrupt politician.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play this game everyday if i have a chance to and when i am very bored I play this game 6 times a day. (:
0743297334|4.0|I can't quite fully explain this but this novel reminds me a little bit of &#34;The Sheltering Sky&#34; but if some of the principle characters weren't idiots unprepared for travel. Rational? No, but who cares?<br /><br />I'd call this a cleanly crafted and damn good read. Some of the aspects of life that the book hints at were cutting edge in their acknowledgment for its day.<br /><br />I am not going to give you a synopsis of the book, this is a review. If you really want to know what goes on read the blasted thing.<br /><br />When you do I won't doubt that you'll find you'll want a cocktail since the characters dink on almost every page. You'll feel useless and energized at the same time and if you're an American, wanting to become an expat.<br /><br />Pour yourself a good whiskey and soak it all in, just like the rocks you tossed in the tumbler.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved it. Though I had read the book over thirty years ago really enjoyed the movie. Can't wait for the next one.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This story is such a good one. It takes a impoverished young African-American and the family who takes him in brings him to a better life and teaches him about life and helps him get to college. A very good story about racial and school struggles.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As one gets older one is more curious about the afterlife. here is a good glimps of it written by someone whom you can believe.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This story was very informative on a part of history I did know existed.I could read only small parts at a time.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Good actors and actresses.  This is one to watch when you want a good dose of sarcasm and llaughter. I could watch it over and over.
B003008RWA|4.0|This movie makes me want to live in a different country. American has some pretty horrible policies. Must watch this!
B009X01GJ2|4.0|While I love the color and the way it's set up, I sometimes wish that the was a little bit more angle when reading with it sitting on the table.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|I like it. It's pretty fun, good action in this game. I'll keep playing it for a while. Good game.
1608871452|5.0|This book was amazing! It had so many great things added, not just the interviews and explanations about the season, but also the pictures and quality.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game, play it all the time!  It's exciting and easy to move around.  I like that I can completely control my character.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|My 8 year old watched this about a million times and loved it. Me, well, it was ok.  I grew up playing all these video games, so I knew who everyone was, but she didn't. Kind of weird, in that the characters were for the parents' generation but the movie was for kids.
B009NX88JU|5.0|This movie is great. It is especially funny and entertaining if you happen to be a music lover. Another perk is the great soundtrack.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Totally got ripped off at the Oscars.  Ben's always great and this movie was worth every buck spent to rent it.
B008M721MS|3.0|I have no recollection of having added this product to my Kindle.  Did it come as standard equipment or what?<br />I might be inclined to use it at some point, but it isn't something I would do on a regular basis.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|The game is awesome and a lot of people play this. Who ever invented the game I would give him two thumbs up
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It tells me how long my device will last with the power it has and it tells me how long it will take to charge at the rate it is charging.
B000VX1CF8|5.0|I love this shoe, and my co-workers asked me where they could buy them.This shoe is casual and professional, and looks excellent with khaki pants. The quality is good, and it is so comfortable. This shoe is the symbol of good products made by the U.S.<br /><br />I will buy this shoe as long as they have it in the market. It has a perfect design.
B00881PTRC|2.0|Most of the words that I've tried to guess are so &#34;out there&#34; that it's not even fun to guess. The graphics are cute but I'm uninstalling.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|Those saying this album is a masterpiece are not exaggerating.  It's sad yet happy, blissful yet depressing, haunting yet beautiful.  It's one of those few special albums I can truly listen to from beginning to end.  In songs like Run Boy Run the deep airy drums drive you forward and as if to tell you to take hold of your destiny, the lyrics convince you to keep running and fighting, then the strings reveal the beauty of the struggle of life and the reason it's all worth it.  Conquest Of Spaces is another favorite of mine.  It perfectly expresses the beauty of the universe and all the struggles of humanity along with the mesmerizing and never ending search for answers within it.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Great history lesson on the Blues and the head cut'n song is a must to have on hand Steve Vai is just awesom to watch.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark does not disappoint you! Her  characters are real and memorable. This novel is a great summer read - you will be surprised at the ending !
B002ZG98VE|5.0|The theatrical version is very good but leaves open holes in th story that the directors cut additional sceens fill in making this movie even more of a hit. In my opinion the best Robin Hood story ever.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is not only helpful for women, but for all minorities grappling with the typical American corporate culture.  I've recommended it to Asian American men, who wonder if they're too collectivist for the American workplace.  It contains practical advice on how to give oneself a voice but also &#34;be nice.&#34;  All it needs is a chapter (perhaps written by her husband) on how to balance work and home when the corporate world can be so unforgiving of men who put family first.  If you think about it, the idea that men put work ahead of family must be a facade and one that's hard to perpetuate over time.  Who, at the end of their lives, men or women, wish they worked another 80-hour-week?  And yet many corporations believe that for men to truly be committed, they can't want to work flex hours.  Paradigm shifter.  This and getting to 50/50.  Totally worth the read.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|I first seen this on HBO, I just really like the story and the work they did creating Paul its entertaining and funny.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am a huge Lord of the Rings and Hobbit fan, I have read the whole series, and have the hardcover omnibus.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Looking forward to her next book..this wasn't as good as Shopaholic series but some funny bits in it that really made me laugh
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|i couldnt figure out how to make the lines larger, so its ok. would like an easier way to find this out.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Seems to me this man can not pen a bad book. Wish there were more like him. This is a very good book to relax and enjoy the plot. Hope this helps someone out there.
B004LUS390|5.0|It does what it says, its great for on the go. It works perfect on my kindle with no issues.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I would've liked a little more story after the battle, after investing so much time into these characters you really want to know what happens with them.  The other reason I only gave it 4 stars was I believe there was a  discrepancy with LAN. He was in the blight fighting along with the rest of the border landers and next thing I know he's in Merrilor with Matt?  I could be wrong I didn't go back to check but you can let me know if I am.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|It's a free, short book about HTML 5; you can finnish it in 1 or 2 hours. After that, I don't think that you can learn more about HTML 5. Because you can find same ideas on internet everywhere. It's free, this is the only thing that I can praise.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I like Denzel Washington and he does a good job in this movie.  Also the price of the DVD and the time it took to ship were good.
B00BSBUZT6|3.0|This is a great documentary for Eagles and non Eagles fans alike.. Picture quality and sound quality are better than I expected but don't expect reference quality. The Bonus disc is just that.. its not a full concert just 8 songs. like others have said it is too short... probably because its so good you just crave more. Very interesting perspective on members of the band. Some of the members I would love to meet and others I would never want to meet. Very little on the individual members lives outside the band.. maybe its because they didn't have much of an outside life during that time. Highly recommended although the price has just been raised from 24.96 to 29 dollars. Now all they need to do is release the Hell Freezes Over concert on Blu-ray disc.
B004I4D0KQ|4.0|Can you believe it? Meatloaf's BAT OUT OF HELL (1977) has sold more 43 million copies worldwide and continues to move at the rate of 200,000 a year!<br /><br />In retrospect ironic, as just bringing this album to completion was an ordeal for Meatloaf and musical collaborator Jim Steinman. Rejected after widely auditioning the songs they planned to record, these two even had to endure smarmy insults from CBS's Clive Davis, an out-of-touch A&R man who singlehandedly crashed Tony Bennett's career by forcing him to cover current pop songs.<br /><br />To shorten the saga, Todd Rundgren loved this material and agreed to produce the LP. He brought in members of his group Utopia and a couple from Springsteen's E Street Band. Edgar Winter also played sax on \\"All Revved Up.\\" With funding from Todd, in late '75 they were off and running. A deal was signed with EPIC subdivision, CLEVELAND Int'l.<br /><br />After sessions were completed, there were disagreements on the mixdown, especially Rundgren's work on \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light.\\" Eventually Steinman, Meatloaf and John Jansen came up with a mix on the song that the vocalist OKed for the album. This eight-plus minute pop masterpiece would eventually peak at #39 on Billboard's Hot 100.<br /><br />Back in the day, I listened exclusively to the three tracks on Side Two: \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad,\\" an introspective ballad, the frenetic \\"Paradise...\\" and \\"For Crying Out Loud,\\" a quieter song about redemption through love that has some suggestive lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Dashboard Light\\" is famous for matching NY Yankees play-by-play announcer Phil Rizzuto with obvious making-out noises from Meatloaf and co-vocalist Ellen Foley. It's a musical description of teens necking by a lake who urgently heat up and \\"go all the way tonight.\\" Their parked car ritual, graphic as it may be, is a universal coming-of-age memory that spans many generations, and is an experience captured so well by this innovative song. For \\"Paradise\\" alone, BAT OUT OF HELL will always be remembered.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[9:56] Bat Out of Hell<br />[5:04] You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night) (spoken intro: Jim Steinman/Marcia McClain)<br />[4:38] Heaven Can Wait<br />[4:19] All Revved Up with No Place to Go<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[5:23] Two Out of Three Ain't Bad<br />[8:28] Paradise by the Dashboard Light (duet w/Ellen Foley)<br />[8:45] For Crying Out Loud<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 46:33T OUT OF HELL will always be remembered.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[9:56] Bat Out of Hell<br />[5:04] You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night) (spoken intro: Jim Steinman/Marcia McClain)<br />[4:38] Heaven Can Wait<br />[4:19] All Revved Up with No Place to Go<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[5:23] Two Out of Three Ain't Bad<br />[8:28] Paradise by the Dashboard Light (duet w/Ellen Foley)<br />[8:45] For Crying Out Loud<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 46:33

B009NG1Q96|4.0|The Elite was well thought out and was to me defiantly worth the wait. It took me by surprise in a lot of parts and I can honestly say that i was up all night reading  it. The book was filled with parts you cannot predict what would happen next and that is one of my favorite parts. All together I am glad I read this book and I hope everyone out there enjoyed it as much as I did.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|i loved the fighting  russian santa it was fun i didnt think i would like it but it was great a watch agian movie
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The book had a great and long build up to weak ending. It started as a page turner and then faded.
B006UUK612|5.0|a movie we watched with the kids in the 80's we loved it then and some movies dont travel thru the years well but i enjoyed this just as much this time as last
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun and addictive. The initial build-up is slow and frustrating, but fun after one has progressed enough. The latest update, however, is causing frequent glitches. Suggest one quickly build one's team to increase bonuses and gifting.
1402775458|5.0|We chose this book as a birthday gift, and wasn't sure about ordering something we had not held in our hands to examine.  We were very pleasantly surprised at how nice the quality was.  Lots of gorgeous illustrations throughout, &#34;antique&#34; look pages, sewn-in ribbon bookmark, nice size.  Can't say enough about it.  You wouldn't be disappointed.  Awesome price for such a gem of a book!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|What a perfect movie my daughters love this movie and have watched it over and over. Jim Carrey is the ultimate Scrooge.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is an amazing series, a must see for everyone. Very sexual, so definitely not suited for a younger audience. The series is close to the book, which I reading as well.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Free and this fun you have to get it if your an iron man fan or a marvel fan in general
B008Y768XO|5.0|Hatchi made me, my husband, and my seven-year old cry like babies.  My daughter cried at the end of the movie, and asked for a dog, &#34;right now!&#34;  This was well done, and of course, Richard Gere's outstanding acting made the movie top notch.  I loved it.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I attended the premiere of Iron Man 3 on May 3rd in 3D.  It was spectacular!<br /><br />The acting, the visuals; you name it!  Iron Man 3 is epic!  Iron Man 3 is about Tony Stark's past haunting him, and a new evil rising, The Mandarin.  There are a few surprising twists in this film that may confuse you, but they turn out to be funny ones!  I find that Iron Man 3 is the most comedic movie in the franchise, from jokes to puns and beyond.  This adds to the lighter tone of this movie.  I recommend this movie for children over eight, for there are several frightening scenes in it.  In the end, Iron Man 3 is the best film of 2013, and possibly one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins Second Book of the Hunger Games is just as, if not more, incredible and unpredictable as the First Book of the Hunger Games.  It is one of those books you  can't put down and then, are dying to pick it up again.  I can't wait to read Mockingjay!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I really like the game, it's engaging and entertaining, however for some reason my game resets. So far I have two different games I'm playing and I never know which one it will be when I load up. :/
B00CHILW64|5.0|This movie had me in tears the whole time!  The reenactment of the tsunami that hit Thailand was overwhelmingly real and captured for me how horrific an event it was.  The devastation following that event was hard to take in, but just when you didn't think you wanted to know more, they put very hopeful moments in the movie.  I think this movie truly shows the hope and perseverance of the human spirit and because of that it was the reward of watching this movie!  The oldest son in this movie was terrific!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Gotta love the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, right? I got this sonic screwdriver for a Halloween costume, and I've used it at a few comic cons as well. The batteries last quite a while, as do the pens. (just be careful not to misplace the extra pen nib). It's a well-made item, with awesome features. Definitely recommend it.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I am a fan of collectible card games and this is a good one. I am just starting and it seems like the difficulty ramps up pretty quickly but I like a challenge.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Tim Burton and Danny Elfman at their best. You gotta love the creep-yet-hilariousness of it, and the very catchy songs. This is certainly one of the best stop-motion animation full-length feature films out there. It's a masterpiece, and a great gift for either Halloween or Christmas
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE IT!!!!!!<br />I wish that u could spawn flint and steel in creative, though<br />IM REALLY GOOD AT IT
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the one game I play on a consistant basis. The game play is smooth and the graphics are bright and happy. Highly recommended.
0071752854|1.0|I bought this book because it was highly rated on Amazon. From the beginning (pages 2-3), I smelled BS: On page 2, the author presents Jonathan (the recipient of his pitch) as an investment banker, and on page 3 he says \\"if you want to be taken seriously in venture capital, you need to have done a deal with this guy\\". What's wrong with this statement? Well, the thing is that venture capitalists invest in startups (seed stage, early stage, late stage, etc). Investment bankers typically do not invest in startups, they come into the game when these startups are either acquired or go public (they facilitate these transactions). It is possible for an investment banker to get involved before the exit (acquisition or IPO), for example when their client wants to make a private investment in a company before it is taken public, but these situations are relatively rare, and in any case VC's get involved before IB's, so it is hard to see how an investment banker can become a bellwether for venture capitalists. So the statement sounded strange. Well, maybe that was a unique investment banker I thought... Reading further... On page 6, the author states that he works for Geyser Holdings, \\"the most profitable venture firm you've never heard of\\". Well, I heard about most of \\"the most profitable venture firms\\", and this one was not among them, so I decided to google it. Guess what? It is a real estate investment firm acquiring distressed properties. There is nothing wrong with real estate investments, but it has NOTHING to do with venture capital. But I guess after the housing bubble the author did not think that real estate sounded sexy enough.<br />Returning this book tomorrow. Oren Klaff, I want my $3.99 back for shipping this thing back to Amazon! Amazon, check if your rating system is being manipulated.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book not one of my normal reads  but very good in going to watch the movie now<br /> :)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My sister got me hooked on this show. I love it!! I've watched them a few times already! These shows will be watched for years to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing a always play it its so fun but I couldn't choose between it and temple run but it's better than angry gran run!!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is just the right combination of drama, humor, romance, and mystery.  The characters and partnerships are well played. We love it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|You can do what ever you want and its free. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking foa game like sim city.
B00583WEYY|4.0|Let's face it, it's hard to follow up a giant album like Let's Dance, so anything else is bound to disappoint. Bowie made a decent album as a follow up, although it's not nearly as good as his good stuff. Everyone knows &#34;Blue Jean,&#34; of course and who can forget that video? &#34;Loving the Alien&#34; and &#34;Don't Look Down&#34; aren't bad songs either. A lot of people think Bowie tailed off after Let's Dance, but I've developed a real appreciation for his later work, starting with Tonight. Cautiously recommended to Bowie fans.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is the best game I have played in a while. It's colorful. It's adventurous and it looks like the real movie! Like I said, this game is great!
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|I guess it might be fun for a non-brain game...but don't see the purpose. Maybe I'm not getting the point???
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game isn't not cool all of the players who have it is cool I am a gamer and I know it cool iron man
B00003CXA6|5.0|I saw it on television.  I am looking forward to seeing it again.  I enjoy historicl movies..  The acting is wonderful.
B002UP1SUE|5.0|Rollins, as usual, manages to pack fast-paced action into a highly readable text. I find his characters interesting and believeable, and he's an author I read over and over again. This one was no exception.
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|I bought this album based on reviews. I needed to listen to her more than once to fully appreciate it.
1885167776|5.0|Yes, it's about ONE THING but it peels back the layers of the One Thing \\"onion\\" in a way you never saw coming.  A great supplement for folks who appreciate Tony Robbins.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I like the auto play features. Just tap the card and it goes to the right place. Nice looking cards.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|I know.....it's cool.....Oscar nominations and all....but come on...do I really need too watch this?  Probably not. Switched to &#34;A Royal Affair.&#34;  Much better.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I had seen the original version and found the graphic displays of human cruelty to be somewhat extreme. This version still shows it but not as graphically nor as prolonged. The original could well have been edited to this version and would have been just as effective.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|WARNING!!! This game has a built in time machine that allows you to travel into the future while you are playing it! You will spend an amazing amount of time playing the game that it gets away from you in a hurry. Very addictive and simple game to play, yet challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. All that needs to be said. Download it, you WILL NOT regret it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great TV series depend on a group of actors with real chemistry plus compelling situations. It doesn't get more compelling than zombies, and the actors in Walking Dead are, by now, family.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Grabs your heart & soul from the beginning. Enzo is a wise spirit awaiting a metamorphosis from dog to man. His story teaches us much of what it takes to be human. Enzo's story is an emotional ride that parallels his owner's striving to be a race car champion!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is titled perfectly.  This is the proof, as far as I'm concerned.  Who better than a non-believing neurosurgeon to be given this experience?<br /><br />A must-read.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|Seems to be a very good map.  However is there a key to the symbols used?? I have not found that.Will use it in Paris next week.  It looks very good and I think I will find it useful.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Not a bad game. It seems to run smoothly on kindle fire and the graphics are decent as well. It really helps pass time.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Great music that I have been listening to constantly for a couple of weeks now while writing and working. It makes me want to see the movie just for the music. (I'm not a Cruise fan.)
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|I got this so I could listen to my Google Drive docs. I could not find a way to make that work. So I uninstalled it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|it fun to play .....didn't think I would like it but do ...my niece even likes to play...I don't think you should have to buy somethings but it ok...ill posy without them
B009KEN87O|3.0|I love the more retro games, but this one hit a wall with me real quick. With so many games out there, I get bored if I get stuck at one screen too long. I got stuck, so I uninstalled it. The first few levels are great though. I am glad it was a free app of the day, because if I had paid for it I would have been bummed.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't wait for the next one. I was sad to realize this was the last book of the series. I've read a lot of historical novels, but can't find another book/author in this genre that captivates me as much as George R.R. Martin. I love his books!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I liked the story but it could of been grittier in looking at bipolar disorder  This movie is supposedly &#34;independent&#34; but was still too Hollywood for my taste.  I think Bradley Cooper did a a great acting job in this, but should have been given more too work with.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|It was great from a day if that. Every time I would  want to get a video it would say locked and ask me to purchase it...Again. So I closed the app to see if I needed to do just a restart and still screwed me. And no I didn't try 1080 resolution. Worst camera app I've come across, waste of .99 cents but I'm deleting it after this review. Keep in mind also I NEVER give one star ratings but I missed a lot of moments of my kid because of this damned app
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|Poor excuse to make a movie just to have a black man be a cowboy hero in a Western. Way too violent and not enough reality.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I seriously love this game. It started with my friend and then it came out on the kindle and it ia SO FUN! But even so, lately this game has been crashing. I don't like that. Otherwise, AWESOME!
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Maybe something got lost in this translation from French to English.  I couldn't get past a few pages of this cumbersome book.  I felt like it was something that I would have had to read for a class, and I'm just looking for pleasure reading at this point.  I can't recommend it for pleasure reading, although I'm sure a gazillion people would disagree with me.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|A great movie for kids and adults alike. Our 2 year old son watches this over and over and over, and I actually don't mind watching it with him. It's a great movie, excellent entertainment, and even has a good message. HIGHLY recommended.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|Most of the album is whack but there are 1 to two songs that are okay but dont waste your monney its not worth it
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Needs brighter colors, would eliminate the color blue from the display,better background, add purple<br />It is a fun distraction, though.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It did not do what I wanted, and my antivirus app detected some problems that will make system slower. I understand developers need ads, but do not develop products that takes many resources, that causes system to crash.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|LOVED THE OLD/NEW SCHOOL MUSIC COMBINED.<br /><br />INCREDIBLY FUNNY TILL THE END.<br /><br />RECOMMENDING ALREADY BEGAN SINCE DAY ONE.  I ALREADY PURCHASED IT AND HAVE WATCHED IT OVER 6 TIMES.  &#34;LOVED FAT AMY&#34;  YOU GOOO GIRL!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Love this song! Pharrell's smooth lyrics over top Daft Punk's usual dance grooves forms a perfect fit. Definitely get this track if you like music to dance to, or simply just to vibe with while in the car.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|I tried this out and the PC Desktop version needs a VPN to work properly. It automatically and without asking for confirmation downloaded and installed Privatize VPN, a known malware app. It rooted itself into Firefox and Internet Explorer changing search enginges, installing extensions, and changing settings, all without permission. Jump itself might work ok if you get a different VPN but the mere fact they include Privatize as one of their &#34;trusted&#34; VPNs says enough for me.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|One of my favorite shows. This season has been fun and romantic without losing its premise. Can't wait for next season.
B006RXQ8RI|1.0|What else is Kill Bill but a homage to 70s kung fu cheese? It has all of the corny dialogue and violence of a Bruce Lee movie. Why then did critics like Roger Ebert lavish the film with plaudits? It's such a silly movie. Are the characters engaging? No. Is the plot interesting? No. Are the action sequences thrilling? Not really. What else is there to consider? I don't care how the director made the movie if I can't get interested in the characters and their circumstances. It's a mystery why anyone would like this movie so much.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Was expecting more action or suspense.  Starts out very lively but slows after 15- 30 min.  A good movie with good acting.  Worth watching once.
B002Z58GQS|5.0|Used these to deliver photography to a client, instead of CD's<br /><br />worked great, and quick upload of over 500 photos also
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|The clock works fine. It's an alarm clock! So it's alarming! (HA!) The data is always updated and the time is correct.
B000H6FE1M|5.0|If you are a hedgehog fan, this is a must. This hedgehog looks so real that it reminds me of the CGI Sebastian the Hedgehog from \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\". Incredible detail, and made of a resin-like material. I put it on my desk and it cheers me up just to look at it.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It works like other alarm clocks. You set it and forget it. I keep it on as a night light.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story was so touching.  The author did a great job of intertwining the stories of Jamie and Lydia, while going back in time to give us a glimpse of the horrible childhood Jamie endured.  I love a story that makes me laugh and cry and this one definitely did just that.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is purely about how to look and embrace life.  If you are positive and think a certain way you open yourself up to positive experiences.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A happy ending after a little intrigue. The romance continues with some new mystery and more conventionality. Kept me interested.
031606792X|5.0|The Twilight Saga is my #2 favorite book series of all time. I totally understand all the hype about it, but after I read the series, I got pissed at the movies. The movies ruined EVERYTHING! I mean, I don't hate the movies as much as I did the first time I watched it, but I think they messed up the casting BIG TIME(everyone will probably agree with me). But besides that, the last book was epic. I'm glad there was a happy ending to it. Even though I wanted Bella to be with Jacob, I'm so glad he was able to imprint on someone (even if it was a little perverted that he did it on their daughter when she was a baby). so everyone pretty much got what they wanted. Even if you watched the movies and already know what happens, I do think that you should read the books since they're EXTREMELY better than the movie. But that's usually the case with every book that's been made into a movie.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A romance with a little extra spice! Enjoyed the story line and the mystery and learning about an alternative life style.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Plenty of other people can go into explanations of the plot, motivations, and ideas presented in this movie.  All I can say is I am so grateful there are studios, directors and actors willing to take a chance on a project like this.  I have never seen anything like it and I doubt I will ever again. It is more than a movie; it is truly an experience.  I have watched the movie multiple times and I can't recommend this movie highly enough!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its great to have all of the versions available. You can learn Grandma's reccommendation of the KJV to the ESV for a better or more understandable read
1596434252|5.0|This book is definitely a must have. The outstanding way of reinterpreting letters in 3D is totally mind blowing. You'll never tire of looking through it! ^-^
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|From start to finish a good movie. Never got stale or lost my attention...and I have a short attention span. Great insight into mental illness as well. It also got me a little verklempt...I'll give you something to talk about...pineapples are neither a pinecone or and apple...discuss.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|this i bought it for my daughter who's a newly weed, she is very pleased !! and very glad that they are happy
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|so much fun to play.  makes you think. physics comes into play.  or maybe its geometry. very cool. cant wait for the next one
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Best super hero mashup movie ever.  And frankly, based on the ridiculous amounts of money it made I am betting you already know that.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I think the book overall was pretty good. However, the ending was...different. Great book and definitely I favorite. I think that The Selection was better, but The Elite was still great!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Straight up, I cannot praise this show enough.  Though, PLEASE make sure if you purchase it that you don't let your kids watch it.  This is not &#34;Lord of the rings.&#34;  It is not kid friendly.  Not even a little.
B00005JMCW|4.0|Not as good as the original but still worth watching. They changed the story line quite a bit. Would like to see a remake with father son.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I have only used this for a short period, was easy to install and use. Very intuitive and fast. Nice Product.
030758836X|1.0|This book should be a minus 20 stars it was so awful.  It is a sick book written by a sick mind.  The language is terrible, the plot disgusting, and the characters beyond psychotic.
B0080M3OGW|2.0|Married man cheats on wife; married woman cheats on husband; they live happily ever after.  Isn't that nice.  To hell with his wife and children.  To hell with her husband.  As long as the two main characters are happy that's all that counts. These two stars should be embarrassed for stooping to such a meaningless film.
B0037BB00I|5.0|I love this artist. Her music is very empowering and comforting with the exception of a few that just give you a reason to cry.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I have many watches but this is my first automatic.<br /><br />I'd describe the dial color as \\"flat navy blue\\". I like the unique dial. The black-on-white day/date is easy to read. I like the size and feel of the watch but the band seems to me a little on the narrow side. But this is OK since I have an average/small wrist. Very easy to set time and date, so long as it isn't in transition: 10PM-3AM. I really like how the crown doesn't stick out at all. The lumibrite dots and hands are easy to read in the dark. After a few days I found that it ran about 10 seconds fast per day. Pretty good! It cannot be wound with the crown. It must be worn or manually swung back and forth a bit to get started. Its power reserve is at least 40 hours. The automatic winding mechanism can be heard sometimes, but nobody notices but me, and I think it is a pleasant sound.<br /><br />Getting the band wet will allow blue color to bleed off the leather insert. So the first time you get it wet, I'd dry it off before setting my hand down on anything I wouldn't want stained. I really liked the look of the Seiko band, but not so much the way it felt. I replaced it with a Speidel black silcone band: \\"Speidel (Accessories) Men's 23000720 18 -mm Classic Watch Strap\\". Feels and looks better. I installed it short strap on the bottom because this works better for me.<br /><br />See-through case-back is a nice touch. This gives me an excuse to show it to my friends, many of whom have never seen a mechanical watch.<br /><br />One week update: My work is pretty physical. I wore it to work all week and beat it up pretty good -- it shows no signs of wear. I took it off over the weekend and found that it ran for about 44 hours on the nightstand.<br /><br />Five month update: Apparently I was too hard on this watch at work and I damaged it somehow. I checked that the rotor wasn't loose.. But its accuracy was suddenly way off -- sometimes by -30/day. I sent it off to the Seiko service center and they repaired it & mailed it back to me in 14 days. They certainly regulated it properly, because it is extremely accurate. I've been wearing it all week and it is -+0 over a 3 day average, and at most -+2 over one day. I've been setting it down on the nightstand in different positions and it makes no difference. My faith in Seiko is restored!<br /><br />Ten Month Update: Serviced watch still works great at an accuracy of about -8 sec/day.<br /><br />My wrist measures 6.75 inches around and this watch is the perfect size and weight for me; one of my favorite automatic watches.<br /><br />This is a \\"gateway\\" watch; if you buy it, you'll want to by another one.<br /><br />-Chrisey certainly regulated it properly, because it is extremely accurate.

B00BL5YQKS|5.0|Excellent cop percent show. Good cops, bad cops. Everyone gets the job done, one way or another. Vic Mackey rules.
B0062LU85S|5.0|I purchased this album right before going to my brother in laws graduation in maryland and this album was a life saver on those long plane rides. So comforting.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to use. Being able to set each day differently or group days together is a great feature. Would like to be able to use the shake to snooze on my Fire.
1577314808|2.0|I bought the book for a course and it did not serve it's purpose. The book was all about depressed persons getting over their depression with the help of a spiritual diety, in this case, God. I would not recommend this book to anyone. No educational value at all.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Finally some real science and explanations blended with common sense and practical solutions. How completely wrong most of the diet gurus were
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show a great purchase. Cannot wait for the next season to come out already. I would definitely recommend to family and friends.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|can control pc remotely. Little choppy at times.<br />Not a must to have one, but nice to have one.<br />have fun.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Had a lot of fun reading the books. The story in itself is very interesting, but Mcdougall also mixes in a lot of anecdotes from the ultra-running community and from how the scientific research regarding running.<br /><br />The content is great, but he jumps a lot between different/parallell stories so it is not always easy to see the red line in the story.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|It's a good app, not really the VNC type, but it was free. The app does just as is says.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you have seen the movies and enjoyed them, then you should give the book a try.  I think Victor Hugo was a excellent story teller.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|you might not get to play for long , you wait for more life to come open; but is an easy game to play and keeps your brain sharp
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|The game has a lot  of  things followup with.plenty of different donations..it is well worth the money!!!!!!!!!!give it a try......
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves this puzzle game!  He has learned lots of new words with the different equipment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun keeps me wanting to play love this game it keeps me occupied for gourds and great for long car rides!!!!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|It was just what he wanted. Loves all things Lego, but hadn't had a game to play before. Lego is so good for engaging children to use their own creativity in this game.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I really loved the app. Collected and categorized to my heart's content.  Then I started to notice that in general, my kindle fire had slowed way down. The pinterest app froze and forced closes as did other apps. I finally decided to dump the pinterest app. My fire is back to normal, but pinning on the website is pretty awful. Just not easy or fun the way the app was. I don't know for sure, but it seems to me the app was just too big for my lil' ol' 1st gen fire.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I read the book, saw the movie on opening day and purchase the DVD as soon as it was available.  Unlike Hollywood that thinks it can always 'improve' on what an author wrote, this director, screenwriter and production group kept it like the book.  I recommend the book and and the DVD to anyone that enjoys a more 'real life' adventure than science fiction style adventure.
0792839730|5.0|Being Dutch myself and having a father who was a member of the Dutch resistance during the war, he told me<br />that they informed England that a German Panzer division was recouping in that area. The film shows the mistake<br />of Montgommery and the heroes who tried to make the most of it with equipment that was much too \\"light\\" against<br />the German tanks and communication radio's which were not suitable in that terrain. The actors are of course the<br />\\"creme de la creme\\" and give this film that very believable historic character with so many unnamed heroes which we should never forget
B001EN71CW|5.0|I bought this as a stocking stuffer and I absolutely love the series! I fell in love with it after the first episode, wish there was more than one series! It arrived in perfect condition!
B00BIPCY14|4.0|A little idealistic and predictable, but entertaining nonetheless. I'm a sucker for Chris Noth. Alan cumming is also quite good and steals the scenes he is in.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Purchase to access was great.  Video quality was super and not what I expected. Bruce Campbell is great.  I would also view The Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness and a Cabin in the Woods for your viewing pleasure.
B002OKGJUO|4.0|Work of fiction but historically enlightening.  If you are a Dracula fan must watch this.  Don't let it being a silent movie scare you, you will get use to it.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Really good twist on the Cinderella story.  Very enjoyable! I can't wait until the rest come out.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|The only application that I have found that I can actually view my security cameras remotely by viewing my desktop.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|Bad movie...seriously bad movie. Couldn't even finish it, and I did try!! bad acting, not interesting characters, bad humour, boring plot, movie in general. I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A very well thought out, well executed app with great utility. Beyond utility the user interface is both intuitive and attractive.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|As said in some of he other reviews this game does connect to your device and looks at your personal information just be carfull.
B00881PTRC|5.0|What a cute little game this is . . . love making the little guy hang just to see what antics he'll do.  Have always liked the game, but his one is especially fun.
