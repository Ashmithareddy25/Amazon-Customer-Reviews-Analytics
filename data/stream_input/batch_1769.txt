I am glad that &#34;like Spock&#34; other main players can come back. i would like to see a movie made in reference to this series.  I am in the process of ordering book 2 of the Cold Equations series now.

1451627297|5.0|The book was in excellent condition. I haven't finished the book yet, but it has certainly peaked my interest. I can't wait to read more!
B0019NB9A2|5.0|This space adventure was the starting point for so many movies. You will find Star Trek and Star Wars in this story. Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Jack Kelly, Richard Anderson and Earl Holliman are just some of the memorable stars in this SciFi thriller. And of course Robby the robot was a sensational hit. I first saw this when I was 7 years old and I'm thrilled to say that my grandchildren ages 12 & 5 absolutely loved it. It is as fantastic today as it was 56 years ago.

B0039TAHMA|5.0|This movie is the second movie of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (and yes, you need to see the first movie or/and read the first book or else you'll be totally lost.  The movie starts off with the two hobbits, Frodo and Samwise getting closer to entering Mordor.  The orcs and goblins have kidnapped the other two hobbits and are on the run, however Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are in hot pursuit.    Several key characters are introduced here.  First Gollum who is primarily hoping to return the ring to his care (In the book \\"The Hobbit\\" he had the ring a long while before Bilbo found it).  However, Gollum is an intriguing character who has a very dissociative personality is in in continual conflict with himself.  I found part of myself disliking him and the other part feeling sorry for him which makes it understandable why Samwise and Frodo would see these different aspects of him and treat him differently.  The \\"Gollum\\" side represents the aspect of him that seemed to have been created during the period of the ring.  Then he has the \\"Smeagol\\" side to him which seems to be his personality before getting the ring, which, while being much more humane than \\"Gollum\\", still had a longing for the ring which his \\"Gollum\\" side uses to his advantage.  These two sides of him will fight sometimes and agree others.  All of us have a side to us that is driven by selfish purpose.  Sigmund Freud spoke of our ID nature which drives us toward physical longings and Gollum is a good example of someone being ruled by their ID nature.    My favorite Lord of the Rings character is introduced, Eowyn.  Her character is a strong-willed woman not afraid to fight.  Her character goes counter to how some people in society view women as being weak and helpless.  I like that her character represents strength and women equality.  It is interesting that Tolkien created her character in a time that feminism was just getting going.  I could see a woman like her being part of the feminist movement.    The race of ents are also introduced, most specifically an ent named Treebeard is focused upon which cares for Merry and Pippin while they are in the great forest.  I think the ents are one of J.R.R Tolkien's most creative beings.  They are tree like creatures that watch over the forest.  I enjoyed the environmental aspect portrayed by this section of the movie.  Treebeard would state \\"no one cares for the trees anymore.\\"  I think this is a very good point that could be make in today's society as large corporations destroy rain forests and other aspects of the environment in order to stuff their pockets.    Aragorn's inner conflict becomes evident now that he believes Arwin is leaving for the undying lands.  He meets Eowyn who takes an interest in him (he hates her cooking though).  Even though it is a small aspect of the movie, it is well played.    Of course with all three movies I recommend get the extended version, however, this one has some very good parts that were left out in the theatrical version.  The primary example is it gives a little history of Boromir, Faramir, and their father.  I think this section of the movie does Boromir some justice as one does not see this aspect of him in the first movie.  You can't help to feel some sympathy for Faramir as he is torn between doing the right thing and impressing his father.    You will get to find out what truly happened to Gandolf after his fall in the first movie.  There are more fight scenes and action in the Two Towers than in the first movie as the movie climaxes with a full battle between those at Helm's Deep and Saruman's army.    It has been years since I have read the books but from what I call the movie pulls it off pretty well.  Both the Lord of the Rings series and Harry Potter series are a few of those movies that are worth watching even after reading the books.  The graphics are pulled off well (especially with the ents).  The movies, along with the books are rich with meaning and life lessons.If you saw the first movie and enjoyed it, you will likely also enjoy this one...but be prepared, it will leave you thirsting for the third.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Having read The Hunger Games it was shocking to read the Mockingjay story.  The author certainly knows how to hold your attention and move you quickly through an amazing tale.  Would highly recommend, great read!!

B008CP6RWU|3.0|Great game but the only thing missing in my case is the free 30 day PlayStation plus subscription! Its no big deal but Im a little disappointed.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I would recommend this kindle book to all my friends.  Has a lot of good ideas for the creative person.
B008YU0AOE|2.0|This is one of thoses gotcha apps, where they shout free, free, free but then you go to use it, and you can only do the most basic mode. You can't even view the other modes of this calc. Makes me suspicious of the over the top reviews on this one... Now what adds to the frustration is its just basic AND it's got ads.... If you're running a supplemental on your app, not cool to hammer the user with ads and NOT give them a little taste of the other features, especially for that reason. Ads that specifically, on the display for a Galaxy Tab, the overlay COVERS the 0 key.... We all know how a calculator works, but when you can't hit the 0 key, it becomes useless. The screenshots look cool but the deployment of this app kills it for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading Catching Fire, I was so moved I wanted to talk to others who read the book as well to see how they felt about the story ending.  Amazing how the author wove the story from the first book, The Hunger Games, through the second, Mockingjay, and then Catching Fire. A wonderful tale that shows what strength of character with knowledge of how society could be when people work together, can lead to change those things in society that need to be changed.  How a small drop in the ocean can become a tidal wave that can change the future for the better.  Great read, would highly recommend!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the BBT series.  I've already bought the first four seasons as a set.  I wish the covers matched more, but that's not a reflection of how great this series is.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Before the title of the movie came on bodies, blood and action just hit you at every angle and it went like that all the way through. Having the legends of movies in there only made it better.This is a 20+ movie and I LOVE IT!!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was absolutely enthralling. I was reading it with my Tv off, yet I thought it was on just because the story gives you that much of perspective. Hopefully, I will live to see this movie

B0033H7VI6|5.0|If your into the outdoors like I am and enjoy collecting decent quality knives that will really take a beating if your forced into a difficult situation, buy one of these. Their inexpensive & made from 1095 high carbon steel just like a Kabar, but they are twice as thick & you could easily use one of these knives to chop down a tree if you had to ( no kidding ). They're a lil bit on the heavy side, but you need tools like this to survive when you don't have much else to depend on except your survival skills and the items that your carrying with you.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game is really good at start. Word of advice, save all the prizes for bonuses. Slow regeneration time makes you work harder to get as much coins as possible. After about lvl 90 you pretty much beat the game. You will no longer lose coins, but keep getting more and more. I'm slightly over 6k right now, and only playing it for the carnival prizes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|it is great it makes you go right into the action.katniss is in to peta now and he is in a jail type place where they punish you for what you do.

B008D37J6O|4.0|I was looking for something that would play wav voicemails on my phone. Works great! 4 stars because you have to open it and it loads every media file on your phone. If you could just open the one file you want, I'd give it 5 stars.
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|I bought this movie for my parents for Christmas. My husband loves action movies & I like funny movies. This movie is perfect for us.
B003IWRE3I|5.0|I saw this when it first came out on DVD. I was blown away. The entire film leaves you with a strong sense of hopelessness and despair. But after it's over it leaves you feeling...I dunno. Hard to explain. Not \\"YAAAAY!!\\", Not \\"WTF?!\\", not \\"Meh...\\", not \\"I'll never watch *that* again\\". But also not overly jubilant, either. It just...is. I just finished reading the book tonight and was amazed at how well the movie followed the story. Events, dialog, everything. Which is a rarity for a movie based on a book.<br />I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in drama, suspense, post-apocalyptic subjects, but also to anyone just interested in humanity as a whole.
B00181JGI2|5.0|I have to have a Cohen Brothers fix every so often.  Beschemi, Bridges, and Goodman are classic, Love this movie....Let's go bowling.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|the first book of hunger games was great and it was  about how kattniss is selected to go and meet the tributes and compete with them in a arena she wins with peta by her side.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Played on Kindle Fire and it works great<br />Interesting story and a good mix of mystery, puzzles, and ho.  One of my favorites and I definitely recommend this game.

B007HACDLK|3.0|This is something small, but a few chapters into the book a certain character is at a hospital, a Command Master Sergeant in the USAF.  This wouldn't be a problem if this rank actually existed.  I know I'm probably being a nit picker but as a member of the USAF this really drove me crazy.  Now there is a Command Chief Master Sergeant, but they would never be called a Command Master Sergeant.  It just seems to me that with all of the research Vince supposedly puts into his books, this should have been an easy mistake to fix.  Ask any Air Force member and this could have been corrected.  Honest mistake, but man did it drive me crazy.  Other than that so far the book has been ok....
B000MR1V22|5.0|This movie is soooo funny.  You can watch it multiple times and not get tired of it.  It doesn't lose its affect by watching it on your TV vs big screen theater.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|this game app is really great for the entire family. i would reccommend it to everyone. you should try it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great read - right up until the end. I won't give anything away, but I will say I feel like the author was really excited and inspired with this novel until the last 10 pages, then it feels like he was just ready to be done. Books that end like that make the whole thing seem pointless. The last 10 pages gets 0 stars.
0767821769|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I have seen it several times and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to have my own copy.  DVD was in excellent condition.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I like the instant access to the book. I don't have to wait for it to be delivered. That's the best part.
B007G92QGO|5.0|Very well written and kept one enthralled while reading it. Kept one guessing as to whether Jacob was guilty to the end.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I highly recomend Avast.  I use this program on all of my. computors and have with great success for many years.
0425263908|5.0|Except for the few similarities: he's a billionaire, damaged, a Dominant and a control freak, I found this book nothing like FSOG. For one thing it well written!  The fact she's just as damaged is a plus too. The sex is HOT and not repetitious. There is no annoying inner Goddess and sub-conscience. The BDSM is suggestive; never used in their sexual activity. And Gideon Cross is way sexier than Christian Grey! Besides, it takes place in New York not the Pacific Northwest. I found it very enjoyable. I'm reading 'Reflected' now and can't wait for 'Entwined'.<br /><br />Nan Virden
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very intereresting. Author paints a vivid picture.<br />Even with the majority of the story involving 1 human, it keeps your attention.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|Worth watching at least once in your life. Has great musical numbers that get stuck in your head for a long time afterwards. A classic.
B009CPE424|4.0|Fun for the kids. My daughter watched this and said it was nice but not as good as Beverly Hills Chihuahua's first movie.
B004JHY8A8|4.0|Was kept spellbound by the book even though it is not a book that  one can enjoy as it is also about the Holocaust but it is worth reading.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Excellent movie and it shows that once you open the door to the Lord Almighty he'll guide you down the path of righteousness
0425263916|5.0|I love this book! It's nothing like FSD.  There is no comparison. The main reason is it's well written. There is no similarity between Eva and Ana except that they are both dating billionaires.  A really enjoyable book.<br /><br />Nan Virden
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Story was interesting, characters were realistic and (although many will disagree) I felt like they had depth.<br />Will probably read another John Green Book.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|There are alot of complaints on here about the packaging... I say frak the packaging, this series is amazing from start to finish! Regardless the packaging is pretty sweet also! <3
B00023BLXK|5.0|love this movie! Dancing, culture, and a love story all in one. I would reccommend this to anyone especially the women out there
0545265355|5.0|I was very happy to purchase these books for $30 especially in hard cover.  The books have beautiful foiling on the outside as well and look great on my bookshelf.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Well filmed. Great story.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a unique and fun move.  Great for adults and teens.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was a great follow up to the first book.  It does have a cliffhanger ending though, so you have to read the last book.
B009AZZ6H8|4.0|I am so glad this band has put together another studio disc.  They sound so good and have captured some of the old magic.  The first track on the CD rocks out.  Chris Cornell's vocals are crisp and have not lost a thing.<br />My only wish is that there were at least a few more rocking - upbeat type tracks like \\"Been Away Too Long\\". Guitar work is solid, as well as the drums.  Great driving music.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Held our interest for the 2 hrs. plus. Thought provoking beyond the obvious plot line. Great cast and well acted.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is a great Angry Birds clone.  Some of the levels are too easy and some are extremely hard, with them feeling like luck played an outcome in you getting a gold medal and not your actual skill. A coupe levels are also impossible to get gold on in this Android version due to a delay in the beginning of each round. These few minor flaws coupled with only about 4 weapons keep the game from getting a 5.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|N never heard of this movie before, but it sure was a pleasant surprise!  Great action movie that you can watch with your kids too!  Love the story line, hope they make a sequel!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Any game by AI factory works well on the Kindle Fire HD. I buy them all because they work and are beautifully designed. These are just the best time wasters around.
0547884591|5.0|First of all, this book is beautiful. Most hardcover books I get have piece of cheap colored paper wrapped around them with an ugly book underneath. The image you see in the graphic is how the actual book looks! Inside it's full color and very aesthetic.<br /><br />I've always wanted to get into cooking, but I just couldn't do it. Why? Well, the reasons are listed in the \\"How to use this book\\" section:<br /><br />1. Too many ingredients<br />2. Intimidating knife skills<br />3. Too many tools, pots, and pans which are expensive and require too much cleanup.<br />4. Food spoilage<br />Different dishes finishing at different times , leading to cold food, undercooked food, burned food, etc.<br />5. Dishes that require constant tending, stirring, and watching.<br /><br />EXACTLY!<br /><br />These things are addressed and I'm really excited to cook. I'm also excited to apply these techniques to language learning. I'm just starting, but so far this book is awesome.
0553582038|3.0|This is my least favorite book so far in the series.  JRR Martin take a long, drawn out journey with nothing major happening to characters that we love in this series.  If you can just get through it, it is ultimately worth it just to continue to be in the world he has created.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan's iteration of the Dark Knight began in 2005 with Batman Begins, redeeming the franchise after Joel Schumacher's campy affair with Batman and Robin. The Dark Knight Rises is the third film of the series and serves as the finale, without a doubt it's of the largest scale. A terrifying villain stirred with a militia against an altruistic hero despised by the city he yearns to save. Thousands of people trampling through war ravished streets, an aerially high jacking of a plane, the things of a blockbuster, but with soul. The film carefully caresses deeper plot points; viewers may find the emotional scenes left burning in their mind while explosions continue to spread on screen.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises does not pick up right after the events of The Dark Knight, in fact, it has been eight years without The Batman and Gotham is doing just fine. Following the departure of Gotham's White Knight Harvey Dent, the Dent act was established, coinciding a honorary holiday founded on a little white lie about his demise. Commissioner Gordon holds attendance at the event, painfully recollecting what happened that night eight years ago, debating whether or not it's time to reveal the truth.<br /><br />Seems detective Blake, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has a hunch on what happened that night. Hot headed as he may be, his time on screen is not wasted, and he helps the audience get to the bottom of many character arcs. He is one of the few to still see Batman as an icon, a symbol of hope. This is a key point in the film as themes throughout deal with pain, false hope, and redemption.<br />Bruce Wayne is now a limping Hughes imbued figure that quickly permeates back to the social scene taking on his juggled persona of well Bruce Wayne \\"eccentric billionaire\\". Christian Bale has received a lot of flak for his role as Batman, especially for the `voice', but as Bruce he is pretty sympathetic. New comer Miranda Tate attempts to bring Bruce back to room temp, feeling he has become a recluse due to a failed project. In many ways this film stretches its history back to the first film of the trilogy while acknowledging what made the Dark Knight so enticing to watch.<br /><br />Bruce is dealing with a dilemma, is Batman truly needed again? This not the same energetic Bruce, he dons a Ra's Al Ghul like beard, and only sparks to the Batcave when personal interest is at foot. He contemplates folding, he is brash, and as Alfred, Bruce's butler and all in one family, believes any attempts to wear the cape and cowl are an excuse, a far cry for help, and a death wish. Their complex relationship while briefly touched upon in this film is still deeply felt. Michael Caine could not have made for a better Alfred, displaying real concern, the wisdom of a father, and the sympathy of mother.<br />On the other side, better yet, the underside of Gotham resides Bane. Bane is menacing, bronze only bested by hi wit. His hulking physique would have one misidentify his voice and choice of words with a tooth pick scholar, creating a unique villain. Nolan's Bane is not a grunting leather suited goober; Nolan's Bane is a terrorist who leads mercenaries that are willing to take a punch for him before even thinking about punching off the clock. Tom Hardy nailed his performance, Bane's face may be shrouded in mystery due to the metallic contraption on his face, but what little you can see, especially the intensity in his eyes, let you know doom waits.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's slinky stature as Selina Kyle is mesmerizing. No she is not Catwoman per say but the idea is addressed in fashion, literally goggles that when pulled up resemble cat ears. Hathaway is seductive, quick to respond...and is also a jewel thief. Her role is vital in the beginning and is then seen less and less, as if her charm was too potent, and the cast elsewhere needed to be shown. Her chemistry with Christian Bale may be a hit or miss with some audience, I for one wanted to see more. A hurt and numbed Bruce talking to a callous and careful Selina had me reeling. Selina Kyle has her own agenda and perceives Bruce to be a typical playboy, which is fair considering he too plays into it for the media.<br />Batman now has a pet bat, one that weighs a few tons and seats two. Thank Luscious Fox and his team for always inventing the latest gadgetry. The military outfitted tumbler can be seen with a new paint job, and the batpod looks as though it was made for Selina. An emp like device makes its way into the film and one new device that would be too much of a plot device to reveal in a review.<br /><br />The films audio is outstanding. Hans Zimmer's percussive elements really bring out the flare of the fire starting, the chanting inside the pit, echo and raise with such intensity the tempo increases, everything increases one might even pass out... and at times the pulse stops after the barbaric beats. Batmans theme is still epic, motivating, and triumphant. Banes voice was dubbed to be clearer, it's infectious, expect to walk out and perform a Bane impersonation or two, no worries it subsides. Cop ambiance is absorbed by the Bat taking off with its frighteningly loud entrance. Gun shots heat cold midnight air, rounds clang and rattle. Banes punches provide a impact and the audio is there to pick up the remains.<br />All coolness aside, the film is truly about Bruce rising, about the people of Gotham rising, about the ascendancy needed to live in a world without the need for a constant savior. The movie is not a full throttle action film, but it has enough action to pass as one. When Bane and Batman meet, it is both disturbing and alarming. This is the end game for Nolan's trilogy and it literally goes out with a bang.<br /><br />Have fun, so many get caught up on `plot holes' they as might as well pigeon hole themselves in criticizing whatever new film is received with high regards. Nothing wrong with not enjoying this film, Batman is hardly in the film, it does throw a few hard to hit curve balls, Blake's all knowingness is a bit cheap.<br /><br />Enjoy the 70mm film, take in the audio, know what you are viewing is not completely all cgi. Those guys dangling on a plane, the football stadium rupture, Wall street rundown, not cgi. Say it was though, it would still make for an enjoyable film. My favorite album is fine as is whether it's analog vinyl or digital mp3. This is where Nolan succeeds, he made a good movie independent on the notion of explosions and effects are everything. There is a storm coming, be prepared to pop this into your dvd or bluray player and let it pass.re. A hurt and numbed Bruce talking to a callous and careful Selina had me reeling.

I love how this book reveals all of the effort and persistence that Arnold has put into everything he has ever done. It's easy to write off his success as \\"Luck\\". But all of this luck was created through his hard work and amazing optimism. One of the greatest human's of the centrury, whether you love or hate Arnold, you have to respect the fact that he's achieved everything he's set his sights on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much.  Anxious to read the second book.  Had a hard time putting it down.  Had very nice detail.  Able to follow story in pictures in my head.

B0074QGGK6|5.0|Gives credence to the difference between inspiration and plagerism in this refreshing look into the whole creative process.<br />It allows one to explore avenues of the process with abandon without feeling like it's been done before...of course it has!  But Kleon gives the reasons you should not only steal from past art but pounce on it and  make it your own signature.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|The movie itself was boring, I would say, in a hurry!.. The story is vague, nice scenery (off course, it's HR Giger designs!!), the I did not like the movie. Again, the picture quality/streaming wasn't as I expected, you know, HD crystal.., but it's probably the signal of my network/cable connections..(?)

B008Y1YJ90|1.0|The movie is good and funny.<br /><br />But the \\"digital\\" copy requires Ultraviolet which means you don't get it in iTunes and to download it you need to watch it only on the Sony App or in a web window on your desktop. You are forced to create an account to view it.<br /><br />I would give the movie a good review but Ultraviolet needs to be stopped before it gets a foothold.
0767903862|5.0|One of the best travel books I've read.  If you've  never read Bill Bryson, you're in for a treat.  His observations are comprehensive and witty and his writing is so vivid that you'll swear you are there, in Australia, seeing first-hand everything he describes.  Australia is a complex country and Mr. Bryson describes it beautifully.  Extremely entertaining, and if you're planning to travel &#34;down under,&#34; it's must reading.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The first part of the book is confusing and almost irrelevant to the entire story.  BUT...don't give up!  It isn't until the last chapter that this book finally comes together...in a way that is psychologically rewarding.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are amazing! It's nice to have all three books in one format. I'm sure you have heard and/or read many reviews on this trilogy so I won't bore you here.

So don't you expect the classic alicia's sound,but a different and equally valid style.For me her best albums are also the two first album but especially the \\"Mtv Unplugged\\" and now this \\"Girl on fire\\", instead \\"As I Am\\" and \\"The Element of Freedom\\" for me are just commercial and forgettable album.

B009VB97EY|1.0|I could only watch the first 20 minutes.  I should have FF'd to see if it improved--maybe Matthew M's character gets killed off.
B00005JLEU|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies!! I've watched it so many times. I admire the way Miyazaki portray's love in his movies. It's more than just passion like chick flicks or tv shows. I almost think his portrayal is more realistic. There's care for the other person and people and creation and work. And then I also love all the creative spirits at the bathhouse! I definitely pick-up on a different one every time I see this movie. There are so many! And there are a love of life lessons in this movie as well. Love, hard work, loyalty, and fighting for what you are convicted is right are just a few examples!
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|The story of a boy and a girl coming of age, that's bizarre to the max. With a star studded cast I expected something quite different. The film is shot in what I can only refer to as a &#34;choppy style.&#34; The characters are all strange and difficult to relate to. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one, was because it was partially filmed in Rhode Island. That was it's only appeal.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Prefer her earlier CD's to this one.She is just so good at that cool jazz thing. Enjoy it so matter what.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|Lots of action. I wasn't sure if i was going to like it, yet, it did surprised me. If you're looking for a new twist when it comes to action movies, I do recommend this one.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I heard this was a great movie so I couldn't wait to watch, wasn't too bad seem they scrambled to find the ending to the movie a little abruptly, to keep it within time constaints and almost recked the movie.
B002EXGQXQ|4.0|My great-grandson wanted a Hellboy birthday cake and I didn't know what he was talking about. So I watched Hellboy 1 and 2. Thank you, Amazon, for making these movies available to me. Though I would never watch these movies for entertainment, my great-grandson was amazed at the details on the cake---Hellboy's horns, cats, Baby Ruths, and, of course, his beloved weapons. And beer.
B00003CXBK|5.0|One of my favorite movies! It definitely is a story about living in harmony with nature and industry. It was so creative and beautifully done. It could be quite graphically gory at times which I do appreciate in some movies, especially those trying to show reality through creativity without going overboard or exaggerating. It's hard not to get caught up in Miyazaki's films I think.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My wife and I are Vince Flynn fans.  We've read each of his books.<br />Outstanding.  Amazon service is also outstanding.

B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This whole book was fabulous. One reason I like it so much is because if your a twelve year old, then the main character of this book (Greg Heffly), is also about 12 or 13 and has some of the same elements in his life as a normal 12yr old would. Also the story line was very well written. This plot is followed by a series of random events some humorous, or some just average typical 12 year old life. I like this book A LOT and I think it was very well done. :)
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Aliens bro, I could read this book one million times it absolutely sends my mind spinning.  The audio add on didn't work so well for me, but as I am a noob on this device take it with a grain of salt.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|Works perfectly with my Fire Touch HD. Love the easel-like feature for video watching, and the cover looks smart. Seems to protect the Kindle well. In fact, I've dropped it once, and had not damage. This is an admittedly small sampling of drop-ability, and I hope it stays that way. Would recommend this cover to anyone. Only reason for four stars vs five is that, when mounted properly, the USB socket of the Kindle is nearly inaccessible because it's in the fold of the case. I mount it upside-down, and it works fine.

B0068LYEHA|2.0|From the New York Times reviews, I was expecting a refreshing tome on the essence of womanhood and modern feminism. This wasn't what I was expecting based on the reviews I read. It was crass in places and not representative of my own experience as a modern, (post?) feminist woman. I bought the e-book and read it quickly.
0547884591|5.0|Yesterday afternoon a friend came to visit me from out of town. Another friend called me in the afternoon and I spontaneously invited him and his wife over for dinner in an hour. I had picked up some simple groceries from a couple lessons in the book to experiment with over the week, so I had some food in the fridge.<br /><br />They arrived and I served them homemade harissa crab cakes as an appetizer, followed by Bittman Chinese chicken. Both came out incredible, and got me a ton of compliments on my cooking skills.<br /><br />That may or may not sound impressive, but hell a week ago I couldn't even properly cook eggs for breakfast.<br /><br />Thanks Tim.

B004LE7PCM|4.0|Can you really go wrong paying less than $1 for so much content?  The only reason that I gave it only 4 stars was that there were a significant number of typos (they didn't interfere with the story) and the page breaks didn't align properly.  The stories could also have been presented chronilogically as it would have made it more cohesive.  Other than that though, I was very satisfied!  If you love Sherlock Holmes then this is a must.
B0093COK4S|4.0|I should begin by saying that I've been a big fan of Sandra from the dawn of time...  well, perhaps not that far back but certainly from the moment she exploded on the European music scene in '85. Also, by virtue of being a fan, I do own most of her albums on either vinyl, CD or both and, given that, naturally, I felt compelled to buy this (the latest of her) studio albums essentially as soon as it came out, despite the fairly long run of somewhat lackluster albums she's released over the past ten years.  Nonetheless, by the same virtue, some bias on my part may be inevitable and thus the reader is forewarned to take this review with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Stay in Touch is an album produced by Blank & Jones and written (for most part) by Jens Gad, a long time collaborator with both Sandra (starting with Fading Shades) and (her now ex-husband) Michael Cretu (on the Enigma project), and by Hubert Kemmler (of Hubert Kah fame) who also provides the background vocals. The music on this album is, in a nutshell, Sandra/Gad's attempt to return to the up-beat tempo and sunnier days (of commercial success) she has enjoyed in the 80s and most of the 90s. Listening to the tracks on it, one cannot miss strong influences from her own work, going back to The Long Play [e.g. Kings and Queens lead-in is lifted straight out of (I'll Never Be) Maria Magdalena] but also some influences from that of others (at times I thought I detected hints of OMD, Duran-Duran, Erasure, Depeche-Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Alphaville, others (?!) well take your pick.) Certainly, Sandra has done her fair share of covers with Cretu/Gad as producers (The Wheel of Time comes to mind) or Gad as the sole producer (The Art of Love) but Stay In Touch breaks that pattern (of albums using covers as fillers) and is not merely a melee of previous or sampled work. Jens Gad has been in the music business long enough to know the pitfalls of sampling (in something pitched as new), and as such, the material included hereis well mixed and massaged and molded into something that is, in fact, sufficiently original to stand on its own feet. In addition, Sandra's voice is as good as ever (Kemmler's too) and that helps keep everything together. Thus, as mentioned above, personally, I find the album as a whole quite enjoyable. Nevertheless, I do not think that Stay In Touch, is the pinnacle of Sandra's career, but by the same token, is not the low point either. Indeed, while it changes the direction set by the ill received (by most of her fans) \\"Art Of Love\\" (which essentially put her career on life support - so much so that her next album was aptly named \\"Back To Life,\\") stylistically, Stay In Touch does not match the impact of Sandra's early studio albums (The Long Play, Mirrors, or Into A Secret Land) nor does it come close, artistically, to Paintings In Yellow and even less so to what (in my opinion) remains Sandra's career high-mark: Close To Seven. While laden with catchy synth rhythms and acoustic effects and what not, the overall feel of Stay In Touch is one of urgency and sensory overload rather than (one of) deliberately crafted diversion. In addition, except for the last track, the similar, unbroken tempo throughout the album renders the whole thing a little monotonous. The lyrics are also somewhat of a strange choice. To start things off we have things like \\"one more time/ you put your arms 'round my waist/ feeling me...\\" from the title track, or \\"now I'm close to you/ tonight there's no taboo/ can you feel the fire burn...\\" from Moscow Nights, or \\"right here/ look in my eyes/ circle of hallucination/ feel me...\\" from Kings and Queens, or there yet \\"love me/ care and believe/ that's all I need/ feel me...\\" from Angels In My Head. (Are you beginning to) See a pattern there? Personally I do find these lyrics somewhat uninspired. Throw in a few photos of a wet Sandra on a beach and perhaps you can begin to see my puzzlement. I mean, on one hand we've seen a drop-dead gorgeous, every man's fantasy Sandra at thirty, pondering the meaning of life and love and pain and sacrifice and all that in Close To Seven, and on the other, here we see Sandra at fifty attempting what? - to channel a sexually repressed high-school teenager? (okay, I agree, the last part of this sentence is a little redundant.)  Now, Jens Gad is fairly good when it comes to it (i.e. to producing music), but he's no Michael Cretu and, perhaps, considering the artistic direction he's tried, for instance, with The Art of Love and the single release from it: What Is It About Me, I'd say he's been trying pretty hard not to be (or, at least, not to be seen as a lesser replacement of Cretu). There (in The Art of Love) the intent seems to have been a complete reinvention of Sandra while recapturing or rather, retaining some of the mystery and sleek refinement of Enigma (with singing in various languages - Silencio A Mi Lado, anyone? and some fairly elaborate musical arrangements) but clearly that effort lacked Enigma's refinement and (I think) completely missed on the mystery (unless anyone thought that simply mentioning the word \\"zombies\\" in All You Zombies would instantly lend that song a veil of mystique.) The next attempt at reinventing Sandra (i.e. Back To Life) was an even bigger failure, more akin to a kiss of death for Sandra's career than a shot in the arm. Add to this the strange cover art, which (in The Art of Love) looked straight out of Kama-Sutra (which at best tried to portray Sandra as a high end Oriental call-girl) or the downright dreadful \\"mug-shot\\" like photo of an angry looking Sandra on the \\"Back to Life\\" album cover and by all measures, the reset or return to the beginnings with Stay In Touch may very well feel like a breath of fresh air, while (one might add) also amounting to an implicit admission of failure (by Gad/Sandra) in most, if not quite all of their previous endeavors.<br /><br />Technically, the CD is somewhat of a letdown especially when auditioned with headphones. The dynamic range is fairly compressed, and that, at times, is rendering the whole listening experience similar to one of watching TV commercials. With a good headphone amp and decent headphones (my setup: C-7030 cd-player/MacBook Pro - XMOS USB 2.0 Reference Design Aynchronous DAC, Matrix M-Stage headphone amp/ Audio-Technica ATH-A900 closed headphones/ Sennheiser HD-598 open headphones) the distortions due to (soft) clipping are readily and annoyingly audible. From this point of view, the second CD (which contains some extended versions of the tracks) is the worse of the two. These issues become less objectionable when auditioned in speakers, although the lack of variation in the output level leaves the sound feeling devoid of nuance (i.e. the sound has but one quality - it's loud). For some reason I expected more from Blank & Jones (it was perhaps the good reviews about their mastering I've read somewhere else) but they just appear to be following the general trend of excessive dynamic range compression so pervasive in the industry nowadays.<br /><br />To conclude, while no heavy fare, stylistically or artistically, I think that Stay In Touch achieves its primary goal - that of resetting Sandra's career by delivering something that has been known to work for her (vis-a-vis of commercial success.) Nonetheless, the album seems to have been crafted to appeal to a younger generation (rather than to the more typical Sandra fan, such as myself) and that, considering the obvious challenges any singer of Sandra's age may have connecting with a younger generation of fans, may yet prove to have been a flawed gambit. Personally, while I've enjoyed listening to Stay In Touch well enough, I'd much rather have liked to see Sandra go in the direction she was moving two decades ago with Paintings in Yellow and Close to Seven. Overall I'd rate this as a good effort that could have been mastered/recorded a little better, so all in all - 4 star.
B00871C09S|5.0|Jimmy Stewart is a study in humility. Something about him is unpretentious. There is an arrogance about modern actors that is annoying. I can not see watching a Ryan Gosling or Leo Dicaprio doing a film like this because they always seem to be carrying this attitude of: \\"look how great I am\\" whereas Jimmy Stewart is simply be a part of a great film while carrying the lead. Perhaps because Mr. Stewart saw combat in WWII and grew up in a time when people had empathy. Empathy makes for great acting and these new guys seem to feed off of our new narcissistic society.<br /><br />Great film, great actors.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed reading No Easy Day, I have to take issue with the many reviews here that focus their comments solely on the Bin Laden raid. Although it is a very important event, the raid on Bin Laden's compound accounts for a very brief portion of the contents of this book. The vast majority of it is centered around describing the life of being a SEAL team member. While the chapter describing the actual raid is indeed exciting, I found the background on what led up to the event far more fascinating.<br /><br />While much of the buzz surrounding this book has died down since the 2012 U.S. Presidential election, some issues should be addressed here concerning the book's possible implications regarding national security. Some elements of the media labeled this book as a threat to national security due to the author's refusal to go through regular channels and gain the Pentagon's approval prior to the book being released. After having read the entire book though, I couldn't disagree more. In fact, most of the book was very critical of the Obama Administration's numerous press \\"leaks\\" and official disclosure of details that should not have been made public to begin with. The only material in the book that could possibly put any of our soldiers in harm's way lie in the Obama administrations own on-the-record disclosures that are reprinted from White House sources. In fact, I would have to say that the author's dim view of how the White House treats national security issues was the real motivation behind releasing this book to begin with.<br /><br />That being said, the author may come across as biased against the Obama administration, but his criticism is clearly motivated by his own personal experiences rather than by political motives. I did not get the impression that it would make a difference whether Obama was a Democrat or a Republican. The fact that an individual would disclose information to the press that could endanger the security of the troops involved for personal political gain would seem to be the sole issue here.<br /><br />After reading the book, one is forced to come to a conclusion as to whether the White House narrative of how the Bin Laden raid went down is true, or if the author is the one telling the truth about what really happened. Personally, I'll take the word of a decorated Navy SEAL over a politician any day. The account in this book simply comes across as more creditable than the White House version. While I have seen this book attacked from many different angles, no one is attacking the contents of the book as being untrue. That, alone, speaks volumes.olved for personal political gain would seem to be the sole issue here.<br /><br />After reading the book, one is forced to come to a conclusion as to whether the White House narrative of how the Bin Laden raid went down is true, or if the author is the one telling the truth about what really happened.

B001GUXJQA|3.0|After reading The Black Echo (Harry Bosch book 1) I had high hopes for this book. I admittedly prefer the plot in this book over the plot in The Black Echo, it's more believable to me. However, that being said I feel as though The Black Echo was a better book overall. This book seems to just ride off the first one instead of bringing a lot of growth to the story. I understand these aren't very character progressive books, they're cynical detective novels, but I was hoping for more. I can't exactly put my finger on why this didn't hit the spot like the first, but it just didn't. It's still a good read and I encourage you to take a look if you enjoyed the first one.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book gave me a better perspective of this historical era and it became very real through the characters that Follett created.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Yes, it's a &#34;vampire flick&#34;, and like all such movies you have to put a bit of logic/reason to rest.  Having said that though, I loved how they made a vampire movie in the genre of what could be called &#34;Historical fiction.&#34;  Incredible special effects throughout (helped no doubt by the $69 million dollar budget for the film), great casting, with plenty of suspenseful / edge-of-your-seat moments, though never too scary.<br /><br />I'd summarize the movie as a unique combination of Blade + Matrix + Civil War + Lincoln biography.  Definitely worth renting at the very least if you like movies in this category!
B001FQFFMG|5.0|I am not a big Reese fan, but she did a really good job portraying June Carter and Joaquin did an AMAZING job as Johnny.  I was very impressed with the vocals through out the entire movie.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I swear I reviewed this already. I guess Amazon didn't like it. My only real issue with this CD is that it's not very long. Aside from that I like the tracks and I really enjoy their music. No scratches or any other issues either.
0545425115|5.0|AMAZING!!! Love this book! Get the whole series, you wont regret!! Full of action, romance, and suspense, it's a book for everyone.  Favorite book!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|i thoroughly enjoyed this book.  the story of steve jobs and how he basically created the personal computer industry is captured in a very readable book.  jobs was brilliant and obsessive in ways most people (like me) can never imagine.  driven to perfection at all costs, he changed the way we live. leaving behind a long line of dedicated followers and destroyed psyches.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works on all pkatforms and sa must have fir just about anybody. the premium edition is only required if u ought to be a piwer user
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I had just finished the Shades of Gray series when I went to this series.  It was good but just could not hold up to SHades of Gray
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was expecting so much more from this author.  I did read the whole book but it was a struggle.
1419705849|4.0|It just feels like the same book with the same jokes, but I did laugh a lot so if you liked the others you will also like this one(especially kids)
B000OVLIQU|5.0|i love music and always wished i could be a recording engineer.  this book is the best of both worlds, bringing the story of how some of the best music every was made.
B006H5120E|5.0|Real good quality and just a magnificent movie. Have your popcorn ready and don't get up it is long but it tells a good story.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Although this movie was PACKED with action and hot guys... It seemed to be missing something.. I felt a little cheated overall.  HOWEVER, the scene where Hulk pounds Loki and calls him a &#34;PUNEY GOD&#34; was the part of the entire movie.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|As a life-long fan of Led Zep I was concerned only that Robert Plant would be so feeble as to ruin the show. Knowing how he has sounded in recent years, (and in fact at times in the 70's) made me afraid to order this film. Well fear not. Plant is as good as he could possibly be at his age. I had hoped for an acoustic song or two but the setlist is fabulous nonetheless. They are finally at an age where Stairway doesn't have to be the encore. The show builds from beginning to end and I would pay the price of this disc just for Kashmir. Thank You Jimmy for letting us see the final performance of the great Led Zeppelin at last! No self-indulgent movies spliced in, just music. 5 stars will have to do but I'd give it 6!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|If you are like me and just want a basic good looking case for your iPhone that will provide protection from the occasional drop, this is the case for you. It actually looks very nice on the phone, is comfortable to hold, doesn't block any of the ports, and will offer great protection. The screen protector was just okay. Still a 100% buy.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|i use this as an audio interface and as a dac for playing music off my computer.  does a great job of both!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This continues the the incredibly detailed story began with the first four installments, and is as good or better. This is as much of an escape for the reader as you can possibly get, which I believe is the point. This series is a must read for all who love adventure and detail, and is sheer genius from the author. Mr Martin does a tremendous job, going to great lengths to keep the reader engaged in the story, while at the same time helping the reader keep track of a large cast of characters, while keeping the main characters attached to the story. Genius.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|The movie itself was entertaining, but the sound quality on the HD Amazon Prime was awful. We had to turn our volume all the way up and could still not hear as well as we would like. Never had this problem with any other Amazon Prime movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|best of the 3 books.  I like the characters and in book 3 you learn more about them.  Make sure you read all three books
B0009P5YXO|4.0|When I ordered this I read a bunch of reviews complaining about how cheaply it is made. Frankly, I don't care about the ultraviolet ink abilities, I just wanted a sonic screwdriver to carry around the office with me. It fits this purpose.<br /><br />Yes, it's plastic and if you're rough with it, it will break. I keep mine in my jacket pocket and rarely extend the tip. I use the light and noise and have fun with it. When it breaks I will order a new one.<br /><br />It's the best $10 entertainment since my night in Tiajuana and I don't even need a penicillin shot this time.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun game and the kids can play without too much help - even my 5 year old can play by himself.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|Beautiful, simple, elegant.  It's my perfect cookbook.  I just need time to try every recipe at least once!  Thank you!
B00377V6J2|5.0|If your looking for great blues, looking no further. The quintessential Albert King (Stevie Ray Vaughns Mentor) paired together with his protegee', perfect combo. The CD & DVD are great, kind of expensive, well worth the money.
B008YP272M|4.0|As a long time Hitchens fan I admit to having shed a few tears as I read this challenging and remarkable testament to a man who seems always to have challenged everyone to seek the truth and stand by one's own convictions.  Vale.
030758836X|5.0|Without the recommendation of an awesome co-worker, I would have completely missed out on this one. Hands down, this is one of the best books I have read this year, if not in my entire life. I have never read a Gillian Flynn novel before, so when it was recommended to me, I did not know what to expect. One thing that impressed me before I even started reading it was how long it sat at the top of the best-seller list. Because of this book, I have added Gillian Flynn as an auto-read author and will be looking for her backlist.<br /><br />Nick and Amy are great characters, but not great people. They definitely have their faults, but that is what makes them unique and such great characters. Nick and Amy represent every other couple struggling in a marriage that is certainly out of the honeymoon phase. This couple's problems and grievances are too numerous to list, but this book reminded me how important it is to put in the effort to make our most important relationships grow and flourish. Nick and Amy didn't do that and with every turn of the page, I was able to see first hand how these two characters were spiraling in a whirlpool of frustration, anger, sadness, bitterness, regret, misery and yes, even hate.<br /><br />Everytime I thought I knew what would happen, I would be surprised at the twists and turns the plot would take. A great book has to be shared so, as it was recommended to me, I have been recommending it to everyone I know. I kept thinking as I was reading this book that this story would not end well for anyone, but I was even surprised at the ending. I couldn't make myself look away. This book would pull me out of sleep calling me to come read. I just had to know what was going to happen!<br /><br />If you enjoy stories that pull you in right away with little to no build-up and flawed and dysfunctional characters that draw you into the mess of their lives, this is the book to read.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I could not be any more disappointed in this movie. It was terrible and had the plot was completely bizarre. Not at all what I expected from the previews.
B007THA4FI|1.0|After having read all of J.K Rowling's Harry Potter books I expected more from her than this.  Because of the price I paid for it, I had to finish the book.
B0084I9QI2|4.0|If you are fan of MJ  this one is for you . I had problem with the DVD it didn't work
B007T99ENE|4.0|Mt McEwan has again written a most engaging story with believable characters that interacted in a very challenging way.  Could not put it down and the ending left me breathless.
B008D1LVRY|4.0|This is a good album to add to any headbangers collection. Every song is heavy and for the $$$$ how can you go wrong???
B003DNN0L2|5.0|never heard of this movie, but gave it a try with my 5 year old, and was a big hit.  If your child is into animals and such they will really like this film, and it's very entertaining too for adults, so a win win!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|wow its amazingly fun what about that I love this app it is amazing I have so much fun playing it
0240801962|4.0|Overall it is fine. I found it very useful for my darkroom work, due to the number of solutions described.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Travis intrigued me from the beginning and his mannerisms toward Pidge are undeniably captivating. I enjoyed the character development and unpredictable path the story took at times. America and Shelpley's relationship was fun to &#34;observe&#34; as well. Will read again. Can't wait for Walking Disaster.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Good family movie for all ages - very funny while showing some strong female leads.  It is a must see!
B006Q1SQCQ|4.0|I am not a native english speaker, however I really found this book really useful for improving my memory. I used to say that my memory was not good; this book made me realize that it only needed some exercise.
B006LSZECO|2.0|VERY slow start and a weird ending. I almost fell asleep until about half the book was over. Not at all what I expected.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I love my Nexus 7, but one thing prevents it from being PERFECT = bad sound quality from the headphones. The fiio e6 makes the nexus sound on par with my iPhone 4, my iPad 3rd gen, and a couple of mp3 players from Creative and Sony. In other words, it's a tiny-miracle-creating-box. It's boosts the mid-range, the bass, and makes music loud and clear. Now I just have to find a way to glue this tiny box to the back of my nexus 7.
B008458O3S|5.0|Kept me entertained and always had new twists.  There were no repetitive levels. Great job on this! Three more words.
B004XWLN20|1.0|Its great if you like scratched up discs out of the box. The design of this box is terrible, for starters it is hard to even remove discs from sleeve as it is. To add insult to injury The discs get scratched automatically from there own case that is suppose to protect them. All it takes is a few views and your disc is rendered unreadable
B008MEM24S|5.0|lots of fun. especially like the different ways Perry gets out, via steam or water.  not good for little kids although my three year old loves watching me play.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the better it gets. The musical theme that runs through each song ties everything together so well and provides for a good hand-clapping time!
B006LXQID8|5.0|Not the standard stuff of romance. Tautou is charming and awkward as Amelie, a social misfit with a freakish sense of humor. The movie's quirky and clever. Soundtrack gives me goosebumps of bliss, too.
0062215507|5.0|I own both Harry Potter Film Wizardry and Harry Potter Film Wizardry (Revised and Expanded) and they are almost identical.<br /><br />The only differences are:<br />1)The 1/3-page paper belt which wrap the book cover<br />2)In the 2010 version, the last 2 pages are \\"sneak peak\\" of the final movie. These 2 pages are gone in the 2012 version and the photos from these 2 pages are nowhere to be found in the Revised and Expanded version. In the Revised and Expanded version, we get 6 pages of new materials from the final movie: the return to Gringotts, the Battle of Hogwarts, the Deathly Hallows, and the Tales of Three Brothers.<br />3)An additional material: a pocket/envelope, which contains a booklet Film Photo Diary, embedded on the inner side of the back cover. Nothing spectacular about this additional material: just a few photos from each of the movies (and only 1 page is dedicated to each movie).<br /><br />For those who missed out on the 2010 version, go ahead and purchase this. It is as good as the 2010 version.<br />For those who already own the 2010 version, you may want to think twice before purchasing this.
B00881PPTO|5.0|Just got this and used it on a flight yesterday.  Especially liked the ability to check on my flight status.  Since the weather was bad, I was concerned about the flight being delayed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Rapp, Coleman, and Hurly in the field together! Nice balance of depth to important characters  and like the way all story lines intersect and get resolved in the end.  Oh the choices they make that shape the final outcomes!  Enjoyable read.
B009FXIICK|5.0|This game has been out for quite a few years now. I first got it on my original grey nintendo ds almost ten years ago and played it till it stiled working. so glad to see it made into an app and have some fresh life brought into it.

B004Q8SM02|5.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles, by A. Conan Doyle<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson discuss what can be deduced from a walking stick left behind by a visitor. When the visitor returns he tells of the old legend about the hound of the Baskerville family, and how Sir Charles Baskerville died recently. Dr. James Mortimer found the footprints of a gigantic hound twenty yards from the body! There have been sightings of a huge hound on the moors at night. A new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives from Canada to take over the Baskerville property; he is the last of the line. Will he meet the same evil fate? Holmes makes an appointment to meet Sir Henry the next day. Holmes peers over the Ordnance map of that area. Has any crime been committed (Chapter 3)? Sir Henry tells of a warning letter sent to his hotel; who knew he was there? Why would anyone steal just one of his new boots? Would anyone follow Sir Henry? Dr. Watson will accompany Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall; there is less danger in a small village than in London. Dr. Watson must keep his revolver near and never relax his precautions (Chapter 6).<br /><br />The moor country is described as wild and sparsely settled. Dr. Watson reports his observations of the people who meet with Sir Henry. Watson sees the dangers of the great Grimpen Mire when a pony is caught in a bog and killed. There are stone huts from prehistoric man. Watson meets Stapleton the naturalist and then his beautiful sister (who tells him to go back to London). Stapleton had once been a schoolmaster (Chapter 7). Watson sends letters to Holmes in London (Chapter 8). Mr. Frankland has a passion for litigation. He also observes the country with a telescope on his roof. Why was Stapleton so angry (Chapter 9)? What was the secret of the Barrymores? Watson meets Laura Lyons and hears her secret story (Chapter 11). What did she hold back? Mr. Frankland observed the stone huts. Then Watson hears a terrible scream from the moor (Chapter 12). Holmes has the solution to a cold-blooded murder, but lacked definitive proof. Holmes studied the portrait of the wicked Sir Hugo. Then plans are made for the night's activities. Will an unexpected fog create a complication? Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade rescue Sir Henry from a murderous fate. The villain escaped to a hiding place on the moor, but justice wasn't cheated. Chapter 15 ties up the loose ends.<br /><br />This may be the most popular of Doyle's four Holmes novels. It does not involve a religion, a company town, or imperial looting. Did Doyle implicitly criticize a hereditary aristocracy that passed down evils to each generation? The character traits of the villain seem like those in true crime stories.

1451695187|5.0|Great for my father-inlaw. His wife of 63 years passed in may and he has lots of questions.This book will give him the peace he seeks.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I've been looking all over for a piano app that will 1) actually play audio when I push the keys. 2) not delay the sound. 3) have Multi touch. 4) have multiple octaves. This piano app is it! It has it all. please get it. it's great for picking out parts when you don't have a piano around!
0593070720|5.0|In depth look into how McFly originated.  They are so humble and gracious, never expecting success and always surprised at the success that came their way.  My only wish was that the book ended closer to present day, but McFly is probably the rest of the story for part 2 :)<br /><br />I really feel like I learned a little about English culture as I journeyed through time hearing this fabulous foursomes tales.<br /><br />Thumbs Up!

B008MG1E4A|3.0|I enjoyed Mr. Bissonette's novel and he does provide an accurate assessment of life as a DEVGRU Operative. However, there are numerous OPSEC violations throughout the text, and even though they are small violations none the less they are violations. Mr. Bissonette did not sign a Special Access Agreement with The United States Navy therefore he will most likely not be punished for his infractions. My suggestion is that in the future all Tier 1 Operatives are bound by a Special Access Agreement that would prohibit them from this type of.....<br /><br />\\" SIlent Professional\\"<br /><br />I do not think The Unit Operatives want to be characterized as a Movie Figure from Lord of the Rings.
B003THHIEM|5.0|With Nathan Fillion in every scene, what's not to like?  This is the only place I could get this show - I will continue to purchase the subsequent seasons.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Occasionally a book comes along that changes one's paradigm, The Biology of Belief is one such book for me.  The information presented in this book changed the way I look at health, healing, and genetic influences on illness.  If you enjoy Cell Biology or have an interest in the healing sciences, you must read this book!
B0058VW36U|4.0|used to be super fun. now it closes and crashes after every 1 to 2 levels. it is very annoying!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Got this game for great grandson to play and he loves it. He plays it after school while waiting on his mother  to pick him up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very fun addictive game... makes you think outside the box :) i would download again... wish i would have waited till after finals to get it tho :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is an awesome game.  getting down to zero energy is not fun, but it teaches patience.  the game play is smooth, with no crashes on my kindle fire.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|There is a lot of negative press about fracking - a process of getting gas out of the shale layers in the earth but not much seems to be getting done about it.  There is also the positive side for people and towns that are benefitting from money that it brings to them.  Read this book and it will give you the view against fracking.  The important point is to understand both sides of the story.  This book gave me one side and I did more research to find out about the pro side.  You can come to your own conclusion but I think Josh Fox brings up some very important information that we need to know and understand.
034580404X|1.0|I heard great reviews about the books and enjoy reading so I ordered them. I found the books to be appalling. A control freak male and the girl who seems to always be attacked. Who in this day and age would first off stick around with a man like that if not for his money, and then have every male who comes around her hit on her. Please these books suck! I am trying to make it through the last part of the last book but it is really hard. I don't see it getting any better. A book is supposed to have a plot and I have not gotten to it yet.
0786886811|5.0|unfortunately i wasn't magically turned into a domestic goddess by buying and reading this book, but i am enjoying it and looking forward to cooking many meals from it.
B000093BDX|4.0|This is a pretty good mix of some of the better tunes done by the Beach Boys over the years, with several real clunkers thrown in the mix as well.  Even with a many of the tunes being pretty lame lyrically, I still thoroughly enjoy just hearing those beautiful harmonies again.  In fact, it is those wonderful harmonies that still let me overlook not only the lyrics, but even much of the rather awful guitar solos of that time.  Having said that, I am still in awe of and never tire of pieces like Good Vibrations, Surfer Girl, Don't Worry Baby, In My Room, Don't Worry Baby, Good Timin', and Kokomo.  These tunes let me overlook (and skip over) some of the truly awful tunes that are included on this disk (which I will leave to each listener to decide on).  This is definitely a good album to own if you're a Beach Boys fan like myself.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you're looking for a straight forward ALIEN prequel, be prepared to be disappointed.  This is a good film, and though it does answer a few of those questions that ALIEN fans are looking for answers to, it raises just as many new ones.  Still, if you're a Ridley Scott fan or, if like me, you're a diehard ALIEN fan, this is a must-see.
1423136802|5.0|Such a great series with lots of action and I love how he explains the myths as well :) By far one of my favourite series!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Do NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR CHILD....unless you set your account settings correctly this \\"Free\\" game will charge you bundles of cash from your accout!!!
B008LA7RM0|5.0|Just to hear this album again is simply fantastic.  There is nothing I can add to all of the praise already heaped upon this album over the years.  This disk consists of 13 mono tracks & 13 stereo tracks of the same songs. Pick your favorite version, I suppose.  Brilliantly written, performed, produced.  This is the album that reflects a more mature Beach Boys style both lyrically and musically, but it also sets in motion an influence on the rest of the rock and roll movement of that time, such as The Beatles Sgt Peppers.  But most importantly, IMO, is that their voices simply sounded incredible together!  The only problem I have with this album is that I can't get their songs out of my head now.  Bummer.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This movie was by far the best of the whole series. I definitly had some cringe worthy moments but I think I will have to watch this again.
0525953728|5.0|very interesting account about how this mission went down.  well worth the read. arrived in a timely fashion. get it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I started playing Angry Birds Star Wars last night and was completely hooked!! I definitely recommend this game!!! Love it :)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I can only say what I'm sure has already been said about Prometheus:  it is an instant sci-fi classic on a scale close to or perhaps equal to other classics such as Star Wars, Alien, 2001, etc.  Outstanding acting, intriguing plot, great script make this a must-see for any sci-fan.  Fascinating.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|My Kindle version kept skipping over the recipe section (section 2 I believe, can't remember its exact name) and then landing me directly on the \\"Dom\\" section.  I tried repeatedly to page back but every time I reached the cauliflower mash recipe my Kindle version skipped to Dom.  Really frustrating.
B008FOB124|5.0|I have been an avid Dead Can Dance fan since first hearing them in the early 1990s, and in love with their music, and particularly Lisa Gerrard's voice. She is absolutely my favorite singer of any genre. I own just about everything I know of by them, so when I heard that DCD put out a new album, I knew I had to check it out, and I was not disappointed by no means. This is a monumental achievement by Dead Can Dance. It is so new and fresh, yet remains true to form for DCD. The instrumentation is exceptional, and the voices are just as beautiful as ever. If you are a fan of Dead Can Dance, you must buy this album, and if you have never heard them, this is a good place to start.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|These people are the reason I try and complain about nothing...amazing book very to the heart and to its point
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince did it again, with another great book in the series! One of my favorites so far, keep it coming!
B009EAO38C|5.0|They do an excellent job of blending classical and modern styles of music. A lot of fun, and a great listen.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Was on the waiting list for months before getting it, we watched the season in a week! Can't wait for season 5 to come out.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Love this movie and the newer rendition. It has become a holiday tradition in my home to watch it after Thanksgiving as we decorate the tree.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|I hate to give a bad review of a book and especially a series that has such a well written story to it.  i read the entire first book and loved the story, that is what kept me reading it.  As i progressed through it the author kept taking us to scenes and sexual situations that didn't need as much detail as was given.<br />I liked the story in the first so i bought the second in the series and half way through it stopped reading because I felt like i was watching a X rated movie in my head (i know that many will disagree, but you have to face the fact of what kind of rating would this have if it were a movie and it is well beyond \\"R\\").<br />The story line is great, wish the sex and sexual situations could have just been alluded to, not defined.  There are many great epic fantasy novels to read so this is one i chose to stop because of all the sexual situations.<br />If you want great story and don't care about reading sexual content, then this is for you<br />If you want great story but don't care to read the smut stuff that is included, then read a different series as this one is not for you (i wish someone else had written a review like this before i ever started this series, because i wouldn't have started it.)
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I was a little skeptical about buying this app, especially after reading some of the reviews.. However, I forgot my camera when going to see my brand new 2 day old neice, and was very upset.  So I took the leap and downloaded the app.  I wish I could put some of the pic up.  It worked great... To be truthful, it looks like of like a phone picture, but it was better than nothing and when I emailed the pics from my Kindle, my mother in law said they turned out really good... So, to all the ones that said this didnt work, I dont know.... I just know it worked great on mine.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game is amazing. It starts out slow and easy but gets very, very difficult and challenging. I love it!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This is the best Angry Birds yet!  it combines regular play with Angry Birds in Space with Star Wars. What could be better?<br />However. We beat all of the levels in the &#34;Deathstar&#34; world and now cannot go any further.  The Jedi world after level 1 costs money? And it says there is some sort of free update &#34;coming soon.&#34;  When is that?  It's weird.  A little of a let-down in such an otherwise fun game.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I hate the way that ads pop up all the time.  Don't waste your time.  Solitaire is free everywhere without ads
0307959856|1.0|This is a valiant effort, but disappointing as both a mystery and a Regency genre book. The characters say and do dreadfully improbable things, flying against physics, social history, and good development of literary characters. Honestly-- three great gentlemen set out in a carriage on a dark and windy night to find a couple of lost officers on the estate grounds, one of whom might be injured or dead, and don't take any servants but the coachman? Then personally carry back a corpse on stretcher, in the dark, a mile or more on foot? All, apparently, to conceal something or other from the servants? Not bloody likely. Then said great gentleman personally rides 8 miles, in the middle of a bad night, to notify a magistrate, and arrives in half an hour without killing himself or his horse? -- Nah. The author lost me right there. The book is clunkily written at best, although PD James tries for, and very occasionally achieves, a Jane Austen flavor. This book needed, at the least, a knowledgeable editor to prevent such howling mistaken constructions as \\"Colonel the Viscount Hartlep\\" (Trollope or Thirkell fans will read it as \\"Hartletop\\" anyway.) And who among British novel readers does not cringe at the use of the term \\"lawyer\\" to refer to a barrister? Or at a newly affianced couple from the highest level of formal society that 'holds hands and runs' together in their happiness? Ah well.
B004Q3QRWC|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this book given all the good reviews and high star rating. I found it disjointed as it chops between time periods and characters with each chapter. Put it all together and there is not really much of a story line. Seems like it is trying to be a bit too clever, and it didn't really work for me.
B001P3SA94|5.0|The broad subject matter of this important film is so hard to address in a two hour time frame that it would be impossible to satisfy everyone. Many of the loudest critics complaints are addressed in the outtakes and in particular, the director's cut, which should not be missed. I understand the Chess family feared how Leonard would be portrayed and did not cooperate or make the original music available. I think the film strikes a good balance between the valid concerns of the musicians and the economic realities of the business. Until the blues &#34;crossed over&#34;, it was hard for anyone to make a buck. Sam Phillips tried at Sun Records & until he found the right white performer, he was strugging in Memphis. Wolf had some success in Memphis before he moved to Chicago, presumably in search of a bigger market.<br />Several of the performances in the film are first rate - the actors playing Little Walter, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Etta James in particular. My copy is loaned out to a friend (again!), or I would cite all the actors by name.<br />The unique talents of these musicians is unquestionable, and Phillip Chess's ability to bring that out can't be overlooked. To the doubters, listen to Buddy Guy's compilation, &#34;I Was Walking Through the Woods&#34; on Chess, for my money, still Buddy's best overall recording.
B0086700CM|4.0|People this is a good  game it is just to hard when you get around 1500 meters and there is not much power ups
B002VHI8J0|3.0|I know I am supposed to say that I loved this and that I spent months thinking about it and it's deeper meaning.<br />But I didn't.<br /><br />I wanted to like it. After seeing the movie trailer, I really, really wanted to like it.<br /><br />It is a brilliantly written novel. Each of the six stories are so unique and so well adapted for their setting in time that I waded through some of the heavier wording and pidgin Hawaiian, making mental notes of all the small things, because I knew at the end there would be a fantastic reward.<br /><br />Six fantastic stories with a very tenuous link later and the 'great revelation' in the last chapter left me with a 'is that it? so what?' feeling. There is nothing new here, just the eternal strike at society and it's structure.<br /><br />Now you might have guessed that I don't pick up a book just for the sake of reading, and am not a literary snob. But I do have intelligence and I read for entertainment and enlightenment. Maybe the movie will make the journey to the obvious more entertaining.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book! I've never read anything of &#34;this nature&#34; and it was eye opening! I would recommend that you be an adult to read it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|there are great ideas on this site that can be used in your every day life to make things pretty and easier to make
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is so alive oh and by the way I am the person who did the 1000th revewer it has TNT bubles seasons dressed up pigs snd more
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This novel was exhilarating. I find myself wanting more, nay, needing more. I also find myself in some school girl, adolescent mind set where child like fantasies live. Grey is a very unrealistic, powerful, seductive character who in the real world would only exist in fairy tales. I still, over all, love this novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm only a 1/3 of the way thru it but again.....it's just as good as the first 2 ! Oh wouldn't we all love to find our own Christian Grey!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like most of Connelly's books but do not care for short stories bundled like a book …<br /><br />These storis were entertaining enough, but leaves the reader wanting a whole book, kind of like getting an abridged book as a gift.  That makes me grit my teeth being polite thanking someone for the idea of the gift; instead of saying the truth of why waste their money?  It is like sex without a happy ending for both; who wants a \\"Faker?\\"
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a one of the best apps acording to a bunch of people and I agree it has bombs eggs pigs TNT king pigs and realustic stuff
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great Performances by all actors in the cast. The characters are real. The story It is full of surprises and questions.  My wife and I watch the complete seasion in a few days. We can't wait to see what happens in season 2.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|It was a good CD,  I got it for my daughter and she loves One Direction.  As for the CD I wont know how she likes it till Christmas.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Love this movie. Just makes for a great night in, sort of a chick flick, but really cute. Love the music as well.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|They fixed that bug where it would not work and does any one know when hoth is coming out? Anyway it is awesome
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this app. You have tons of games to choose from and you get to play new ones my using the game points you get from playing the games and get new games. One of my most favorite ways to past time.
1400052181|5.0|I love this book.  It's a totally original concept, and Skloot handles it wonderfully.  The research, while clearly immense and dense, never overwhelms the book.  The narrative is quite seamless, and opens up very engaging questions for the reader about life and the ethics that both follow and precede death.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is the best game yet......I hope you bring us more. I play every HO game that looks good and this one takes first prize. I play Big Fish HO games on my computer and this one is as good if not better than most of those games. I have been waiting for a great HO game for my KF and it finally arrived. Thanks
B009FXIICK|2.0|QUESTION: What do you get when you mix a bunch of animals and try to match 3 or more in a row horizontally or vertically?<br /><br />ANSWER: Another Bejeweled type game!!<br /><br />I know that my joke material is really bad.  But seriously, I know I am going to get a bunch of unhelpful votes because I am going to go against the majority here and I might as well at least have some fun writing this review!<br /><br />Like I said above, I am going against the majority and giving this app only 2 stars and here are my reasons why:<br /><br />1.  It is a completely unoriginal idea for a game.  There are no new twists on this match 3 or more concept that isn't found in any other similar type games.<br /><br />2.  It bothers me to see on the title screen the words \\"touch edition\\" which leads me to believe this is a cheap port from another system which probably doesn't take advantage of all my Android device's features.<br /><br />3.  Another thing that I don't like about this app is that there appears to be places to list your name on the high score charts even though you can't enter your name when you get a high score.<br /><br />So I would say that Amazon is going slightly in the wrong direction for free app of the day selections today.  But since the app does have some good sound effects which redeem the app a little, I will give Amazon a 2 out of 3 so far this week for the free app of the day selections for Cyber Monday Deals Week.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|At first I thought I wouldn't like this but as always my friend is right haha. It is really fun game I will sit down with my kindle and play this for a few hours.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Probably a better book for youngsters but it kept my interest at least for the most part. Boring in parts though.
B0091LS07E|5.0|My girl did it again. I am Alicia Keys fan from her first album. My girl is happy in her life and she conveys this throughout the entire album. I love every track, can listen to the album from 1st to last song and not want to skip (Which is a rarity). My favorites are tracks 1 thru 7, track 9 and 12, not excluding the other tracks, I can just identify with those especially. This albums flow is mellowly, R&B, jazzy, sultry and of course sprinkled with hip-hop. This album has made my day:)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the entire series.  Cant wait to read more and see the movie.  It was very full of suspense and crazy story line that kept you wanting more.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Written through the eyes of the child experiencing his world that was a horror, but normal for him.  I really enjoyed this book and was greatful the author gave us a tight ending.
B004WR125O|5.0|Plug it in and it works great.  I have had no issues with losing connection because of a weak signal.  My router is in the basemet on the other end of the house and this sits on my first floor.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I downloaded this for my daughter and she loves it. Great app,  even has a story kids can follow and games are easy to control so you don't have frustrated kids.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I loved the entire series.  Cant wait for more.  Cant wait for the movie as well.  I read all 3 books in less then 2 weeks.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great story told as seen through the eyes of the dog.  The story made me smile and I loved it.
B008AT71WI|5.0|This review is for the latest Blu-Ray Director's Cut release.<br /><br />The Movie: I have never seen the original Roger Corman version and I've never gone to see a live production of the show, but this version of Little Shop has always been a favorite movie of mine. Simple set designs, catchy musical numbers, and great performances...especially the smaller ones from Steve Martin and Bill Murray...this movie has a lot of heart and soul. Also, the special effects have held up AMAZINGLY well...they did such an incredible job with the Audrey II puppet...I think after being jaded from all the CGI lately, seeing this puppet in action was nothing short of jaw dropping for me this time around.<br /><br />The Video: I own the original DVD for Little Shop and I can tell you the video on this version is stellar and definitely worth the upgrade.<br /><br />The Audio: I don't really rate audio...not my thing...but it sounded just great to me.<br /><br />Special Features and Packaging:<br />The packaging on this release is really nice...sort of a \\"digibook\\" format. There's some great material and information inside the case. Also, although I haven't fully delved into the extras on disc, I did watch the alternate ending....and I have to say, it alone is worth the price of this Blu Ray. It's amazing to see the darker ending that was originally shown to preview groups.<br /><br />Final Thought: If this is a favorite movie of yours, and you only own the DVD version, this is definitely worth the upgrade...much like the recently released Jaws Blu Ray (look for the DigiBook for that unfortunately only available at a certain Big Box store).
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Its great to be able to get the great old movies on DVD at a great price. Love this movie!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book flowed very nicely.  It left me in suspense through the entire book.  I cant wait for number 3 to be out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not too much &#34;scienceficition&#34; to be weird yet enough to be enjoyable.  Very well written and a good fast pace.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved this book.  A real page turner.  Vince Flynn does not disappoint.  Great plot with lots of twists and turns.  Highly recommend this book.  A great way to relax
B005MSD75U|2.0|I thought this movie was boring. Might be good for kids t ough..... I would not recommend it to anybody.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great series.  Very crazy that someone thinks this way but the books were great and not easy to put down.
B0071CBBKS|5.0|I am in love with this new CD! I have listened to it on repeat many, many times and still cannot decide which song is my favorite. If you are a fan of the Fray, you will have no reason to dislike this CD.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|This book was worse the DeMille book to date.  I needed to push my way through it.  Love Corey character in past books.  In this book his wise cracking is over the top and annoying.
B0055ODXBY|5.0|This is a great show!  I'm not going to go into too much detail (if other ppl wanna give stuff away about the movie, so b it but as for me, I'll not b the spoiler ;)  but I think this movie was written perfectly!  What happens in this movie allows for future movies to b made w/o messing up anything from the original! :)  The way it's done, it allows them to base it off anything that's already been done & make it fresh/new!  I love the casting for this show (ALSO perfect! ;)  If u haven't watched this show, u need 2 buy it (u r in for a treat!); if you've already watched it & r deciding whether or not 2 buy... stop trying to decide & just buy it now (u r also in for a treat & u KNOW it! :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the entire series.  It was quite demented and nothing like I have ever read before but I loved it.
034580404X|5.0|Wow! Just....WOW! Books arrived on July 13th, I finished ALL three by July 17th! WOW! I haven't had a chance to pick them up again as I've been busy with school.  When winter break arrives....I'll be doing my 4 day read once again!
B00005NKKV|3.0|It was worth the price to get the one tune and have a hard copy of the Cd. I would buy it again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book (series).  Amazon offers the lowest prices and best downloads.<br />If you like strong romance books (very sexual) this is the series to read.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I loved the entire series.  I read all 3 books in less then 2 weeks.  It was very suspensful and kept wanting to read more.  Very hard to put down.
1451695195|3.0|His experience seemed confusing to me given what I have heard from others concerning their near-death stories.  Also, while I am sure his medical data concerning what he had may have been of interest to some, I found it laborious to read through.
B00005NKKZ|3.0|It was worth the asking price to get one good tune and a hard copy for keeping. I would buy it again.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and haven't heard of any complaints<br />and yes I would recommend this to anyone and everyone :)
B005N0PJJO|5.0|Best series I ever read.  All 3 books were great and they kept you in suspense all through the series.  Cant wait for more.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Again, it was Okay but unlike the beginning of the series it was a little lame.  The excitement was lost along the way.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT AS GOOD AS THE BOOK LIKE MOST MOVIES, BUT I THINK THEY DID A GREAT JOB JUST THE SAME. THE ONLY PART I DIDN'T CARE FOR THEY CHANGED IS THE ENDING. ABE WAS TURNED INTO A VAMP AT THE END TO CONTINUE ON HIS CRUSADE TO KILL ALL BAD VAMPS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO READ THE BOOK AGAIN BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER CHANGES AND NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT ALL HAD ME THINKING I WAS CRAZY OR WAS JUST A CHANGE FROM THE BOOK..HAHA. I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.
B000FA57US|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and haven't heard of any complaints<br />and yes I would recommend this to anyone and everyone :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it and read the second one as well.  cant wait for number 3.  It very much reminded me of 50 Shades but the suspense was just as good and I loved the story line.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Enjoyed every ounce of it.  It was excillarating to watch all of the dance routines and how they performed each segment to the letter.
1608871452|5.0|I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW AWESOME THIS BOOK IS! AND IT'S HUGE! I MEAN HUGE! I KNEW IT WOULD BE BIG BECAUSE OF IT BEING A COFFEE TABLE BOOK, BUT WAS NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE AS BIG AS IT IS! EVERY SUPERNATURAL FAN SHOULD GET THIS BOOK! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! THERE ARE TONS OF INFO AND LITTLE GIFT SURPRISES THROUGHOUT THE BOOK! I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE! I GET THE MAGAZINES AS WELL AND HAVE THE BOX SETS ALL ON A SHELF TOGETHER AND THE BOOK MAKES A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO THE SUPERNATURAL COLLECTION!
B001E45XT4|4.0|The quality of the noise is quite good. The sound is separated from the mic entirely. The only bad thing is that they feel like ear muffs and after awhile they get hot and you would have to readjust.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|Not an original idea in the film. He must have needed some cash to pay for the Porsch. Aliens in the stomach! How original!
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Loved it.  As before it was very fast moving and interesting to see the story unfold about love and family.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET IN ON THE BLACK FRIDAY WEEK DEAL ON THIS SET AND GOT IT FOR $19.99! AWESOME PRICE FOR ALL THE ROCKY MOVIES.. WELL EXCEPT 5.. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT ONE! SOMEONE HAD A BRAIN FART! ANYWHOO, I RECOMMEND THIS COMPLETE SET TO ALL ROCKY FANS. I FINISHED THEM ALL UP TODAY. I LOVE HOW THEY ARE PACKAGED AS WELL. A LOT OF BOX SETS OR SETS ARE PUT TOGETHER WITH ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER SO YOU HAVE TO HOLD ONE WHILE GETTING THE OTHER ONE OUT OF IT'S SPOT. THESE EACH HAVE THEIR OWN SLOT AND VERY EASY TO REMOVE AND PUT BACK. SO GET YOURS TODAY OR WAIT AND SEE IF THEY ARE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER SALE ON IT!
0307744434|5.0|This book has the feel of a fever dream, or one of those magical realist books from the 70s and 80s where anything could happen, and often did, but through a mist.  Superfically about a competition between two magicians (although any thought that this resembles Christopher Priest's well known \\"The Prestige\\" should be put aside) it is really about the nature of connection, performance and love.  It is moving, ethereal and strangely compelling as it weaves a tale about the late 19th and early 20th centuries from the point of view of circus performers who are far more than they seem, and who are in love with each other and the magic they perform.  It is beautifully written (and it is her first book, amazingly) but the poetry of her language never detracts from the momentum of the story, which is told in an unconventional structure that never seems to detract from its own coherence.  A great book, and I can't wait for her next effort.
0966638328|5.0|Received the package ahead of schedule and the book was packed very well to assure no damage came to it.
B004A8ZWT2|3.0|I didn't particularly like it but I guess it was okay.  However, the tape itself was very clear.  For some reason, the Blu-Ray did not play on my BluRay machine.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I enjoyed the game but didn't love it as much as other similar type games I have played. It would freeze up on me every once in awhile. I thought the graphics were great although I do agree it would have been nice for a zoom feature but not critical IMO. I played it on my Kindle Fire and found that if I turned up the brightness all the way, that did help.<br /><br />I did find the game difficult and challenging in some areas. I ended up having to turn on the skip puzzle option because there was one or two that became tedious and boring.<br />Although... I didn't realize what the moths were for until I was almost done with the game (used for hints through the game! Duh! although some of them are just basic hints and don't provide much) and the gold coins are not required unless you want to see Zoltar.<br /><br />I did end up having to consult a walk through because I was stuck here and there at what to do next. I do agree with others that at times it seems the next step isn't always  clear and doesn't make sense. Some of the puzzles are a little confusing so you do really have to pay attention to some of the items you find or some of the things you uncover and have to try out random things with the items you find. It was almost like the dev. was trying to get too clever or mysterious about the steps or puzzles to throw the game player off and it just ended up a confusing mess.<br /><br />You do have to collect 99 puzzle pieces so that you can unlock and complete a portion of the game. They are hidden throughout the game. Although, I ended up only finding 97 and it let me continue with my quest. I started the puzzle and put the outside pieces together first and tried to organize the other pieces but left the puzzle and when it went back it reset my remaining puzzle pieces. So once you start on the puzzle and start to organize pieces, make sure you stick with it! Puzzle isn't hard, just a little tedious.<br /><br />The game was only $2 so worth the price and I would recommend it to others who enjoy this type of game since the purchase price was so reasonable. I think some may become frustrated and others will really enjoy the challenge. I did enjoy it enough and just purchased The Haunt 2 (haven't played yet).commend it to others who enjoy this type of game since the purchase price was so reasonable. I think some may become frustrated and others will really enjoy the challenge. I did enjoy it enough and just purchased The Haunt 2 (haven't played yet).
B009RI4FRU|1.0|We kept thinking that, with this cast, the movie had to get more interesting.  It didn't.<br /><br />I figure a bunch of actors wanted to have some fun making a movie and didn't care if it was interesting.<br /><br />All the deliveries were deadpan. What plot there was was stupid.  They found the kids described in the summary about 30% into the movie.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|good book, they bounce around with testimonials from different characters they never come back to. each has a show/book/spinoff potential BUT never really comes back... though it was knowledgably written and a good read...worth the kindle download price for sure!
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was the ultimate endurance of a love which had to come to the this end.  Lovers forever and finally no holds barred.
B000I3PERS|5.0|I got this movie for my husband as it is his favorite.  It is a great couple compromise as it has an intellegent story line for me and lots of blood and guts for him.
B000A0K2JO|1.0|I haven't been able to get this adapter to make a connection on my computer.  I'm a bit frustrated by this.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|These are great little sharpeners to put in your pocket or your lunch box or anyother place where you need a quick knife sharpener that will put a good edge on and ge you through the day .I would recommend them in your bug out bag or in your car for those emergencies that may arise.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was a wonderful story about challenges, love and lost, faith and belief and regaining all when the odds were stacked against you.  Simply put, AMAZING.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is an old movie that fascinates my Today preteen and she has watched a dozen times. I still love it too. What is \\"goonier\\" than an old movie fascinating today's youth![[ASIN:B004ADH1RI The Goonies]]
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Totally addicted to this show. Loved season 1. Season 2 is just as good, ( spoiler Alert) the only thing i don't care for is the alien stuff.
B009F1ZYCO|5.0|Classic IRON MAIDEN re-issues on high quality Picture LP, what a great collection addition !!!! A must for any Maiden fan !!!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Out of the whole series of Fast and the furious, this one by far was the very best one.  I loved every bit of it.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I feel like this mic should cost more, in terms of range of sound and how it records despite the form factor.  I don't use it mounted on the hotshoe usually so I'm not going to complain that it picks up small sounds like focus motor, user burping, etc.  When on a boom with extension it is really nice...
B005LAII08|5.0|We were able to see this movie in the theater and my girls loved it so much that they could hardly wait for it to release to dvd. I'm especially excited to have the digital format though I was disappointed that Disney forces you to use iTunes or Windows Media to download it. Though we don't currently have a 3D Blu-ray player or tv, maybe in the future... Overall, I couldn't be much happier with the movie and the set of discs.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|This album is simply superb. If you are a Steely Dan and Donald Fagen fan you will already have bought this album and will agree that it is one of the best yet. If do not own any Dan or Fagen albums you must buy this, listen to it every day for a week and you will be hooked. This CD get better and better with every listen and you will soon be searching for the Steely Dan/Donald Fagen back catalogue.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I just got finished reading a bunch of Netflix reviews on this movie and I feel like a just left a nuthouse.  They were trashing the movie for all kinds of reasons.  One person was racially offended because Jamal found some success, others felt the story to be completely unbelievable and others believed the movie to be condescending.<br /><br />Get over it!  Yes, sometimes the good guys win.  And yes, there's nothing wrong with a normal, good kid getting a break.  Why do movie characters all need to be emotional train wrecks?<br /><br />This is a story of how a good kid with talent can overcome economic disadvantages.  It does actually happen.<br /><br />The cast, screenplay, acting, directing and cinematography are all top shelf.  This is a great movie.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Everyone in the family liked the cd, but wish that it didn't have so many slow songs on it. Otherwise, it was perfect.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is way too addicting. And I can't even figure out WHY it is. Before I do anything else on my Kindle I have to first check my friggin' coins.<br /><br />Damn...
1105495957|4.0|George Orwell is well known for works like 1984 and Animal Farm, and deservedly so.  Readers who have enjoyed these tales should pick up Orwell's more biographical works like \\"Down and Out\\" and \\"The Road to Wiggan Pier\\".  These books accurately describe a life that the history books ignore: poverty in England and France in the early 1900's.  The descriptions of day-to-day life- scrabbling for bread and cigarettes, finding shelter or work, the miles worn into your soles- make you appreciate your own predicament all the more.<br />This is a great read for all ages.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Very  entertaining movie.  And the camoflage parts were great.  How did he hide himself so well?  Fooled me twice. I had to play it over again just to see if I could find him hiding.
B003E88TKS|5.0|This was an incredible film with a great script and gifted actors. The ending did close as you'd expect, and George Clooney was not the hero this time around. However, that made his character even better.
091581112X|5.0|i have got so much good from this book, i highly recommend it to you. i have even given a class on it..
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys have picked up a lot of fans in the past few years, and I am one of them.  They are well known for popular hits like \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\", but you will find an album full of good work in El Camino.  The Black Keys have taken their popularity in stride over the past few albums, and El Camino keeps to their soulful rock/blues roots, while adding some fun songs into the mix.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am a huge Taylor Swift fan and I love her work, but she has outdone herself on this one!  Same great heartfelt and original songs that you'd expect from her!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Everytime I try to stream a song, it force closes. please fix!!!!! I'm not sure if I can even download my songs right now. So frustrating!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I usually find myself on Book Three or Four of an epic thinking, &#34;this is the same story/banter/stuff as the last book&#34;.  I am really impressed with this series and Mr. Martin's ability to keep me intrigued with the characters' development.  I love his ambiguous notions of good and evil which endow his characters with understandable but variable actions.  This is a really refreshing and more realistic approach (albeit somewhat idealistic) to human behavior.  No matter what, I am loving the surprises and innovation of his creations!  I am looking forward to the next!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I like all of Vince Flynn's novels, but I enjoyed this one more than usual.  It is fast paced and a great plot.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Cornwell's earlier books are so much better. Although it wasn't a bad read, it just wasn't as good as her earlier works.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can I say? This is a must have app in today's world. You can keep in contact with friends and family just about anywhere and feel like you're still a part of their lives.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The second is the best ..some of the characters lost in the final book really upset me . There was no reason for it...
B007REV4T8|5.0|I can't review the BR/DVD release specifically, but I can review the movie.  I'm a long time Bond fan, and have stuck with them through thick and thin (Die another Day was quite thin).  I don't want to give plot lines away, but this movie pulls everything together that ever was, is and will be James Bond.  The start sequence is classic Bond filled with exhilarating fight, car chase and gun fire scenes.  Adele's musical intro is a true return to the Big Band music I grew up with, and the visual sequence that goes with it is stunning.  As you watch the movie you get to see where each of the parts from Adele's intro come together.  The plot is marvelous, with delightful `nods' to James Bonds of the past, that can only leave you with a knowing smile.  None of the punch-lines are excessively corny, simply leaving you snickering.  The grand finale is beautifully elegant, tying loose ends together with subtle details that please the heart.  Yes, I'm a Bond fan.  I know there have been some pretty stupid Bond movies in the past. But this one?  No, this sets you up ready, eager and waiting for the next installment.  I was so eager, I went to see it twice, and could happily watch it again.
030758836X|3.0|I finally picked up this widely discussed and acclaimed suspense and finished in a week. The first 2 chapters almost got me to quit as they were filled with the most boring details which you just don't expect in a so called \\"suspense/thriller\\" novel. I wonder how the editor could have let it pass. I trudged through and got intrigued in the second part of the book, literally flipping the pages until I hit the last part, where I had a bad feeling that the book was going to end badly, and which was indeed the case. That was probably one of the worse ending I've ever read over the years. It's like the author got so out of hand and let her imagination run so wild that she wasn't able to write a proper ending, because all scenarios just wouldn't support. Such a crazy ending which not only unconvincing, unrealistic, but laughable, even in a fictional world that could never in a million years happen.<br /><br />The characters are unlikeable either. Like many reviewers here I do not care for them or what happens to them, even if eventually they manage to kill each other I wouldn't raise an eyebrow and probably think they deserve it. That's how despicable the characters are portrayed and presented. The storyline itself is not outright crazy, which could have been built up well and ended beautifully, but what a shame, the author didn't carry that till the end (or lacked of such in the very beginning?)<br /><br />And the many pages of meaningless rambling! What was that and how did that contribute to the story made me scratch my head. It really set me strayed from concentrating on the story and kept me wondering if the author ever going to get to her point.<br /><br />To me, this book is definitely a disappointment, comes in many flaws. Not my best read.
B00005S6K8|5.0|This is a remake of the original Sabrina, but I like this version better than the first. I think it is a great story.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Interesting, Fun, & Better than I thought it would be.  I would recommend this movie to those who want to relax, enjoy, and not take it too seriously.
B003MC5N28|3.0|The Giver was recommended to me by my granddaughter as her favorite book.  I found the early chapters a bit confusing as to how the community structure was evolving in such a foreign way.  It mystified me if this story was a human, animal, or unknown species.  As the story unfolded I felt for young readers could be frightened or mislead by the structure and rules of the community, on how the community tolerated inhumane rules and violations of human dignity perpetrated on all ages.  From the killing of young babies, the elderly, and the match making of couples in order to marry, as well as only allowing 2 children per family unit.  Where did democracy, freedom, and individual choice disappear to, especially after all the past wars fought to protect FREEDOM for ALL!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I wish Vince Flynn could write a book about Mitch Rapp every month. I have read them all starting this year and am reading them again. The Last Man is tremendous. I hesistate to say it is the best, because all of them are so good. I will guarantee you will not be disappointed in this book. Kudos to Vince.
B009CPES4I|5.0|This is a wonderful film about approaching your senior years and finding purpose and fulfillment in a time where most believe there is non to be found. I loved this movie and I would purchase the DVD!
B0000042HV|5.0|This is the only Shostakovich String Quartet set I own, so this will not be a comparison review. However, having said that, I still believe this set is well worth its low price.<br /><br />These performances are truly hair-raising in their virtuosity and drama. Like the symphonies, Shostakovich's string quartets are highly melodramatic, often filled with page after page of heart-rending emotion. The Fitzwilliam String Quartet has all the technical and musical resources to bring these searing masterpieces to life with absolutely no holds barred. The virtuosic playing of the first violinist is particularly memorable.<br /><br />Recorded 1975-1977 in Surrey, England, these six discs present all 15 quartets in order, and without splitting any quartet between discs.<br /><br />The engineered sound is excellent throughout. My only complaint is that a few passages are played so softly, you almost can't hear them.<br /><br />Includes a wonderful book of liner notes (English, French, German) on every quartet.<br /><br />This budget set is *highly recommended*.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I bought the book out of curiosity. I had read about it so much that I wanted to know what the hassle was about.<br />Still don't get how the book can be life-changing as I had read, though...<br />But it is a nice book. It's easy to read (English isn't my native language) and it's hard to put the book down :)<br />The sex scenes get kind of boring in the third book... It's a bit too much of a good thing I guess :)<br />But the story besides the sex is interesting, it keeps you wanting to read further to know what happens.
0785163174|2.0|Just started reading AVX OHC last night. Gah.<br /><br />I understand what Marvel was attempting with this series, but man, this book is horrible.  Characterization, plot, and logical team interactions are thrown out the window. Captain America, Wolverine, and Cyclops all seem horribly, horribly out of character. Granted, I've only made it through the first four chapters, but it's terrible.  Even with such as large cast of characters, the main players all seem virtually interchangeable. There is no true character \\"voice\\" or motivation.<br /><br />Somebody please phone Chris Claremont, STAT! He's got to be slamming his head against a wall somewhere after seeing this garbage.<br /><br />As others have commented, the gutter loss is very bad in spots. Normally this kind of thing doesn't bother me too much, but I found myself really cracking the book open far more than usual in order to read all the caption boxes/word ballons. The red AR boxes also totally take me out of the storytelling experience. It's just jarring & annoying. I'm probably going to flip my copy on eBay as soon as I fniish reading it in a few days.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I check my weather daily with this app and it is always accurate alongside local weather forecasts. I enjoy the features of the app a lot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and relaxing. Fun for all ages. More challenge with each level. Very addicting. Flow app is well worth downloading!
B008D28HYS|3.0|I was really excited when I saw that this app was available.  I enjoyed the first couple levels but then I found some pitfalls.  The pictures are great but the work space is not easy to use at all.  In order to fill in the squares you need to be zoomed in pretty close and to do that and to see what you want to do is really hard.  This made it unplayable to me as I like to see more of the work space when I do the puzzle instead of a six by six square on a 100 by 100 square puzzle.  It just isn't for me and it just didn't have the same feel as the first one did.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I gave this film 5 stars because it was perfectly delightful.  The acting was superb, the story was enchanting, the photography absolutely glorious. I highly recommend The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel  to any one over 55.  It will make your heart smile.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app regularly and would recommend it to anyone. I use it on my phone and my kindle fire.
0316187216|5.0|Another great Joe Abercrombie book.  I've read them all now and this was another great read.  Exciting, bloody, funny, full of wit, wisdom, and great characters. Loved it!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite games that I have on my Kindle Fire.  It is easy to use and a really great puzzle games for the genre.  I have played similar games on other devices and even have books that have the same puzzles.  What I like about these puzzles is that there are no trick empty spots and the pictures make sense and actually look like what they are suppose to be.  There is always a way to figure the puzzles out even on harder levels and the area to do the puzzles is easy to use (made easier with my stylus).  The updates are wonderful as they add new puzzles to all the levels so no matter your comfort zone you will have new puzzles to do!  It is well worth the money as it has a high replay value and lots of updates.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|The best movie Spike Lee ever made. I never get tired of watching this movie.<br />The acting and writing are superb
B008XG1X18|4.0|Fun for looking at recipes and new dishes to try out. A friend turned me onto it and I have found it to be quite useful.
B0039NAVKY|4.0|I've read Vogue magazine for years and years and always wondered what it was like behind the scenes. The book 'The Devil Wears Prada' and movie gave some insight into what Anna Wintour is like to work for but it was pretty cool to see her in action and see even the big name designers bowing to her wishes. I especially enjoyed watching Grace Coddington work; she is truly talented. The soundtrack is lovely too.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I have downloaded this game for every device I have that offers it and I still enjoy it!  It is a must if you enjoy puzzle games or casual games where you combine things.  This one you start for the four elements and from there you can unlock a world of objects from vampires to Christmas trees!  It is creative and some of the combinations are actually quite funny.  It is a good free app to have and if they would make some updates it would be worth paying for as well.  The only things I would say it needs improving on is the work space that you have the combinations on and maybe a way so you can sort the ones you already have so you aren't trying fire with ones you have tried before.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i can't stop watching, i wish this show had ,more episodes and a movie. and if it was all available now that would be great
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I bought this last year after I decided to invest in a vinyl collection. I absolutely love the quality of this turntable and would recommend it to anyone. I have not used the vinyl to USB feature to transfer music, but I have no doubt that it is easy to manage.
B009X01C64|4.0|This is a nice case.  It is genuine leather and will stand in either portrait or landscape position.  It fits my kindle fire 8.9 inch very well.  And the 3 different standing positions are nice.  This works well when I am sitting at a table or desk.  However, when I am laying in bed, the case does not angle enough for comfortable reading.  So I end up holding it when I read in bed.  That is the main reason I gave this case 4 stars and not 5.  There is also a pocket to store accessories.  And there is a strap that will help you to hold the kindle like a book.  However, this is a bit cumbersome since the 8.9 inch is larger than the regular kindle and weighs a good bit for its size.  Not sure I will use this strap much.  But for the most part, I do enjoy this case and the added protection for my kindle and mobility it gives me.
B0054SMID0|5.0|very good movie. twists and turns keep you engaged through out the movie. like the fact that the movie remains faithful to the book it is based on ! would like to watch more of similar movies.

B0040QYROA|5.0|I now that there are still parts lost, but this felt like a complete experience for me as such ect.
B007M45PMU|4.0|thoroughly enjoyed this album more than i originally expected.  Stubborn Love has become my favorite song on the album.  i was ok with their first single but whenever i hear something i'm on the fence about on &#34;The Spectrum&#34; on XM, i tend to form a mental block because it is like lite rock my dad listens to anymore.  hearing the rest of the album dumped my biases and changed my outlook completely.  i liked it.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Love the Album, Love Lana.  The shipping was sooo fast! and it was very well boxed. We got this album along with another i had purchased- and we switched to Lana after about 5 minutes and listened to her all night. :P
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|We are so starved for a decent sci-fi, anything with a bit of special effects seems to suffice. The plot makes very little sense and leaves you hanging at the end with zero explanation. The really disturbing part is this was one of the better scifi movies in the past 12 years. That doesn't make this a quality movie. They just spent more on sets, props and graphics. Too bad they didn't use original ideas instead of copying Alien.<br /><br />Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender were the only two bright spots of the film. In fact, their performance was so far above the others, it was clear this film was far beneath their talent. Their presence by comparison, just showed us how seriously lacking of talent the rest of the script, cast and film crew management were. The graphics were also good but nothing spectacular.<br /><br />The director & writers were simply awful as was the performance of Logan Marshall-Green. The rest of the ship crew were even worse, but that was the fault of the writers & director who designed them that way. The actors were only doing what they were told. Conversely, Logan was simply awful like some raunchy stranger you wake up with, after overindulging at a party the night before. There are so few actors with genuine talent anymore. It just makes you cringe to watch them.<br /><br />Obviously, most of these reviewers aren't old enough to remember the original alien. Thus, they don't know a copycat film when they see one. This is not just some tie to the original alien. It is nearly a duplicate from the alien growing in a crew members abdomen, to the robot with its own agenda ending up talking with its head torn off (named Dave, of course. Remember 2001 Hal & his voice?).<br /><br />Then we have a giant octopus generating a claw hammer headed alien (identical to Alien). A bit of DNA improbability. Let's not forget a corporate employer with a hidden agenda. This isn't an alien prequel. It's a full-bore ripoff of the first alien movie right down to the scurvy crew. They had to tie it to alien as a possible prequel & pay them homage (pronounced Ho'mAj not O'mozh) to stay out of copyright court.<br /><br />You have to picture a crew & 2 field professionals who wake up from 2 year hibernation acting like they've never met each other nor seen the inside of the craft before. Who would go on a 2 year journey without knowing who they were traveling with; or who was in charge or seeing the ship before they boarded? Or having an idea as to what the mission was before they left earth?<br /><br />Next we have a rowdy, cigar smoking captain into 60's rockstars and a tattooed punk, sucking tobacco in his spacesuit & hating the world. No one would tolerate smoking on a space craft today; much less in 2093. Talk about selling your soul to tobacco sponsors. It was absurd and insulting to the audience's intelligence. After 2 years in sleep, their bodies would surely have eliminated the need for tobacco-if it was even still available in 2093. I would hope not.<br /><br />The same movie formula which worked on smoking, chauvinistic audiences 30 years ago, does not float today. We have improved society & attitudes a bit since then. Why would hyper-clean, respectable corporate leaders spend Billions on a space journey and hire a bunch of rowdy, grubby, smoking, tattooed bikers as a crew? This wasn't some salvage ship for an ore company.<br /><br />Not to mention building a top of the line interstellar ship to go to the unknown without including a single weapon for protection except one portable flame thrower? Nary a single weapon for the ship. And you ask why we still hang onto star trek. At least they used common sense about the future.<br /><br />Then we have the tired stupidity of having our actors run longways under the path of a tall falling object when a simple right or left turn would suffice. It's like those dumb scenes when someone runs down a road with a car chasing them and never consider to run sideways off the road. Plus, they always have to fall down while running if they are females.<br /><br />I also wasn't happy with the \\"everyone eagerly awaiting their parents deaths\\" theme. I guess if you are a dropout Xgen addict who can't or wont hold a job... then that would be your only way to succeed to something you haven't earned nor deserved. If this is your attitude, hopefully, your parents have changed their Wills to exclude you. Frankly, I found this dialogue (of someone telling their father he should die and get out of the way so they can take over everything he worked for) quite disturbing. Even worse when coming from a supposedly clean cut, soft spoken, successful offspring who, quite sweetly, tells father he should die so they can pursue their own ambitions with the corporation, money & empire the father built. Whoever wrote this has some serious parental issues. If I was the parent of the person who wrote this dialogue and thematic attitude, I would hire personal security & immediately charge my Will. This was one scary IRL mindset. Since the director also kept this scene (and had an even worse deleted scene for this parental death wish conversation) and the discussion of how \\"Everyone\\" looks forward to their parents deaths... this directors parents should find this mindset disturbing as well. As for movie value, it really degraded the movie further by ruining any respect this supposedly clean cut character had garnered. We might have expected this from one of the rowdy crew such as the tattooed punk biker type but not the character which spoke the lines.<br /><br />This movie will not fulfill your need for a new scifi but I guess it's better than nothing. The entire crop of untalented film directors over the past 12 years has become pathetic... not to mention the tired, plagiaristic writers with no imagination of their own. I guess this is all the Ritalin generation is capable of doing since imagination & initiative was bred out of them in exchange for peaceful classrooms.<br /><br />If being left hanging at the and of a film without any explanation is a problem for you, then you might want to wait until 2014 and watch this with the sequel which hopefully will explain the story & provide an acceptable ending (if they ever get the project off the ground). Hopefully, they will hire a new director and new writers and restore the characters played by Charlize Theron & Fassbender along with Noomi Rapace since her character is critical to the sequel..

B005PK553C|5.0|I enjoy purchasing my tv series on amazon, the quality of the series was the best!! even though the tv show it self seems to loosing ratings now, I will diff buy again on amazon.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|After the lackluster last two X-Men movies, some people thought this prequel wasn't going to be any better, and some people believed it would redeem the franchise.  Luckily, the latter were right.  This movie hits all the right notes, being faithful to the characters we love from the comics while also to the movie universe.<br /><br />The special effects and the setting are great, but what makes the movie is the characters.  With the exception of a couple of secondary ones, all of them are wonderfully written, and the story has just the right mix of seriousness and humor.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.  It's been a long time since I was excited for an X-Men movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoy this series and look forward to the next book. It a great series that tugs you in
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a complicated story, which at times is hard to follow.  It reads like a mystery with characters who exhibit personality disorders.  Not entirely believable.
B004IQ78HA|3.0|not the greatist quality, sound was not the greatist. I had to put it on max volume. not sure if maybe there is a improved version. Or if its better on HD
B007REV4YI|5.0|Is it possible to like a movie so much that suddenly all the previous movies in the franchise have become better in your eyes?  I would have thought such a thing impossible, until I saw Skyfall.  Up until having watched this film (which I went to see on a theater on a whim), I had neither love nor disdain for Bond films.  They were fine for me, but they were nothing special, I watched them on TV if they were shown, but I didn't rent them, much less buy them.  Yet I did know enough about the character and the mythology to understand some key elements that would have great importance in this last film.<br /><br />To put it simply, I loved this movie.  Every single part of it was great.  Even with my amateur knowledge of the franchise, I was able to understand every (or at least most) in-joke or reference to previous films, since, of course, the story, the villain and the rest of the characters are fantastically written and played.  The most important part, though, is that this movie made me realize how much I liked Bond films.  I suddenly saw the previous movies in the franchise in a new light.  In fact, this movie prompted me to purchase [[ASIN:B006U1J5ZY Bond 50: The Complete 22 Film Collection [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />Now, I was a little scared, because this isn't the first time I like a new movie, I purchase previous films/episodes of a franchise and end up dissapointed.  It happened to me with Star Trek.  Since I loved J.J. Abrams' film I purchased the first season of the original TV series and it was a little hard to get into.  But to my delight, having received the set and promptly watched a couple of the movies, I found that I really liked them.  I'm looking forward to the release of this film on Blu Ray and I will be updating my review when I receive it.
B008YAPRPG|5.0|This version is far superior to the original directors revision. It reflects the movie I saw in the theatre. It is a gritty presention of the film as originally envisioned.
B007SGM084|4.0|Fun read.  Fifty Shades got repetitive in the third book of the trilogy, and ended in a contrived way to my thinking.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is a classic jazz vocal album. Madeleine Peyroux has a voice reminiscent of Billy Holliday and the quality of the music is good
B004M9ZI0M|3.0|Disappointing, despite a potentially great cast.  As a feminist and as an ardent admirer of Helen Mirren - did anybody see her Phèdre from the National Theatre of London? - shattering!), I regret  to say that for me, Prospera instead of Prospero just didn't come off.  She came across as a strong-willed mother, but she lacked the towering stature of the magician who engineers a tempest to serve his ends, involving far more than just her daughter's fate.<br />Sorry.
B0098460O4|5.0|If you saw the Britian's Got Talent shows with Jonathan & Charlotte on it, you know who good these two sing together. Jonathan's voice is spectacular and very powerful but Charlotte is no slouch.<br /><br />You can listen to the both of them all day. WOW!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|There are a lot of various genres of Christmas tunes to choose from. This one excels in every way possible.
1401223176|5.0|I think this is my absolute favorite Batman comic. I love the artwork and while the story-line seems to be squished together with all these different villains I think it took a unique approach at covering them.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|magnificent production, thrilling acting from three of the current best singers of the world.<br /><br />Great to see a production with no gimmicks, no contrived staging, but just something that Puccini and his librettists created
B008YMHORI|2.0|I must admit that I have bought this CD only to compare this recording of Schostakowitsch's Sonata to the one Gabetta has previosuly recorded with Mihaela Ursuleasa. As Grimaud is such a star, after all! I must admit that I do not think Grimaud is really what Gabetta needs! I, for sure, would not have paired them. The piano sounds washed out, imprecise, impolite. It seems to fade away under the strength and precision of Gabetta. Sorry. Waste of time and money. God bless advertising, though!
B0091REZMW|3.0|takes too long to gain energy and it takes to many diamonds to banish phenomenon.  game play is very fun though.
B008IJT0CE|2.0|I really like the concept of this and I love how you can mix the sounds... however, many of the options have a consistent break in the sound - it cuts out just a bit and is noticeable to the point that it is difficult to relax and listen to.  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for this issue.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|I just love this recording- to be able to hear a nights difference from Leeds is simply amazing!! The drums are right up front in the mix which gives a different perspective all around and the boys just seem a bit more frantic and hyper versus Leeds- which I'm digging. To me as a lifelong fan this is a real treat- Leeds will always be a benchmark in the Who's career and rightfully so, but I welcome ALL complete recordings of one of rocks FINEST outfits period.<br />Real WHO fans... get this disc!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have discovered occasional incompatibilities between some streams and some devices but, all in all, this my favorite internet radio utility.
B005XI9456|5.0|This album gives a modern beat to songs for Christmas which is just what our kids appreciate. It is not a traditional Christmas album but I also like the new beat.
0439023483|5.0|Good quality as mentioned.<br />The book is well arrived on time and as expecting.<br />I am enjoying reading about it.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|It was over the top fun movie. The one liners are the best,funny and just cool they can make fun of themselves.and themselves. And it look like they have fun.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I found the main character's constant wise-cracking a little annoying but he book is a real adventure. The characters are well defined and interesting and the plot exciting. I'd love to own the movie rights!
1936850028|5.0|I purchased the Kindle Edition of \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" having spent a week last winter snowshoeing and skiing in the Telemark and Cable area. As a casual skiier and not a racer, I wondered if this was the right type of book for me to read. Right from the start, the author drew me in and held my attention. His detailed and interesting account of his journey into skiing the Birkie and joining the ranks of competitive skiing was very enjoyable to read and is a great motivation tool. Whether your goal is to simply read about the Birkie experience, looking for something to motivate you to get out on the skis so you can be a Birkie athlete, or anything in between, I highly recommend the book. The reading is interesting and motivating.  You'll have some good laughs and enjoy a great \\"view from the inside\\" of this international sport. You never know what catching Birkie Fever might motivate you to do, but I know for sure you'll enjoy every minute of catching it as you read \\"Beyond Birkie Fever.\\"
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|My son really plays this one more, but I watch and play the regular game and this one has more dimensions. Fun to play!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I love all Mitch Album's books and this one starts a little slow but has an intriguing plot and ending.  You'll  like it.
B009X01C64|5.0|I was surprised at the high-quality of this leather case.  The construction is top-notch with nice clean stiching and excellent quality leather and other components.  The plastic is sturdy and the rotation point has a solid feel.<br /><br />Once I got the Kindle Fire loaded, it fit in very well.  I like the fact that you can rotate the Kindle within the case from portrait to landscape.  That's the main reason I picked this case.  There's three notches to set the correct viewing angle.<br /><br />The elastic band that hold the case closed also helps with one hand reading when the case is opened.  This is a great feature.<br /><br />Since this case is built so well, it's a little heavy.  I'm not complaining -- it's just an observation.  This is one of the nicest cases I've ever used.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|If there is an Academy Award for the use of extras in a film, this should receive the award.  Also, the locations and set and scene design is outstanding.  Every role is a great role.  Oldman is outstanding.  PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE MAKE THE NEXT TWO BOOKS!!!!!  P.S.  Any director wanting to use the color green in a film must seek written permission from the crew of this  film-- they own &#34;green&#34; now.  A great script and wonderful art direction and just the right tone.  I love how you never see the faces of many of the women in this film, showing that it is very much a man's world.  Perfect casting in every role down to the man in Istanbul with the briefcase walking his dog!!!  Loved this shortened version because so much of the text was taken care of visually in the location and set design.  Masterful, compact and I think produced &#34;on the cheap.&#34;  Great.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. It will amuse you for hours and hours of fun. It's challenging but not to challenging. It'worth the 99&cent; and more.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm a fan of John Grisham and was enjoyed reading this book. Always a twist and turn. Can't wait for the next one.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This is absolutely breath-taking!! It's certainly not classical composition - it's very much in the theme of most contemporary orchestrated theme-based accompaniment. Nevertheless, this album is filled with themes that easily challenge popular soundtrack compositions of the day (Hans Zimmer, John Williams, etc).
B005CC0CMC|5.0|I think this is a great read after or while seeing the HBO series because there are so many characters it helps to be able to visualize the characters and locations from the series while you are reading the books, even though they differ in some places to the HBO series.  A great fantasy escape.
B007EECSFA|2.0|I read her earlier works and in comparison this one is taking effort to finish. It lacks the &#34;sparkle&#34; of the prior books.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I have this same case for my 8.9\\" Kindle Fire HD and this one works exactly the same as the bigger brother.  It is perfect!<br /><br />I like this case quite a bit and find it to be of high quality and good design for the most part. The Kindle Fire HD fits VERY tightly into the plastic holder on the case, so you don't have to worry about it falling out. It was, in fact, fairly difficult to get the final corner to click in place, but that is okay, as I know that it will be secure. The tri-fold design allows you to stand the Kindle on end or in landscape. The plastic housing has a protrusion that slides into grooves on the third panel of the case when standing the Kindle in landscape. This is very nice and allows you to have three different viewing angles.<br /><br />When folded over to hold the Kindle vertically, the case has a large, sturdy, strap to place your hand in to hold the device.<br /><br />You can rotate the Kindle 360 degrees so it can be in horizontal orientation with the ports on top for charging. I originally thought that this was impossible, as the rotation was very stiff and I didn't want to break the case. It turns out that the case just needed to be broken in a bit and now it is PERFECTION!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is action packed from the very beginning.  The discriptions are so vivid you get emotional reactions from them.<br /> This is a wonderful and exciting book.<br />I high recomend this book for ones reading pleasure.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This app was working just fine when I first downloaded it almost 6 months ago. Now I am starting to notice things happening that never use to before. First of all, it closes constantly, for no reason at all. I need to buy a clothing store from the market. It will let me open the market and buy anything else, but as soon as I go to click on the clothing store, it closes!?! Essentially, if this issue is not addressed quickly, I definitely plan on uninstalling this application...period.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|I just love the music from all the Twlight movie series.  The music just plain speaks to me. Such great talented  artists.
0385344333|4.0|always like reacher, but felt this was one of the better ones lee child  wrote, certainly was a page turner, and have recommended it to others to read, good action, plot
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Love it so far. Works great. Easy to hook it up to the computer. And it's not ugly so I dont mind having it on my desk.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|From Mitch Albom, the one that is still my favorite is Tuesdays with Morrie.  The Time Keeper is easy to follow and even though is full of fantasy it leaves you with a good message.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|The music is great I love the Music from the Twlight series. I have gotten the whole collection of Twlight CD's.
B004GFN11A|5.0|This made the transition from paper journaling to only journaling and blogging that I did not think I would ever do.  It works well, and is simple to figure out!
B002SYXCVK|5.0|Sting is tried and true and these Christmas songs will be on my favorites for a long time to come.  Highly recommend it!
B00679T1EO|5.0|The best tv series I've ever encountered. The acting, setting and scripts are all outstanding. Every time I watch this I enter a British heaven and have tea, scones and marmalade.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I find the game fun, easy to plan and the card size is great.  Uno is a very relaxing game. I can play it for hours,
B002RI9UBS|4.0|The book was a good read and an interresteing story, leaving the reader question the power of the human mind.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this show, zombie media has become quite a monster, lots of terrible entertainment out there. Great writing, acting and effects, I do wonder who's cutting their hair all the time... and the lawns...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. I use it every day at work on my Kindle Fire HD. Very cool and I love that it has memory options. Try it and you will not be disappointed.
1451695195|3.0|I would never pooh-pooh somebody's near death experience;  they experienced what they experienced.  However, I found this book<br />a very difficult read.  How much better it would have been if he strung together all the chapters about his actual NDE and left<br />all the philosophizing and personal background information for a different section of the book.  I was not interested in the<br />philosophizing and background information making up such a large portion of the actual story.  I just thought it was a poorly<br />constructed narrative with way too much extraneous information. That being said, I found the fragments of the actual NDE quite<br />fascinating.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run. My grandchildren love this game.  This was the first time I downloaded a game from amazon and it was so easy to download on their tablet.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is well written. He writes clearly with emotion and humor of his life experiences and conditions in Malawi. It's an inspiring story that I can highly recommend.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've been using this app on my Android phones for a few years now, and it's fantastic to see this available for Kindle Fire.  I've used this on both the old Kindle Fire and my current 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD and it's an excellent file manager for copying or moving files around without needing a computer, deleting and managing media files, and looking at the Android OS files for any side loading and development changes.  Highly recommended for anyone that puts a lot of 3rd party content on their devices.
B0047N0Y52|5.0|5 items with 5 distinct colors (white ghost, red chair, green bottle, blue book, grey mouse).  Flip a card, the card has a picture of two of the items; if the item pictured is the the color of the actual item (say a grey mouse sitting on a blue chair), grab that item (the mouse) as fast as you can.  However, if the items pictured both are the wrong color (say a red ghost with a green book), then grab the only item not shown in any way (not a ghost, not red, not a book, and not green - leaves you with grey mouse, quick grab it!)  A variation of the rules is every time a card has a book pictured on it, you have to say the answer rather than grab the item!<br /><br />It's easy to learn and fun to play.  Points are awarded when you grab or say the correct item, you get the card.  If you grab or say the wrong item, or grabbed when you should've said/said when you should've grabbed, you give a card to the deck and it'll get replayed at some point.  When all cards are out, the player with the most cards wins.  Fun for 2 or more players, can be played with 1, recommended for 8+ years but maybe a smart younger kid could understand it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|So I downloaded it and it worked for a couple days. then after a while, after the day I download it it says the file doesn't Exist! so I give it a 50/50. It was fine but it gradually got worse.
B00932A2MC|4.0|An enjoyably-cheesy movie. Perfect for the family 9+....we all really enjoyed it.<br />The special effects were pretty decent, not too scary for the kids
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This was a good movie for the kids.  The movie has a message and this message will teach kids to be grateful for what they have and appreciate the love of a mother. Also send a message to parents to let their children choose for themselves. It was nice to have all this in a movie. It was entertainment for the whole family.
B000000XB9|5.0|I play this a lot.  Love to hear those old hits and was surprised to hear them do I Heard On the  Grapvine.
B001GMQALY|4.0|Been a very long time since watching this movie, looking forward to seeing it again. Had this one one VHS but the tape got broken so time to get it on DVD.
1451695187|5.0|I don't need any other book about the subject of an afterlife after reading this one!  How lucky we are to have an actual Neurosurgeon's experience - evereyone should read this book.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This is such a well-made movie, the type you end up watching over and over again and never getting tired of in the process.<br /><br />It is filmed so well and in such great locations it just makes you want to jump through the screen and take a walk around for a year or a lifetime.<br /><br />The acting is superb and the screenplay is masterfully done.<br /><br />The lines are delivered so well with such perfect timing, which is so important when adapting a literary masterpiece that radiates with mischievously clever dialogue.<br /><br />Lastly, the soundtrack is just fantastic, I could watch this movie with my eyes closed and still love every minute of it.
B005F9CPG8|4.0|Love listening to those Beatles tunes.  I play this a lot.  I'll look for more Beatles CD's in the future.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Wish I had the 10&quot; tablet so I could draw larger pictures. This app is indeed very cool and useful. You can be on any wick network and pull up the browser for viewing,printing or saving.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I am not new to bodybuilding and diet. I've been at it for awhile. And maybe rightly because of that, I've tried many different training protocols, cardio types, diet styles. In the end, you kindda get lost with what to do, how and when.<br /><br />Mike Matthews in his book 'Bigger, Leaner, Stronger' reminds all of us the basic principles, that simplicity is key, that we shouldn't listen everything we read in bodybuilding magazines and sites, and that it shouldn't be that hard.<br /><br />- weight training: overloading is key. But overloading in weight, not in reps. So go all out, 4-6 reps, 3 sets, Go home. It's short enough that you can totally focus and give it your all, but heavy enough that your muscles are hit hard. That's how they grow. This has worked well for me. After 3-4 weeks, I could already see slightly 'rounder' muscles.<br /><br />- cardio: HIIT.'nough said. That's a time saver, I usually do 20-25 mns max, counting warm-up. No more.<br /><br />- Diet: that's the tricky part, always been for me. There also, Mike is very good at reminding us that it is simple: it's about eating/drinking less calories than you burn during your day. So you MUST count your calories, spread them out over 5-7 meals (easier to digest than eating big meals), and reduce until you hit your sweet spot. I started with something close to what he indicated in the book. Didn't work. Reduced a first time. Didn't work. Reduced a second time: and started to lose. Fast. Already 5 pounds in 3 weeks. I reduced by about 200-300 calories, mainly taking away carbs from the original diet plan inspired by Mike's recommendations in the book. But his diet is balanced, nothing extreme, no zero-carb, no paleo diets or anything like that. I like that too very much.<br /><br />Overall, a very good book, a balanced but effective approach. It works! So I'm gonna stick with it. Mike gives plenty of ways to do permutations in your workouts, so I just finished an initial 6 weeks training, took a week off,and I am designing my second 6 weeks training program.<br /><br />Also to be noted: Mike sends emails to those who buy the book, to see how their training is going. It is not an automatic message: I answered, and Mike got back to me with positive encouragements, and more tips. Really cool!<br /><br />Buy the book, get on with your weight training, cardio and diet, and you'll gradually get closer to a more healthy and stronger body. Enjoy the process.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|This product does not work on the kindle. My son downloaded it for me and worked on trying to get it to work and never did. Finally just gave up. Don't use if you're trying it on a kindle.
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|I was pretty harsh on the Season 1 Blu-Ray.  The video quality was poor, and the menu system was just plain broken.  Much as I love the series, I couldn't recommend buying the Blu-Ray of Season 1.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Season 3 on Blu-Ray is what it should be: excellent menu system and the video quality matches what they broadcast.  If you're trying to decide which one to get, the Blu-Ray is worth the extra cash.
0984183523|5.0|Victor Cheng provides great insight and practical advice for everyone aiming at getting into management consulting.<br />He takes a simple approach to solving the complexity of case interviews, I'm sure that there is no better source on case interview preparation than this book.<br /><br />When I felt I had enough theoretical knowledge though, I could improve a lot my performance by practicing live on preplounge.com. I really recommend it if you want to experience the real case interview situation.
B000I9U7C4|4.0|This is a must-see for any serious movie fan.  Robert De Niro is spectacular as troubled loner Travis Bickle.  We watch his sense of alienation grow as he descends into a kind of heroic madness.  He's that rare evil character that you actually find yourself rooting for, never mind that he's turned into a deranged sociopath.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars?  There's some ridiculous editing in this film.  A lot of it is in the climactic shoot out.  Matthew, the scumbag pimp, takes a a bullet in the gut and returns several minutes later as fresh as a daisy wielding a .44 magnum and firing at De Niro.  There are some strange continuity issues as De Niro climbs the stairs surrounded by his rivals.  You kind of have to see it to understand.<br /><br />Also, there's the famous final scene when Travis emerges as a hero.  It's likely that the dying Bickle fantasizes this whole scene, but that's never made clear to the audience.  That confusion at the end is enough to eradicate a star in an otherwise brilliant movie.
0345803493|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I started getting up earlier before work to read a few pages. At the end of each chapter I thought I'd be able to stop but I didn't want to miss anything. The book is full of intelligent intensity. Love it.
B003R0MF5S|5.0|I was pretty hard on the season 1 Blu-Ray, and I think with good reason.  However, by Season 3, they seemed to have figured out how to make a decent disk, and Season 4 is just as good.<br /><br />If you've followed the season through 3 seasons, by season 4 you know what to expect: an overarching story that just builds and builds, without the ridiculous cliffhangers some shows (Lost, I'm looking at you) feel the need to use to keep you watching.  Each episode is a complete story with a solid beginning, middle and end, but it all points to the ultimate battle that you know is coming.  When it seems things can't get any more tense, they do!  Over and over and over again.  And when the tension gets too strong, they throw in a joke or a lighthearted moment and it just makes you love the show that much more.<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between the Blu-Ray and the DVD, the Blu-Ray is worth the extra picture quality for Season 4.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed this Grisham book very much.  I read it so quickly that I was sorry when it ended.  It kept me on my toes the entire book; just when I thought I had it figured out, it would take another twist.
B005QUQP76|4.0|Awesome quality, though I wished it weighed a bit more<br />Great feel, metal construction on the bottom and n overall modern aesthetic.
0345803485|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to read how sleek and sassy this book was written. I COULD NOT WAIT TO READ FIFTY SHADES DARKER.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|When ever I open this App, the screen view rotates 180 and when i turn the screen around it flips again. i think there must be a way to erase it and then reload it but do not know how. This app does not work on my Kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting. So much fun to play when you are bored. You will want to keep playing over and over again!!!!!
B007REAIUE|5.0|What a great album! The sound is very old school rockabilly.  And what a great price. Buy it - you won't be sorry.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is about one of America's finest ... a brief account of his remarkable career in the US military, culminating in a thrilling mission as a SEAL team member that resulted in the killing of Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />For those people who are prepared to risk their lives for their country, they are heroes.  For those heroes who serve their country in the special forces, however, there are no words to adequately express appreciation for their service to their country.<br /><br />No Easy Day allows readers to gain a basic understanding of what it takes to become a member of a highly professional special forces team.  It reflects the effort put in by these very special men.  It provides an insight into the very dangerous work they undertake while most people are sleeping safely in the comfort of their beds.<br /><br />No Easy Day provides readers with a first hand account of that special mission in Abbottabad, Pakistan.  It provides an understanding of the planning, training and execution involved with that mission.<br /><br />After reading this book, readers are left feeling total admiration for these elite soldiers and the work they do.  It's dirty work but someone has to do it.<br /><br />Thank you Mark Owen for telling your story.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I found this to be a slow read -- laborious at times. Maybe it was all the financial stuff, or the expansive Vanger family -- all the names got confusing.  I did think the character of Lisbeth was interesting...
B00003CXGG|5.0|This movie was great I really only like the parts with Trish (Aaliyah) I didn't care to much for jet li to be honestly honest :)
B005GT3XGS|5.0|I am a big fan of the series for its witty, intelligent dialogue and for a wide range of scenarios for a show. Enjoy!
0425263916|5.0|This was everything I expected and more. Gideon ticked me off many times but I started figuring out was happening. Very wonderful book and cannot wait for the next :-)
B009FXIICK|5.0|Like bejeweled,  but better! I have this game for ds,  so I knew this would be awesome.  For Free too! Sweet!
B008M721MS|5.0|This is an awesome tool.  I love it.  I like the Kindle Fire because it is smal but not to small to do what i need it for.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|great game.  simple in design. tough boss levels.  wish there were more than 20 levels.  minor annoyance is, the game gives achievements. but I can't find where to view them once obtained.  so, because of this I'm rating 4 out of 5 stars.  finished the game in a few hours.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Totally entertaining!  Loved it!  Charming plot, and I would love to see a sequel.  Absolute fun!  The actors were wonderful.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was great how the writer moved back and forth between the husbands story (present day) and the wifes journal... then the twist!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is an important work of writing and should be necessary reading for high-school students. Lest young people forget what gorgeous writing looks like, much less forget how our cultures evolved, this is a must. I read excerpts aloud in bed every evening to my husband because I could not resist saying certain passages aloud. &#34;Why are you returning to the classics? he asked with humor. My response was &#34;because I had forgotten from my college days how relevant and important it is to know the distant past&#34;. History is indeed our precious teacher.
B003U80I5G|5.0|My dad was executive producer, so I am a bit slighted.<br />I love this version since I was a child.<br />My parents watched it being filmed in London.<br />It was on  tv during the 70s.<br />Sadly the copy is not great.<br />Should have been preserved better before they sell it to the public.<br />Music is fantastic. John Williams.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I'm not quite all the way through the first season yet, four more episodes to go, but I can't wait to finish it.  It has so many twists and turns it keeps the viewer guessing.  I'd recommend this to anyone that likes suspense.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As with most crime novels and thrillers, you have to get through the details in the first few chapters in order to understand the rest of the book.  Red Mist and The Bone Bed are the first ones of hers I've read on an e-reader.  I love Scarpetta!<br />I have read everything by Patricia Cornwell, fiction and nonfiction.  She is amazing!
B007LB1O3I|4.0|I am not that much into Electronic music but this album is pretty good. When I went to the concert I was expecting that this lady was going to have an old stile of music with some controversial lyrics and I was completely shocked. The words and graphics to Gang bang are a bit disturbing because all of the violence. I got the album after the concert since it was included in the price of the ticket and the song that I like the most is the first song, it add some nostalgic tone to it not because of the lyrics but the stile of the song. In the \\"I'm addicted\\" song, her voice sound more like a teenager that a 53 year old women. The song \\" I don't give a \\" you can hear the anger to her ex, good lyrics I think. The other songs that are really worth hearing are Love spent and Masterpiece. This last two tell you more of a person than an artist. For the other songs in the CD, I don't really care because there is nothing that I like from them.<br /><br />The music it self it is very decent and again even though I do not like that much Electronic music, I recommend this CD, I do not think that you will be disappointing at all
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Wow, I am blown away. This movie was excellent in the following areas:<br />1. Plot that made sense and stayed connected together.<br />2. Well written dialogue and narrative.<br />3. Beautifully projected in the form of art.<br />4. Great moral lesson taught to the audience.<br />5. Finally Disney is now a new modern storyteller.<br />6. Has a lot of action and funny scenes.<br />7. Drum roll- An original story.<br /><br />I must say, I am an adult and I liked this movie better than some of the adult movies, now in the theaters.<br />It is a must see, for all.
B005KAJPY2|2.0|Well, I bought this album about a year ago because I felt obligated, because I have \\"collected\\" every VNV album and single released (where is my award?). I first started listening to them in 2005 and started with Empires and then went backwards to Praise the Fallen, then forward with everything else. I have barely listened to this album. It's packed with 4 chord pop anthems and repackaged Very VNV lyrics. This scene is becoming so stale with bands polishing their sound and stagnating that I think it's about to flicker out (maybe it already did? Neuroticfish thought so.) Seriously, VNV's sound has not changed in over 7 years. Victims of their success I suppose.
0739367676|5.0|I love all the Twilight books, I have all the books, all the movies and now I have all the audio tapes too
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Pixar has yet another hit on its hands with Brave. They have a compelling and funny story that has you on your toes and they did a wonderful job not spoiling it with the trailers. The animation is top notch.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|A very worthy follow up to Lana Del Rey's Born to Die!, I'd say there are about 3 or 4 songs that are really stunners, but overall very solid album, worth the buy
B004N44SOI|4.0|First, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys the music of Nikki Sixx. Solid guitar work, good song writing, solid vocals, and listenable from start to finish (no filler). That being said I can't think of any song on here that will be iconic like, \\"Kickstart My Heart\\" or other hits like, \\"Home Sweet Home.\\" I understand those are Motley Crue songs and Sixx AM has a very different sound than Motley Crue. It's not the difference in style, it is the lack of that one song that will be played on radio stations across the country for 30 plus years I'm talking about. This band had a couple songs in this category on their last CD. It's funny, I actually find this to be a stronger album start to finish than their debut release but the songs that really grab you on their debut album fit the, \\"WOW\\" category, and I just didn't walk away from that here (listened to it twice so far). In the end I'm really complaining that I want more from an album few others have the talent to produce. Conclusion, worth your money. Go buy it.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|This was certainly an amazing story with surprising twists and turns.  As others have written synopses, I'll not reiterate same.  Although I found the story compelling indeed, I was not enamoured with the long-winded sentences, endless rambling phrases within clauses and all-too-frequent references in brackets.  In the craft of writing, a three-word sentence often proves to be most effective.  Despite my pickiness on the writing style, I found that The Secret Keeper was definitely worth the read.  In three words ... READ THIS BOOK!
B005ONTD42|5.0|This is an INCREDIBLE device (it's more than just a toy), with SO MUCH POSSIBILITY! It's the focus of my research report right now; and, I just gotta' say, I love this little guy and have nothing but an incredible amount of respect for the two co-founders of Orbotix, and their current CEO (Paul Berberian). While not as cool as a quadricopter, I love that the API is entirely open-source, allowing developers for iOS and Android to code for this marvelous machine.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i loved the fact that you can watch it anytime and on my pc it was great. i tried to find these episodes on all different webs and amazon was the best.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|ha ha it was so funny. I could relate to it in many ways I hope Jeff make more books that would be the Best
1433502410|5.0|This Study Bible is an excellent resource for the serious student. It's more objective than most. The concordance is adequate and the map section is extremely helpful. The only negative is its large size. Too much to take places.

B00917IQFY|5.0|Best GP record since Don't Tell Columbus (which is so worth your time).  What you get with the Rumour backing him is infinitely fuller than some of his solo albums in the last 15 years (although The Figgs did a great job on Songs Of No Consequence.  I think the keyboards of Bob Andrews livens this record up most for me.  Bob contributes many parts that I just realize has been missing all these years.  My favorite tracks keep changing, but as of this writing my top 4 are: OLD SOUL, LIE GETS HALFWAY ROUND THE WORLD, LIVE IN SHADOWS, and ARLINGTON'S BUSY.  This record has so much, you really can't go wrong picking it up - especially for $6.99!  Recommended for old and new fans (are there any new ones?).  Just don't expect Squeezing Out Sparks Part 2.  This is a different pace, some more slower songs but there are rockin' songs too.  The drumming of Stephen Goulding in Lie Gets Halfway Round The World, for instance, is brilliant  Get this NOW.
0395389496|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I love the movie just as much and I was excited to get the special edition book.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it because it gives me a fast update on the weather and what to expect.  Easy to access and read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was riveting for me. It was very well written. It was inspirational, I won't say why because I don't want to give to much information and ruin the book for others. I am very critical of what I read and this was a 5 star worthy book for me.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I think it is so cool because you can build like you have always wanted to. and you can make the pities fly.
0688091717|5.0|I learned about this book this year at a school where I was teaching and it is a good story and has some teachable aspects and some good activities to go along with it so I decided to order my own copy.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was so good, my cooking, laundry and cleaning took a direct hit as I as I simply could not put this book down.
B000063DHL|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This album deserves all 5 stars and there's no argument about that. But considering the fantastic sound quality of the original vinyl copy and the marvelous job Martin Birch did on the production of the album, this remastered CD version clearly misses the mark in sound quality. A new remastering is desperately needed for digital fans.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I have now had the pleasure of playing the first three personas on the PSP. Each game have gotten significantly better. Persona 4 blows them all out of the water. Just finished my first playthough at 72 hours and am going into NG+. I plan on really taking my time the second trip around. YEAH, its that good.
B005FISBTO|4.0|Another really interesting Season of my favorite serial killer.  Let's face it, you can only do so much with a plot about a guy like Dexter-- working for the police while secretly killing bad guys and getting away with it!<br /><br />I like the secondary characters,especially foul mouthed Deborah, and Matsuka(sic).<br /><br />The plot does the normal twists and turns, with Dex tracking a pair of killers who see the end of the world coming according to the bible and act out scenes from the text as a warning to all--ending to that seems illogical to me, but OK.<br /><br />Best part of season is the end--it is a shocker, and I wonder how it resolves itself this new season!<br /><br />If you follow Dex, you'll want to keep pace this season,too.
B002X9W50E|5.0|BEST LIVE BOWIE ALBUM EVER!!! and I love that it comes with extra tracks that weren't on the DVD. David Bowie, if you read this, will you please tour again?? I don't care if there's a new album or no, just tour! Please!!
0201721481|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read about C++ programming language. I own several C++ books but I have not read any others cover to cover like I did this one. Few things I like about the book are 1. Writing style of the authors - Most of the explanations are very succinct & to the point. 2. I enjoyed the exercises at the end of each section. However, this book is pretty huge & not a beginner's book. This book is a good read if you have some prior C++ programming knowledge. It will definitely take your C++ coding skills to the next level.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|This movie was horrible, I wish I could give it half a star.  Its the worst movie of the year.  This movie totally ruined what could have been a cult followed movie like Kill Bill, but with humor.  The first one was great.  Sure the lines were corny, but believable and funny because of the great on screen chemistry of all the actors. Thes first one was just a bunch of great friends who had each others back but like all men, still busting each other chops.  It had its moments where the characters truly show that they care about each other and all had big hearts.  I am totally annoyed that my man Mickey was not in this movie... Mickey was there front man, for getting them gigs, and weeding out the crap.  Whats with the cast of washed up has beens, Arnold, Bruce, and Chuck.. Really!!!! I think Mickey, Goofy and Donald could have done a better job, all you needed was Madanna and Mr. Penn to show up...Really!!!!!  When the first one came out I was like, geesh Sylvester is in this, but I was happy to see him make a come back.. I was excited to see the whole barber shop kind attitude of all the guys...What happened to the on screen chemistry, it  must have gotten blown up some where.  I personally think that they should have make Dolph  redeem himself by allowing him to actually blow up the wall, that would have been great, because he was the black sheep of the bunch, that would of been great.  The only smart one in this movie was Jet, he bailed out before anyone could have seen how bad this movie was.  Too many Chiefs without any common sense.  Rick James said, cocaine is a hell off a drug, and I believe that whom ever wrote this and whom ever allowed it to go to screen was definately snorting some cocaine.  Also, since the movie was about big men with big guns shooting up everything..  I really would like to take the following addons out to pasture and shoot them, including Sly.  I want my money back and I want extra for pain and suffering.  This movie hurts far too much..
B009VSW15Y|5.0|to those who do not know how to acess your videos you film with this app that does in fact activate the camera on Kindle fire HD, go to your search bar and type &quot;personal videos&quot; they should be there. for pictures type in &quot;pictures&quot;. I was willing to try to see if the app would work even though it costs money. it does work, and it also will activate your skype camera as well by itself. It defeniatly is worth the extra money, though unconvienent for having to buy it. Hope this helped!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Every woman's fantasy for the most part. I can't stop reading. Now I must have the next book. I heard its better then this one.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I wasn't sure what I was to expect when I first rented this movie. It has one of my favorite childhood actors in it, Shia Labeouf. I been following him since he was in Holes(which came out when I was in the 8th grade). He has been in a lot of excellent movies since then such as Eagle Eye, Transformers 1-3, Disturbia and now Lawless. Based on true events about to brothers who go on a crime spree. Amazing movie about revenge and brotherhood. Gotta give this movie a 4 out 5 (which I rarely give movies 4 stars). The acting was so good with the additions of Tom Hardy and Guy Pierce.<br />I really overall enjoyed this movie, though it does have a language problem from time to time but its nothing serious.
034580404X|5.0|So little has been written about this series, so I think my review will be ever-so welcomed by the reading public at large. First off, this is not 'poorly written' as so many have said.  It's not Joyce or Faulkner, but it's decently written; more than competent. It fleshes out some details of a very common fantasy for both men and women (and probably of many boys and girls as well).<br /><br />This is written from a female POV and often resembles what we used to call 'a bodice ripper'.  There's a ton of sexual content in these books---very explicit and mostly of the 'vanilla' variety.  A problem that I had was that the sex is invariably  supernaturally successful, which somewhat inhibits the suspension of disbelief.  I realize that this is a fantasy, but the situations and characters could have been humanized a bit without detracting from the overall effect.  After all, we learn mainly from our mistakes (at least I do). The other problem that I had was that the female often seemed trapped in a Jane Eyre mindset (as I remember it)  Every time that she feels that things are going well, she immediately has to create an imaginary problem.  &#34;But what if...&#34;.  After a few dozen times, it begins to annoy.  OK, she's young, inexperienced, and insecure, but she's not 11 years old, is she?<br /><br />The main point is that this is a very good story of how two vastly different people can work out psychological problems and wind up with a real relationship. It's not so much a sex story as one of human adaptation.  I recommend this to any adult who may want to get a glimpse into the minds of people who actually do some things that remain only a fantasy  to many folks.<br /><br />Dr. Stan Bonobo, Sacramento
B002MQYOFW|5.0|powerful and moving. I was engrossed through the whole three books. I would recommend it with caution especially to teens.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I highly recommend this game for your kids. It is very time consuming though.<br /><br />Wonderful touches. just like the show.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|This is certainly one of the greatest contemporary books in English for a very simple reason. Namely, if we forget about the exact time frame or locus and socio-cultural conditions surrounding the plot, we can still enjoy a fully developed story, which is totally human, emotionally involving and life fulfilling. The underlying love story is the underpinning of the whole scenario, although it is not intrusive by any means. Despite not achieving his love eventually, the butler has got to know the real meaning of that word and remains a man of real honour till the very end. In other words, a great book by an even greater author with an amazing biography.
B004NS710C|5.0|Loved it! Best movie I've seen in a while. I also love the fact that it was based on a true story.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was a great read.  I think it is my favorite Mitch Rapp with plenty of twists: who are the bad guys and what are their motives?
0345803485|1.0|I borrowed the book from the library, so at least I didn't waste any money on it.<br />I just can't imagine anybody can get excited by such writing. Complete waste of paper and time.
B002VISN9E|5.0|Matilda is really a must-read book for both children and adults. It is allegedly Dahls' most mature and exquisite work. I especially liked the young teacher's character, which is very convincing and symptomatic in terms of social and moral values, set against the cruel Miss Trunchbull. The personality of Matilda is the main driving force in the story. It's amazing how such a fragile kid could in fact bring about a great and positive change in the life of a whole community. The book is so enjoyable, funny, and at the same time so educational and wise.
B009X01C64|5.0|This beautiful case was very well designed and executed and the care is apparent.  While not flashy, it is elegantly simple and very well made.  The leather is unblemished and the stitching neat and even.  All the components fit together into an integrated whole and they perform as intended.<br /><br />The Fire fits snugly  and securely into the hard plastic shell and once it clicks into place, it's there until you move it.  With the cover closed, there's a decent amount of padding surrounding the Kindle to protect it against life's  inevitable bumps.  The elastic strap attached to the back of the case serves a dual purpose.  Apparently, it was intended as a strap to hold onto when reading in portrait mode but I also like to use it to keep the cover securely closed when the tablet is not in use.  That also ensures that the very desirable wake-sleep function of the cover is not inadvertently disturbed by an accidental opening.<br /><br />One of the most versatile and useful features of this Marware case  is the Revolve stand which allows the user to stand the Kindle at three different angles in either portrait or landscape orientations.  Simple to operate, the stand is extremely flexible and will rotate 360°, allowing charging whether the case is open or closed.  It's also very stable and unlike some others I've tried, does not collapse under the weight.<br /><br />It's a good solid feature-rich case and worthy of holding the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".
B002CLBJU0|4.0|Con Air is a mind blowing action film among Cage's best works action wise inculding The Rock, Gone in 60 Seconds and so forth.  The backup actors did a great job in the movie to bring all the action, drama, intensity to the screen.  I miss action movies like this one because it has everything you desire in an action movie, great fight scenes, lots of things blowing up, and a vilian you love to hate.  So if your just looking for a great action movie to sit back pour yourself a drink, and enjoy then pick this movie up and enjoy a night off with one of Cage's better action movies.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|A new way to look at a crime - from the inside out!  You never figure out quite who to trust, or, for that matter, who you want to come out on top.  The execution of the plot is so well planned by the writer, things just fall into place.  Believable characters, good and bad, make for page turning reading.  I loved this book!
B00000AF98|5.0|I just read this in october 2012 in classicrockmagazine.com and it is so much fun I have to include it<br /><br />\\"Last week Tyler told a radio interviewer that he'd \\"hated\\" Kiss since the time the bands toured together and one of Aerosmith's roadies wound up in a knife fight with the other outfit's crew.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes I get offended,\\" said Tyler. \\"They've got a couple of hits but they're more comic book. I hear that and I go, `Yeah, that's alright - do they really mean it? What's this all about?\\"<br /><br />But he added that after the violent altercation he'd \\"gotten to know Gene and Paul, and they're beautiful people.\\"<br /><br />Now Stanley, talking to the Rockline radio show, has responded to the comments.<br /><br />\\"Maybe Steven's feeling a bit full of himself because he has an album coming out,\\" the Kiss frontman says. \\"When their album comes out, let's put it with ours and let the music do the talking.\\"<br /><br />Discussing the bands' 2003 double-header tour he reports: \\"Steven insisted they close the show. I didn't care because one way or the other you have to come up onstage. He had a chip on his shoulder back then.\\"<br /><br />Stanley says he remembers \\"looking down his nose a bit at Kiss. Seeing him come onstage to an underwhelmed audience and people walking out.\\"<br /><br />He adds: \\"Steven may have been over enthused and needs a reality check.\\"<br /><br />I agree: let the music do the talking. I think both Aerosmith and KISS are great bands but Aerosmith doesn't have an album like Crazy Nights! I have about 50 thousand tracks with all kinds of music and this CRAZY NIGHTS album is one of the most fun of them all! The tracks Crazy Nights and Turn On The Night are worth the price alone, I consider them both some of, no make that, THE best rock (glam rock?) songs of the 1980s. With their songs, their fireworks and the charismatic Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, I would love to see KISS live in action, but I guess Iceland will be a bit far off.<br /><br />So I guess I am lucky we have recording technology and therefore this wonderful album. Listen to it and buy it!><br />So I guess I am lucky we have recording technology and therefore this wonderful album. Listen to it and buy it!

B002Z58GQS|5.0|It amazes me the way that memory prices have collapsed in the last few years. An 8 gb thumb drive was once in the thirty plus dollar range, Now ... well it seems to change so rapidly that it is impossible to assess the real cost on a daily basis.<br /><br />The Transcend JetFlash 300 - 8GB is superb! I use mine primarily for the Ready Boost capabilities - and for storing a back up copy of works in progress. It does these jobs faultlessly and perfectly, For the cost - I don't think you could do better. While not 'military grade', it also doesn't have the bloated cost of 'mil spec' items, which come to think of, I don't personally possess either.<br /><br />In essence, it does what is asked, for a decent price.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|I received my box set on Monday November 26. I made it through \\"The White Album\\" This morning, I decided to check the reviews, just to see what people were saying about the set I'd just bought. I was surprised to see dozens of reviews about how awful the sound quality was. I'd made it through 3/4 of the box set, and the only issue I'd had was a bit of fuzziness at the end of Magical Mystery Tour. I assumed that the people saying the sound quality was subpar were audiophiles. I'll add that I'm simply a Beatles fan. I'm not obsessed with the minute details of sound quality and so on. In fact, I'm listening to these on that Crosley Vintage Stereo that the other review mentioned. I actually like a few pops on my vinyl, because for me, that's what gives them their character. Perhaps I shouldn't have jinxed myself by reading the reviews. I moved on to Yellow Submarine, which was also problem free. I thought that perhaps I'd been lucky enough to have a good set. Then I put in Abbey Road. As soon as I dropped the needle, I was greeted by a crackle that sounded like it came from a 30 year old record that had lived a hard life. I'm listening to \\"She's So Heavy\\" as I type this, frightened of what will happen when I flip the record, and frightened of what the remaining two albums have in store for me. I won't be returning this set, because I'm pleased enough with the other discs to justify keeping them and not taking a chance on getting a truly broken set. Besides, I have the 2009 Capitol release of Abbey Road that I bought at Best Buy and it's of good quality. If I want to listen to Abbey Road, I'll simply listen to that copy instead.<br /><br />Based solely on the discs, this should get a 3. However, I'm biased towards this because of what it is- a nice set of Beatles records with original inserts, etc. The book is also an absolute joy. It feels like it was put together very well, and the selective gloss finish on the pages is great. I'm having fun looking for the hidden images that only appear in the right light. The high quality book, overall value of this collection, and subject matter are what justify the 4. But I will admit, for such a high dollar item, I think that Apple ought to have selected a better company to press these discs. It's unacceptable to have such glaring quality control issues on what was supposed to be a prestigious item.<br /><br />As a closing note, I'll mention that I've just flipped the disc. Side 2 of Abbey Road sounds much better. Let's hope the first side is the only issue I have with this set.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|great movie, Joss should be directing Star Wars. IMO this concludes the series quite well. Sad they couldn't go a few more seasons but all in all, great movie.
0547884591|5.0|So, this book is really about learning and about how to learn. I went on the slow carb diet when the 4 Hour Body came out and have lost 15 pounds and even better than that is that I've lost about 10% body fat, I'm now under 10% body fat and I really think its been mostly diet. I love how most of the recipes are Slow Carb compliant. I feel better and have better energy. This book, even more than his others, incorporates Tim's sense of humor and joy to learn more about life. This book is also very colorful, I'd definitely recommend the print version as there are so many pictures and illustrations and the layout is just fantastic. The illustrations on most of the pages are part of what make this book so many more pages than his last, but they are very helpful not just as a cook book (the way a cook book should be) but as a book of learning and how to learn how to learn. Go 80-20 rule!

B003O86FMW|5.0|If you liked the movie, the books is SO MUCH BETTER.  I read the books first, and so my imagination did a fantastic job setting up the visuals in many of these scenes.  The movie didn't live up to that in many cases, and so much was left out of the movie in consideration of time.

B00846REIS|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendation that it was like 50 Shades. This book was riddled with offensive language and just down right nasty! A REAL MAN would NEVER talk to a woman that he claims to love in that way that Gideon talked to Eva. A real woman would NEVER use such filthy language as well. The way that these two spoke to each other was disgusting. This writer needs a new adjective besides the \\"F\\" word! Seriously, who in their right mind calls that part of a 's body a \\"C\\" and means in a sexy, good way?? This book was one of the BIGGEST disappointments and IF it were possible, I would ask, NO, I would DEMAND, a refund of the almost $11 that I paid for this piece of trash! Imagine my horror when I got to the end of the book only to find that NOTHING had been resolved between Gideon and Eva and then told to buy the next book in the series. Hot places would freeze over first before I wasted one more brain cell reading this woman's garbage! The characters were absolutely unbelievable and all I kept thinking about while reading this book was, \\"These people are supposed to come from class and have money, but they talk and act like they were raised in the streets by the lowest forms of life that exists!\\" I hated this book, as I am sure you can tell by now. Don't waste your time or your money!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Got a camera now. This was needed to take pictures. Without this no pictures. Too bad that the shutter button is on the tablet face or the camera wasn't on the back of the Kindle so you can see what you are shooting..
B00973DDN2|5.0|a little different but still worth every penny. go out and support the killers who are one of the few bands were mentioning these days
B0098VYCCE|3.0|A bit 2 dark & need more substance.  I don't know, it just didn't do much for me but the visuals were excellent.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game. Real fun to play. Very easy to play. Easy to download. Easy to run. Both my wife & I like to play
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book, got a little confused what was going on with Peeta, but it was still a great book!!
0525953728|5.0|Mark Owen does an excellent job in this gripping book of telling the real story. I like the way he gives some background of his own life that has led up to the raid on Bin Laden's compound. It is refreshing to read the real story without all the politics. We as a nation owe a great deal of gratitude to Mark and his fellow SEALS who are willing to do the tough stuff to keep us safe.  Ken Bontrager author 18-Wheeler Jihad[...]

B009CPJHY4|4.0|Loved the mix of personalities and how they each worked out their issues.  7 more works required?  Why? Why? Why?
1845767055|5.0|Looking for a long time, I finally found the Paintings.<br />Glad to bought it .<br />It is so good for me,I love it.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely.<br /><br />I went into this movie with the complete understanding that it was to be a separate story within the \\"alien\\" universe. I was not expecting a prequel, and quite frankly, I'm happy it wasn't made to be one.<br /><br />Simply put, this movie gives the watcher different events to analyze and judge for ones self.  It gives the watcher the chance to figure out different aspects and come to ones own conclusions.<br /><br />I'm not much for reviewing movies, but I wanted to give this movie the positive feedback it deserves.  I rarely, as in almost never, find movies that I ever want to watch a second time.  It's a personal thing, as I know many people who watch movies over and over, repeating lines and what not.  I just can't do that.  But this movie I actually plan on watching a second time very soon.  And for me, that says a lot.<br /><br />I hope to see the story created in this movie continued.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|[[ASIN:B004S3MB2U NeoCal Advanced Calculator]] was great on the Palm Treo (sigh). It's just as good on the KF. Bigger keys, too!<br /><br />Seriously, this is THE calculator app for KF. NeoCal (Advanced) does everything. Period. Still a throwback to RPN days, like me? Got it! Algebraic entry? OK, got that too! Wanna do financial? Yahtzee! Unit conversion? Yep! Does it all.<br /><br />If your a cheapskate, try NeoCal Lite (free) or NeoCal Scientific (a couple bucks). If you want just one calculator app, this is it. [I suppose they could add some general algebraic capabilities and graphing, but I don't do that kind of stuff much.]<br /><br /> Highest recommendation.
076790592X|2.0|Morrie deserves a lot better. While at times seemingly very heartfelt the author consistently makes it very clear he's  not the brightest bulb. Another review put it perfectly. Any book written by Morrie is going to have a whole lot more content-and probably  be a hell of a lot less self-satisfied than this author.
B009S8PEHY|2.0|I am glad I got the special buy because I was intending to buy it but I am glad I only wasted $2 and not $10.  If I had liked it I would have bought the $10 one to have a hard copy.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|I don't even know who would be dom anof to get this game!!!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  all I have to say is WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!!!!!!!  suckyest game ever!!!!!!!!  do you no how dom this game is? ?????????????????????  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|After reading the reviews, critics as well as everyday movie watchers, I was somewhat hesitant when deciding to go see this. I loved it on the big screen. Came home and ordered it immediatly. Great special effects, scenery, costumes, set designs and acting. Yes, the actors were all up to standards. Ok, so maybe dialogue was the one area I felt lacked much depth. The actors did what they could with what they were given. All inall, I love this movie!
1449417051|5.0|Hilarious! I have this book (definitely order it!), &#34;5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth&#34; and follow TheOatmeal regularly. I can't wait for 2013 so I can hang this calendar!
B009FXIICK|4.0|this downloaded and played fine on my kindle. I like the fact that it was simple enough graphics - sometimes the pieces in match 3 games are so stylized that it makes them too difficult to differentiate at higher levels, especially with my eyes!!  the animal pics are cute and the music reminds me of original nes games. it doesn't seem ridiculously hard at the higher levels and it did not frustrate me.(yet) ... it will be a keeper for a little while.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good. lots of fun! its a game that takes some time to get used to and wasnt exactly what i thought it was when i purchased it but i am completely satisfied. great free game!!
B008MM9630|4.0|i like the game alot fun and interesting and the best thing its free cant ask for more. you can even play it with no wifi which i good cause i have a kindle fire hd.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've read the following selections from Tim: 4HWW, 4HB, and now this.  I have casually read the blog from time to time, picking what interests me and deleting ones without guilt that I found boring.<br /><br />This book is solid.  I purchased via Kindle, and actually wish I had sprung for a true physical version...The true compliment.  As with many of Tim's books, I read them in a handful of sittings, and then go on with my life.  One day, in a moment of inspiration, I tear my bedroom apart looking for his previous works to revisit the idea of a virtual consultant or using ice bags to lose weight.  Sadly, I always know where my iPad is, so this search for wisdom won't be nearly as fun.  However, the content is all there.<br /><br />The fun, buffet style approach to tidbits of genius appeals to me.  I truly believe that if an idea takes more than 10 pages to explain, it's not as amazing as the author would lead you to believe.  Tim embodies this style with 4HC.  I will absolutely cook using the book, think differently because of his ideas, and above all, continue to find and test new ways to improve my life based on some of these ideas.  Oh, and I feel that the $4.99 I paid for this was nearly criminal for the sheer volume of knowledge and time spent creating this work.
B004BDOJJU|4.0|Fantastic imagination as always and adds something different to the movie which is what I saw first. A well realised fantasy world.
B00124BNF4|5.0|Great compilation of songs at an amazing price. If you liked the Talking Heads you'll love this greatest hits collection.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|It came fast and looks great.  My daughter has loved it and shared it with many of her good friends.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|Love the action on Haven series.  I enjoy the action on both series.  I loved season 1 so much I could not wait for season 2 to start.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Came quick and looks great.  My Jo will be loving this come Christmas.  I wrapped it right up for her.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Fun adventurous movie.  Great for all ages.  If you haven't seen it already then you're really missing out.  Get it now!!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Beautiful story about appreciating the gift each of us is given....the present. Life is so fast, we are all so busy....nice to be reminded how precious it is. This is the third book by Mitch Albom I have read, not on purpose...but I will look for more by this author.
B0029XZODY|3.0|The show is great but the last dvd of season 3 and the first dvd of season 4 are blank, only the intro and nothing to click on to play the show.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The ads don't bother me, so I think this is an awesome free app. But if you don't like ads, opt for something else.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Loved it. Very good game. Highly adictive. Great funto play. Play it for hours. One of the better games i have gotten.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Fun for the whole family!  We enjoyed the continued series and loved seeing all the characters together on one movie.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Compelling drama, well written and exceptionally gifted actors giving nuanced performances. Mandy Patinkin is amazing, as is Claire Danes. The ambiguity of Sgt. Brody's character is so well played by Damian Lewis that in many episodes it is hard to decide if he is a sympathetic character or a villain. Taut, suspenseful, thought provoking and intense. Don't miss it!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great to have.Lets you know just how much juice you have left to work with.<br />This is what every device should have built in. The info is outstanding!<br />Get it and you'll never regret adding this to your device.
0547884591|5.0|I excitedly received this book in the mail recently and proceeded to read the whole freakin thing that day. People at the coffee shop were staring at me as I literally laughed aloud at many segments. Humor aside, the amount of value in this book is unbelievable. Seriously people, you are getting years of Tim's experience, connections to experts, willingness to experiment, and unrelenting drive for perfection all for the price of dinner and dessert. I've read and successfully implemented material from his last two books and this one is proving to be just life changing as the others. Thank you, Tim, for putting your heart, absurd attention to perfection, and tears into this book. My friends and family are going to be having mighty similar gifts this Christmas!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a great show that not a lot of people know about.  I am so glad I was able to download it for free with my amazon prime account.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|tried to watch the movie all through the day but it would not play, didn't even got to watch it but i was still charged for it. very disappointed, very poor service from you guys.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This isn't a child's movies. Adults only! Really enjoyed watching it! I highly recommend this movie! Great story and good cast!
B000W9MMPU|2.0|I have no review for the actual films as I can not watch them. I have now purchased two distinct copies of the trilogy on HD DVD and on both sets Ocean's 11 and 12 do not work, but 13 does. I have tested the movies on multiple HD DVD players. On my Xbox 360 add on player it just doesn't read them. In stand alone players they lock up. Be wary when purchasing this set, I know they aren't ALL like this.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This movie took me back to my childhood in the best possible way.  For those who grew up loving the Muppets, you will love this movie.  It brings the same spirit and adds new life to it with a great performance by Jason Segel and Amy Adams.  Not only will you love it, but its a perfect way to introduce these amazing characters to the younger generation.  I went with my little brother and we both walked out of the theater in the best mood ever.  All we can do for days  was sing Mahna Mahna.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the entire trilogy!  Good clean read that kept me intrigued throughout the sorry.  The relationship challenges were a little old by book 3... but good read for families.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|I am not a harsh critic usually and knew when I was renting this movie that it wasn't going to be a great movie.  Still, often movies like this can be fun and something to do when don't want to be watching a serious movie.  This though was not amusing at all and I really didn't laugh at any point during the movie.  The entire time I was wondering how much longer until it would end.  All in all, you can find a much better movie than this to watch during an afternoon off.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A very risqué read. You will definitely enjoy and unable to put the book down.  Best Read While On vacation or weekend. I couldn't wait to read book 2 which turned out to be a little disappointing. But book 3 provided perfect conclusion with a bit of a year for a possible book 4.
0316228532|2.0|Only worth reading due to her being the author of Harry Potter.  Feels like she is trying to hard to depart from Harry Potter and be a \\"real\\" author with a grown up novel.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I was disappointed in the story line in book 2... It seemed a bit predictable. However after reading book 3i found it provide a pretty decent connection between 1&2
0393338398|5.0|I never understood the obsession with baseball, but I read this book and suddenly I was hooked to the sport.  Understanding the stats behind what makes a player great and how executives makes decisions really adds another dimension to the game.  After you read, you will become a Sabermetric Geek.  Lewis is one of my favorite authors as he knows how to bring what can be very dull subjects to life.  Combining hard numbers with a great story, Lewis makes this book not only informational but also a great read.  For any sports fan, or anyone who wants to understand a significant other/friends love, I would highly recommend this book.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|much better than 2nd book... provides good closure for the story. nice vacation read because it was very hard to put down at times.  I enjoyed the trilogy!
B002APU580|5.0|Books aren't often translated well into movies, but this is beautifully done.  As an English major, I'm always scared to go see one of my favorite books of all time in movie form, but this time I wasn't disappointed.  Firth is an amazing Darcy and Knightly does a beautiful job as Elizabeth.  They really bring the characters to life.  So next time you are looking for a movie to watch when you are having a girls night in, grab this.  This movie, along with some wine and chocolate, will make for the perfect night.
B009FZFONO|4.0|This show is good...but you can tell it is AMC and not Showtime or HBO...with budget being a bit different!  But the story and the acting are pretty spot on!
142314189X|5.0|Series and books like these are what create young book lovers.  I feel in loves with books in the 2nd grade with my first ever Goosebumps and went from there to more serious novels.  Kids will fall in love with the adventures of Percy Jackson, as Riordan is a great story teller.  Lots of adventure, a great way to be introduced to history, and a lead character who every kid will want as their best friend, this is a great gift any parent can be proud of.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I'm an old geek, so this one hits home.  Nice new bird tools, and smooth graphics.  Good pop ups tell you what new birds do.
1612930425|5.0|This is the love story that you will judge all other love stories by.  As well, your romantic life will be judged if you can find your own Mr. Darcy.  Jane Austen is a great book and one that all teenage girls will enjoy.
B009FO908A|5.0|These young men are brilliant singers.  They are a wonderful group; both in individually and collectively.<br />They have truely earned a place in music history.
0439023513|2.0|One reviewer said it best, that the third book is a near emotionless string of events thrown down on paper. I read one critic say that the books are plot-driven. That is true. However, in Mockingjay, the reader doesn't care anymore about what is happening. All they get is a sense of doom, and a feeling of being deprived of something essential. In reality, there probably should have been four books, because so much plot had to be written in that the characters were lost.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Again, the series was for my wife.  She said it is probably the greatest and perhaps, most believable series she has yet to read.  She has read the actual books and on her kindle and plans on reading the books again around Christmas.
1439170916|5.0|This was an exceptional book that I read in several days - I just could not put it down. The flow of the writing felt like I was reading a mystery. In a sense it was a mystery but a mystery about the twists and turns in the discovery of cancer and cancer treatments.  I was especially enlightened about breast cancer and the health care consumer movement that started with women getting involved in decision-making about their own breast cancer treatment. Reading this book also gave me a new appreciation for the researchers and all the dedicated people who worked in labs. The author made what could have been a very dry and scientific topic alive and easy to read and comprehend.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|She likes the first two books so far, but says they are not quite as good as 50 Shades of Grey, but still enjoys reading the series so far.
B00A12Z264|4.0|I'm a fan of Christina Aguilera and think she is one of the few talented artists out there amongst the young ones.  I will admit that at first listen I didn't love the album, but it's really grown on me and I think it's a great change for Christina.  &#34;Army of Me,&#34; &#34;Let There Be Love,&#34; &#34;Just a Fool,&#34; &#34;Light Up The Sky&#34; and several other tracks will grow on you, I think.  Good album for fans of hers.
B000083E79|5.0|I have always liked Cher and this CD has a little bit of everything.  It has her earliest hits with Sonny and it has her best after she went solo.  A real enjoyable listen!
B0086700CM|5.0|I was at 1000000 and I glitches and fell off a cliff so this. game is the absolute worst screw u
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book talks about a half-blood (a child of a God and a mortal) Percy Jackson's adventures. I thought this was a great book! I now know a bunch of Greek Gods I diddn't know about.<br />P.S. sorry for any spelling (if there are any)
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|This movie is just the epitome of grindhouse action and style. It pulls so many elements from so many other films, and somehow makes them better. The visuals are amazing, and Tarantino's mastery of color and composition really shine through, just like Pulp Fiction. I know many people say that he copies shots exactly out of older films, but so do many other directors, and chances are most shots anyone is about to do, unless they do a long-take, it has already been done. So, for the cinematic critics out there (and I know I need not say this because this movie has been analyzed for years) the long takes in O-Ren Ishii's place are amazing. Watch it.<br /><br />Just bought this on Blu-Ray for $4--be careful, the rental version on Amazon is 480p, standard def, so for the best experience I would download an HD version or buy it on Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray came with a free rental, (sweet!) but as I said, it's only 480p. Now that I've watched it again, I'll have something to compare the Blu-Ray to. If it's anything like Pulp Fiction's (again, $4!) Blu-ray, it will be a world of difference. Every pore and imperfection...gorgeous to say the least.<br /><br />I think this is the better of the two Bill movies; the second is really good but this one is just more fun, and I personally think the music is better, which was a big factor for me.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Why is the Kindle version 300% of the normal ad free version? I'm glad I rooted and installed the Google Play store so I can pick between the free version and the $1 ad free version.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Enjoy this series.  As a history major, I believe this Follett series is painlessly educating people about the history of this incredible century and also clearing up a number of misconceptions.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If you grade a novel by how fast you read it, then Michael Connelly's \\"The Black Box\\" gets a double A+ from me. I finished it less than 24 hours after page one, in just two sessions. It is a spectacular read in all aspects.<br /><br />No writer is better at propelling a story than Connelly, and \\"The Black Box\\" is no exception. Once there is take off, the velocity commences at a steady pace...it neither falters, nor careens out-of-control on its journey.<br /><br />Just when you think there is going to be a pause in the action, Connelly drops another nugget of info, evidence, action or theory---and you are reading in a higher gear.<br /><br />I think Connelly is the best at hiding the most meaningful clues in plain sight. The answers are always there, if you are clever or lucky enough to spot them prior to the d&eacute;nouement.<br /><br />There is never a deus ex machina employed. When the puzzle is solved, all the pieces fit neatly together.<br /><br />In \\"The Black Box,\\" Harry Bosch is working on a 20 year old cold case in the Open Unsolved squad.<br /><br />Danish photojournalist, Anneke Jespersen was murdered execution style during the 1992 LA riots. Harry and his partner Jerry Edgar were the detectives called to the scene.<br /><br />With all the homicides committed during the riots, Harry and Jerry were dispatched to another killing after a too short time on the Jespersen murder scene...leaving lots of business unfinished.<br /><br />Fast-forward 20 years to 2012. The LAPD brass bring out the cold cases from the riots, hoping to gain some positive PR on their 20th anniversary. Harry volunteers to take on the Jespersen case.<br /><br />With little physical evidence in the 1992 murder book, Harry uses hunches, Internet searches and old-fashioned police work to form a base.<br /><br />Once the foundation is established, additional pieces are uncovered and the dominos begin to fall.<br /><br />\\"The Black Box\\" moves at an incredible pace. After reading a couple of new books, I will reread \\"The Black Box\\" at a slower pace in order to savor the work of a master and enjoy all the subtleness and nuances of the finest crime novelist extant.oks, I will reread \\"The Black Box\\" at a slower pace in order to savor the work of a master and enjoy all the subtleness and nuances of the finest crime novelist extant.
B00168OIOE|5.0|If you haven't seen Monsters, Inc, you are in for a treat!<br /><br />This is definitely during the 'golden' age of Pixar, high quality, imaginative, beautifully presented films with great stories and loveable characters.<br /><br />A second Monsters, Inc film is coming soon, a Prequel, so you owe it to yourself to see where it started :)  And the box set is beautiful, vibrant, and a solid deal.  :)
B009SSGBOE|5.0|I just heard that Donald Fagan was bringing out a new album and so the immediate availability from Amazon solved that problem.  One thing is consistently true that it is so clearly Donald Fagan, if you already like Don or have liked him since Steely Dan then this is a must.  If you are not sure then you may need to understand the music type the all I can say is that this is something New and Exciting for you to hear.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This film has been out for awhile now, so I won't go into too much already covered detail.<br /><br />This was based on a comic book/graphic novel series, where the characters and story lines were adapted for film.<br /><br />I did not have a chance to see this in theaters, but after renting it, I purchased the film within an hour of watching it.  I absolutely loved this movie.  This is a movie for the 'ADD' generation, the kids who grew up on video games, and those of us who love a storyline that whips around, and only makes sense because the film has it's own 'logic'.<br /><br />The story is good, the characters interesting, and the special effects are excellent.  They even received permission from Nintendo to use some 'Zelda' music, and that matters ... Nintendo is very very careful about rights to their properties.<br /><br />Sadly, it didn't do very well in theaters or on film, but i'm still holding on to a very minor hope that maybe someday a sequel will be made.  If not, this is a great film.<br /><br />Side note: I purchased this from Amazon and received it as expected, but without the cardboard case sleeve.  I called Amazon and was apologized to, and offered either to send it back and receive another, or a credit in lieu of it.  Very pleased with the customer service.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|I didn't know what all the hype was about on this movie, but now I know.  I love it so much.  The seller was very nice & helpful!!!
B003K16P3M|5.0|I am an adult who loves to read Young Adult adventure and fiction/fantasy books, so while I was looking forward to reading Graceling, I was expecting the usual teen angst-ridden story. Not so! Just a fun, at times scary adventure with admirable young characters. I think this novel was very well written (no glaringly obvious grammar mistakes, great flow, etc.), and the story was surprisingly gripping and mature.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The game is better than angry birds and changes things drastically. More fun to bulid things than throw birds at pigs
034580404X|4.0|B ook is written for a lower level like Jr. High.  The sexx scenes were steamy but after a while were just plain boring.

B009AZZEU2|5.0|These guys have waited for 20 years to make this album. Finally, they are able to write unfettered by any record execs pointing out the hits and the duds; as if they would know music from a steaming pile of dog doody! I am very pleased with my purchase which came in great condition. Thanks Amazon!
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Never heard of this movie (don't know why?) I was going to pass but then I saw who was in it. Turned out to be worth the $4.00

1419705849|5.0|My son definitely loves these books and I'm glad.  Unfortunately, even though Greg is getting older in the books, the writing style stays the same.  My 10-year-old son finished this book in just a couple hours, maybe less.  When he was younger it took him much longer.  Oh well.  The content is fun and it gives him something to read.  He has read and reread all the books in the series, and I know he'll read this one over and over too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Nonstop action thriller that I could not set down.  My only wish is that Flynn could turn out one of these every week.  I'd read them all and probably get nothing else done.
B008CP93S0|5.0|Not our typical rom com ... Actually funny I watched it twice and recommended to some friends who thought highly also
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am about 49% thru the novel and can't wait to get back to it. I have always enjoyed Follett's books. Learn so much about History. The touch of romance keeps me interested to see what could happen next. His desriptive writing puts you right @ the scene.
B008JAGG38|4.0|I thought this movie was gonna be lame but i rented it anyways... Ended up to be funny and not to redundant on the American pie them... Plus there were boobs so that's a bonus
B009MCRHH6|5.0|i bought this for the wii a few years ago and became hooked instantly.  basicly you use goo balls two build structures to achieve the goal of the level.  the sound efects and music are spot on and enticing.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a beautiful book, exceptionally well written. The author is a neurosurgeon and doesn't &#34;dumb down&#34; his descriptions of how the brain works, technical details, etc. but explains it in a simple enough way for anyone to understand. I highly recommend this book for anyone, not just those interested in near-death experiences. I found it intriguing and uplifting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app since you can play for a couple minutes or an hour and it continues to work your logical skills.
1451638450|5.0|LMB is my all time favorite author, and I am a huge fan of the Vorkosigan's. Needless to say, I was beyond thrilled when I heard that she had a new book on its way, and it was about IVAN of all people. I love Miles** (the main character of most of the other books in the series) beyond reason, but I've also always had a very soft spot for Ivan. None of his family has been able to figure out that just because he's-not-like-Miles doesn't mean he is less-than-Miles, and I was glad to see him get a story of his own.<br /><br />I managed to avoid all spoilers about this book, and refused to be tempted by the e-ARCs that was available from Baen Books months ago, all because I wanted to be able to read this for the first time in hardcover. I was not disappointed. This was a very satisfying visit to the world of the Vorkosigan's and it had plenty of good cameos from nearly all of my favorite characters.<br /><br />Having said that: I'm not sure I would recommend this is as a point of entry in to the series. I think a new reader would enjoy it, but there are so many references that were made more meaningful to me because I knew the rest of the story. I'm die-hard enough about this series that I really think you should start all the way back at the beginning with [[ASIN:B0073AP20I Cordelia's Honor]] and then work your way forward.<br /><br />And know that I am jealous of you, starting these books fresh, because as much as I love re-reading them, I would dearly love to go back and read them all again \\"for the first time\\" -- they are that good.<br /><br />Yes, I know they are space opera, but that doesn't really matter. They are good stories with amazing characters.<br /><br />**As proof of my adoration: I named my cat Miles....
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|well... its just not good stuff I mean roblox.com is better than minecraft and free and like it but you get tomake a GAME not world and you get ulimited blocks and guns and stuff play roblox instead
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Not at all what we expected, it is a weird spoof. No-one in this movie is &#34;normal&#34;. It is a mystery why there were big names in this movie.
1609611543|5.0|This book will help anyone who reads it. People desperately need this information, and will not get it from their medical doctor. Order it for yourself and anyone you love that is struggling with chronic health issues.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This one was okay. But not as good as book one: the hunger games.I am not sure if I will read book three.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I play it almost every day its really fun when I don't want to read. I dk why people would give it below a three
B001F0WXY0|2.0|Here's how I review. No synopsis, no narrative. Just get to how I was introduced to the book, what I liked and didn't like and maybe some spoilers. Enjoy!<br /><br />I was introduced to Dune after googling \\"best sci-fi books of all time\\".  So when Dune popped up at the top of almost every list I saw I decided that I had to read it.  There were some interesting concepts I loved but ultimately the book didn't really do it for me.<br /><br />::: Things I liked :::<br />-The concept of Arakis (Dune) being a desert world with a unique ecosystem etc.<br />-The idea of blue-eyed Freeman with stillsuits and all their other abilities got me really excited.<br />-How the worms and spice were related was fascinating!<br /><br />::: Things I didn't like :::<br />-This book has extensive politicking in it and does not really provide any background for why the political groups are at each other's throats<br />-I found myself confusing characters and I realized half way through my read that it was because they were forgettable or didn't seem to have real human reactions and emotions.<br />-Prepare yourself for a long wind up. I read through about 40% of the book until the main characters even reached the desert and culture of the Freeman began to be revealed.<br />-Granted this is the 40 year anniversary edition of this book but the dated language and flow really made it a chore to read sometimes.<br />-Overall the plot was a bit vague with visions and mystical characters that never really receive and explanation.  The writer forces you to pick up tidbits and try to piece them together yourself.<br /><br />::: The Verdict :::<br />Ultimately there was nothing that held me to finish this book. I always give a book at least a 50% completion before setting it aside and making a judgement. With Dune I gave it 60% because I really wanted it to be good.  In the end I set it aside and decided to watch the tv/movie adaptations to see if the ending is really worth the trudge through the book.  I really had high hopes for the \\"all time best sci-fi book of all time\\" but found an old drab of a book that could be awesome if the right person came back to revive it.ok.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|I love the word usage in this book. The charters have a true life of their own. This book has every rite to be claimed a classic.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This is a good formula book but does not measure up to the earliest books. Unfortunately, it is &#34;The Lion&#34; revisited.<br />Also, I don't think Corey's continual quips add anything.
B0000714BP|5.0|&#34;You're just a boy in a dress!&#34; &#34;A boy in a dress?&#34; This is a must have movie for any movie collection..If you don't buy it &#34;I'm offically taking away all your princess points&#34;
0061997811|5.0|I am a POTTER FREAK and this is the ideal present for one! It was amazing!!!!! Mine just came in the mail and i have no regrets! I look @ everything already and open up all the secret compartment! Definitely worth it...
B005LAIHR2|5.0|We love this movie and got a great value by purchasing it from Amazon. It arrived on time and in perfect condition as always.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|That book was truly amazing. Amazing photographs, old time photos, old letters, great detail, weirdness, epicness and history all wrapped up in  one. This book is a must get.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game to pass the time.  Addictive and challenging.  Even when you get stuck it holds your attention. Would recommend for all.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|I enjoyed the first three quarters of this novel but found the final quarter a little predictable (more of the same) once it became obvious who the culprit was. Just my opinion, probably still a good read for most readers.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|Most of these email apps are I suppose great for other people but I find that these email venues are better used on you computer and laptops, some device with a larger screen.
0446580848|2.0|I've read most of his books and this would of been the last one...if it had been the first one.  Not up to his standards... If he wanted to write a screed on terrorists, why confuse the issue with a slow moving, unexciting story...
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I actually purchased as a replacement for my mis-placed and or lost cable for my Kindle Fire.  But this is a great product for your device!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I've read lots of Terry Pratchett and love most of his books. This one was great. I recommend it to anyone.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is a GREAT case for your Kindle Fire, I would never be without it, I even use it when laying in bed listening to my audio books, and it is durable and really protects your kindle screen from harm...Great product!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one of those books I could not put down.  It was well written, an interesting tale of betrayal, intrigue and payback.  I recommend it for someone who wants to escape into a good read.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I think I would have used this if it were NOT for the fact that it wants you to sign up to use it, I simply wanted an online Bible to read or more to the fact to be able to have it in audio format (cause my eyes are NOT what they use to be), so for me it was NOT useful...
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I play this all the time.  Wish they would open up new levels.  I can do this mindless thing while waiting for Doctors.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I got this app thinking that I would join facebook but I am really NOT fond of these kinds of venues.  I hear such horror stories that happen to people on them and they put way too much personal information on it, so I do NOT give this app a lot of star for that reason. I realize that it is very popular but I feel it is a dangerous venue! SORRY...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I work at night and have a hard time getting to sleep. Relaxing Melodies is perfect for putting me in a quiet state where sleep is not only possible but almost always a definate case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the app os really easy to use and I play it all the time because the games range from simple to hard. its fun earning points to unlock new games.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like the fact that this chilling and entertaining story is told through the voice of multiple characters rather than just one. The interview format makes it seem like this book is non-fictional which makes the story come to life (pardon the pun) that much more!
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Just not up to the standard we expect of Grisham - verging on boring and predictable.  Grisham can do better
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a fun game!  I would much rather pay for a game then to have to keep paying to get anywhere. But it still a fun way to waste time!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|If I was going to hate on anything about this book it would be the fact it's so short, I almost gave it 4 stars for that. For $4.99 I'd like a bit more meat, I suppose in some ways I'm just being nitpicky, and ultimately I'm glad he released it, so with that in mind I had to go back to a 5 star rating. To review the actual story it's engrossing like most of his books the page demands a turn, and another, and another.. and another.<br /><br />Something akin to Civilization game when it's 3AM and you know you should go to bed, but in 3 turns you'll have uranium, and oh.. OH GHANDI WILL PAY FOR HIS TRANSGRESSIONS AGAINST MY NOBLE EMPIRE<br /><br />But I digress, great book, would be a nice little read for a car trip... if you brought two.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun because it has so many games. however it has some weird ones too. I get frustrated with some of them but overall pretty good and for free totally worth it.
0345803485|1.0|Poorly written porn. Could not finish the book.<br />Would like to see a profile of the people who gave<br />this book a 5 star rating.
B005PK553C|4.0|This show has a great storyline and is very compelling, but be warned that you don't want to watch this with your teen-aged kids, too much S-E-X for family viewing.  However, it is a great series and we are moving on to Season 2!
0525953728|5.0|I liked the no-nonsense approach to the missions, especially \\"THE MISSION\\" depicted in this book.  Give a good appreciation for the planning and professionalism of these guys.  Also shows how the Obama administration politicized the members of the seal team and released information about the mission and personnel that never should have been released.  It was interesting to hear the discussions the Seals had after the mission, such as \\"you realize we just got Obama re-elected\\".  \\"Would you have rather us not got Usama?\\" \\"No, but.....\\"<br />They were soldiers doing what they had to do.  That they were politicized by an administration that has little respect for the military was not a factor when the call to go was finally made.
B000JQUKKU|4.0|This is another work I like to have at my finger tips especially around the holidays. I intend to read this via my kindle again and again.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 3, so far, has been what Season 2 wanted to be. Quick. Fleet. Vicious. It coordinates reflections on humanity, tragedy, primal urgings and zombies to fit within 45 minutes. And it does it well.
0345803507|5.0|Again-Christian Gray is fantastic!<br />Love the set and it shows how true love prevails no matter how messed up you think you are:)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great illustrations,very funny and sticky situations. I like how you drew the viruses with Rowley‘s face and the things that fight it with Greg`s.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'm an older reader, and chose to read The Hunger Games trilogy because I work with adolescents and wanted to see what they are reading.  I actually enjoyed the first book immensely,.  The characters were well constructed, and the relationships explored in some depth.  I was keen to read the second one, mostly because I wanted to follow up on what happened to the main characters and was a little disturbed with the repetition of the same themes.  This third book I found to be simply dark and destructive; it was hard to find a redeeming message or a character to root for.  It's almost as though it was written as a potential movie script or violent video game, with true emotion left behind.  I needed to find something to uplife my spirit once I was done!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I personally think that this app can be soliloquy mitch better. I have the Pc vershion and the xbox vershion and I think this is a brocken toy compared to them. there aren't buckets or npc villages or villagers and there aren't even caves! I know that a hole bunch of people think it is so cool but I rather by a laptop and the Pc vershion insted of playing this game. I did by it but I regret it so mutch right now. there will never ever be a good minecraft game for ipod,ipad,or Kendal. I'm not a hats filled person but notch(the creator of minecraft) messed this app up so badly that he should be ashamed of it. but I love the Pc vershon and Eny one that has it should also download tekkit because it is like you had onegood sandwich then someone gave you one million amazing sandwiches all for free. that what tekkit is comepared to minecraft. the only problem is it is a little confusing at first.<br /><br />that's it, I love minecraft, but not this minecraft<br />couse it's crap
1451695187|3.0|Most people buying the book are likely already convinced of heaven and more interested in reading of the experience.  Thus all the scientific reasoning at great length may fall on deaf ears as were author's before his experience.  I'd like more details of what really goes on there.  Guess I'll have to wait and see.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game like graphics and like having friends to obtain items needed.  need ability to energize up quicker though but otherwise awesome game.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Good movie. It was entertaining, but lacked something. I wouldn't buy it, but I would watch it again. Worth a watch.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Why did I read this? Honestly, after 50 Shades, you would have thought I would've learned my lesson. It's just so miserably written. Big mistake!
B00913P6G0|5.0|This is one for fans of real Hiphop!! This is definitely a cd to keep in heavy rotation, unless u Shyne u definitely gonna be feelin this one!!
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|I was going to buy this for a grandson for Christmas. He loves Legos.<br /><br />Of course, I don't know if he would love THIS Legos, though, since many according to the reviews have not.<br /><br />With six grandkids, $60 is w-a-y too much for HOPING that he would like it. Actually, it's way too much, period.<br /><br />Yes, I believe in capitalism and free enterprise. Even so, a 75% increase in price, apparently just because it's Christmas and sentiments run deep now, changes buying it, to being fined because we bought it.<br /><br />We've all heard the adage \\"What the market will bear\\" -- I guess they'll see how much it WILL bear.<br /><br />Capitalism is about making a profit, yes. Capitalism and free enterprise are also about the customer's right to refuse.  I, for one, am refusing 'to be fined' because it's Christmas.
0547884591|5.0|Get this book. It will flip your world upside down. Like T4HWW on steroids. After reading 4HWW I moved full-time to Shanghai, started my own business and am working literally 4 hour a week. Less than a 1/4 through this book and I decided to learn Italian before my trip to Italy (leaving in 3 weeks). Before reading this, would never consider attempting such an insane task. Now... I'm learning Italian, world-class cooking, and guitar ALL AT THE SAME TIME with amazing results!!! Thanks Tim. You really have changed my life!
0307719774|4.0|I love this Journal and the questions that are in it. Some of the questions are very broad and can be answered simply and don't take much time to think about. Others are more deep and really get you thinking. I wish the cover was higher quality, but it still seems sturdy enough to last for a while.<br /><br />But overall I am pleased with it, and and it's not bad, especially for it's price!
B005LAIGLE|2.0|boring, predictable movie. I do not even remember what it is about, and I saw it within the past couple of months. Can't they even try for some originality?
B004HXIZVC|3.0|I downloaded this app in hopes of uploading some of my music and listening to other's music . Yes, the app is great for what it's supposed to do, but shortly after, I encountered a problem. I have the Kindle Fire HD, and I noticed that after downloading Soundcloud my sound no longer worked on my Kindle. I shut it down, cut it back on, pressed the reset button down for 20 seconds. Still no sound. Eventually, Kindle support suggested I restore the kindle back to default. On the bright side, I got the sound back, however, by restoring it I lost all my apps, music, pictures, documents, everything! I don't know if it's just a coincidence, but I wouldn't chance it.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|it started out interesting until about the middle.There are way better romance movies out there like the 'Notebook\\",\\"Somewhere in Time,\\" \\"Against all odds\\",or \\"What dreams may come.\\"
B00594XOZU|2.0|Basically, I downloaded the app because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Personally, I don't like it, and I don't see the purpose of it.  It's a texting app. If I wanted to text someone, I don't see why I couldn't just do it from my cell phone, instead of downloading an app for it. Unless you're using this app on wifi if your phone is disconnected (which mine never is), I wouldn't recommend it. However, I'm not much of a texter, so for people who love to text, this app may be great for you!
0307888681|5.0|Max Brooks is a great writer. Great writer + zombies = great book to read. If only the people on the walking dead had his books...

B005FISBTO|5.0|Love this series! I don't get the cable channel it is shown on so I get the dvd's at the end of the season and watch it all in a few sittings.  :)
B00005JG6Q|5.0|I have an old VHS tape of this movie and watch it every now and then.  I ordered this DVD and it was the greatest upgrade.  DVD came fully packed with all inserts (as new).  Prompt delivery.  Fair price.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I don't have the cable channel this is originially shown on but our daughter said it's great so I ordered it. Great series.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Not Follets best.  The many characters played off each other like &#34;6 degrees of Kevin Bacon&#34; .  Usually, I can learn some history nuggets from the backstory but this one contained no new info or tremendous historical insight.  Love his other novels, but this one was a chore to maintain my interest.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|saw this first from the library, then bought it here so we could have a copy as a reference, and to show our kids as part of homeschooling...so they will be aware of what is out there...great dvd
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Me and my family watch this movie a dozen times every Christmas. It is just as hysterical as the first time we saw it...Love the movie.

1451695195|5.0|This is a seminal book in the field of near death experiences. Unlike anything else in this genre. It will really challenge your beliefs about this life and the next.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Love this app. Great with news and Facebook.  So much faster... glad I found this app or did it find me?
B000002H38|5.0|Great artist in studio...not so good on stage.  Comes late...talks too much and the volume at concert will make your ears bleed.  So you buy this CD and enjoy this great voice.  I would rather have Anita's CD than a concert ticket.  Enjoy!,
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to manipulate this calculator. Able to do several functions and it keeps track of the previous functions in order to see any errors. Great.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I'm still reading it, but enjoying it very much.  The juxtaposition of an organization of antiquity and the futuristic resources of Google give it fun playing field.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The greatest book ever written; what can you say that wouldn't measure up.  I use this app to double check an verse or wording of other scriptures I come across.  App has yet to freeze up or act quirky.  Wonderful app and I am glad it's here and updates are consistent.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Not a bad song amoung the bunch.  Great sounds.  Pink at her best!  Thank you, Amazon for the great price.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was hooked on this book from the very first page.  It's the first of the Jack Reacher books that I was meaning to start reading, so good to start from the beginning. Will definitely read the others in the series.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I used to help my friend shoot short films in high school a couple years ago.  We had a pretty prime setup; we used his Canon T2i and his Zoom H4n.  I wasn't really up for doing the audio at parts when we were short on people for the crew, but damn these things works.<br />I've had a Canon T2i since about two years ago(love it like a child) and I just bought my own Zoom H4n a couple of days ago and I COULD NOT be happier with the results.  (side note: I don't know why they charge this one for like $230 and others for 260 some dollars when this one comes with the case, the wind screen and the 2gb sd card) Anyways, this machine is amazing!<br />Yesterday I plugged in some standard iPod headphones just to test it out around the dorm, omg...  I'll sit on one side of the room and tell one of my hot, sexy lady friends to go in the other corner and just whisper as soft as they can.  I'll close my eyes and repeat back exactly what they said. Kinda freaked 'em out a little bit, and they thought I might turn into a rapist/pedophile hahaha.<br />In conclusion: I've never had a problem using this SUPER AWESOME Device(with both my friends or mine).  Sound is crystal clear with a soft/smooth background noise that doesn't cause any disturbance.  Picks up the smallest noises(great for foley artists).  But you might be thinking \\"HEY! I don't want all of those background noises in my videos!!\\" Silly boy/girl/alien child, The background noises are what makes a film more realistic.  Don't you dare tell me that you've gone and watched a movie where all you heard were just their voices and no other sounds.  This thing is pretty damn cheap.  I mean, of course, there are cheaper options out there that don't cost this much. But if you are ready to step up to the next level, dare I call it the Professional Level, then this is definitely the device for you( Can't go wrong with some XLR inputs[am i right?])<br /><br />Some things I would buy along with this ZOOM H4n<br />- Dead Kitten Windmuff(good for outdoor shooting.  The windscreen they provide is \\"alright\\" but really doesn't do much against strong winds[unless, of course, you want the wind])<br />-External mic/boom with XLR connector(I would recommend a shotgun mic)<br />-don't really need to buy this, but do some research on youtube or where ever just to learn the functions, because this sound recorder has a lot of potential, and people tend to skip over a lot of the features that it provides.<br /><br />Hope this review helped at least one person, Happy Shopping!
1419703692|5.0|Just regret to buy it too late.  A must have for &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; trilogy and Christopher Nolan's FAN.  As a Hongkonger, also felt regret I didn't visit the TDK team while they were filming in Hong Kong. :-(
B00542USJW|4.0|Good puchase - cute movie<br /><br />I dont mind giving reviews on items i purchased and would purchase again- but this requires so many words there is not much to say- I like it- glad i bought it- the reciepient liked it- it was just as described

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The movie is filled with &#34;one-liners&#34; that will have even the adults rolling in the aisles!  I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B009X01GJ2|2.0|I had a Marware leather case for my first generation Kindle Fire and loved it. When I received my new Fire HD, I was excited to see that Marware had a new leather case for it and I promptly ordered it. Unfortunately, I am disappointed with it and it's going back. It's a beautiful case and I love that it has a strap on the cover for reading - but here's the problem: It's clunky to try to hold and the hard plastic flap that the device is attached to swings open.  There needs to be a snap or velcro so this doesn't happen. If you are used to reading with the Fire hand-held, this is not the product for you.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|i dont have it yet but looks fun because is littlest pet shop but it sad that in the game you needed money so why do i dont want it is cause my parents are going to spend MONEY for a game so no
B0043EV774|3.0|This telling of Alice in Wonderland uses all the modern techniques and technology but it puts a few twists into the familiar story.  The effects are quite good and almost hallucinogenic, but the variations of the original story don't seem to be necessary, although I suppose they help to give us a new slant on things. I'd like to have seen more of some of the key creatures, such as the Cheshire cat, the caterpillar, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, etc. Maybe Disney's animated version just overpowers anything after having been in the brain for a few decades.<br />The 3-D works well, having sent my wife ducking once or twice. The effect isn't overly done; when things do come at you it doesn't seem like it's done just to show off how well the 3-D works, but instead it just seems like part of the story.<br />I don't want you to get the idea that this is a poor version. It's a quality piece of work, but for me, I'm just as glad that I got it on 3-D BluRay rather than paid for the theatrical release. At least this way I can recoup my investment by watching it every few years after I've forgotten the details.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Love the popular tracks but where is the song, \\"A Place of My Own,\\" that was performed at the iHeart Radio concert last year? This to me would be a 5 star album with this song included. We need an album with bonus tracks to include this excellent song! I personally loved The Element of Freedom as I wouldn't skip a track. That got my 5 star rating. Every song flowed on that album.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Improvement from the initial load on the Thrive. Excellent edit function for marking, deleting, moving, etc.  Reading line before opening.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|Love the new fire! I like the HDMI connection, I like the better speakers. I don not like how they do not warn you that it does not come with a charger.
0793542049|4.0|A very good tutorial on walking bass lines, it is set out well  with many good examples and also some very good concepts teaching how to set about constructing your own lines. The Cd is easy to follow and I found the examples extremely helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone  providing they have a good understanding of the notes,  basics of bass playing and some knowledge of music theory.
B0014D6PCO|3.0|A great movie. A great way to begin the trilogy. I perfer this movie ove the dark knight rises. However it wasn't perfect.
0634089358|5.0|This book certainly provides the information it claims to, easy to follow with clear examples on the Cd. I think this book is a must for the beginning bass player providing they know the basics but would also be very useful for the intermediate bass player as well. The examples of the songs are very well done. What more can I say - I love it!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|After reading this book in high school, I feel in love with this book. It's a great read and worth the money. It's not too long but it's sure to grab your attention and get your mind going. If you want a good book, try this. I bought the kindle version and after immediate download, I was ready to go.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I have always loved the Firefly series and Serenity movie. The fact that I could get it delivered to my Kindle Fire was awesome! Now I can watch my favorites when I'm traveling. Joss Whedon is an amazing storyteller. The characters are an eclectic familial blend of sweetness and craziness! If you have never watched Firefly...what are you waiting for!
B008KOMMTA|5.0|I love this set! I have loved the Titanic since it came out when I was young so I was thrilled that it was finally on Blu Ray. The set is a nice piece for a collector of Titanic things. The box is well made and good for a display. If you love the Titanic, this is for you.
B007L6VR12|4.0|Once again, Wes Anderson treats his audience to beautiful storytelling around characters who will make you laugh while they break your heart.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Hands down a 100% GREAT movie!  I LOVED it!!<br /><br />This movie would make a great Christmas gift for any age by the way!  This movie really took me by surprise as you can tell, but really it is one worth having!<br /><br />I actually wasn't too interested in another animated movie, but for the kids I will make a sacrifice.  I am so glad I did.  The movie reminded me of a Nancy Drew for boys.  I guess that would mean Hardy Boys right?  But I wouldn't know since I have never read a Hardy Boys book.  There is a lot of mystery, action and suspense which will keep you on the edge of your seat and at attention the entire time.  And although I say it is a Nancy Drew for boys, this movie would appeal to any age boy or girl.  I was just really impressed with the story line, and the awesome degree of animation that makes the characters and scenery come alive as if it were real!<br /><br />Give it a try.  What do you have to lose? If you don't like it turn it off, but you will be in for a treat if you happen to stick around and watch it to the end.<br /><br />This movie does have the bad guys trying to get what they want, and the young boy making daring leaps at the top of buildings.  Things that wouldn't ever happen in real life, but it is all done in a way that still makes this a wonderful family movie for years to come.  You just don't get good clean movies like this to come along very often.<br /><br />Highly recommended for families with children of any age.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is easy and fun to play. I spend entirely too much time playing Solitaire instead of cleaning the house!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a Christmas gift so we have not opened it or played it yet but I am<br />sure my girls are going to love it!!!
1609611543|5.0|This is a must read for anyone looking to improve their diet and how they feel. Wheat is not the &#34;health&#34; food we have been taught to believe it is.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I'm not much of a reader and 70% of the books I do buy, are put down and forgotten after a third to half way through. However, like \\"The Four Hour Body\\", I can not put this book down. All I do in my spare time (after work, waiting for something, lunch, etc..) is read this book. I polished off FHB in about three days, all 500+ pages (luckily I had a 6 hour flight to enjoy it). Like the FHB, this book will be finished off in no time, ...unfortunately.<br /><br />In the FHB and The Four Hour Chef, Tim recommends not reading it like a conventional book from start to finish. But I just don't want to miss anything and find every detail so interesting, that cover to cover is the only way for me to read it.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|App trys to load and but won't.  I can't get the app to play! Not statisfied at all with this app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|super fun game but not overly time consuming. overall a great once a day game. I've had lots of fun checking it before I go to work.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, a saga like twilight yet completely different!  Can't wait for the other books and movies
1439102430|5.0|People disappointed with this book seem to be looking for a Shakespearean novel. Reichs writes thrillers! Mysteries! And the adventures in this book are thrilling. The mysteries keep you engrossed until she wraps it up at the end. I'm looking for a good mystery, a good read--and Reichs has done it again. The primary mystery was a totally new kind and I like that. Hard to find nowadays. I saw where a reviewer reported there was no character development in the story--but that's not true. Several people in the story change as a result of what happens in the story, and also in their relationships with Tempe. She also is growing--maturing comfortably, and growing as a mother. But all of that is icing--the cake here is the good story. Yes, some things repeat--but you cannot deny that they still have impact because Reich is an excellent creator of excitement in her reader, even dread--and that is what keeps you turning pages.<br /><br />I, like several other reviewers, enjoyed the educational tidbits Reichs always works into her stories. I very much enjoyed learning about native tribes, about Canada in general, about diamond mining, and more, all the while engrossed in the mystery--the mystery! That's what Reichs has again done so very well. If you like an exciting and unusual mystery, this one is top-notch. So sorry some people didn't like it--it all depends on what you're looking for. I liked it--a lot.<br /><br />Thank you Kathy Reichs. (Ariel I.)
0547884591|4.0|Not mind blowing but definitely a good staple.  I imagine this would be an excellent reference for those with no background in cooking and information gathering
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is my most favorite game ever!  I play it every day. The graphics are great!  Happy playing every ponie!!!  :)
1419705849|5.0|this is what we wanted and why we depend on Amazon for our purchases.  book was exactly what we wanted for our youngest son for Christmas and we are happy to have this for him as one of his presents under the tree this year!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|there are a millon of reviews on this knife and i would have to say that they were right one very awesome knife.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this was a fantastic read and a book that was hard to put down  who knew i could be drawn into the 1960's and intoa time travel story?  good stuff!
B009FXIICK|5.0|This is a great game and I'm so excited to see its available on my Kindle Fire. It runs great and it's loads of fun. What a great FAOTD! Thank you, Kiteretsu and Amazon!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is one of my favorite games and this version is fun to play and gives great options. I like the fact that it has dragons.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|When I left the theater it was with wonder - &#34;Could the real reason for the Civil War be as different from what we know, as the politics of today&#34;  I am not saying that I believe or don't believe in Vampires.  It does seem odd tho that countries in Europe do believe in them.  The movie has a lot of gore, and a LOT of suspense.  You are literally on the edge of your seat.  Honest Abe is true to what we all have been taught about him.  He was a good President and a good man.  This movie brings all that and more home. Had to have a copy for my own library, because it does make you THINK.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is fun, but I don't like the fact that when there are no more moves it doesn't tell you it just keeps saying you can move the same cards over and over.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest app is a great way to keep track of boards recipes and other favorite things on the go. I shop my family's boards for gift giving!!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It comes in handy and it helps. I have this on all my computers and it seems to help  with downloading certain things.
0307277887|5.0|The book is better than TV series! Excellent to Dexter's fans! Can't wait to buy the second and the third, and... and...lol
B000Q7ZO8U|3.0|I just bought this on Blu-ray and watched it with my 3-year-old son. He liked it, but the action scenes were a little too intense for him at times. The animation isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done. I like the story, even if it is a little cliche.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Great and flexible in the way you set up what you like most by subject (science, arts etc) or by location (US Britain, etc)
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another classic from Vince Flynn ... Mitch Rapp at his irascible best or worst.  Rapp is a bit too verbal and jaded for me, although of course he does back up his words with actions ... His verbal threats just seem to be too prevalent for a real man of action.  It just seems a bit out of character ... Other than that, the conflicts build, the reactions are awesome and Rapp's crew never leaves a base uncovered.  The Last Man's constant excitement only stops delivering its thrills when the last thought in the book is expressed.  I loved it.  A less verbal Mitch would have easily earned five stars from this fan.  Can't wait for the next episode ...
B00973902K|5.0|They played it over & over so I didn't download, but always heard the chorus and never the verses! Now its the new repeat song on the MP3 player!  I wonder if she'll have another hit!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|HEY ALL MY LITTLE PONYS AND BRONYS. ( BRONYS ARE BOYS WHO LOVE MY LITTLE PONES 2)OUT THERE THIS GAME IS A DREAM COME TRUE I JUST LOVE THIS GAME
0385737955|5.0|This is a suberb first book by James Dashner in the Maze Runner Trilogy; keeps you guessing at every turn and hard to put down.  If you liked The Hunger Games, this one might be up your alley.  Book arrived punctually and in great condition.  Overall, a very entertaining read!
B009FXIICK|3.0|Just another match three game.  Saying the graphics are retro is shorthand for poor.  Would anyone with a smart phone want to go &quot;retro&quot;, and change it for the bricks of long ago?  I did not think so.  This is okay for what it is, but there are many better match three games.  Skip it!
B009R9WAZ8|2.0|I'm a big Rihanna fan, but this cd has disappointed me. I'm not sure if she rushed through it just to get it released or what, but I think her last album, Talk That Talk is ten times better.  The only songs I like(my personal taste and opinion) is Diamonds, Phresh Out the Runway, What Now and Lost in Paradise.  I give it 2 out of 5 stars.
B00852ZXLQ|5.0|It's as if I read it in high school.  Love Scout.  Would recommend book for all to read.<br />Too bad there wasn't more on Boo.  What did her do with all his time in the house, away from the world.<br />It's sad too that he only went outside at night.
B007712XAU|4.0|I have disc 2 of season 2 break.  After i watched it...thank goodness.  However I am not the only one I know with a broken disc 2.  Anyone else had this happen??  I think it is a manufacture defect andd they should replace it.  I do not think it is just a coincidence.
0425263908|1.0|I have never written a review before but I felt like I needed to. I couldn't even finish this book. About halfway through it just made me want to fall asleep. I wouldn't be as bummed if the book was cheaper. But the price of this book is not worth the money. My advice is to stay away!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Beautiful to see interface, however, it is not AccuWeather in my location of Mt. Pleasant, Ut. I would rate it 5 stars otherwise.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Love this one but all the ads keep opening without me selecting them which is so unbelievably annoying I am unistalling this game due to the ads alone.
1451696205|4.0|Enjoyable read.  Thought it would be better than it was. The flow of the book sometimes would lose my attention.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Have you had the experience of starting a book and being unable to put it down?  This was just the opposite.  I started reading it, put it down after an hour or so, and have been unable to pick it  up since.  This is not an indictment of the book.  In fact I suspect it is well researched and written as are the other DeMille's books I've read.  The issue is that I read books like this for entertainment, relaxation and escape from the unpleasant realities of the evening news.  This book provides no such respite.  Mr. DeMille's fiction is just too close to reality and reality is anything but entertaining.  If we ever find ourselves free of extremists, terrorists, sectarian violence, and criminal behaviors passing as some sort of holy war, I might pick it up again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have downloaded several games from this company... delighted that all have worked well.  Good products. You won't regret trusting the downloa.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The second book wasn't as entertaining as this one. And will you make more books like this one<br /><br />P.S. if you respond send it to devonnash@Yahoo.com
0316227706|5.0|This book is sooo much fun to look at. It really makes people smile and is a wonderful gift, especially for dog lovers!
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Purchased this set for our grandson.  He loves Legos.  He has gotten to where the more complicated they are the more he likes them.  Delivered before the estimated date and in great condition.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Has been great for me. Has more features than I have even learned to use, and allows me on the fly editing. I'm a fan!
B0012GMXYM|5.0|Borboletta is by far my favorite Santana release.  I can't give this less that 5 stars...  However, Amazon gets 1 stinkin' star.  When I saw the 2008 date on this posting I assumed that Sony had finally gotten around to a remaster, after all, Welcome was remastered in 2003.  NOT.  This is the same ol' AAD release that I already had that's been around since forever.  Not the first time I've been burned by Amazon on CDs.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Good movie for the whole family. Has a good overall message. My kids liked it and I appreciated grand santas humor
0425263916|5.0|I love Sylvia Day and all of her books.  I just wish I didn't have to wait for the next book in the series so long......
0425263908|1.0|First of all, no woman on the planet would have anything to do with a man that says I want to have sex with you in the crudest manner, after he says hi.  Next, why would an ivy league educated gazillionaire even talk like that! I cannot stand Eva and the language is offensive. I was deceived by the reviews and returned this book to Audible by chapter 8.  What a waste of credits!  Thank goodness, Audible will allow you to return books you don't like.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE SOA.  All of the seasons are good and I recommend you buy them all!!!!!  It just keeps getting better.
B005LAIHHC|5.0|By now most people are familiar with SBC's work.  As someone who gets the overarching joke I loved this movie, although like most of his films there are parts that drag and parts that are excruciatingly unfunny.  That being said, it feels about half an hour too short.  I notice that most people aren't mentioning the music, which is consistently awesome, as well as the magnificent cameos by Fred Armisen and Jon Glaser.  The helicopter scene is worth the price of admission alone, so if you're on the fence I would recommend at least renting it.
B008L5FFP6|4.0|This CD has a lot of great songs on it!  It was a great price too.  I would recommend this CD to my friends.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A movie that can be watched for all my family, dad, mom, 10 year old girl, and 6 years old boy. Action, known characters and fun facts.
B0073CCYAM|5.0|I received it before the estimated date and with some extra gifts from the owner!<br />I had a great experience and I recommend it for sure, thanks!
B007V65R54|5.0|I loved this book. Mr. Silver writes clearly and informatively about how decisions get made and why some things get more accurate and some don't. Since we all rely on someone's predictions frequently this is very useful information. Since many of us have to make our own predictions in some areas it can  be critical.<br /><br />Silver's book covers political predictions, poker, weather, stock markets and finance, mortgage backed bonds and baseball. I'm sure I've forgotten something but you get the drift. The book makes some demands on logic, but not many, and doesn't require much math. It doesn't provide solutions for every prediction and got a few complaints for that but it goes clearly and directly into why some areas can not be predicted accurately. And why some areas may never be predictable.<br /><br />All useful,  all easy to understand and fun to read.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I bought this DVD for someone who loves Big Bang Theory. The quality of the box set is great and the extra features are very entertaining. It is great for someone interested in the show or looking to enjoy it for the first time. I'd highly recommend it.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Look the first thing you need to realize is it has BG on it and is black/grey and orange. All of the BG stuff has the same color scheme so people will know. And yes I am a bit embarrassed by all the BG stuff I have. Matching consumer main stream stuff does not go over well with my hiking/camping crowd.<br /><br />That being said I will tell you why I still carry this. Yes, I have a camelbak in my pack and it works great...unless you need to share or boil water or purify water. Well you see my point. This is an old school product redone by BG.<br /><br />This is a remake of the standard military canteen with cup. They nestle together and sit in the same belt carrier. I have carried an original one for years but it is kinda ugly and heavy. This new one has new materials and looks nice.<br /><br />It gives you a standard canteen that you can add your choice of purifying tablet or use the cup to boil water , make coffee/tea/eat soup etc.  Not a huge stride forward but it does a great job for what it does and in a versatile addition to your hydration gear.
B0086700CM|4.0|Not something I'd play for 30 minutes at a time, but it's a fun game to kill a few minutes of waiting time.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|If you get all of the BG gear from Gerber you will get several of the same things. Each product has basic survival info on water resistant paper, and a fire starter is also common. This is no exception. I say to this great I will take it.<br /><br />I have many,many,many,many,many, multitools. This is not the best and definitely not the worst. It is well thought out and as with all things is a compromise. Sturdy, nice feel, good choice of tools and good locks.<br /><br />What adds to this is the case and additional tools. Adding a rubbery case with storage for your two most common tools is a very smart decision. Though the flashlight is a bit under-powered and I still carry two others, just having it on my belt it great. Add to this the fire starter which I will never use is a very thoughtful touch that will come in its own if I am ever separated from the group.<br /><br />For this reason alone I would recommend everyone in a group of hikers or campers have one of these on their belt. Having three essential tools with you no matter where you go is a perfect first step to being safer in the outdoors.
B009YU62H2|5.0|I only bought this album because it was $3.99 otherwise I would have not bought it.  That would have been my mistake.  I am a fan of Soundgarden since Badmotorfinger, and their tunes that came after that that were radio friendly did not fit in my taste.<br /><br />This album imo, is a mixture of both and done very well.<br /><br />Will get many repeat listens, highly reccomended it.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I would like to say if I liked or disliked it but my kindle wont download it. just says try again. After 4 days of trying . I quit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Still reading this book-60% completed and just can't put it down. I'm sure the ending will be a shocker-can't wait to see how this turns out./
B000FA5SMK|5.0|If you've read and enjoyed any of Nelson DeMille's books before, you'll love Plum Island!  John Corey is an irascible character with a great sense of humor.  Don't hesitate to invest in this book. It's worth it!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I thought this app was amazing. I liked that you could download your favorite music and videos. This app is great for anyone who wants to download and save these things for free.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Great read so far - not finding the kindle encourages me to keep reading as I don't need to get to the end of the chapter.
B002N4DZ26|5.0|Best Queen of the Night, with crystal clear tonal control.<br />Bought the CD set just for this passage.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.<br />Check it out on youtube before you buy.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|When I need to relax after a hard day at work or after a busy weekend schedule, I just reload Preator. The bad guy gets his, the good guy wins and the earth is saved! what more needs to be said....After all it's Arnold!
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is a great story that never gets old. I recommend Star Wars Trilogy to anyone.I had to replace my old dvds because they got scratched up.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock did more with the windows in this film than Bill Gates has done yet!  This is a timeless film, and the copy purchased from Amazon proves that Amazon knows what movies will last beyond my lifetime!
B009FXIICK|3.0|This app is no different than dozens of other ones just like it.  I played for a bit ant then uninstalled because.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|great game. moves smoothly. can't put it down.  characters remind me of Harry potter is<br />there another game like this or better than this? when does the sequel come out. worth every bit of the price.<br />l
B008AX1HD8|1.0|Might be a good book but the reader is soooo boring. Could not follow story line because of that .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The project is amazingly done, great acting, historical accuracy, beautiful set and lovely cinematography.  The story is deeply compelling and keeps me wanting more!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|When my son showed up with this model flashlight, I knew my search to find the right gift for my husband was over.  He likes them in general, but there was no mistaking how his eyes lit up at the unbelievable distance it reached and with such clarity..  Any outdoor person will surely get excited over this versatile tool.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Put it on my Kindle for those down times and I can't wait to get out of there it calms me.
0307891372|5.0|no damage, and came very quickly. very use full book. beat the game quickly and had alot of fun with it. no issues no problems recomend to anyone.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Fantastic service and item .Good all around and exactly as described. Delivered quickly and will no doubt order from them again.
B001TH16DI|5.0|What can I say, a great deal on 5 great movies and 1 ok one. These are the original cast Shatner and Nemoy, not the new but awesome crew
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Fantastic service and item .Good all around and exactly as described. Delivered quickly and will no doubt order from them again.
B007EE564U|4.0|This is the latest in the continuing story of Mitch Rapp America's sanctioned assassin. For those who have enjoyed the earlier episodes in Mitch Rapps life this is more of the same with many of the characters from earlier books returning. These books are always a good read and are hard to put down.
B0048KXRR6|4.0|This is a great family show.  I like Nanny McPhee (the first one) better, but this is still a wonderful and fun show.
B009FXIICK|5.0|If you're into puzzle games, like Bejeweled, this is a MUST HAVE!<br /><br />If puzzle games aren't your thing this game will help pass the time.<br /><br />The retro music and sound effects are just icing on the cake!
B005XLN97M|5.0|This was a present for my niece for her birthday.  She loved it!<br />When I ordered this item, I sent it to the wrong address initially.  I called Amazon and they were very accommodating.  I returned the item and reordered it with the correct address.  It arrived extremely fast and in perfect condition.  My niece loved it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn continues to put out great novels.  I get so entranced in the novel I can not put it down.  I can't wait to see how the movie comes out.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|A sleeper at the box office, but it took off in its rental & DVD phase--& has maintained that popularity. It even grew substantially in critical stature. In one poll, critics rated it the best US movie ever. A beautiful story.
B0010HA68I|5.0|Excellent product. The plastic clasp is a bit fidgety, that is, until you figure it out. I use these on my Thinktank shoulder harness v2.0. Slid the clasps under the sewn straps of the harness. The connectors have stayed secure so far. Great for hiking expeditions.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers is maybe the best hero movie! The super heros were seamlessly woven into the story so they each could shine. The humor was perfect! Love the movie!
1400067820|5.0|Yes, another 5 star review.<br /><br />Those who have read my reviews know that I write to appeal to people considering whether or not to spend the money and more importantly, the time, to read a book. I won't give a synopsis or blow by blow account. Nor will I pick at tiny, silly details. The question is, \\"worth your time?\\"  answer: YES.<br /><br />I love to read a book that actually causes my brain to unleash ideas of my own. This is what great art does. It stimulates your own thinking. My mind buzzed as I read page after page of Antifragile<br /><br />That said, I ignore many of the 5 star reviews---blah I loved it blah blah blah. Did it change your thinking? Will you be thinking about the core concept, that adding stress to a system actually does make that system stronger? Will you allow that thesis to develop in a mature way in your intellectual kit or discard it before having a chance to develop into a fine part of your thinking? That's my favorite part of a great book! That I can let the ideas become part of my own thinking.<br /><br />There is criticism that the author points out problems but gives no solutions. Please! This isn't a blowhard book from Tom Friedman. Your brain is flat. When someone can introduce a new angle of view, use your own brain to develop solutions. We don't want to do our own thinking these days however tragic that is.<br /><br />This is not Taleb's best book. It's his current book. He's not writing a Harry Potter series.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I think she is a talented writer.  The underlying story is good.  But, I must say I have read a lot of the same thing, from years ago.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its awsome......but add minecarts and more mobs.... and let you go to the nether. (ps for the guy who said add more lava... on the seed thing type nyan.)
B00867GJYK|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie ever since it came out, so I was very excited to see that it was being re-released! In watching the Blu-ray, the wizards at Disney have done an amazing job at capturing the magic of this film is vivid detail. I was so impressed with the quality of the overall film and the sound quality and vivid imagery was pristine. I cannot say enough great things about this movie and how well it was done! If you are already a fan of this movie, or if you missed it when it originally came out, \\"just keep swimming\\" along to your nearest store and pick this up, you will definitely not be disappointed.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|My first album from Adele, stimulated by her wonderful theme song for Skyfall, the latest Bond movie.  Not overwhelmed by the album, but I don't regret the purchase.

B000QI2ZWW|3.0|Couldn't stay awake and quickly realized it's not suitable for small children.  Not sure why it was so highly praised.
1423113497|5.0|This is a great box set.  I brought it as a gift for my niece and I too enjoyed the stories.  Great price and if you have adventerous  pre-teens this makes a great gift.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|An easy, yet descriptive fictional narrative of life after the war to defeat the zombie apocalypse.  Recommended to fans of fantasy, horror, or zombie fiction.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I absolutely love Maroon 5 and this cd did not let me down!! HInt: This is an excellent Christmas gift.
B007N8RULO|5.0|It is spider solitaire and plays like it should. I like the fact that it is simple and they haven't tried to change it from it's original form.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The premise of the story is kinda lame. Aliens hiding on earth from other aliens. Pretty good action though. All in all not a bad way to kill some time watching.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to Pinterest! this app gives me access to all of my favorite things. I love that I can login to my account and save and repin. I can share with other apps (facebook, evernote, etc) It has categories to search.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Everytime I open up a picture attachment it is automatically save to my device. I probably have a million up wanted pictures saved to my device . i don't want that!!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I use this to keep track of and follow all of my favorite blogs...It alerts you to unread posts. You can save favorite posts. share from this app to other apps.
B004UID2LC|1.0|DON'T GET IT. THIS APP HAS A VIRUS!! I downloaded this app for my kindle fire hd and did a virus scan and lo and behold this app had a virus. That's one of the thing I hate about android. You can actually download an app with a  virus on it to ruin your device...smh!!
B0082A3HTQ|3.0|I loved the music in the movie. So I bought to enjoy it again. There is some classic music here which I truly enjoy to have it on CD. Good blend!
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is addictive, I have it on my main device and I never get any work or reading done. I had to actually erase it for a while-to get stuff done- then download it to my device again.<br /><br />I really don't know how they can improve it.. maybe give you more buying options after collectiong the coins, or even make it a trwo player game where you can race your friend side-by-side(on a separate devices of course). Maybe even create a finish line. It has an illusion that you are actually going somewhere, but you never do! LOL
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Helpful book. Gives many examples of real life couples learning to speak each other's love language. Also explains how Dr. Chapman came to discover the basic most 5 love languages.
B001N4TIHI|5.0|Loved the part she played. Was very glad that she didnt just take back her cheating husband. Really just a great movie.
B008BQL77K|5.0|This series is perfection. It's funny, sharp, serious, and tense. It's everything in one. The chemistry amongst the central characters is incredible, be it Mike and Harvey, Mike and Rachel, or Harvey and Donna. You name it, it's crackling. The witty banter in serious moments is what really makes this unique. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it can showcase hardcore drama with the best of them. All the characters have their demons, but they also are loveable. This is a show not to be missed. It's easy to overlook with so many options, but at this point, it's better than anything on the major networks.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Denzel Washington and a post-apocalyptic story--just my cup of tea.  The story is good and he shows the right temperament to pull it off.  Other reviewers act as if the mention of the Bible is a turn-off, but of course that is one of the  only books  in the world, now or in the future that could have any importance to a post-apocalyptic audience that still has any wonderment left in their being.  The looks of the landscape, the continued violence of the population, and the desperation of all, make the movie exciting.  The theme just gives it a depth to make it memorable.  I'll watch it again.

B000001F6T|3.0|Most ten years after fans want blues rockin and hard rock, but this one is a experimenatal work that has jazzy influences. That's not a bad thing but unless you like that type o feffort from a rock band then you may not like this one. It does have great musicianship though and even a drum track that is just the drummer playing. But just a few months later this band would explode into a proper monster heavy rock outfit with the release of 'sssh'. That one will appeal to rock fans more than this one. Howver this is a good effort and different , it needs a patient listen because like I said most fans of this band only like hard rock. I like all kinds of music so I like it , it's a four star expiremental rock cd and  three star rock cd. SO it's somewhere inbetween. ALL the five star raters are right though because they love the different nature of this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Yes it has ads, that's how they can offer it free.  Play it daily. No problems whatsoever. Love it! Highly suggest.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|love this app! I can go from Shazam, tag the song, then from same app go into amazon MP3 & buy song right then & there! songs are usually .99 but i have seen a few on sale cheaper, & albums are even better priced!! soooooooo much better then iTunes!
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this series and this was easy to order and very fast to ship. Cant wait for next one
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It has room for improvement but it contains most of the features I wanted initially.<br /><br />I most like that I can can do speech to text for a list, save it, share it, and access it from my computer or mobile devices.<br /><br />After using the program some, I have imagined other ways it could aid in performing tasks and hopefully these changes will be implemented.
B0043EV774|5.0|Loved this movie.  I totally enjoyed the plot and the actors.  Fully of action. Kept my attention through the enitre movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A simply stunning read that I couldn't put down. I never had to read it in high school but I always meant to get around to it. I hate to say that the movie made me finally get it, but it did. Also, I love a book with a twist ending.
B005LAII9O|5.0|Loved this movie.  I totally enjoyed the plot and the actors.  Fully of action. Kept my attention through the enitre movie.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nothing special.  Gets the job done.  I like the really big numbers because I am a button masher. I cant find anything bad about it.

0547884591|5.0|My housemate's copy came to the house the other day and I dove in.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of confusion and animosity over 5 star reviews being given so quickly for such a large book. 5 stars means I love it. I haven't finished it, but I've gained enough in the first 10% that it was worth buying my own copy. Here are my reasons.<br /><br />The fact that this book is about learning to learn through cooking had me excited from when Tim announced it a year or more ago. Although most teaching takes a linear approach, most learning does not (mine definitely does not). Tim's books aren't linear, but are chunked and should be read in a disjointed manner based on what you want to learn.<br /><br />I already love to cook, learned to cook in my teens as I love to eat, often times too much, but learning to cook saved me a lot of time and money in college. Now, Tim is applying his same OCD level of detail and process of learning to cooking. In the first 40 pages he mentions cooking techniques only a handful of times, but those few times contained pearls, hidden amongst his personal stories. I've been working to learn Hindi for a while now using conventional lesson plans. The problem is, I don't have enough time to commit the regular hours to the lesson plan. When I hit Tim's dirty dozen sentences, I immediately stopped reading, copied them into an email and sent them off to a friend for translation. Now, armed with the two sets of sentences, I can pull out the critical grammar and vocab keys and use them to unlock the rest of the language (and others that I wish to learn as well).<br /><br />This is not a book of recipes, which perhaps a lot of people thought that this was going to teach. How to learn to cook hundreds of dishes in 4 hours. If you want that, I suggest buying most conventional cookbooks and go from cover to cover (or watch the movie about the woman that did that). This book will teach you how to cook a handful of recipes, but it will teach you the creative processes of how to create hundreds of your own. I much prefer this latter approach and further refining my own knowledge of cooking and enjoying food.
0062183591|5.0|What makes this book so enjoyable a read (not to mention enlightening) is that the author weaves stories from his own life and the observations that kick off his research.  From how he felt carrying an expensive bag to surgery he was once pressured into considering, it's these small, everyday moments that pass other people's brains that grip Ariely and guide a series of experiments that reveal some interesting facts about human nature.  Devoured this book in two or three sittings.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Not our favorite movie, at least not for young boys.  Cute concept but it just didn't hold my 8 and 10 year old boys attention.
B002MG2ATY|3.0|I'd seen it before.  Enjoyed it then and enjoyed again.  Oliver Stone tends to be different.  I believe this movie would not be everyone's cup of tea.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|Expected better plot. Received a different impression of plot from trailer. Not at all what I expected. I was disappointed.
B009FXIICK|5.0|I got this game off another app store a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised to see it as app of the day. Looking forward to playing this on my kindle.<br /><br />There are only 2 game modes with very similar play but the game is interesting in that you keep trying to best your last top score. It's fun seeing how far you can get and the tension is high when the timer counts down and the screen starts shaking.<br /><br />Give it a go if you like puzzle games or want to work on your ability to recognize objects faster.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|This film is better than its remake. I would recommend this film to people who claim they love the &#34;classics,&#34; high school dance organizers, and those with a burgeoning interest in blood related pranks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book brings forth our future society that just as a gardener cultivates trying to keep out weeds, life during these times reveal how our law of thoughts are understood.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|If you want to learn a little bit about the history of the Jesuits and the natives of Brazil and their conflict with the Portuguese and Spanish settlers (I admit an oddly specific craving), I would recommend watching this movie. The movie lets you know the relationships between the Jesuits and the settlers at the time. As there are many conflicts in the movie it should hopefully be more interesting that the history books (unless you have a very vivid imagination or an over zealous history teacher).
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This movie will change the way you think about the foods you buy and the foods you eat! It is very well directed and filmed. Extremely professional. Top notch across the boards. Where DOES your food come from. Watch this movie to find out!
B00114RKT8|5.0|If you want to learn a little bit more about the political history of the abolition of the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade I would recommend watching this Hollywood accurate historical film.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Witty and brainy. Love the casting and the plot lines. I've been really impressed so far and hope the show is renewed for a second season.
0143034901|4.0|I am so excited that i recieved this book i read the reviews online and seen some pretty good reviews on it. i ordered it for my book club and is excited to see what they think. it came in a day early than the estimated date which is fine the sooner the better and the book was in great protection
0525478817|2.0|I'm not so sure about this one. The story is appropriately sad, but that's about it. It just makes you feel sad. In that way, I feel this book is kind of emotionally manipulative. The author also seems to think he is a better writer than he is, which creates a strangely pretentious work. The characters are also ridiculously unrealistic and the book glamorizes cancer. It's not horrible, but for all the hype it isn't worth it.
0547848412|1.0|I hated every minute of this book, but kept giving it a chance, waiting to see what the fuss was about.  Overblown, overwrought, unbelievable.  There are so many better reads out there worth your time.
B0053O8ARI|5.0|it's been awhile sense we have had a series that shows the friendship between two girls from different sides of the tracks. While this dynamic is a win win it does take the right combo and because of that what we have is the magic of two broke girls. The line steeling the scene steeling and most importantly the character's that make u wont to root for them and see them come out winners. If your looking for a gift that will be a huge win in a stocking stuffer do and and bring these hot girls in-to your life
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I never ralized L. Frank Baum wrote so many Oz books. I plan to read them all because this was a good one. While &#34; The Wizard of Oz&#34; is my favorite movie of al time this book was very good. Some things were the same as the movie and some things were VERY different. I can't wait to read the others.
0385341008|5.0|Last evening was bittersweet for I completed my reading of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows.  The story was amazing, absolutely amazing, and even though the book had a beautiful ending, I wanted it to go on for many more pages.  I would dare say this is the best book I have read in 2012.  The novel is written in epistolary form and has the nazi occupation of Guernsey as its epicenter.  The book shines because of its wonderful character developement as you get to know the antagonist and the members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society through the letters that they exchange.  This is my first experience with epistolary writing and I am now a fan of the form.<br /><br />Our protagonist is Juliet Ashton who has found some success as a writer.  Beginning with a letter from Guersey native Dawsey Adams to Juliet, the novel introduces us to the backstory of the conception of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and the society members, themselves.<br /><br />This book must be read and savored by anyone who loves a good book with exceptional character development.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book & book 2 & 3 as well. This book won't be for everyone but for those of us who have dark,  crazy & dirty dreams it will be right up your ally. Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. :-)
0345803485|1.0|I would give this zero stars if I could! I mean how on earth is this a best seller just boggles my mind. Repetitive, absolutely no story line, other than the \\"porn\\" factor there is nothing of substance! But then again looking at the recent \\"best sellers\\" I am hardly surprised.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My son recommended this series for the beach this past summer and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed them and the last book was the best.

1400064287|4.0|Think Small. Just Do It. The Marlboro Man. Why are these the campaigns that we talk about for decades and why are there thousands, probably even millions of others that disappear down the dustbin of history? Is it because these were divinely inspired? Is it because people like me keep jamming them down your throats? Or is it because of something else? Do they have some qualities that make them easier to remember, more compelling, more resonant? That make them, as it were, stick?<br /><br />Chip and Dan Heath think so.<br /><br />Chip, a professor of organizational behaviour at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford, and Dan, co-founder of Thinkwell and a consultant at Duke Corporate Education, have analyzed (to read the rest of this review, please visit theagencyreview.wordpress.com/made-to-stick)
B000B8L6LI|4.0|Better than Smith's similar sharpener, because the hole is much more narrow, and as a result the angle between the surface of the blade and the surface of the stone does not alternate as much.
B002ZHKZEC|4.0|I'd never watched Doctor Who until Matt Smith came around, and during the break in seasons decided to catch up on the pre-Smith new series.  Took me awhile to get into Tennant's Doctor, but by &#34;Girl in the Fireplace&#34; I was onboard.  I was watching these on BBC America, until I realized that occasionally a &#34;specials&#34; episode actually ran 50, 60 minutes or longer, and BBCA was editing them down to about 42 minutes to fit into an hour of television.  Basically you're missing a third of the episode!<br /><br />So since all the &#34;specials&#34; ending Tennant's run were that length, I purchased the blu-ray.  Picture and sound quality are excellent.  As for the episodes themselves, I was surprised to end up liking &#34;The Waters of Mars&#34; best.  Great episode.
0757302661|5.0|I loved this book. It's about reprogramming your brain when it comes to birthing. Make sure you read this with your husband and whoever will be in the birthing room with you. Practice the scripts often and download free hypnobirthing apps in itunes. I recommend Glenn Harrolds free ones. I listened to them everynight before I had the baby, while I had the baby, and still now (10 months after having the baby). It helps you relax and use your mind to get your body to relax during birth. It also helped me with sleep.<br /><br />If you're looking for some advice on other baby registry essentials, check out AllMomsArePerfect dot com.

B000F8O2OM|2.0|Love the Stargate Sg-1 series... Watched every episode on TV, when it was aired.  That being said, thought I would snatch this show up while such a good deal for the holidays.<br /><br />Received package today, nothing wrong with it, shipped in nice tight box, dvds have no scratches on them.<br />Watched a couple episodes.  Audio was great, the video quality was a little lacking; like the quality you see when you copy a DVD on computer and compress it down to make it fit to a certain size.<br /><br />The main bug I have with it, is the compression may be too much.  While watching the episodes the video will do a freeze for a second or two, the audio will keep playing but the video has paused.  All the episodes I watched had this issue, some episodes did this over 20 times.  I even watched it in 3 different dvd players, and they always froze in the same spot...<br /><br />So I know its nothing physically wrong with the discs, but whoever copied and compressed them down from the masters, is not a hero.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I have a widescreen TV so the movie format was perfect.  This story will warm your heart and thrill the little ones, young and old.  This is the new Christmas Classic.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|a very beautiful watch!!<br />disadvantages:<br />- a little bit big.<br />- the strap material is easy to get ragged.<br /><br />other than that, the watch is really great!
B009GESJH2|5.0|I've been listening to Kid Rock pretty extensively for the past year and a half. In that time I purchased most of his albums, and he has become one of my favorites. He is one of the few mainstream artists who really try to do their own thing, and the Rebel Soul record is no exception. I generally have to listen to his albums several times before I can share an informed opinion of them, and after about a week of listening to Rebel Soul I find I enjoy it more and more. I don't like it as much as Born Free, but Rebel Soul is among of my favorite Kid Rock works. Most of these songs are bluesy old school-type tunes and solid country rockers  that make the listener want to dance. This is the Kid Rock that I love the most, though every incarnation is honest and real.<br /><br />That being said, I see a lot of haters ragging on Kid Rock for not doing the same kind of music he was doing 15 years ago. Get real, people. He is in his 40s now and his life probably isn't the same as it was back then. You can't expect him to make records that were the products of a much younger guy over and over again until he dies. I understand if the &#34;new&#34; Kid Rock is not your personal preference, but if you want to outright trash the man for his personal and artistic growth perhaps you should just go listen to your old Kid Rock albums and pretend it's still 1998. Those of you who are downing him for supporting Romney need to GROW UP as well.
B005A1ER0I|4.0|Though it is by a composer for Two Steps From Hell, do not expect to hear \\"Invincible\\" or \\"Archangel\\" on here. It's epic, to be sure, but very different from the standard epic trailer music. It has a more pronounced mid-evil feeling (See \\"Soulseeker\\"), a very foreign/tribal/old-world sounding vocal style (see \\"Starvation\\" and \\"Merchant Prince\\") and significant techno influence on a couple (\\"Aura\\" and \\"Illusions\\") I'm not a particular fan of the aforementioned vocal style, though I can still appreciate it well enough in the context of this music. The album has good variance, going around between the three aspects I've mentioned in varying degrees, so that Soulseeker sounds very different from Merchant Prince sounds from Aura, and yet the album still feels like it has a particularly unique identity. For the most part, I'm not blown away by this album but I in no way regret the purchase. \\"Ilusions,\\" however, the title track is worth particular mention. Incredibly long at 8:01 (largely repeating itself once over), Illusions itself is a good poster child as it is incredibly unique, combining an interesting vocal style AND a more traditional epic chorus (If you're a two steps fan, think \\"United we Stand\\"), along with \\"wubs\\" and techno base used surprisingly tastefully.  As an epic track it feels melancholy and desperate; not as a depressing, tragic piece but as a desperate, epic journey - and with its length it has notable tone changes, making for a good ride.<br /><br />So it's far from my favorite album, but it's an interesting change of pace within the genre and a solid album with a clear identity.
0307592731|3.0|It was interesting to get inside her head.  A different story.  Reminds us how early childhood and loss of a parent affect a person.

B004I744AS|5.0|This is the easiest and best dictionary app out there.  It is easy to look up a word, the main reason one uses a dictionary!  However, this is so much more than a mere dictionary! I love the other numerous features such as the word and article of the day! I've found myself playing around with this app like one would with a game app. Not only can it be educational, but also very entertaining while learning cool stuff!
B009VB97EY|1.0|Story about the lifestyle of a stripper, not so much a love story. The story line is terrible. A complete waste of my time.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use and handy. Log in easy, search easy. Way better on my tablet than trying to use the web browser!
1608871452|5.0|Just got this and it's even better than I was hoping it'd be. Wonderful images. Great articles and a season by season look. Enjoyed the added little extras as well. As a huge fan of this show I would recommend this book to both the hardcore disbarred fans and the most casual.

B000FCK42M|5.0|As a relative newcomer to Don Winslow books I have been impressed with the four that I have read. This has been one of my favorites(at least so far) in that there are many facets to this story involving drugs,the DEA, the CIA, and,of course,politics. The scope of the story is immense,and involves the U.S.,Mexico and South America. Read it - I'll bet you like it.

B00337KM2S|5.0|This movie meant so much to me because i saw myself in the characters.  It is a very general story about life but that is why I liked it.  it will keep your attention.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It is 1920, the war is over and everything should go back as it was before the war. But they never will and Robert Crawley struggles with that all through this season. I enjoyed this season very much . The family attends two weddings and a Funeral, expierences child bith, financial hardship and accepting that change can be a good thing.
1454901276|3.0|Peter May has more well-regarded novels and teleplays in his oeuvre than a thousand other authors. Though I had not read any of his previous works, I was drawn to this novel by its story location in the Outer Hebrides islands off the northwest coast of Scotland. Rather forbidding land, it seemed like an intriguing setting for a mystery/thriller.<br /><br />Since leaving the northern tip of Lewis Island, police detective Fin Macleod's life ran into a dead end. A failing marriage hastened by tragedy. A career rut. Regret heaped upon regret. When a murder occurs in his island birthplace that resembles one he previously investigated on the mainland, he is dispatched home to wade into an endless stream of bittersweet memories. His childhood friends have all descended into melancholy, the love of his life persists in a loveless marriage, and secrets from the past still linger, threatening to corrupt the present. Someone he knows may be a murderer, and Fin is the one who must uncover the fiend, along the way unlocking secrets in his own life.<br /><br />Mystery/thriller readers seeking slam-bang action need not apply. _The Blackhouse_ is a slow, moody, character examination driven by inner motivations and how they go awry. The bleak, tree-less landscape of Lewis Island is reflected in the desolate inner lives of the people who inhabit the island. Every child of Fin's era lived a double life, vacillating between strict Protestantism and a perpetually stoned/drunk, promiscuous existence, and those choices informed their present lives. Everyone seems guilty, whether of murder or simply of poor choices.<br /><br />In short, as reflected in the title and the cover photography, this is a dark read.<br /><br />But is it worth the time?<br /><br />***<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Author May writes evocative and provocative prose. Readers will feel the stubble on the old fisherman's face, smell the stench of seabird guano, and commiserate with the emptiness of human lives that gave up long ago. His descriptions conjure settings with phraseology that draws in readers. No creative quibbles here; May can write.<br /><br />* The research into the setting shows. May expertly depicts the real-life annual hunt for young seabirds on a forbidding island crag, the means by which people survive in this desolate land, and the sense of history the place retains. While he didn't grow up there himself, it almost feels as if he did and is recalling his own memories.<br /><br />* May perfectly balances dialog and description, along with the inner and outer lives of the island inhabitants.<br /><br />* _The Blackhouse_ strives toward the literary side of the mystery genre, something less often experienced than should be.<br /><br />* While the book unfolds glacially, it rewards those with patience who want more depth in their characters and are tired of reading books that are all plot and little else.<br /><br />* Nice touches include a Gaelic pronunciation guide, a map of the Outer Hebrides, and some in-text help by the main character when it came to pronunciations not included in the aforementioned guide.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Despite May's talents _The Blackhouse_ contains three glaring new author problems that a writer of May's caliber should never have committed:<br /><br />1. The last-second arrival of critical information -- Not once, but twice, May has important information arrive in the story right at that crucial final second. While this is standard stuff in lesser mystery/thrillers, it seems beneath May and intrudes on the careful construction of the rest of the novel. In other words, it's a cheap means to drive the story forward, and this novel should be better than that.<br /><br />2. Hidden memories trope -- The entire novel consists of the present day intermingled with the distinct and accurate memories of hero Fin Macleod. Which is why the great revelation at the close of the novel comes as so out of place and unbelievable. Author Mayasks us to suspend disbelief and (for this reader at least) fails miserably, given all that preceded the revelation. All those vivid memories, yet one critical recollection never registered. This feels like a major cheat on the part of the author, and yet he does it twice. Once is understandable, but not a second time. When combined with the previous problem, it's hard to ignore the deus ex machina feel of it all, and it undermines the quality of the rest of the writing.<br /><br />3. Failure to keep info fresh in readers' minds-- The novel opens with a dream containing what will later prove to be critical imagery. May then conveniently forgets to revisit that imagery for 300 pages until that major revelation (above) occurs. By handling that info the way he did, May further cheapened the ending.<br /><br />* Given the tone of the novel, the final sentences seemed bizarrely out of place, especially when considering the revelations of the previous few pages.<br /><br />* Mystery/thriller? Well, by broad definition perhaps. At issue is how much of an actual mystery/thriller inhabits these 357 pages, with the answer being \\"not much.\\" The number of potential villains is countable on one hand, the pool of motivations goldfish bowl-sized. Any regular mystery reader will know the perp within minutes of Fin landing on the island. Only the motivation proves more elusive, and that's part of the questionable reveal at the novel's finale (see above). If anything, the thrills (of which there are almost none) and mystery are tack-ons to the character and setting development. If that's your kind of mystery/thriller, then great, but most fans of the genre will close this book with a sigh.<br /><br />* The characters in _The Blackhouse_ are so broken and tainted as to be unlikable. This is a terrible trend in modern fiction, with too many novels inhabited by people with whom many readers will never identify. Fin's island-mates were all hard-drinking, pot-smoking, promiscuous teens living double lives. That they turned into shattered, depressed adults doesn't help the story's cause. What makes anyone want to root for them? Or even for the hero, who is one of them?<br /><br />* Here is yet another novel where Christianity is depicted as a pointless enterprise undertaken by mirthless scolds and hypocrites. You begin to wonder if there's an unwritten agreement among contemporary writers to drive a stake through the heart of religious belief. How often are novelists today going to go to that tired well of stereotypes before we get some characters of faith who actually live up to their beliefs and do so with joy and true conviction?<br /><br />***<br /><br />While I may not speak for every reader of _The Blackhouse_, I cannot escape a feeling of diminishment on reading the concluding pages of this novel. Is it any wonder that so many people today feel depressed and despairing? Though the novel closes with a shred of hope, it's hard to balance it against the relentless onslaught of bleakness found in the preceding pages. When paired with the finale that underserves the reader, all that darkness does a disservice. Yes, author May depicted life on that island with some level of accuracy, but the function of a good writer is to give us something better than reality. Readers need more than a transport; they require a destination worth visiting. That May can only take us to ruins, both architectural and human, makes this book just another examination of decay, and heaven knows most of us need better.asks us to suspend disbelief and (for this reader at least) fails miserably, given all that preceded the revelation.

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie mainly because of the theme, man against nature. I especially enjoyed the last clip (after the credits).<br />I will not tell you about any of the scenes of the movie & spoil the whole thing by telling every little detail.<br /><br />I thought the cast were well scripted and performed well with each other.<br />There was good character development, along with a little backstory which played well in general.<br /><br />For being a survivalist story, I consider The Grey to be above grade for the par.<br />The circumstances under which the characters come together & the consequential outcome of those events made for a gripping experience.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about The Grey, was the unbelievable, and unrealistic aspect of timberwolves hunting for sport in an extremely hostile and barren wilderness. I just couldn't make myself believe that a hungry pack of wolves wouldn't eat what they kill. It would have gotten a 5-star rating from me if not for that one detail.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy stories of the survival theme.

B004WPT3ZM|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever made.  I love the 25th Year Edition because I wanted to hear this album in its original sound and I prefer the sound from this album over the remastered one.  A must for any metal fan no matter what genre they listen to.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|After watching the new music video for Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife) I knew I had to buy this album and I am not disappointed at all.  Every song on this album is fantastic and is one of my favorite albums of all time.  The new singer Tommy Karevik is a more than worthy replacement for Roy Khan, my favorite example is on Prodigal Son at the beginning every time I hear that song it sends chills up and down my spine.  I was shocked when I got my package because it had more than the two CD's, there was a poster of the band and a book about the story behind Silverthorn.  Amazing album without a shadow of a doubt.

0449237567|5.0|This little novel escaped my view for years, lost behind big names like the Foundation series, it's prequels, and the robot stories.  But this story is definitely worth some attention.<br /><br />Extremely cerebral and philosophical (particularly in its middle section - the story is divided into three parts), this novel is a unique approach to the idea of parallel universes and symbiotic relationships.  Asimov's storied scientific mind is not forgotten, but the ideas of fulfillment, success, and love are much stronger in this offering than in his more technical novels.<br /><br />Quite shocking at times, with a twist I never saw coming, this book is worth the few hours it will take you to read.  Expect an abstract and inventive middle section sandwiched by two more standard Asimov-ian stories.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|great movie., Love george Clooney, enjoyed watching and easy to get. will buy from again. Product was as described and easy to use/download/access. Great customer service and will buy from again.
B007THA4FI|3.0|While The Casual Vacancy must have required a lot of effort and skill to write, it just did not work for me.  It was complicated, too busy and confusing.  It reminded me of a TV Soap Opera with all the different characters (most of whom also had a nickname...hard to keep up with) and all of the plot lines.  Every time I picked the book back up I would have to reacquaint myself with all of the characters.  Also didn't care for the ending.  Don't want to give anything away but didn't really think it needed to end that way and it did not leave me wanting more.
B008518MOW|5.0|In the Hollywood of franchises, few are successful --critically speaking, that is --, especially those developed after superheroes or so-called graphic novels. One of the immensely successful ones, both critically and by the public, is \\"Men in Black.\\" And, just when we thought that the second installment was the last one, that there was no way that a third one could be done, comes the delightful \\"Men in Black 3,\\" a hugely entertaining, intelligent sequel, as good as its predecessors.<br /><br />The movie starts when a gorgeous woman goes to jail to deliver a birthday cake to Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement), an extremely violent criminal, who happens to be jailed under maximum security, at a prison built on the moon.  Little did the guards know what was inside the cake: the key for Animal's escape. Once out, Boris returns to Earth for his revenge. He immediately goes to a store and buys a time-travel machine. He desperately wants to go back in time to kill the man who took his arm, this man being Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Boris succeeds, and in addition to trying to kill Agent K, the future of the planet is at risk. Agent K tells Agent J (Will Smith) that the biggest mistake he ever made was not killing Boris those days. Instead, by returning to the past, Boris was going to kill Agent K, changing this way the course of history. However, Agent J won't allow this, so he also travels to the past, to 1969, so that he can save his friend's life. Once there, he finds Agent K when he was only 26 yrs old, this time played by Josh Brolin. In addition, they will receive invaluable help from Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg).<br /><br />As in the previous \\"Men in Black,\\" the new one is also leaded with funny, extraterrestrial entities, mostly in a Chinese restaurant. Particularly hilarious was the scene in 1969, when Agent J meets Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) - also an agent --, who at one time requests Agent K's help, by yelling, \\"K, I can't tell women from men!\\" The Blu-ray & DVD editions also include making-of documentary, gal reel, music video by Pitbull, alien games, and more. (USA, 2012, color, 106 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on November 26, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for Sony Pictures Blu-ray
B000FCK65W|4.0|I found this book to be very heart warming and interesting.  Whether or not it is true to life and an accruate account of life at that time, doesn't matter because I enjoyed it.  A slow page-turner of a book.

0061478784|4.0|My brother, who is nine years old, he loves this book. He is also inspired to watch the Japanese movie, Howl's Moving Castle, which is also a good movie. So~ good book, good story, and good movie.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I have never seen different characters from several different movies evolve into one...this is amazingly funny, action-packed and what a load of hot men all wrapped up in one awesome flick!
0679805273|5.0|This is a great book!  We started buying it as a gift, with a note for the parents.  A cute idea is to take the book to school at the end of every year and have your child's teacher write a note or just sign it.  Begin at preschool and end with Senior year.  Then present it as a graduation gift for them.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|I am a great enthusiast of David Garrett's work and this album is truly a gem.  BE SURE TO READ THE INSERT where David explains his vision of what he wanted to achieve.  Once you hear this excellent variety of music, I am sure you will agree with me that he has been successful.  We are blessed to live in a time where a man is not afraid to think and play out of the box!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|This was a great movie!  I love Billy Joel, and the others.  It was simply a great Disney Musical!  I like to purchase it as a gift for others now!  Someday it will be a classic like their others.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space is definitely hard to play but addictive.  Sometimes the physics engine does unexpected things, but that is part of the challenge.
B007STBUHI|5.0|I bought this anniversary dvd, so we could have a Jaws Pool Party.  We waited till dark, and we had the movie projected on the side of the house, as we all floated around the pool, and of course we had lots of fun!
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box is a smart read, a journey into a seemingly unsolvable cold case that unfolds layer by layer into an ending of gripping suspense. Harry Bosch is one of those characters who is easy to connect with, certainly not a perfect hero but one with flaws like you and I, yet offering much to admire in his drive to uncover the truth and bring closure to families who have been impacted by tragedies. In between the focus on the police case, the reader catches scenes of his home life, and it is clear he is a father who does his best to put his daughter first as much as possible, and I really respect that in a character and the example that this sets. Beyond the first explosive scene, much of the story is spent sifting through the past in trying to solve the case, and therefore it took me some time to feel a strong momentum in the book's pacing. Nevertheless, the author throws in some twists  and turns as well as some often hilarious tension with Harry's boss O'Toole, adding some excellent drama to the book. Overall, this is a book that was thoroughly entertaining, and as I was drawn further  into the story, I found it harder and harder to put the book down and step back into the real world. I really enjoyed the last few chapters as the truth of a conspiracy is revealed, and the conclusion is well done.<br /><br />Readers who have enjoyed previous books by Michael Connelly should plan on picking up this latest offering, and will no doubt be pleased they did. 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Book has been provided courtesy of the publisher, Hachette Book Group (Little, Brown and Company), for the purposes of this unbiased review.

030759565X|5.0|I have loved Deb Perelman's recipes on her blog for many years (...).  When she came out with a cookbook, I knew I had to support it.  I initially bought it with some hesitation ... I mean, after all, she has a blog with thousands of amazing recipes, could a cookbook compete?<br /><br />The answer is: Yes, it can.<br /><br />The recipes in this cookbook are fantastic. Deb has gone out of her way to make sure that there are unique, easy-to-decipher recipes that you won't find on her blog.  I've made several, and they've all turned out fantastic (true to the smitten kitchen way).  The directions are clear, Deb offers suggestions on what ingredients to use, proper substitutions, and when a step that might seem cumbersome or something you want to skip appears, Deb goes into detail on why she included this step in the process and what it adds to the recipe.<br /><br />The book isn't just about recipes, though.  Deb Perelman's fantastic photography is included, as well.  The best part of the book for me is the stories that Deb has chosen to share.  She shares how she got into cooking, stories behind her recipes, and other tidbits about life.  These make this a cookbook you can actually read, instead of just reference.  If you order this  book, plan to block off several evenings to take in the book, read through it, and pore over all the magnificent details inside.<br /><br />One note:  The book comes with a removable cover over the hardcover binding, something that the publisher's insisted on. To Deb's credit, she has also made sure that the actual hardcover binding is beautiful as well, meaning you can feel free to store the paper outside somewhere else, and save yourself from ripping it mid-recipe.
B000I8ES5C|5.0|Great movie. Absolute classic that I am going to show to my nephew, even though my brother will insist that it's an oudated movie.

B004V2S4SS|5.0|I purchase this for My daughter who is into this kind of TV series and I don't know much about it, but for the price and for the<br />prompt delivery, I was very pleased and it came very nicely packaged and early! She was happy to have it! Thank you!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love books that are witty and well written and I generally stay in that genre type, such as Valentine deFrancis' Note to Self, but my cousin told me to try Sylvia Day's Reflected in you, and I have to admit, I enjoyed it.<br />I wasn't a big fan of the 50 Shades trilogy, and maybe it tainted my opinion concerning any books that area similar. Nonetheless, although this isn't the type of reading that does it for me, I did enjoy this and I recommend it.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV show of all time! Came on time and the price was alittle steep, but was well worth it for a good<br />show to watch!  Thank you!

B004T4KQJS|5.0|We, humans, are not meant to comprehend history beyond the confines of a few generations.  Nor are we meant to understand distances that exceed what we can walk, things we cannot touch, smell or see.<br />With the use of math, the scientific method and finely crafted instruments, however, scientists have expanded our understanding far, far beyond the limitations set by our senses.  Lawrence Krauss conveys enough of how such limitations were overcome to reassure us that there is a solid rationale beyond these astonishing and counterintuitive theories, but not so much as to completely lose his lay readers in a sea of science totally beyond our grasp.<br />I take this book in relatively short sips, savor its concepts and shake my head in awe of what it so well descibes and tries to explain.  Thank you, Lawrence Krauss.  Your book is a treasure for the unprepared, such as myself!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's been decades since I eagerly awaited the next installation of a television show, and I am loving it. I find it funny and even a little disheartening that people refuse to watch such an excellently executed drama as this on the basis of the fact that there are &#34;scary dead people&#34; in it. The zombies are really not the focal point of the show. The real subject of the show is the way people act when great adversity is thrust upon them. I find this to be one of the best pictures of basic human nature currently being offered to the public.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Well written and acted.  Good special effects.  Makes you wish more episodes of the television series had been produced.  Well worth watching again.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This is probably sort of cheap, but then Rovio did about the same to me. I got the game for free on my phone and I decided to spend $2.00 to buy Path of the Jedi (in-app purchase).  Level never opened and so I emailed them twice--no response.  Not that it matters, but that's why I am coming on the Amazon store to rant a little.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I still can't believe we can order and see real current movies instantly..This one was excellent. We really loved it!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great family movie. Wonderful lessons to be learned, such as even the toughest hearts can be softened with patience and love.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved the charachters and the poetry was an added plus.  Nice to see a simple love story with life's twists and turns.  I shared this one with my grandaughter who read it twice.
0891419063|5.0|Really one of the best books I have read in a long time.  The detail in the book is amazing!

B007HACDLK|5.0|As with all Vince Flynn's other books it has started out very exciting and hard to put down. I am reading it on my Kindle. I love the suspense. I have not finished it so I will have to wait for a final decision on the whole book.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|So far,so good. I just got this app for the camera feature. I just wish you could turn the camera around to face in front of you.
4898153194|5.0|I simply love this little book. I found out about it by accident when I was visiting Japan and rushed to the bookstore to buy it. It's the most cherished thing I brought back with me. The photos are beautiful and tell a wonderful story of a friendship. It's true there's only a handful of them but for me it's just the right number chosen by the author to say what she wanted to say. There's no description of the photos either but they're powerful enough to send their message.<br />This will be definitely one of those books that you pull out every time you feel a bit on a low side. It can cheer you up in a second. I only regret I bought just one copy. I know now how many of my friends would appreciate this little gem.
B000002UAU|1.0|The product (CD) would not function in any of my three CD players. It malfunctioned in the same manner on all three players. I can only assume that poor quality control on the part of whatever organization produced and or shipped this product allowed this faulty product to be shipped. I returned it.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am a big Jack Reacher fan and was eagerly waiting for this book to come out.  I am sorry to say it was a bit of a disappointment.  It was very slow and repetitive and I actually had a hard time getting into it.  I actually wish that I had gotten it from the library rather than spend money on it.  I agree with one reviewer who questioned whether Lee Child actually wrote the book.  It definately was not his finest work - maybe he's getting bored with Jack!
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Lego products are great.  The design and quality is superb and the toy actually exercises my kids' brains, unlike many other toys that are popular today.  Highly recommended.
0307405095|5.0|I have only made about thirty of these so far, but I haven't found any I haven't liked. Leave it to Martha to have such an exquisite collection of recipes.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|From the first page this multi-layered story is worth reading.  The characters are interesting, and frightening, and the history being told is darkly fascinating.  Created great discussion in our Book Club.
B004FVHBXY|5.0|If your a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, Inception is a must see. Very different from anything seen in the movies ever. The story line, action, graphics are top of the line. LOVED IT!!!!!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Love this CD, she definitely did not disappoint on this one. One of my fav songs is Jump! If you enjoy her style you will be pleased with this purchase.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Don't expect deep plot line or well developed characters with intricate dialog. This is a shoot-em-up blow-it-up action movie and nothing more, however it does that perfectly. If you want a exciting(and ridiculous) action packed FPS video game like movie this fits the bill.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|it will have you guessing, wold recomend i wish there was a fourth book i would be first in line.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I liked Rod performance of traditional Christmas songs.  It was nice and subdued.  One could sit back with a glass of wine and enjoy the seasonal music.
B000KQGOA4|5.0|If you love Holst, The Planets, and/or Van Karajan, you'll love this CD:) I really don't know how you can get much better than this. Even my parents recognized the skill and beauty:) Just get it and enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book is great and it is very pratical to read usilg kindle. I would recomend it to a friend.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Definitely not the most gripping literature I've ever read, but for those who have no familiarity with the military it's an easy to follow and fast read.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This is a pretty good cable as far as cables go.<br /><br />The wire/cable itself is robust - good feel, hefty gauge.<br />No angle hair spaghetti grade stuff here.<br /><br />The Connectors are durable, well made and well installed.<br /><br />I didn't get to use it for the intended application.<br />but,<br />That is why GOD created Plan B.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|heard the song on the opening sequence from Borderlands, listened to some of the other songs and bought the album.  Awesome band, even David Letterman made them play twice he liked them so much
B009FXIICK|5.0|Be smart about when to use your extra help items &amp; you can get pretty far! This is a basic game that we've all played various versions of, line up objects on a grid, but there's a few things that makes this game a little different. You can move the objects while the grid is still moving before it lines back up right after you made a match if you're fast enough to do it, when you get stuck you can click the magnifying glass to help you find matches but you only have certain amounts so save it for when you need it. Sometimes a box will show up in the grid that changes to the box next to it when you use it &amp; frees up some spaces so that helps too. The game is nicely paced until about level 8 when it really speeds up. I don't think I would've ever beaten that level or most of the ones after if I didn't have the magnifying glasses to quickly show me where matches were. When you use the magnifying glass make sure you pay attention to what it's showing you because it only lasts a few seconds. Overall it's fun and I found it's addicting to play &amp;I didn't realize how long I was actually playing so it made time pass by quickly so it's a good game to play when trying to pass time. It's not a pretty game like some of the alternatives but it reminds you if the 8 bit retro games of the past :-)
B005723JSQ|5.0|I've had a really horrid week and this book helped me relieve tension.  I was expecting a sweet, funny romantic read and that is exactly what I got.  If you practically live by your phone you can't help but laugh.  I disagree with other reviewers that say this is the same as other novels by this author.  I found the plot to be unique and engaging.  Thank Ms. Kinsella for the much needed laugh!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|the book was cheap and i love automatically receiving it . still reading but it has already made an impact on my marriage. it just helps couples understand each other and how each party operates.
B00943SQCI|1.0|This is another DVD that you never sent me.  Feel like you stole money that I paid for items with.  I can't be a customer of yours when you don't send me items that I paid for.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love reading the modern day twist on Greek and Roman mythology that Riordan imagines up. It makes it so fun to follow along, and I eat up these books. A great book, in a fantastic series. Wether you're an adult, or have a youngster that wants a good clean story, full of fun, Rick Riordan is your man.
0345803485|1.0|We'll ignore the fact that the writing is so bad in order to get down to what I find the most disturbing thing about this book being such a big hit. If you loved it, and you are one of these women oh so in love with Christian Grey, I want you to do something for me. I want you to go back reread this book and this time pretend he's ugly, that's the only difference I want you to make. And when you finish tell me honestly, do you still love him? Of course you don't. You erase the fact that he had swoon-worthy good looks and he becomes someone you'd never consider dating, let alone loving. His controlling abusive behavior isn't that sexy when he isn't is it? Hmm.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Been hooked since Episode 1, Season 1.  And that's saying something because we hate almost all tv programming.  This series owes its success to Frank Darabont.
0316228532|2.0|Best part of the book is the title!  Unfortunately, this is a dull book with limited character development, weak dialogue and sexual references that take the narrative nowhere. I've read a few reviews saying the last 100 pages are good but there are too many great books published to spend hours getting there so I won't give \\"Casual Vacancy\\" anymore of my leisure reading time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My wife has a Kindle fire and loves it. I put the Kindle for android on my phone and my PC and I am very glad I did. I have numerous books downloaded and now they are sync'd so I can read the same book on my PC or I can use my smart phone while waiting at an appointment.
B000SEIDR0|2.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma: Too depressing! Consists of horror stories about the food industry.  All too true, and a good subject, but no fun to read about. Neal Thorpe
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've read every fiction novel by Grisham. This one falls short of the standard. There plot line is similar as others he's written. The back story to the plot is thin and not quite believable. Outcome was very predictable. Overall a disappointing effort.
030746363X|5.0|As someone who reads a lot and has worked in the fitness industry, this book is a great read. I have read it all the way through and referenced it several times for as long as I have read it.<br />If you are looking for a magic cure in the book, this is not for you. If you are looking for insight and opinion on alternative methods on fitness and weightloss along with great narratives, you need to read this book.<br />As with any book, you need to read with a critical eye as there will be things you agree with and things you may not totally agree.<br />It is great for anyone who is looking for a plan and is comitted to weight loss.<br /><br />In summary don't waste your money on a diet book or a diet cookbook. get this book, you'll reference numerous times.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an all over the map kind of reader.  From the Wicked series to Middlesex, but my interest are mostly horror and Sci-Fi.  I almost passed on Wool because there are so many run of the mill post apocalyptic stories and they all seem to have the same common denominator.  Wool is not one of those run of the mill stories. I reluctantly downloaded the Ominbus series based on all the rave reviews.  Now I too feel the need to rave about Wool.  This is a creative new story that takes life after the end of the world to an entirely new level.  Thank you Hugh Howey, I can't wait to read what comes next out of that ingenious head of yours!!!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This season, even though shorter has some awesome episodes. From the perspective of watching this long afterward I can say I liked the Ruby character. She doesn't show up too often, the Bela character I can do without.<br /><br /> Some truly funny moments to me are 1: Dean going and seeing his old girlfriend and the b-day party. Seeing the women eyeing him up like a piece of deliciousness, and not being shy at all, is great. Seeing him interact with the kid who acts and talks like him. Quick math and oh Holy crap. Not his kid though? Bedtime Stories had me cracking up, especially when Sam knows the Cinderella story and Dean tells him he is so gay. I love the episode where the old lady is hot for Sam and it grossing him out. The lady wasn't shy and seeing both guys in tuxes was a sight that had me speechless, gaping at the tv. Oh My God when Gert(old lady) did the double ass grab on Sam and whispered sexily into his ear, the look on his face was priceless. Seeing Dean come down the stairs in slow motion and thinking he looked ridiculous. I agreed whole-heartedly with Bela that, that was not the word I would use. More like a super-sexy American 007. As you see in the gag reel. His reaction to the suggestion of angry sex saying don't objectify me, is total b.s. as you shortly see a huge freakin' grin split his face.<br /><br />  There is a really funny part in the Fresh Blood episode. They capture a young newly turned vampire and are asking her who turned her and how. She said some guy was buying her drinks and put drops in her drink. What did he look like? She said he was an old guy, you know like 30. The looks on their faces was WTF: when did 30 get to be old? Since they are riding around that age bracket. Way too funny.<br /> The Christmas episode is out and out hilarious. It starts with the elf thinking they are two perverts just watching kids to seeing Santa with a bottle of Jack watching Christmas porn. That will warp your psyche beyond repair.<br />Seeing Sam &Dean standing there open-mouthed at Santa is side-splitting. Only to be topped by them breaking into a Christmas carol like they are just out caroling. Santa laughing and them high-tailing it out of there. Let alone being tied up and tortured by rejects from Pleasantville, who have no problem with killing and chopping up bodies, but she tells Dean he owes money to the swear jar for cussing. Wicked funny.<br /><br />  The Mystery Spot is funny, yet hard to watch considering Dean is heading to Hell shortly. Sam gets to watch him die every which way and he can't stop it. Then we find out the Trickster is back, and Sam gets a taste of life without Dean. It has some really funny moments and sad too. The season ender is really hard to watch, as Dean's time runs out and he gets shredded by Hellhounds and sent to Hell. You see the full realization of what he did on his face as he is screaming Sams name.<br /><br />  This show just keeps getting better and better. These 2 are absolutely mesmerising to watch and a huge bonus seeing 2 hotties in tuxes makes it complete. I would ramp it up to 15 stars if that were a choice. Get yourself these season's and get hooked(it will happen). It is worth every penny, and it is money well spent.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Even though the story is about a presumed murder, I did find myself laughing out loud a couple of times.  I really like the way the author changes back and forth from one chapter to the next showing the wife's perspective from the time they met and working forward.  Then, the next chapter is written from the husband's point of view starting with the day of the &#34;big event&#34; working backward until her story and his story meet in the middle for the big twist.  I can usually predict the outcome of a book and did not see this one coming.  Thoroughly entertaining.
0439023491|5.0|What is there to say, this book is great and provides some amazing twists and turns to the story line. Can't wait for the movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|All of the episodes have been great, all of the seasons have been really good.  My favorite television series this year!
1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander's credentials are overwhelming in describing his experiences, when his brain was nonfunctional and incapable of creating them. His description of the soul in relationship to the brain is a mind opener!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have bought in years. Jason has such a variety of talents when he sings. Sad to say but happy to have been able to play &#34;Livin in the moment&#34; at my 30 yr old sons service. I lost him on the 4th of November. This song was written for him...
0525478817|5.0|One of the best Young Adult books I have ever read in my life. There was a point at the end of a chapter where I had to physically restrain myself from throwing the book across the room because I was so angry with John Green for making my worst fears a reality. I knew it was coming, of course I did. It didn't make it suck any less. For once in my life I really was both laughing and crying at the same time. Best tears of my life.
B00936A0RU|3.0|Lawless is an early 1930's period piece about the bootlegging business between three hick brothers who try to maintain their moonshine business with cops and competition crawling up their asses. This movie is very pretty to look at, the music is well done and interesting (covering newer songs to sound older), and the actors sell their roles pretty well. The problem I had with Lawless though was the overall story, tone, characters, and pacing; and here's why:<br /><br />-Characters: So our protagonist in this film is the youngest of the brothers who's grown up a coward who wants to be a tough guy businessman like his brothers, however he doesn't really find his balls until 20 minutes before the movie's over and makes dumb decisions throughout the film that jeopardizes his family. So we have a flawed protagonist, not really a big deal, it sort of adds depth to him, although all the depth that's given to him makes his character your standard cookie-cutter underdog ripped from countless Hollywood stories and not much else. The middle brother is basically just the family wildcard, and the oldest brother is the quiet reserved badass that pretty much runs the family business himself.<br /><br />So this is your trio of characters the movie is 'based on', there's almost no depth to any of them if you've seen Hollywood underdog gangster movies before. Then you have sub-characters, such as Rickety Cricket who was a former priest turned cokehea-wait, wrong Rickety Cricket. Crickety Ricket, who is the token smart guy, fixes the bootlegging equipment and machinery and is the youngest brother's timid nice friend who ends up being the second act martyr to move along to the third act. The youngest brother's love interest also plays a small role simply as 'love interest', and she just giggles and repeats \\"if my daddy were here\\", \\"my daddy don't like you\\", \\"my daddy this\\", \\"my daddy that\\", etc. You also have Gary Oldman, who was barely in the film and his name was slapped on for marketing purposes as the intimidating mobster who buys from the brothers for no reason other than he recognized the younger brother's face.<br /><br />But now onto my favorite character: the evil FBI agent who wears all black, looks like a pale sickly Nazi, and pretty much tortures anyone who crosses him, all the while the police officers turn a blind eye. Early in the movie he asks someone \\"do you think I'm stupid?\\", which he apparently is since he does nothing the entire film but piss off the entire town (including the police officers). Also, you're supposed to believe that in the 1920's everyone in a Southern town that wasn't a criminal was a total coward. The agent saunters around town and terrorizes the populace without anyone raising questions or just shooting the guy. Sure he was a federal agent, but I think murdering the town cripple in cold blood would lead to his titles being stripped away from him at least. Sure there was some message about how fear controls people, but that's more applicable now with people sitting inside watching the media, not in the 1930's where people were still settling across the country.<br /><br />So there's little depth to any of the characters, hell even Pulp Fiction had more character depth to it. But what about the story? Well the story is basically the agent slowly snaking his way farther and farther up the brother's asses until they decide to retaliate, which is the end of the movie. The story itself is kind of interesting, family protecting their business and what have you. One thing that was weird about the pace was how predictable it got. After the agent arrives into town, there would be a few 5 minute scenes where the youngest brother and his love interest would be flirting, and then SUDDENLY 20 MINUTES OF GRAPHIC VIOLENCE & DRAMA!!!! There was virtually no build-up to the climax of the movie because the pace never changed from STOP-GO-STOP-GO.<br /><br />There were also a few scenes that were either plain stupid or plain annoying. Like for instance the police find the bootleg still, and the brothers never think to just burn the place down while the cops are there. Also in that scene, the youngest brother comes across the agent who's in his mercy, and before this scene, the agent beat the royal s*** out of the brother. So what does the brother do now in this opportune moment? Step on the agent's face and call him a queer or something. He doesn't break the guys teeth, he doesn't bruise up the guys face or kick him in the balls, no, our hero does nothing but some anti-climactic love tap then walks away. Also at the end of the movie, the youngest brother is pissed since his token smart best friend is dead, and wants to shoot the agent. So what does he do? He goes up to a police roadblock where the agent is among a dozen cops, and points his gun at all of them, and doesn't get shot immediately. No, the bad guy has to slither out from the darkness (literally) and shoot the brother. It's dumb, stupid, Hollywood s*** like this that pisses me off from these kinds of movies.<br /><br />So it was entertaining most of the time in a 'how far will they take it this time' sorta way, it almost felt like a graphic novel or something due to the violence. Again, the music was great, which makes sense considering it was from the talented Nick Cave who also scored the infinitely better period piece: The Assassination of Jesse James. The acting was decent and so was the whole design, it was just unrealistic, shallow, and stupid a lot of the time.nnoying.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have always enjoyed this particular make of P & P... especially with Keria Knghtley. The entire production is well put together with great cast interaction. I have watched this movie repeatedly on T.V. and now watch it on DVD. Excellent entertainment!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great book and I will read it again.  It has been the best alternative since 50 shades of grey.  Love it
B008WCP2PG|3.0|While not a excellent movie, there is an edginess that goes far towards the storyline. Enjoyable as an afternoon matinee.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful trilogy.  Will for sure read it over and over again.  Very much one of my faves.  All three of them.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album has a great variety of sounds - unlike other albums, I actually like listening to the whole thing at once instead of mixing it up with other artists.
B007SGM084|5.0|These three books consumed my life for 7 whole days.  I could not put the books down.  Fell in love with Mr.Grey.  I will forever read these books over and over until I die.
B008M721MS|1.0|Maybe I'm missing something, but I've never heard of anyone who's gotten this to work. It'd be great if it did!
B008HK3RVY|4.0|This case is as described.  It fits perfectly for the Fire HD 7&#34; but there is no space for anything else.  I'm juggling cases for my Kindle, but this is the best one for traveling.  Nothing will get inside of the case, where my other one can slide open enough to allow for objects to scratch the screen.  Timbuk2 is known for cases, and this is no exception.
