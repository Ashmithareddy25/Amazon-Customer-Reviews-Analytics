1932907009|5.0|Wow! I just finished reading \\"Save The Cat: The last Book On Screenwriting That You'll Ever Need\\", and have to write something now or I will explode! Seriously by far the best How To book I have ever read! I am so sad to find out Blake Snyder is dead because I want so badly to shake his hand. I can't believe such a book could be written that literally tells you how to write a good screenplay in a way that is understandable and an absolute joy to read. For a small town boy with no formal mentor in the industry, Blake Snyder is a God send. He makes writing movies compatible for anyone with his honest, no secrets insight that inspires me to dive right in. The man was a master of his craft and he was so good that he just could not bear to withhold his plethora of knowledge and golden gem insights into the art of scriptwriting.<br /> Blake Snyder is the first person who ever taught me how to tell a good story and I believed him. He never just tells you something or states a fact, which he does often and comically, Blake gives you a perfectly relevant life story that smacks your brain with such explosive imagery and logic that there is almost no way you can misinterpret his points unless you are reading the book upside down! And he praises the reader for challenging him and dares you to prove him wrong. It's so awesome because you pretty much know you don't stand a chance past your initial argument.<br /> Mike Cheda. I must meet this man or in some way become affiliated with him because anyone one or any movie or anything for that matter that Blake Snyder approves of is A. O. K. by me. As must be fairly apparent by this review, I am a complete noob when it comes to screenwriting and I feel like no better book in the world could have tossed me so gracefully into the exciting realm of the movies, which is hey! what we all really came here for in the first place. Thank you Blake Snyder. In 195 pages you have become my greatest teacher and totally turned my world upside downboth professionally and personally. You were the catalyst to my story!
B00015YVDG|5.0|Mel Gibson really turns it on in this movie about a wealthy father who's young son is kidnapped. Without giving away the plot, Mel's character responds in an unusual way that launches an exciting storyline. Three scenes in this movie are amazing; the first is when Mel breaks down on a balcony with his wife played by Rene Russo. The second is when Mel goes on TV. The third is when...well I won't give the third one away.  A must see if you enjoy suspense/crime thrillers.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|This picture grabbed me from the beginning and would not let go.  It was so intense that it took several minutes to get back to real time when the movie ended.  The acting was extraordinarily excellent.  A great piece of ensemble acting.  But Eisenberg was superb as Zuckerberg with his frozen expressions and an almost empty face.  Scary as hell.  And talking so fast subtitles were needed.  The characters were not warm and fuzzy, particularly Zuckerberg, but Savarin was the closest to a sympathetic character.    The script was literate and the direction was terrific.    This picture was robbed of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director.  At least Sorkin won for his screenplay.
B003QCCS3Q|4.0|In today's music scene, you won't do much better than this.  Mr. LaMontagne has firmly inserted himself into the best of singer/song writers.  I didn't give a 5 star review because the songs are a little uneven.  Beg, Steal or Borrow is the best song of it's type in a very long time.  A couple of the others don't quite measure up, but he set the bar awfully high with Beg, Steal or Borrow.    The production is simply brilliant.  The sounds and choice of instruments are perfect for each song.  I think the use of steel guitar is the best since Gerry Garcia played for CSN&Y.    I bought the CD on the strength of Beg, Steal or Borrow, after hearing it on the radio.  The rest of the recording continues to grow on me.  I like it more each time I listen to it.
0763644765|5.0|My 21 month old LOVES THIS BOOK. We got it a couple months ago and hes to the point he can read you it himself (he has memorized it) Also when he uses his potty he yells out \\"I did it ! Horray ! Undies\\" Just like they do in this story haha.  Overall this book is perfect for your little potty trainer or soon to be.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I don't look for anti-Semitism under rocks and in dusty corners but am I the only one disturbed by the awkward and stilted analogy at Kindle section 4428?    Roscoe is explaining to Finlay how the counterfeit money is distributed through the country by \\"Kliner\\" (not exactly an Irish name and a variation of \\"Klein\\" but that's OK.     But Roscoe, a hot southern babe who probably never saw a pastrami sandwich or ate a decent bagel, out of thin air picks out the analogy of a Menorah (Jewish candelabra) to describe the distribution fingers for the money trail. She explains at some length that a Menorah is a candle holder used by \\"\\"Jewish people\\"  If it had fit the story, the time and place, OK, but it didn't and was disturbingly forced. Is it just me?
B004H2ZFPW|4.0|Love or hate her, Avril is still going strong. After four studio albums, and being featured in Eragon and Alice in Wonderland 2010, her success is there. Granted, her style has always been a hybrid of Pop and Punk, and again a love/hate taste, but she is finally branching out to a more subtle style. I've seen reviews of Goodbye Lullaby saying that it's too slow or filled with too many ballads. Yes, while Goodbye Lullaby is slower than her previous work, that opinion is kind of one-sided. With Avril, the style fits. Her voice when she is rocking is good, but one she is singing a song like Innocence from The Best Damn Thing, or the opening Black Star from Goodbye Lullaby, she shows that she is more than a one-trick pony. What the Hell is definitely the most unique song on the album, because that is the only one to use a bit of techno, so if you judge the album based on that one song, you are doing yourself a disservice. Push, Smile, and Everybody Hurts are the highlights that round out Goodbye Lullaby, and gives the album it's distinction.<br /><br />Now, while the album has variety and style, I feel that, just as she did in The Best Damn Thing, her use of profanity is a bit drab and tasteless. It doesn't fit her, at least I don't think so. Yes, it does give a bit of edge to her music, but she was fine without it.<br /><br />Overall, being a fan of Avril from the beginning of her career, I'm not disappointed with her newest album. Her new direction is promising, and I cannot wait to see where she goes from here.
B00122MBY8|4.0|One of the greatest albums of all time. I had the privilege of seeing Van Morrison live on the Boston common around '72. He had his ensemble of musicians with him and they did some of the songs on this recording. It is a beautiful romantic journey from beginning to end. It is a shame the sound quality has degraded as it has. I believe it was better on the original 33 vinyl album.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|If you take your iPad and Camera with you on your travels, the camera accessory is a must buy.    Very easy to use. Just plug the accessory, connect your camera USB cable and the iPad instantly recognizes the camera and shows the camera pictures, and then you just tick on the pictures you want imported and you're done. On later uses, the pictures that are already in the iPad will be distinguished by a different tick colour.     Overall it does what it says, but you do get the feeling that this feature should have been built-in in the iPad from the start, and you realize how Apple uses the milking the cow till its dry methods.    NOTE: I only used the Camera accessory, I did not try the SD Card accessory
0439023491|5.0|This series is so awesome it is very hard to put down! The writer is excellent at keeping the plot from being predictable. She also is a pro at ending every chapter with one sentence that practically forces the reader to keep going to see what happens. Totally clean, a little violence but nothing offensive. My teenage daughter and I fight over who gets a turn to read it next!
0439023521|5.0|Reading THE HUNGER GAMES was like breathing in fresh air--finally, a well-written young adult book with fresh ideas, an exhilarating storyline, and heart-thumping adventures. This book was a nice relief from character-centered books that have pervaded Young Adult fiction and focuses more on the storyline and plot. The setting of the novel resembles a lot of other post-apocalyptic books: a dystopian society arises from the ashes after a major war between the authoritative Capitol and the 13 Districts it rules. The Capitol won the war and destroyed District 13, and as punishment and reminder of the power of the Capitol, every year they force each district to hold a lottery to choose one boy and one girl who will go to the Capitol and take part in the Hunger Games: a winner-take all gladiator battle to the death.<br /><br />The protagonist of the book is Katniss, a bold and self-reliant 16 year-old who illegally hunts in the woods to save her family from starvation. As the Hunger Games begin, Katniss takes the reader along with her on a journey through the political manipulation of the Capitol and their cruelty in the Hunger Games. I can't stress how fantastic this book is. Recommended for ages 13 and up.
B00005JKCH|3.0|What can I say?  Peter Parker / Spider-Man was poorly portrayed throughout the series thank goodness they are rebooting.  Did you all know he's not supposed to be an awkward nerd stare into the headlights with barely any personality all the time?  Not to mention Spider-Man is a witty wise cracker?  This doesn't mean Raimi's film is not fun.  There's plenty of Spider-Man / Green Goblin action and the effects are pretty good.    Overall this film is cheesy, and just feels held back.  The Spider-Man series could have been much more, instead we got a mass appeal trilogy \\"all about a girl\\" and less about Peter Parker's guilt / mistake over his one huge error in life.    The Spider-Man costume is spectacular it's everything I always imagine the live action costume would be.    I like the Green Goblin but boy could have we have gotten better.  I imagine Raimi didn't want to scare all the kiddies and box office $$ away.  But I still love the bridge fight and especially end fight where the Green Goblin basically smokes Spider-Man.    Spider-Man is fun but vastly under potential to what a great comic and Spider-Man film could have been.  Period.
0439023491|4.0|Because of her public defiance to the Capitol at end of the Hunger Games, Katniss knows she is persona non grata to the powers in charge. CATCHING FIRE shows the ramifications of Katniss actions with berries--political unrest has spread throughout the districts, and the people have become emboldened to protest the Capitol. Suzanne Collins expertly portrays the dangers and sufferings uprisings bring to all people, both involved and not. Katniss and Peeta find themselves thrown back into the twisted ways of the Capitol, where they must fight every inch of the way for survival.<br /><br />Once again, Collins has written an 'edge of your seat' adventure story that propels the story to a shocking cliffhanger that shows the consequences of uprisings and retaliation. However, I found the character development to be slightly lacking, especially in a first person narrative; Collins tends to gloss over a lot of Katniss's reactions and feelings, especially with Peeta, who is supposed to be her love interest, and his rival Gale. I also felt that her return to the Games was a bit repetitive, and did not hold up to the first one at all. Nevertheless, it was still a gripping story that should not be missed.
030746363X|5.0|This author has many innovative techniques and ideas for different ways to achieve goals we all hope to get to.  I like the fact that he has used himself as a human guinea pig to test his methods (all sorts of crazy stuff!).  Some of it seems pretty radical, but I found it was very interesting.  I hope to give a lot of it a try over time.  (I had checked it out of the library first & decided it was something I wanted to have in my personal library).
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Over the past few years, I've slowly picked up each of the Complete Recordings from Howard Shore for Lord of the Rings. The first time I saw the movie, I was drawn in by the story, the characters and before anything else, the music. Music is what makes a movie work. Without a talented composer, your movie can crumble. Howard Shore did a brilliant job with all three movies. I listen to this soundtrack and the other two constantly - usually as a good background noise while studying or doing other activities. All three Complete Recordings are well worth your money!

B002ZCY7SW|3.0|SPOILER ALERT THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW!!!!!    Let's see: There's a mole in CTU, terrorists threaten a nuclear holocaust, White House staff members go rogue, Charles Logan gets his traitorous head into the mix, a president seriously violates the law . . .  Where have we seen those plot lines before?  Oh, that's right.  In several other episodes of 24.  There is little that is original in the Season 8 story line.  Plot twists, the bread and butter of the 24 series, were identifiable before they happened.  All you had to do was recall the previous years' episodes.    Some suspension of belief has always been necessary to watch 24, but Season 8 broke the common sense barrier.  A cop tazes Jack and beats him severely.  Renee knifes him deep into the abdomen.  The bad guy strings up Jack and shocks him into unconsciousness while probing fingers dig into the knife wound.  He gets tazed again, takes two automatic weapon rounds in the chest (while wearing a Kevlar vest but a devastating blow nonetheless), suffers a flesh wound to the shoulder, and gets thumped on the head several times.  Yet each time, he pops back up with the spring of a frisky colt and can even get it on with Renee while enduring injuries that each should have immobilized him.  Jack Bauer isn't a secret agent.  He's a professional wrestler!*    On the good side, the ending was tense and was the strongest part of Season 8.  We all were certain that, in this last season finale, Jack was going to die.  It was just a matter of how and who went with him.  But, no, the producers left the door open for more.  Don't do it, producers.  Let 24 fade into memory.  It's said everything it can say and more.      *Probably the worst example of 24 wanting viewers to buy into the impossible was in the second season when Jack's plane crashed into a mountain side.  As the next episode opened, there was Jack strapped to his seat, just a little groggy after his ordeal.  And there was Nina already up and alert and shooting a pilot whose body, in reality, would have been spread across the mountain along with hers.  And, of course, Jack and Nina remain in such good physical condition that they can run around the mountainside trying to kill each other.  Yes, 24 is fiction and designed to be over-the-top, but it isn't fantasy either.
1439102724|2.0|I absolutely LOVE Picoult's work and have read all her other books. I was preordered this bok and was so excited when it downloaded to my iPad. And then I started reading it. It wasn't so much the subject matter, I have enjoyed Picoult's books on many other subjects that I didn't think I would be interested in, but rather none of the main characters were very likable. It wasn't like I was torn between who I wanted to get the embryos, it was more like I didn't care at all. Disappointing.
0316154687|2.0|First off, David Sedaris knows how to put a joke together and can be funny.  However, when reading his material, I'm turned off by his pretentious, upper-middle class views.  In criticizing James Fenimore Cooper, Mark Twain wrote that someone who does not see the world properly is incapable of writing about it.  I feel the same way about Sedaris because of the elitist way in which he sees the world.<br /><br />For instance, in one story in 'When You Are Engulfed in Flames,' 'All The Beauty You Will Ever Need,' Mr. Sedaris spins a yarn about going to buy marijuana with his brother from a man in Raleigh, North Carolina.  However, he continually pushes thoughts onto the characters that are, obviously, projections from his upper-middle class mind.  He also emphasizes certain aspects in the characters he finds deplorable.<br /><br />For instance, at one point he writes, \\"I pretended to admire the Christmas tree, which was miniature and artificial, and stood upon a barstool beside the front door.  \\"This is nice,\\" I announced, and Beth shot me a withering look.  Liar, it said,  You're just saying that because my stupid husband sells weed.\\"<br /><br />While it is obvious that Sedaris is lying, since he tells us \\"he pretended to admire the Christmas tree,\\" it is normal for him to read Beth's look as calling him a \\"liar.\\"  However, the sentence that follows is pure projection and can't be taken seriously as her thoughts.  It is more accurately the type of thought that upper-middle class Sedaris tends to place on members of the lower class.<br /><br />The very next sentence in the story is \\"She really wanted us out of there.\\"  Again, this is Sedaris projecting.  He does not bother to explain how he knows she wants them out of there.<br /><br />Sedaris places emphasis on certain things about the characters or their possessions that he finds deplorable.  An obvious example is the Christmas tree above.  He also makes it clear that the dealer and his wife, Beth, live in a \\"trailer,\\" not even attaching the word \\"home\\" to it to deprive it of that quality.  He tells us the dealer looks \\"like one of those kids who drops out (of high school) and spends all day hanging around the parking lot,\\" as if those type of people are common and his upper-middle class readers are familiar with them, just a stereotype he perpetuates.  Furthermore, the only dialogue of the dealer and his wife Sedaris provides is that which will seem grotesque to his readership.<br /><br />Sedaris ends the story by making a point about how homosexuals are viewed, that people assume one in the couple plays the role of the \\"traditional man\\" and one the \\"traditional female.\\"  He tells us, \\"People I know, people who live in houses... have often asked the same question (which of you and your husband is the man and the woman?).  Thanks for getting heterosexuals to look at how they view homosexuals, Mr. Sedaris.  Maybe it's now time you take a look at how you view the lower class.  They're people, not just a device to scare upper-middle class folk into adopting your view for fear of becoming like them.to it to deprive it of that quality.

B004CAWKXE|5.0|I was surprised, but not unpleasantly, at the new direction this album took. \\"Danger Days\\" rocks from the first track to the last--so much so that it's impossible to pick real highlights. The band managed to create a fresh, consistent sound without ever being repetitive, all the while following a rather creative narrative arc.<br /><br />This definitely escapes the \\"emo\\" label that saddled the band in early albums. It also turns away from their punk roots in favor of electro/dance themes, but that didn't sour me on any of the songs.
0060751967|3.0|This has \\"typical romance chick lit\\" written all over it. It also has many parallels with the Twilight stories (MANY). The main difference being that this novel is written for adults and has sexual content. If you enjoy reading chick lit romance novels you might enjoy it. The only reason I read it was because it was available for free for a limited time on the Nook. I would have never purchased this book.     Besides the similarities to Twilight, and the cliche romance, I felt like this book was too obviously made for \\"average women,\\" as if the book was trying to appeal to them. In the book we find that Shanna wears a size 14, because she indulges in pizza too much, wears a 36B bra, and wants to eat brownies all the time but gets mad at herself for it. Of course, her love interest, Roman, doesn't mind at all and just loves her. It looks to me like the woman on the cover is not a size 14 either. If they had made the lead character a size 4 that was happy with herself, that wouldn't have appealed to the average woman I suppose.     There were certain parts that were silly and unrealistic, like when Shanna gets angry when she finds out he has a harem, as if they had some sort of relationship. They barely knew each other, and she acted as if he broke her heart. This is not great literature, it's the type of book you read just to have something to read.
B00004XOWN|3.0|In the late-80's early 90's there was a big deal about censorship, and many bands made a statement by swearing and trying to fight the 'warning' label. By the late 90's the tactic to get the warning label was becoming something of a gimmick to get teens to buy albums. Well, by giving the 'clean' version of this album much more than I gave the original CD is my statement. I wish I could put on a modern album without it being full of expletives. Anyway, Fred Durst has some clever vernacular, such as 'your mouth is writing checks that your a$$ can't cash' from Full Nelson, that is more interesting and creative than hearing some guy swearing at you over and over.     Limp Bizkit is a band form the late 90's nu-metal/rap-rock scene. However, Fred Durst, as a front-man, is like a 1000 times more entertaining than most of contemporaries. Although the band is bashed for being angst and aggressive, the more seriously you take Fred Durst, the more you hate him. The less seriously you take him, the more you like him. Come on! with lyrics like 'if I use 2 more expletives... that's 46 expletives in this expletive rhyme' and 'keep my pants sagging keep a skateboard,   a spray can for the taggin' it becomes obvious that Fred is writing entertaining lyrics that sometimes make a mockery of controversy. Wes Borland is a very creative guitarist, more innovative than many of his contemporaries.    This album has good diversity, from groovy rockers like 'My Way' and 'Livin' it up' to slower more moody songs like 'It'll be ok' and 'Boiler' and also the love song 'The One'. An album that is fun and sometimes full of surprises. Rating *** (Only for the clean version)
B0035V35PI|2.0|Um This movie was not all that good, it has great special affects because the protagonist and antagonist are not martial artist. The movie was kind of entertaining because of all the blood and special affects but if you are looking for real martial arts..this is not it!!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This heat sink and fan combo is a winner. I chose to purchase an optional second fan (you will also need to purchase a fan Y connector). The second fan dropped my temps an additonal 3-4C. With 2 fans installed and running at 1500 rpm, it keeps the mobo and cpu ultra cool - idle temps are 27c/29c respectively. Under load they hover around high 30s. The install was easy, especially once you watch the video on the Cooler Master site. The written instructions are a littel confusing. It is a large fan, so make sure you have a big enough case.
B000000HHE|5.0|A Classic for sure. Used to own the cassette and wore that sucker out. This album is unavailable on I-tunes, but amazon had it for cheap. Long wait for the shipping,but well worth it.De La Soul is from the soul.
B004PA50JM|5.0|I don't think I've enjoyed more than 2 songs in a row on an R.E.M. album since \\"Automatic ...,\\" so I've been happily shocked how much I enjoy CIN.

It's happy, it's complex, and it's satisfying.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|One of the first ebooks I purchased was The Name of the Wind, and I have waited impatiently for The Wise Man's Fear.  I bought it, then realized I needed to reread the first book.  I never reread books, and was very surprised at the degree of my immersion in the story again.<br /><br />Then I was able to start on Day Two.  I am not going to go into any of the Plot lines, but rather want to comment on Rothfuss as a storyteller.  He has an ability to weave stories, then take you in surprising directions you had no way to anticipate.  Most of the time when I read fiction, especially fantasy, it is too easy to anticipate what comes next.  I have read two books, and have no idea what to expect in the third.  Even within his substories, he unfolds plots, subplots, new directions and his main character in ways we, or at least I, can't see coming.<br /><br />I have well over fifty fantasy books on my kindle alone, and have read many more than that.  This series has been the most engaging of any of them for me.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Instead of a long review discussing each song I'll be brief and simple.  I have listened to R.E.M. for 25 years and I'm always very critical of everything they do.  Take out copies of Murumr, Recogning, and Automatic For The People and put Collapse Into Now next to them.  Good.  You now have the 4 R.E.M. albums that define perfection.
1594202842|5.0|I had read so many articles and reviews before even reading the actual book itself, I'm not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing.      When I first got the book, the description on the cover struck me, where it says this book was supposed to be a book about how Chinese parenting is better than Western parenting, but it ended up being a book about how she was humbled by a 13 year old.  Nowhere in the press do I find this phrase or sentiment reflected.  On that note, I set out to read the book.      I found it funny and definitely shocking at times. There were parts I could totally identify with, and parts that left me shaking my head.  Ms. Chua obviously has some incredibly strong and rather rigid convictions.  The determination and constancy with which she applied herself to parenting her children was incredible.  I know I don't even have the energy and willpower to make my kids practice Chinese every night, much less practice a musical instrument for 6 hours a day.      Regardless of how extreme her methods are, I think taken in the context of a memoir, it's an enjoyable read.  Do not take it in the context of a parenting book, because that's not what it is at all.  Do not take it in the context of an analysis of parenting methods and the differences between cultures, because that's not it at all either.  It's her story, and her family's story.      Interestingly, the reviews on this book are mostly divided between one and fives.  That is a great pictorial indication of just how polarizing her book is.
0307594009|5.0|I've always had a healthy interest in the Second World War and had read various materials about the Holocaust.  I had previously visited the Holocaust exhibition at the Imperial War Museum in London and visited Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II (Birkenau) death camps in Poland, but although I knew about Anne Frank and her eventual fate, I had never read her diary.<br /><br />It was only after a visit to Anne Frank Huis in Amsterdam last year that I decided on my return to England that I'd have to order a copy of her diary (the definitive edition).  Since diary's are private I felt (at first) a little intrusive but as it turns out, if Anne had survived the War she intended to publish them anyway, so that put me more at ease in reading it.<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect in terms of content. I think the sadness that I felt in reading it was more due to the fact that I knew how things ended rather than due to the content itself.  There is actually quite a bit of humour in the diary as well as teenage growing pains, a girls hopes and aspirations, as well as some of the more inane and banal aspects of family life.  It amazed me just how \\"normal\\" a life they tried to lead whilst hiding from the German authorities, a family just trying to survive the War, and how close they came to doing so.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary will be read and (hopefully) studied by many generations to come.  I take solace in that Anne, through her death, got to tell her story, unlike the many millions who shared her ultimate fate never did.<br /><br />Read the Diary and if you ever get the opportunity to visit Anne Frank Huis in Amsterdam, then please do so.<br /><br />A solemn read but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
B003062NG0|5.0|As an example of how good Porcupine Tree is - this collection of outtakes from the Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun sessions is better than most rock groups best efforts.  Amazing!
B004M5HB74|4.0|As I said in the title, this is a pretty solid collection of remixes.  If you liked the self titled album La Roux then youll undoubtedly enjoy this collection.  On the other hand, I bought it when it was $7.50 and felt that was a pretty good price for it.  I would consider it more of a single than an album because too many of the tracks are just remixes of the same song.  If youve heard the album then you know what to expect from this release as far as the sound goes, but it definitely has a more \\"club oriented\\" sound too it; more bass, more loops, more repetitive sounds.  On downside to something exclusive like this: When I ripped it to my pc using Zune it didnt have any info to pull, no track list or titles, no album art.  Im really OCD about my collections so Im going to have to manually upload the art, and I already had to type in the song titles so they wouldnt all be \\"unknown song 1\\" \\"unknown album\\" \\"unknown artist\\".
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The sound quality on these is fantastic.  They are very well put together and can even be disassembled should one of the parts fail (although I doubt I'll ever have to since the build quality is so high).  They come with a complete parts explosion with part numbers.<br /><br />These headphones are extremely comfortable. I've had them on for hours.<br /><br />Skip the over-priced noise cancelling Bo__ and get yourself a pair of these.

B002RSDW80|3.0|Julie & Julia starts out on a positive note by being somewhat original and creative before inevitably falling apart, so now I believe the movie is overrated.      The movie consists of two storylines constantly jumping back and forth.  One story is that of Julia Child herself from over 60 years ago in France slowly but surely becoming a cooking sensation by starting off with (surprisingly) questionable cooking skills and gradually improving into the celebrity we remember her for today.  I was actually surprised she started off on such a sluggish note as far as her cooking skills are concerned.  I always believed -along with many other folks- she was born to be such a great cook, but apparently not.    The other storyline (arguably the better one) is about Amy Adams character pretty much following in the legendary footsteps of Julia Child, so she spends a considerable amount of time cooking in her tight apartment kitchen being creative with a variety of different recipes and pretty much beating her brains out trying to make every dish exactly right.    Unfortunately the plot simply does NOT ever really pick up in a way that leaves me satisfied.  It moves along at a snails pace, and as you sit there hoping for that one special golden scene to save it, it never happens.  It just plods along, sometimes mildly funny, other times completely missing the mark.  By the time we reach the book publishing segment, the boredom becomes overwhelmingly intolerable.      I really think Julie & Julia should have been shortened by a good 45 minutes because the way it is, well, you probably have to be a huge Julia Child or Meryl Streep fan to really be able to tolerate all the eventual boredom you'll have to sit through.  I give it 3 stars out of 5 without any regret.  A better storyline should have been a requirement before putting it in theaters.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I was pleased with \\"Burlesque\\" for several reasons: it gets plenty of things right about Hollywood; the featured actors all do exactly what their roles require; the soundtrack is irresistible; the costumes are worthy of a Vegas show; and the wall-to-wall musical numbers are staged and photographed very, very well.    Don't know what film experience Mr. Antin has, but clearly his work with his wife's Pussycat Dolls was educational.  \\"Burlesque\\" surely does not have an original story, but it surely doesn't need one.  The script is fast-paced, witty, emotionally consistent, and simple - leaving the complexity to the stagings.  I saw this on pay per view and am about to put the DVD on my wish list because I know I will be a repeat viewer.    Pure entertainment!
0446577383|2.0|90% of this book is well structured and a really interesting read, unfortunately the last 10% when it is all being drawn together is dreadful. Some of the most predictable conclusions I have EVER read.  The ending of the book read likes the most naff American movie drivle, it's as if he was deliberately writing if with the screenplay in mind and a half-hearted dramatic ending.    Without wanting to spoil it for anyone, the line around \\"bad atmospheric conditions in the atlantic\\" made may laugh out loud as one of the most pathetic efforts at building suspense I have ever read, it was just SO predictable. If it ever gets made into a movie it'll be straight to DVD and straight into the bargain bucket.
B003TML0VO|5.0|I do not believe that the majority of the songs on this CD can be considered among \\"The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time\\", but that's really beside the point. As my ears processed this music  into my mind I came away with the opinion that despite the somewhat misleading title it was still an outstanding musical experience. One that I will have no problem playing over and over again. If you like the sound of Classic Rock and the guitar playing of Carlos Santana then pay no attention to some of these Amazon reviews. Buy this CD, stick it into your player, turn up the volume, sit back, and enjoy the ride.
B000Y5JFNY|2.0|The limited edition 45th anniversary collector's set purchased is disappointing.  Stopped after viewing the blu ray for the first 10 minutes.  Regret to have purchased this collection's set.      The blu ray is less than high resolution.  Most of the screens of landscape show many flickering points which are rare in blu ray.  Horizontal lines all over the screen are obvious which are common only on VCDs and not normally found on DVDs, and the first time seen in blu ray.      The music CD is contained in a plain paper CD holder without the track listing anywhere.    The music box sounds less than 8 seconds even with a full wind and can hardly be heard if the cover was not removed.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|I'm not going to pretend I went into The Fantastic Mr. Fox with expectations in any feasible direction.  I never read the classic book on which this film is based but had vague knowledge of the book's existence as \\"one of the other books from the guy who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach\\".<br /><br />Next up comes the realization that the film adaptation was the result of director Wes Anderson's creative vision; a style that, love it or hate it, is undeniably unique.  With past films like Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, about the only common thread I could find was appearances by Bill Murray (and in that regard The Fantastic Mr. Fox continues the tradition).<br /><br />This is the story of one Mr. Fox and the conflict within him between being a responsible family \\"man\\" and the chicken-stealing wild-ways of his past.<br /><br />Despite making a promise to his wife that the life of thievery is a thing of the past, Mr. Fox decides, as part of his mid-life crisis, that he must try \\"just one more raid\\" on a trio of intolerant farmers (Boggis, Bunce and Bean).  The sad reality with recovering addiction is that \\"just one more\\" easily becomes a returning lifestyle and Mr. Fox realizes this only after it's too late.<br /><br />And while the action serves as the catalyst to move the plot along, the core of this tale is satirical family life (personified through animals) of Mr. Fox (George Clooney) wife, Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep), their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and visiting nephew<br />Kristofferson Silverfox (Eric Chase Anderson).  It is this dynamic that provides the film's greatest charm by staying close to the moral lessons of the original tome coupled to Anderson's trademark off-brand wit and style.<br /><br />And in keeping with the Wes Anderson brand of style, the visuals, this one forgoes fancy Pixar/ DreamWorks-esque 3D computer animatics for traditional stop-motion technique. And not unlike Aardman's works with Wallace and Gromit or Chicken Run, there is undeniable charm to be found in this method.  Once the viewer adjusts to the intermittent rhythms and the scruffy (almost ultra-realistic) look of the model textures, the wit, beauty and emotional undercurrents contained here are stunningly apparent.<br /><br />The pacing, heck even the themes and satire are undeniably adult oriented however.  Does this mean foul language, sexual themes, or gore? Absolutely not.  Anderson's work is an all-age friendly class act all the way.  However, it's definitely still debatable as to just which age will make the most of the experience here.  The visuals may be strong enough to keep the kiddies involved but it's the sociological and family interrelationships that really define this piece.<br /><br />Entire case studies have been conducted in effort of defining the various themes and underlying issues that author Roald Dahl confronted in his writing and many of these ideals transfer brilliantly into the film: Concepts like our inherent inability to ever fully let go of our youth or the battle between industrialism (represented here by the farmers) and nature.<br /><br />The vocal work is spectacular as is expected from such a deep cast and the Alexandre Desplat soundtrack makes use of an excellently appropriate selection of pop music.<br /><br />In all it's tough to come away from this film without some appreciation of Anderson's ability to combine the classic material with his own sensibilities.  And while his past films may suggest this as a trait that can go either way, rest assured that Fantastic Mr. Fox retains the very best of what Wes Andersen has to offer: Intelligent wit, impeccable timing, and just enough homage to early-filmmaking techniques to be labeled charming.Chicken Run, there is undeniable charm to be found in this method.

0756404738|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear is the second book in Patrick Rothfuss's trilogy, the Kingkiller Chronicle, following his 2007 novel, the Name of the Wind. The Wise Man's Fear succeeds on multiple fronts: it features a compelling protagonist whose development as a character is truly remarkable; it features a solid, intriguing plot; it is superbly written.     The protagonist, the titular \\"Kingkiller\\", Kvothe, is a famous magician, musician and adventure. By his mid-20s, the age at which we are first introduced to him, Kvothe is a legend, more myth than man. The trilogy is his autobiography, dictated by a bitter, disenchanted, seemingly broken man. So much of Kvothe's story has been turned into popular legend, myth and song (in the series), and it is truly fascinating to watch Kvothe explain how the events truly unfolded, how the myths and stories truly began. Further, Rothfuss is a rather remarkable writer. The narrative flows beautifully, the language used is masterful. The only quibble I have about the writing whatsoever is that the dialogue, as with the Name of the Wind, is a little trite and unrealistic at times.    Because of its premise, the Wise Man's Fear, like the Name of the Wind, is extremely character driven. Kvothe is the central character and the only one of true importance. This works so well in the Kingkiller Chronicle because Kvothe is a fascinating and incredibly complex character. The story simply wouldn't work if Kvothe was dull or one-dimensional. Although Kvothe was in the Name of the Wind a little too perfect (that is, he tends to be extraordinarily good at pretty much everything he tries), he definitely makes his share of mistakes in the Wise Man's Fear and experiences some rather startling failures.    One of the biggest weaknesses in the Name of the Wind was the lack of three-dimensional supporting characters. Fortunately, Rothfuss devotes considerable time (which is not difficult to do in a 1000+ page novel) to side characters, fleshing out familiar characters and introducing new ones. None of the side characters are as developed as they could be, but the supporting cast is no longer a weakness.    Although the Wise Man's Fear is an excellent novel, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the Name of the Wind. Unlike the Name of the Wind, parts of the Wise Man's Fear tended to drag. In particular, Kvothe's time with Felurian felt endless and seriously overdone. But honestly, almost every segment of the book (and you can break the novel into probably five distinct segments based on location and plot) felt at least somewhat overlong. Rothfuss certainly has enough story to fill 900 or so pages, but this 1000 page tome could certainly have been trimmed a bit.    For all its strengths, and for its few weaknesses, the Wise Man's Fear simply lacked the magic of the Name of the Wind. I couldn't quantify exactly what was missing, but the book never gripped me like its predecessor. It's beautifully written, masterfully developed, incredibly creative and innovative, but something just seems missing. Still, though, the Wise Man's Fear is a remarkable novel. If you liked the Name of the Wind, you'll almost certainly like the Wise Man's Fear. Although the novel probably deserves a 4.5, I think it's closer to a 5 than to a 4. The Wise Man's Fear and, indeed, the Kingkiller Chronicle in general, is very much so worth your time. Rothfuss is producing some of the best fantasy today. Don't miss it.

B004NYQYNQ|4.0|Adele's 21 album is definitely hyped; and I even fell for the hype. I found out about Adele when I heard her singing \\"rolling in the deep\\" and her remix of \\"rumor has it\\" ft Lindsay Lohan (Don't judge; it was a really good remix). I thought she was great and I was totally set on getting her album BUT after listening to amazon's music samples, I felt it (the album) didn't live up to my expectations. I read the reviews, everyone said it was an awesome album but I decided not to get it...until today. I heard the full version of \\"rumor has it\\" via youtube and I was like, \\"wow this is amazing.\\" I bought the album via digitial download and I'm so glad I did. The sample music really doesn't do her justice at all. Alot of the songs are packed with emotions and you can really feel her words. It's a bit of country and some r&b; that's the vibe I got from listening. I highly recommend it. The media hype is for realz.

0545123283|4.0|While not quite as compelling for me as the first, still a very good read.<br /><br />Cole was realistically toxic with his self-destructive ways and was not one-dimensional all bad or all good.  He is a much more like-able and relate-able character than Isabel as an addition to the narrative.  Also, a very good way to work in someone with skills to help work out their problems.<br /><br />Narrative from Isabel just made me dislike her more.  She seems the archetype of the poor, little rich girl.  Seems like she could channel her energies on her long-term goals rather than on trying to be the biggest b this small town has ever seen.  While realistically portrayed, spending time reading Isabel's thoughts often just seemed like a waste of my time.  Also, I did not really get her chewing out Sam on his responsibilities with the wolves and his agreement that he needed to take responsibility for them --- irony aside, what did she think he could do to control where the wolves go or what they do?  Also, frankly, of all the wolves, being a victim, he had earned the right to move on with his life and let others who had chosen their own path live theirs.<br /><br />Would've liked a better resolution for Grace and her parents --- very realistic but since we're talking werewolves here, it's a bit mundane to just see regular teenage rebellion and parental authority arguments.  Better if they had seen just a hint of the truth to let them start guessing that there is more than the usual hormones going on that --- again, reality --- odds are, won't last.  I don't want to read about the story of the 99% that did not make it --- I want the story about the 1% that did.<br /><br />To be fair, I believe the reality is that people who go through major trauma together may start a relationship because they feel a special bond but don't necessarily last either because that is their only bond and without it, they would never have come together or worked out in the long run anyway.  The author does try to show that their personalities balance each other very well and, to me, seems quite a close mirror opposite of her parents (one is artsy and the other is very pragmatic but both are very supportive and involved with the other.)  Hopefully knowing what they know, they would be better as parents but, again reality, most people seemed destined to become their parents and even parent the same way etc.<br /><br />Again, I'd like to read about the 1% that were different from the rest.r personalities balance each other very well and, to me, seems quite a close mirror opposite of her parents (one is artsy and the other is very pragmatic but both are very supportive and involved with the other.)

0321701763|5.0|I was arrogant when I looked at this book and thought that it might be too simple. After all, I'd been using Photoshop for a few years and was only upgrading versions, wasn't I? Well, when I actually sat down and started working through it patiently, I found that I was wrong to be so arrogant. The book may look simple aty first glance, but it is quite carefully constructed to build up a nice balance of information in an easy way. From the start, I was finding myself learning little tricks and new shortcuts.    For me, there were two gains to be had from this book. The first is that I was several Photoshop versions behind and it was truly helping me to learn new features. The second is that I was nevertheless getting set in my ways and was overlooking shortcuts which would make my life easier. For example, I thought that I knew all about selections. Yet I had never used the spacebar to move the selection around at the same time as I was making it (don't laugh at me!).    So, unless you're an absolute super guru, I think that if you are patient enough to work through the lessons in this book then you will get a lot out of it.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album marked their commercial peak. Though many fans find the previous album, [[ASIN:B00005NKKY Bookends]], to be the apex of the duo's artistic creativity, it's hard to think of another pop act that exited with a success comparable to this album and its title track. Despite Garfunkel's initial reservation, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" made good on Simon's feeling that it was the best song he'd ever written, topping the Hot 100 for six weeks and winning Grammy awards for song and record of the year. Though the recording is deeply tied to Garfunkel's brilliant vocal performance, the composition spawned dozens of successful covers, including Aretha Franklin's Grammy-winning R&B chart-topper and Buck Owens' Top 10 single. In the 1970s it became a staple in Elvis Presley's stage show, and cover versions continue to be recorded to this day, with a live version from the 2010 Grammys having charted, and the television show Glee having featured the song the same year.<br /><br />But the title song is far from the album's only jewel. With Garfunkel away for the better part of 1969 filming [[ASIN:B00005ASGC Catch 22]], Simon was left to work alone, and apparently consider a post-Garfunkel career. \\"The Only Living Boy in New York City\\" and \\"Why Don't You Write Me\\" are easily heard to be contemplations of Simon's isolation, while \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" includes the telling lyric \\"so long Frank Lloyd Wright, all of the nights we harmonized `til dawn,\\" an allusion seemingly tied to Garfunkel's study of architecture at Columbia. The seeds of Simon's multicultural solo career can be heard in the Peruvian flute of \\"El Condor Pasa (If I Could),\\" broad rhythm instrumentation of \\"Cecilia,\\" and reggae styling of \\"Why Don't You Write Me.\\" The album topped the chart, won Grammys for engineering, arranging and Album of Year, and spun off four hit singles.<br /><br />This CD/DVD set marks the 40th anniversary of the album's January 1970 release, and combines the original eleven tracks with two hours of video material. The DVD includes the duo's rare 1969 CBS television special, Songs of America, and a new documentary, The Harmony Game: The Making of Bridge Over Troubled Water. The special, aired only once on November 30, 1969, has been bootlegged many times, but never before officially reissued. At the time of its airing its social and political viewpoints - particularly its explicit anti-Vietnam war messages - caused sponsor Bell Atlantic to pull out. But with backing from CBS (the same network that had fired the Smothers Brothers earlier in the year), the program found a new sponsor (Alberto Culver, the makers of Alberto VO5) and was aired uncut.<br /><br />Both video features are extraordinary documents. The 1969 special, originally shot on film and pieced together from two different sources, is a post-Woodstock look at America in which Simon and Garfunkel seem to be trying to explain the younger generation to adult viewers. They surface the questions and doubts on the minds of many young people in 1969, starting with the incalculable loss of the decade's heroes - JFK, MLK and RFK - and reflections on the brutality of poverty and the activism of the farm workers, UAW and Poor People's March. First-time director (and future famous actor) Charles Grodin skillfully mixed compelling newsreel imagery with voiceovers and interviews, and interwove performance footage and behind-the-scenes shots of the duo at work. Simon and Garfunkel are spied working out arrangements of new songs, rehearsing their stage band and recording in the studio.<br /><br />The making-of documentary repeats some moments from the '69 special, but adds context with discussions of the program's creation and controversies. There's additional concert footage and contemporary interviews with Simon, Garfunkel, their manager, Mort Lewis, their engineer/producer, Roy Halee, and two of the studio players (drummer Hal Blaine and bassist JoeOsborn) featured on the album.. The conversation with Halee is particularly illuminating, as he describes how the duo's studio sound was produced, and provides specifics of the album's tracks. The song-by-song discussion reveals numerous details on personnel (Fred Carter Jr., for example, played guitar on \\"The Boxer,\\" Joe Osborn played an 8-string bass on \\"Only Living Boy in New York City,\\" and Larry Knechtel developed the gospel piano on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\"), recording locations, production techniques, and brightly highlights the creativity everyone concerned poured into the album.<br /><br />Missing from the CD are the bonus tracks (\\"Feuilles-O\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water (Demo Take 6)\\") available on earlier releases, as well as the oft-bootlegged session track \\"Cuba Si, Nixon No,\\" but the video disc is priceless and a fantastic bonus to celebrate this album's anniversary.

159420229X|5.0|This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it?<br /><br />Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America.<br /><br />I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the \\"Memory Palace.\\"  The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun.<br /><br />What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />In Chapter Five, I scanned the \\"to-do\\" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory.<br /><br />It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, \\"the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination.\\" Having been to Greece twice, I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book.<br /><br />The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. \\"People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things.\\" [page 134] Some even believed that \\"the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe.\\" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future.<br /><br />The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship.<br /><br />This is an important book.

0316098337|4.0|This was a great book with an interesting premise. It gives its readers the perspective of 5 year-old Jack, who has lived his entire life in a tiny room with his mother, a kidnapping and rape victim. It's incredible to see the ingenuity of Jack's Ma, as they cope with the boredom of life in a cage and try to survive the unpredictable whims of their captor. However, the first part of the book does begin to drag, and you begin to wonder how much longer it could possibly go on. Finally, circumstances change, and we get to see how Jack is able to come to grips with a world he didn't know existed. Jack's narration really begins to shine when we see him mentally working through problems he had never confronted before.    One thing I was concerned about when I first picked up the book was that it would devolve into some sort of torture porn--depending more on gruesome imagery and creative ways to injure characters in a specifically sexual way, than actual plot development. I was thankful my fears turned out to be needless. The book deals with very sensitive topics with care and tact. It does not attempt to dull the horror of what the characters are going through, but it does not depend on it to hook readers.    By the end of the book, Jack's narration can become wearying, as Donoghue struggles between maintaining a believable child's voice, and her own mature prose. The inconsistencies between broken English and flowing sentences and vocabulary become increasingly apparent. Though this issue did become tiresome for me, the resonant story made the book well-worth reading.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I heard alot about this novel before reading it. All the great reviews are 100% accurate! I loved this book. Steig Larsson does a great job of setting up the characters for you in the beginning. I will admit that this made it a little challenging to get into at first, but once you put the pieces together you simply can not put it down.<br /><br />This novel is gripping and touches upon your every emotion. I went from admiration to outrage to disgust and back at several parts of the book. Steig Larsson does a great job at adding twists and turns to the story that you would never expect and his character Lisbeth Salander is constantly intriguing.<br /><br />Definitely a must read!!!!!
B004NLVMKY|4.0|Saw John perform live in NYC last week & he was tremendous!  Enjoyed the new songs he played so we got the cd after the show.  It is his best work since Temple Bar.  \\"Evil\\" is an even better song live.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|There is something here for everyone.  It's as if everything R.E.M. has ever been came together in one album - yet it still feels cohesive.    Collapse Into Now is R.E.M. back in fine form and back feeling comfortable in their own skin.    Some of the songs here are on par with the best R.E.M. have ever written.  The joyous \\"It Happened Today\\" will put your in a state pure euphoria.
B003UESJH4|5.0|There is something to be found here for everyone in this brilliant and powerful movie.  Entertaining on all fronts, both dramatic and laced with great humor and irony, it leaves one with a sense of euphoria and triumph.  While comparatively little was known in America about Queen Elizabeth's father before the release of this masterpiece, there has been an on-going interest in her late uncle, the ruling monarch before WWII, who abdicated his throne in favor of the American woman he loved.  His radio speech to England at the time when he removed his crown, and handed it over to his reluctant and ill-prepared younger brother, is perhaps one of the most listened to still today, not only by the British, but other nations as well.  It is a speech that may be consided as having changed the course of history in such a way as to bring Queen Elizabeth to the fore as one of the most important rulers today in modern history.  The pivotal point of the story in this movie lies here with her father, who had a debilitating speech impediment, and was hardly able to make a brief announcement let alone a speech of any kind.  With the tenacious help of his wife, the future Queen Mother, they go together in search throughout the kingdom for royal physicians, who may hold the key to a cure.  This depressing and increasingly \\"grim-go-round\\" brings them as a last resort, into the office of an unconventional speech therapist, who is regarded as an eccentric crackpot, a nonentity and possibly a fraud.  Or is he?  This is for the viewers to determine.  The first thing this man does is to grab \\"royal protocol\\" and place it outside his office, solidly parked near the umbrella stand until the office visits are over.  The results are not only hilarious, but appear to be beneficial and involve hard work on both the part of the doctor and the patient as they thrive to become a working team and establish a friendly understanding.  In the midst of this true historical anecdote, the movie shows a dark and frightening contrast to the struggling king in the form of Hitler, a foe who has no trouble speaking whatsoever, using a documentary newsreel at the time showing him rallying the crowds, sending cold chills down some of the viewers backs.  It is now a match between \\"Good versus Evil\\", and the rest is history.  As for the king's speech, broadcast on the radio and listened to by England and the world-at-large, announcing that Britain is at War with Germany, it is perhaps one of the most intense and powerful ones ever given (On a personal note, this was a great topic for a small international speaking club located at UNICEF House in New York.  After giving a short 5-minute address on the background history of the movie, I highly recommended that everybody would benefit in some way from watching it.  My fellow members are from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Islands and while we are all fluent in English, it can be difficult for us to stand up in front of an audience and \\"speak out\\" although we are a friendly group, always encouraging and supportive).  All to say, \\"The King's Speech\\" is a wonderful and important reminder to all of us that we have \\"A Voice\\".and frightening contrast to the struggling king in the form of Hitler, a foe who has no trouble speaking whatsoever, using a documentary newsreel at the time showing him rallying the crowds, sending cold chills down some of the viewers backs.

B004Q6FNEW|4.0|I knew what to expect going right into this one. Stand up and Fight is a lot like the Varangain Way but this album has a higher production value and the scope of everything just seems bigger. Everything from the music to the art in the booklet has a great polished feel and easily worth the price. Getting right into the music, this CD to me felt like the orchestra was the primary focus. It has a nice mix of their heavy stuff and emotional build ups which the orchestra really enhances. Honestly, it's one of few CDs I could follow the story of which is usually lost in so many concept albums. There were a few times in the CD though because of the overuse of the orchestra that I thought I was listening to an old Disney Soundtrack being presented by Turisas. Regardless, the CD has some memorable moments at least for me:    The March Of The Varangian Guard - (Strong opener)  Venetoi! - Prasinoi! - (The orchestra really shines in this one, the main riff is great)  Stand up and fight - (The perfect middle track for the CD)  Fear the Fear - (Reminded me of their old stuff. memorable chorus)  End Of An Empire - (The choirs are just incredible at the end)  The Bosphorus Freezes Over - (I like the ending narrative. Ties up the story in a nice finish)    It took me a couple listens to really take everything in on this CD (so much detail). Overall it's a nice addition to the Turisas collection.

B002ZBD9Q4|5.0|Alter Bridge is one of my favorite bands!  Great vocals and great musicianship.  Myles Kennedy is one of the best rock vocalists out there today!  Even Slash had Myles tour with him recently.  Mark Tremonti continues to blow me away with his talented solos!  I still consider this debut album the groups best album.  All three of their albums are great, but this one's a little more straight forward with great power chords!  I get more feeling out of this one.  You can't go wrong with this band.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I forgot how good Albert King was! He's a guy that sort of slid through the radar for me. But after hearing this I can say that I remember his voice on old songs I used to listen to, sort of high, right on key, very smooth, very cool. I know he's one of the pillars of the blues through the 50's and later. And Stevie, who I already knew of, was equally talented and as Albert said a \\"Pickin' Cotton Picker!\\" Both seem totally dedicated to the blues and to their craft and boy it shows! This is a rare and greatly superior recording and video. I recommend it highly.

Riordan could have done much better.
B00006JJ2Y|5.0|I had the great pleasure of attending one of the Bottom Line shows in 1978. Having seen Lou in 1976, he seemed a lot more \\"with it\\" in 78. Albeit entirely wasted-- he had to be led to his mike, helped with his guitar, and forgot half the lyrics. But the backup band, the pot smoke, the Quaaludes, and Lou's everpresent leatherjacketed a-hole-ness made this a classic. In those days, audience members routinely shouted \\"You Suck!\\" at Lou, just to get him to rise up-- and he does, in this show.    I think it was booze and coke. Lou doesn't admit much though. You have to like this album because it is a candid slice of the punk era in a (then) dark part of NYC.

It becomes obvious by the end of the film, but the journey is pretty spectacular.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|I'm not going to go into a long descriptive paean to the film here; the visual side of the film is more than acceptable, as are the characters and the story. What I particularly enjoyed about the film is the way the individual characters interacted within the bounds of their extended family. Like most families, there are inherent tensions and conflicts - but there are also shared pasts, common interests, and a recognition of the ties that transcend the petty. It's knowing that there are people who will always have your back.<br /><br />When Kenji, the introverted college student and math prodigy is inveigled into posing as the fiance of his classmate Natsuki so that she can cope with the expectations of  her extended family, he has no idea what he is getting into. A classic nerd type with a part time job doing systems upkeep on the vast virtual reality of Oz and no experience with girls (let alone one as attractive as Natsuki), he is way over his head. When he meets her vast family at the palatial estate in the country, presided over by her clan's matriarch on the occasion of her upcoming 90th birthday, much comedy and many awkward moments ensue.<br /><br />While attempting to sleep the first night, a mysterious math puzzle arriving via his phone turns into an obsessive all-night effort to solve it. When he does,  his reward is not what he expects. He goes back to sleep, only to find on awakening that he's now wanted as a cyber criminal who appears to have hacked into Oz. In the ensuing confusion, Natsuki's ruse about his real identity is unmasked as well; a family member who is also a policeman hauls him off under arrest.<br /><br />But the havoc now being unleashed within Oz is manifesting in the real world, which has become dependent on the cyber world as a place to meet, shop and carry on much of its business. Disorder spreads, and Kenji is brought back to the estate because massive traffic jams have made travel impossible. Now as there as himself, he begins to start finding out what is happening - and begins to really interact with Natsuki's family, which is where the story begins to take off with a number of twists and surprises.<br /><br />Watching Kenji discover what he has been missing from his own life, watching him unfold and blossom as he begins to become involved with Natsuki's family is a joy, as is watching how he the outsider begins to remind the group of its own strengths and values, something that familiarity  can obscure. His interactions with the matriarch of the clan are especially pleasurable. She is one formidable old lady, and she sees more in him than he knows about himself.<br /><br />The battles within the virtual world of Oz, the conflicts outside - ultimately the story is about how functioning families are made up of people who see each other for who they really are, care for each other despite the pain that sometimes results, and come together to face their challenges as a family. (Even if they are not related by blood.)  One of the turning points in the movie is seeing the \\"On-line community\\" in Oz suddenly become a cyber-extended family.  In a virtual world it's still possible for all the things that make us human to manifest when needed.<br /><br />While there's plenty of action and suspense in the story, there's also a wealth of great character interaction on a very human level.  That's what makes this much more than just another anime film with some flashy visuals and some violent action.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Collapse into now is the greatest example how a band with the caliber of R.E.M. find themselves again and communicate their ideas in music and lyrics with the finest perfection ever! This record is BEYOND the expectation I had about it after Accelerate came out (an album that I really enjoyed to the point to travel to Mexico city just for a day for the last concert of their tour back in November, 2008). Where to start with this record? Songs like Discoverer, Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter and All the best could easily be made from the R.E.M. back in the mid or late 80's with a pinch of U2's careless way to come up with fun rock songs. On the other hand, Oh my heart and Uberlin are instant classic songs. Too hard to forget them in a year from now. I believe that a couple of songs here could have been cuts from Out of time (1991): Blue (aka Country feedback 2) and It happened today (met somewhere between Belong and Half a world away). The ballads here on the other hand are BEAUTIFUL!!! Walk it back and Everyday is yours to win are my rewards after waiting for over five years since the last greatest ballads they made: I'll take the rain (2001) and Leaving New York (2004). Mine smell like honey is the BEST single they released for an album since What's the frequency kenneth? (Monster, 1994)... this song has R.E.M. signatures all over the place and that's why I love it!!!<br /><br />We are in 2011 now and before I finish my review here I want to quote what Bono (U2) said back in 2000 when they were about to released \\"All that you can't leave behind\\", \\"it's interesting how all the boybands are taking over the music industry and the charts but now let's show them how MEN do it\\". Well, when Michael Stipe sings in the track All the best the line: \\"Let's show the kids how to do it fine, fine, fine\\" it seems to me that Stipe is backing up Bono's quote 11 years later and of course, he has a reason to do it. R.E.M. is releasing an album just after Radiohead's new album came out \\"The king of limbs\\" and Pj Harvey's \\"Let england shake\\"... for me it seems that these brilliant people are here to set the rules again in music.<br /><br />Buy this record if you want to listen to great music made by a great band.

0891419063|5.0|This harrowing account is by far the best I have read on the battle for Peleliu. I spent a lot of time on Peleliu when I was working as a diving instructor in Palau. Today, the jungles have overgrown the entire area that was burned and blown into a desolate landscape during the battle. From the top of China Wall, it is hard to find a viewpoint to see the areas where all the intense action was. However, all the artifacts remain. Planes, tanks, guns, live ammunition, and Japanese skeletons can still be found in the caves and undergrowth. Without a book like this, it would be impossible to fully imagine the horrors of battle that occurred in the now peaceful jungle.

After a good five minutes of listening to her new album i wanted to break the cd player and burn her cd. My ears felt like they would bleed from the wailing she was doing in most of her songs. I do not call that singing. This album lacked the depth that Rockferry had and her lyrics were kind of stupid. The melodies were everywhere and didn't really fit the vibe of the song. Huge let down from Duffy. The customers at my job hated it too, finally after so many complaints we were allowed to remove it from our music selection. My co-workers and i were thrilled. Purley for the fact that we were no longer being submitted to such torture.

B000002UAU|5.0|There are two schools of thought about this album. One, as exemplified by the fussy old Rolling Stone`s naming it the \\"best album of all time,\\" holds it as the absolute pinnacle of the Beatles' achievements, the ultimate album by the ultimate band. The other tends to dismiss the album as a bit contrived, and -- and this is always a difficult thing for any work to overcome -- as primarily the project of the pandering, lightweight McCartney rather than the uncompromising, \\"deep\\" Lennon. (Ah, the joys of stereotyping...) \\"Sgt. Pepper has its moments,\\" they'll say, \\"but Revolver / Abbey Road / Rubber Soul is really where it's at.\\" Some of this is just being contrary, a normal reaction to any work that has been greeted with the adoration Sgt. Pepper has received since essentially the moment it hit the streets back in 1967. Additionally, though, the album runs afoul of some longstanding rockist biases. It is most emphatically a studio construction, constructed with layer upon layer of overdubbing, impossible to even conceive of recreating live. With a certain school of music fans who find credibility only in epic live performances and extended improvised solos, Sgt. Pepper has an uphill struggle indeed. Certainly it never really \\"rocks\\" in a conventional sense, a marked contrast to the Beatles work from 1968 on, when they returned to a more straightforward, guitar-oriented style. But then \\"rocking\\" arguably wasn't what the Beatles did best as a band, and certainly no one would ever accuse them of being great live performers. Their art was conceptual rather than instinctive, the yin (in this as in so much else) to the Rolling Stones' yang. As their grandest conception of all, Sgt Pepper is their ultimate expression.    There is one dud here, McCartney's \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" which strains for the neoclassical pathos-in-austerity he'd found in \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" but discovers only bathos. Everything else is, however, almost uniformly stunning. I particularly love the second side of the album (beginning with \\"Within You, Without You\\" for you children of the CD era). Could any other band, ever, successfully jump from solemn Indian raga to classic English dance hall to... just what would you call \\"Lovely Rita,\\" anyway? Ah, well, hopefully you get the point. Far from merely dabbling, even from reviving forms of music one would never have expected to find on a \\"rock\\" album prior to Sgt Pepper, the Beatles are here inventing new genres of their own. My favorite track is \\"Good Morning, Good Morning.\\" Amazing production on this one, with the lead guitar lines dominating everything else with their delightful squeal, including the vocals, and that amazing cacophony of animal noise that ends the thing... and of course the famous chicken clucking that turns seamlessly into an electric guitar, long justifiably held up as perhaps the best single example of George Martin's production genius. This one needs to be played really, really loud, folks.    But Sgt Pepper is not so much about the individual songs as the experience of the whole, which adds up to be something almost overwhelming. I'm not sure there's anything here I love quite as much as \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" or \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" from the previous album, not to mention \\"I Will\\" from the one to follow. Yet if asked to play one album to demonstrate why the Beatles deserve all of the reverence they receive, this would be the one I'd choose.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|\\"Ultimate\\" sums this item up perfectly.    You get three versions of the film, each with commentary. These are featured on discs 1-3.  Disc four contains additional supplements. For me, one of the more interesting is the home movies  recorded by one of the extras. He captures George Romero setting up shots, and make-up artist Tom Savini  whipping up zombie effects.    Another great extra is a tour of the mall where the film was shot. Ken Foree, who played one of the SWAT team  members, leads a group of fans through various shooting locations.     The discs are housed in an attractive slipcase with minimal artwork. I highly recommend this item for any hardcore  zombie fan. You will not be disappointed.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Here it is. Your classic Anti Hollywood/reality TV show picture crowned with only a few of Hollywood's most AA lister's, newcomers and foreign child actors. Director Clint Eastwood has set into motion a raving Pro Con discussion about the acclaimed \\"success-failure\\" of his new movie \\"The Hereafter\\". Moviegoers will be surprised to be sitting out the 2 h 9min movie with mostly waiting on some action after the Grand Opening of a natural disaster scene.  Forcing the viewer to be intuitive rather then judgmental is the fact that half of the movie is being subtitled in English, while a French couple tries to mend their relationship after it had been traumatically shaken up on their vacation in Asia.  The 3 storylines that are running beautifully parallel to each other, subtle suggest that they will find their path to each other. Paris, London, San Francisco.  Matt Damon's character beautifully portrays a medium that due to his \\"curse\\", being able to talk to the dead, is unable to lead a real life or have any romantic relationship unless leaving his gift untouched, while at the other end of the world a young English boy is mourning the sudden death of his little twin brother.  No Mercy for reality TV lovers: If you are looking out for flat foul action you guaranteed to miss the subtle signs pointing gently to a suggested Higher Power that maybe after all might lead us humans together and connect all spirit. Whether you like the movie or not--It cant be denied that certain Life scenario's have in some form or another been present in your Life leaving the question open: \\"Can this after all be just coincidence?\\"  Eastwood and Damon's character won't give you the answer: You have to give it to yourself.  It's the beauty of this movie that it suggests a truth that might miraculously web through everyone's real life. If you only want to see what you want to see you will not even get a glimpse of the intention of this movie.    by Hendrik Helmer

1416955070|4.0|The book synopsis pretty well covers a great description of the book.  There is magic in the way of ruins and demons.  We have a small run in with vampires and werewolves show up too.  This book has a great combination of all the magical creatures and type.  We have growing relationships and ones that we fight for.  A book with a wonderful mixture of everything you could ask for.    I'm going to try something a little different with this review.  I'm going to share my thoughts and feelings as I was reading.    When I started the book I kept reminding myself to not think of the hype I've heard of this book, how everyone thinks they are amazing.  I asked myself why does everyone love this series so?  As I was reading through the first section of 147 pages, I thought there isn't anything that spectacular.  Good characters, good reading, I'm enjoying this demon hunting idea.  Then at the end of the first section I sat back with one word echoing in my mind, What?  Yeah, I had a feeling that was coming but I enjoyed the way Cassandra played it out.    So I dive into the second section.  This is where I start to realized I am enjoying the characters.  They are well written and the adventure and action picks up.  Oh, we have our demons, werewolves, and vampires; all part of the Downworlders.  The story is more of saving friends and finding that shadowhunter cup.  The creatures met on this story are ugly and great.  In this section I'm reading and thinking on Jace.  He's an okay character.  Then fifty pages later I realize I REALLY like his character.  I think to myself, When did this happen? How did the author take me to this point with this character?  He was okay before, but now he's great! Hm. I'm starting to be impressed.  Then the, oh no the werewolves goes to Oooohhhh, the werewolves...  I loved this twist.  The second section held several twists and turns for me, that I just were taken by.    Now, the third section.  I must say I can't stop reading the book at this point, but I have not realized it yet.  Oh the action.  The explaining!  I've learned so much about the story and the characters.  Then I flip the page and stop. I say, Wait! What! No. Nononono. My heart is pounding and it drops with the characters learning some information.  I look at the clock on the wall and realize it's midnight.  I have forty some pages left to finish the book.  I HAVE to keep reading.  But to finish will take at least an hour and I have to get up early in the morning to go to work.  Can I do it?  Can I get through tomorrow short on sleep? Hold up. When did I get that invested in this book?  When did it become unputdownable for me?  I'm loving it!    I ended the book all twisted around, backwards, and upside down with the twists and turns the author throw at me.   I found I loved the characters and enjoyed the paths the author took with the unexpected sharp turns she takes.    Really a wonderful read, and now I am WANTING the next book of the series!
B004I2K4E8|4.0|This is an amazing concert of Les Miserables.  The only complaint is the stunt casting of Nick Jonas.  He has a good enough voice but good doesn't hold up with the amazing voices of the rest of the cast.  He sounds weak in comparison and looks like it takes way too much effort to get the songs out. I wish they would have used a professional and then this concert would have been perfect!
0316069485|5.0|Like a fine wine, Connelly only gets better with time. As Grisham and Turow have slipped into mediocrity, Connelly and his protagonist Mickey Haller have vaulted into the lead of legal thrillers. He captures the drama like a courtroom voyeur. The famous LAPD Detective Harry Bosch is thrust into the action with his half brother. No one writes about the cop world like Connelly. He blends the two opposing worlds like only a great writer can. This could be his best.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|I know the title is a little mis-leading.  But those that really know Bruckner know exactly what I mean.    Bruckner's symphonies have been hampered by various conductors and musicologists editing these symphonies because of their duration or sometimes just musical taste.  Bruckner did not help the situation by creating different versions of the same symphony.  I am not going to bore you with a long dissertation on Bruckner's symphonies (I did that in college).  What is important to know is that the 2 most famous editions are the Haas and Novak versions.  The Haas editions are essentially hybrid versions where he went about to bring together the original versions with the revised ones.  His intent was to create a definitive version of each symphony for performance purposes.  Classic case in point is the 8th which is largely the revised version with passages from the original edited back in.    The Novak editions, however, restores each symphony and its various versions into their original state; an edition I personally prefer.    What does this mean here?  Karajan leans toward Haas for his recordings.  Superior recordings they are, BUT (generally speaking...err...writing) they are not the symphonies as Bruckner actually wrote them.  Since this was the only edition available to Karajan in his early years, it is understandable why he used them and would continue to do so.    For those who wish to hear Bruckner as he actually wrote his symphonies, one must seek out the sets my Eugen Jochum.  He recorded these symphonies a number of times; the Fifth he did about half-a-dozen times (give or take).  There are 2 complete versions of the numbered symphonies; a superlative account on DG with the Bavarian Radio and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras from the late-50s to the 60s and a 2nd on EMI with the Dresden Staatkapelle.  Check-out the reviews on Amazon for these recordings.    From a purely technical standpoint, none of the sets above are of his complete symphonies.  Bruckner wrote 2 others; the \\"Study\\" (#00) symphony and the Symphony #0 \\"Die Nullte\\".  Both are generally consider curiosities and not found in any of the major sets of complete symphonies.  I recently found 3 exceptions for the \\"Study\\" Symphony: Inbal/Frankfurt RSO on Teldec; Skrowaczewski/Saarbrucken RSO on Arte Nova; and Tintner (1917-1999)/Royal Scottish NO on Naxos.  There are 4 recordings of the \\"Die Nullte\\" that I am aware of; the Skrowaczewski and Tintner mentioned before plus Haitink/Concertgebouw on Philips and Barenboim/Chicago SO on DG.  The Haitink and Barenboim are, also, complete sets and are generally available individually.  I would opt for the single disc of the Study and Nullte and go with Jochum (or, if you prefer, Karajan) for the rest.    All current recordings of the 8th Symphony are of the revised or the Haas revised version.  There are two exceptions.  Inbal and Tintner made the only recordings of the original version of the 8th.  That version is longer and has definite textual differences.  This version is not as successful as the revised version, but it is a fascinating look at what was Bruckner's original vision.    For those that are not particular about which version to listen to, you cannot beat this set.  The performances are spectacular and virtually unrivalled.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|wahey!! Its finally stopped asking me if Im over 13!!     Watched this the other night, unsure of what to expect. Its a sort of futuristic retrospective, redolent of all the films others have mentioned, and also of Space 1999, and other Anderson-esque type offerings. Spacey is dull and emotionless at the best of times, making his work here as Gerty excellent casting! Rockwell is excellent as he has little to go on here, carrying the film by the strenght of his perfomance. The premise is realistic, although one couldnt imagine any corporation no matter how stingy, only manning the operation with one bloke, of course WE know why this is the case, but even so.... also the reaction of the characters to each other (trying not to give spoilers) is unusual, in the same situation, I would have spent the next 3 years WTF-ing and not so quickly fall into the rapid acceptance of their situation the characters do.     Plotwise, (SPOILER ALERT), my other main niggle would be the lack of explantion of the ilness suffered by Sam 1. It shows all the hallmarks of radiation sickness which would be a believable by-product of his activities on the moon, as exposure to solar radiation or even mining by-products could explain this. The Director alludes to a Bladerunner type limited lifespan,but this is a much more Deus-et-machina explantion than the former, in my view.. anyway..    Ok, you can open your eyes now, yes, excellent low budget, well put together work, feels almost like you could present it as a stage play, good score, holds the attention even though there is a lack of aliens, explosions, chase scenes etc. Go ahead and try it. Watch is with Silent Running or Dark Star and compare and contrast!!     K
B0010SKUYM|2.0|Good imagery (thus the star).<br />Meandering story with little discernable plot.<br />Hero is not likable or logical; same with most other characters.<br />I won't be buying the next installment.
0670022411|2.0|If a book is well written, engaging, and well paced, I can zip through it in a few days. It should tell you something that I have had this book for a month and can't manage to finish it. Every night I pick it up, read a page or two and then zzzzzz.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|After watching this film, the North Face jackets and coats have a whole new meaning.  Even in good weather this 1936 climb of the North Face of the Eiger is unbelievably difficult.  What follows when a team climber falls, is severely injured, and the weather goes to storm conditions is beyond what anyone of us would expect would be possible to survive.  The team breaks down as tragedy after tragedy develops. I kept wondering how the equipment and clothes protected them during those early climbs?  Even with the great equipment we have today the combination of climbing difficulty, injuries, and weather would have made it near impossible to survive this ordeal.  This film is a must see for all climbers and for those interested in climbing.  Its unforgettable and probably the best mountain climbing movie I've ever seen.
1591843790|5.0|I will happily read anything written by Guy Kawasaki and I have never once been disappointed.      Enchantment is a must read and I think goes well beyond the confines of being just business-oriented--anyone can learn from it!
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I've generally never considered myself to be a fan of horror films, so I didn't pay much attention to the zombie genre. Shaun of the Dead, that hilarious loving tribute to zombie movies and George Romero, got me interested. So did the brilliant 28 Days Later. So, from there, I watched Romero's newer stuff. Then his older stuff. And then I got hooked. Now I'm in to the zombie book genre. I'm a sociologist, so the zombie genre fascinates me because it's as much about the people and the collapse of society as it is about the zombies. You could argue that the zombies are just a backdrop for the human drama. So, I was really excited about The Walking Dead. I love zombie movies, but I was intrigued by the prospect of a TV series, in which the filmmakers have time to explore classic zombie genre issues and ideas more thoroughly.     I wasn't disappointed. It's a solid show. At times it felt a bit clichéd, and some of the subplots felt unnecessary or implausible. But the acting is generally strong, the effects are great, and I'm looking forward to the second season. For folks that want a wall-to-wall gorefest, it might be a bit disappointing. Some episodes are almost zombie-free. This show is really about the people. But that's ultimately a strength, and again providing evidence for my theory that the best zombie stories just use zombies as a backdrop for exploring what it means to be a human living among other humans.
B002ZG9774|5.0|This is likely the 100th review on this movie.  But at least I'm a honest viewer.  Predictable guilty pleasure?  Probably.  But the costumes and musical numbers are stellar, and the actors are worth the watch.  Christina Aguilera was quite good and if she can get her life straight should consider diving back into movies.  She has good comedic timing, is super hot and I dare say easily a better actress than Madonna. (I know that isnt saying much, but let's throw some perspective on this) This was her first try.      Overall this film is a fun romp and a nice get together at home with friends and beers flick    Christina----please continue to do movies!
1591843790|5.0|I thought it was strange that Guy would name is next business book Enchantment, but after reading the book, learning how to enchant your customers is a key skill. He talks about how to achieve likability and trustworthiness with your customers, your employees, your boss and perhaps your spouse! I especially enjoyed his specific advice on push and pull technology. Highly recommend that you read this book on your next long airplane flight!

1401223176|5.0|Wow! Some of the best artwork ever in a Batman book. Jim Lee is just unbelievable. This is one of the best recent Batman books. We get to see many of the rogue gallery and enjoy a great murder mystery. Lots of action sequences but plenty of detective work as well. I thoroughly enjoyed these books when they first came out and reading them again was an absolute joy. I just can't get over how great the art is. It will leave you breathless. Essential for the Batman fan.
0061801313|5.0|I am not really a reader at all, but I am totally addicted to these books. I started to watch the ABC Family series and I caught it on like episode 10, so I bought the books so I could figure out Allison's background. Now I am addicted and I will read one book a day! I am currently waiting for book #5 Wicked to come in the mail... and I cannot wait!!! I will be sad once I'm done reading them all.<br />The TV series is a little different from the book, but I actually like that, because it keeps the TV series twisting and turning!!
1401207529|5.0|This is where you need to start if you want to get into the modern era of Batman Comics. This was Batman's reboot after Crisis. A graphic novel doesn't get much better than this. The spotlight is equally shared with a young Jim Gordon. A lot of the ideas from this book were incorporated into Mask of the Phantasm and the Nolan Batman movies. Go out and buy it. Absolutely 100% essential for Batman fans.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|...literally! I added this to my netflix instant queue in hopes that I'd watch each part (there are 4) over the course of a week or so, but that was not the case! I started it a few hours ago and just had to finish it! I'm a sucker for period pieces and this does not disappoint! It's not your typical run of the mill \\"love story\\" and its so well made and beautiful. I love all things BBC and hope this review convinces some people to invest in it. After seeing it once I can for sure say that I will be buying this mini series!
B004MMEIK0|4.0|Short and simple.  I liked reading a paranormal romance with some humor it. Its a nice break from the harsh tragic lives that are the backstory to most paranormal romance hero and heroines books.    It was a could not put it down for most of the book.  Crazy vampires, vampire reporters, True Blood in Chocolate making the lady vamps fat and having to drink the Blood Lite version....Vampire sex toys....    The ending of the book was lame.  Everything just kind of ended and was left unresolved.  The heroine Shanna's family ended up being worse than the vamps but that was not written in a satisfactory way, when your Dad has abandoned you and you find out he is the reason for your lifes trauma, trust me when your grown you can definatley be mad at him....Someone sould have punched that man : )Roman the hero was Alpha but a lovable Alpha..
B004IJZFP4|5.0|This is the first time I have been inspired enough to write a review on Amazon. This has got to be one of the best reissue jobs I have ever heard. The sound is 5 star. The Nemperor/CBS CD always sounded like cr*p but this is spectacular. Bonus material is equally astounding. Thank you Greg Hampton and John Bolin. I salute you.
0452287022|4.0|I had this book on my shelf to read for a long time.  I liked Vermeer as an artist and was curious to read an imaging of the history behind one of his famous works.  This was a good book, it does a good job of transporting you back to that era and of giving you a glimpse into the life of Vermeer.<br /><br />The story focuses around Griet, who is a girl hired into Vermeer's household as a maid.  Things are tough for Griet at first and she misses her family.  Her love of color and presentation interest Vermeer and suddenly she finds herself being more than a maid, she is assisting Vermeer with his art supplies and his paints.  The household Griet has been shoved into is not a happy one; Vermeer's wife is constantly pregnant and exhaused, his mother difficult, and his children somewhat evil at times.<br /><br />Chevalier does an excellent job of painting beautiful pictures in the reader's mind.  She has created characters that are very human; they have human problems and lead somewhat normal lives.  These characters are seamlessly woven into to this historical setting making for a realistic story that's a bit fanciful at times.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about Griet's life and how Griet navigated the tensions in the household.  As a character Griet possessed a sort of grace that makes her endearing to the reader.  Vermeer is portrayed as somewhat mysterious, although the reader is given occasional glimpses into his character through Griet's eyes.<br /><br />This was an engaging read and an interesting look into what things may have been like in Vermeer's household.  I loved reading about how the paints were made.  The ending of the book is well done, with a surprising little twist of irony.<br /><br />Overall a decent read.  I enjoyed Chevalier's writing style and how she blended her fictional ideas seemlessly into this historical setting. Griet is a wonderful character that readers can't help but love and cheer for.  At points some of the things seem a bit fanciful, but that is part of what makes the book interesting.  The ironic twist at the end was wonderful too.interesting.  The ironic twist at the end was wonderful too.
0756404738|3.0|He is a good writer, you have to give him that.     He is not so good at writing _books_, though.     What I mean is, each chapter, each sentence, is very compelling. Overall, though, things are very muddy. A couple hundred pages into this book the narrator Kvothe says, \\"We have spent too long at the University.\\" This is really the author apologizing to his readers for spending way, way too long there. The book improves immeasurably when we leave the University, but unfortunately we return.     And, I can't help but fear that the next and final book will spend too long there as well. Ultimately, it's impossible to care what petty games Kvothe plays with Ambrose, and since we know there is only going to be one more book in the series, it seems that the much more interesting questions of the Chandrian, etc., will get short shrift.     This series should be called \\"Animal House with Wizards\\" or something like that.     Although he can craft a great sentence, he spends way too much time on trivial rivalries (this whole thing is building up to Kvothe killing Ambrose, right? Who cares!), and way too little time on the Amyr, Chandrian, current day woes, etc.
B004J713JW|5.0|Aside from the fact that I was at the Friday night concert (so excuse me for my biased opinion), I think that this was probably the most memorable concert that I've ever been to (to date).  It was full of energy and excitement and the star-studded special guests were fantastic.  The blu-ray provides the closest experience to actually having been in the crowd. I was at first upset that it took almost 3 years to be sold, however, they really did take their time and execute a fantastic product in sound and in picture quality (even though some will complain that it isn't in 1080p but rather only in 1080i).    But I digress. The main reason that I am posting this is to make you all aware that some stores are already carrying this item - and I don't mean illegally! I went to my local best buy today to purchase the CD/DVD combo - one of the sales associates told me that the blu ray was arriving today and she then went a step further and retrieved it from the truck! About 8 or 9 other fans, including myself, jumped on the copies as she struggled to carry the stack of discs from the receiving dock.    Anyway, don't wait - get this and get it on blu-ray for the closest experience to actually having been there.    I miss Shea and this concert will always be remembered by many as a grand 'ol farewell to the aging mecca.  (if only the mets had avoided a 2nd consecutive season-end collapse, i wonder what might have been for the playoffs and maybe world series. however, those are thoughts for another blog and another time!)
0061726826|4.0|Lena lives in a world where love is said to be a disease. They call it deliria.Lena counted the days until she could be cured and no longer susceptible to the disease. The government controls how people think, even though their control might be absolute. There are people who ran away before they were cured, they live in the Wilds. A place uncontrolled by the government. Lena is completely ready for her cure, until she contracts deliria and falls in love.<br /><br />This was certainly an interesting concept, that remind me quite a bit of 1984. There is definitely the air of oppression and a worry about a sort-of Thought Police. The only thing I didn't like was the pacing of this book. It wasn't really as fast-paced as I had thought it would be, more of a gentle flowing. So at times, although I was really interested, there just wasn't that much going on. I enjoyed how realistic that made the book seem, but it was just a bit too slow for such a long book. Other than the pacing however the novel progressed nicely, with enough action to not completely kill the story and not so much that there is no plot or relationship development. It was strange looking at friendship in a different life. Even relationships between family members were completely different after they had been \\"cured\\". It's weird to think that most of what strives us to other people is a simple feeling of love. In Lena's world family visits you out of priority, they no longer crave your attention and care. This book makes you think of a lot of things that you may take for granted every day, the simple freedom that you have even if your parents have some strict rules. The fact that music, and books and movies are all selected for you out of the many vast numbers that there used to be seems outrageous. The idea that listening to music, that doesn't have any sort of negative message, but isn't approved by the government is wrong, is illegal is mind-blowing. I loved Lena and how she is described as nun-like in the beginning of the story and then goes on to complete break out of her shell. I really loved that she was such a static character and it was totally believable that she would start to question some things, especially with growing up with the mother she had. Her mom was a great mother, and it's sad that they tortured her so much simply because she had a heart filled with love. It seems like such an outrageous thing to be punished for. It's not even that she loved the wrong people, it was the simple fact that she did love. I am certainly looking forward to the next novel in this series, for many reasons, none of which I can explain to you because they are spoiler-y. Trust me though, this was a very fascinating and delightful read, that I will not soon forget. I'm sure I will still be thinking about it when the second novel comes out and I can finally move on in Lena's story.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure.<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"Rainstorms are incredible: falling shards of glass, the air full of diamonds.\\"<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was sent this item to review.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|Sad yet involving film. Explores the important question, what matters most? How long we live isn't it. Subtle, beautiful performances. Highly recommend.
0545123275|2.0|The very beginning was good and then it got bad very quick.  So incredibly slow and boring.  Sam and Grace seemed to have the same voice and hard to tell who was speaking (unless you check the beginning of the chapter).  Very similar to Twilight but does not compare and I do not even like Twilight that much.  There was not much action either. Felt like I totally wasted some good hours reading this.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I originally saw them perform on PBS and fell in love with their sound.  Quality DVD that I listen to on a regualr basis.
B002K4MAA2|5.0|If you consider yourself a fan of the more serious zombie genre, then this movie is a must see.  I can't believe it is only released in the U.K.  However, you should note that you will have to burn one of your five region switches in on your player or drive if you want to play this movie because it is burned for a region 2 disk.  I would suggest either using a backup software to back up the movie and reauthor a new movie disk so that you don't waste all your region changes or invest in a region free player (they are cheap these days).
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|Like all their recent albums, \\"Collapse Into Now\\" is yet another ho-hum effort from a band that used to set the standard.  The main issue here-- that no one else seems to notice or admit-- is that Michael Stipe has lost his voice.  He simply cannot sing beyond low-register, low-octave chanting.  Yes, I've been around since Murmur, and I know the band started out with Michael's voice in the background on most songs.  Yes, that style has worked on some R.E.M. classics.  However, Michael used to vary that tone with songs that he sang loud and forcefully, and his voice evolved into one of the most recognizable, melodic voices in music.  Now, he can barely belt out an extended note.  Thanks goodness for Mike Mills in the background.  Honestly, this album confirms the fact that R.E.M. will never be the band they once were, regardless of the media hype surrounding this alleged return to the true R.E.M. sound.  All this album does is make me search the shelf for their albums from the late eighties and early nineties and enjoy past masterpieces.  But, hey-- if you like it, good for you.  Honestly, I'm not a hater-- if they made a polka album, I'd buy it.  I just can't listen to the same monotone vocals over and over and over and over and over.  If Peter Buck is smart, he'll join The Decemberists full time.
0545123283|5.0|Amazing book! Also, props to the sender because it came in the mail fast and in great condition!!<br />I am obsessed with this series!
B0043RGY60|5.0|\\"This is War\\" (Deluxe Edition) is an extremely fun and exciting cd to listen to. I just received this cd yesterday, and I first got a chance to listen to it last night (I enjoy this cd so much that I listened to it again this morning). I am extremely glad that I took a chance on getting this deluxe edition of \\"This is War\\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars. I say this especially because I took a chance with buying a ticket to their upcoming concert in April near where I live before actually receiving this cd (I bought a ticket on March 7th, and received \\"This is War\\" deluxe edition on March 8th). What this has to do with the greatness of this band (and obviously their music) is that I went to purchase tickets online, and noticed that many of the seats to this concert sold out so fast that only the ground seats are left (even after I slyly attempted to see if different seats available). I went ahead and purchased a ticket to the ground floor seating area of their concert because of the strong sense that their music is going to be good (once again, I took a leap of faith before having this cd in my hands). After listening to this cd, I feel lucky (and happy) that I went with the idea to purchase a ticket to their upcoming concert even before listening to \\"This is War\\". The following is a summary of the song and dvd summary to help you see why I enjoy listening to these tracks and my obvious excitement about attending their concert (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest rating).  Please understand that the summary is my own personal interpretation and humble opinions on each of the musical gems of \\"This is War\\" (Deluxe Edition) by Thirty Seconds to Mars. I am very understanding and open-minded to the fact that there are going to be different views and opinons on these songs in variation with the person hearing all of these songs.<br /><br />1. Escape (10 out of 10)- \\"Escape\\" is about letting your spirit roam free, living your life with as much freedom as you can allow, and turning over a new leaf in life.<br />2. Night of the Hunter (10 out of 10)- \\"Night of the Hunter\\" is a masterpiece musical creation about calmly embracing both light and darkness in one's life, and bringing together both for a powerful spiritual transformation. This song really resonated with me because it serves as a beautiful and healing reminder to transform all unexpected events and challenges into positive opportunities for increased wisdom and personal power. \\"Night of the Hunter\\" is a beautiful fusion of melodic drums, high-energy guitars, and a fantastic hybrid of rock and electronic music.  \\"Night of the Hunter\\" is my third favorite song after the tracks of \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and \\"Closer to the Edge\\".<br />3. Kings and Queens (10 out of 10)- \\"Kings and Queens\\" sends the message to always expect the best for your life and future.<br />4. This is War (9 out of 10)- \\"This is War\\" is a powerful musical track about always remaining emotionally strong, and standing up for your rights and what you personally believe in.<br />5. 100 Suns (8 out of 10)- \\"100 Suns\\" is about having self-confidence in yourself, and seeing your own personal greatness.<br />6. Hurricane: (9 out of 10)- \\"Hurricane\\" is about having the passion for life, and helping others to the best of your ability.<br />7. Closer to the Edge (10 out of 10)- \\"Closer to the Edge\\" is a very high-energy song, and is one of the musical tracks that helped convince me to get the cd.  I admit that I saw the video to this on tv, and I was convinced to hear more from this band when I picked up on the positive message of this video (follow your dreams and goals), and I noticed the passion and intensity coming from within the lead singer (Jared Leto) to deliver a meaningful and soul nourishing song.<br />8. Vox Populi (10 out of 10)- \\"Vox Populi\\" uses the term soldiers as a creative metaphor/concept to stand up for what you believe in, and follow your personal insights one may receive when they are called to action. In addition, \\"Vox Populi\\" contains good electronic music blended wonderfully with the lyrics and vocals of this song.<br />9. Search and Destroy (9 out of 10)- A catchy, uptempo, and energetic song about embracing change in your life, and to take whatever steps are needed to construct your life that is in alignment with your own personal happiness.<br />10. Alibi (10 out of 10)- \\"Alibi\\" is about pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, and picking yourself back up regardless of how many times you may have to do so. \\"Alibi\\" is also a great quiet type of song that has a gorgeous blend of drums,piano, and guitar. In addition, this musical track is about embracing life with the energy of creative fire in your being.<br />11. Stranger in a Strange Land (10 out of 10)- \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is a great musical track about the very daring acts that someone would carry through when influenced by the emotions of whatever they are feeling about the person in question. I admit that \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is one of my favorite songs in this compilation.<br />12. L490 (7 out of 10)- I gave this a rating of at least 7 because the chanting in \\"L490\\" was harmoniously synchronized, but was minimal on music and words.<br />13. Bonus Track of \\"Hurricane\\" featuring Kanye West (9 out of 10)- This version also sends a beautiful message about loving life, helping out your fellow man, and making the best of your life. I feel that this musical collaboration between Jared Leto and Kanye West was very creative, and great to listen to.<br />14. Bonus Track of \\"Stronger\\" (a BBC live version that I rate 10 out of 10)- I really enjoyed Jared Leto's take on \\"Stronger\\". He really makes it his own by making it natural and believable when he sings about seducing the person he desires.<br />15. Bonus Track of \\"Bad Romance\\" (another BBC live version that I enthusiastically rate 10 out of 10)- Jared takes this musical masterpiece and skillfully makes it how own as well. He does a really excellent job of sounding extremely persuasive when he sings about wanting the person he desires, and doing it very admirably (again he sounds very seductive in this song, and the seduction side of him really shines in his version of \\"Bad Romance\\")<br /><br />  The dvd version has really good musical videos to \\"Closer to the Edge\\", \\"Kings and Queens\\", and the making of the \\"Kings and Queens\\" video (very exciting and interesting to watch). I say this because Jared demonstrates an abundance of passion and creativity in having everything turn out harmoniously, and it clearly shows when you watch in him action during the making of the video. The fact that he also showed an appreciation for the many fans that showed up to be a part of this was also very touching.<br /><br />  I strongly endorse purchasing \\"This is War\\" (deluxe edition) if you enjoy rock, pop, and/or electronic music.  This deluxe version of \\"This is War\\" is well worth purchasing, and I very much look forward to going to their concert in April.\\"Vox Populi\\" contains good electronic music blended wonderfully with the lyrics and vocals of this song.  9.

B002MT3CIY|5.0|Pink Floyd can do no wrong in my eyes. This is a great DVD for those who never had the pleasure of one of their concerts. I was lucky enough to see them several times and was newver disappointed. I highly recommend this, especially for those who have never seen them live.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Perfection! Absolute perfection. This book is the literary equivalent of macaroni & cheese, total comfort food for the soul. I bought this novel on sale at a local bookstore, read it in a day and then started over again the next day. The epistolary style makes it difficult to follow initially, but pretty soon you know the characters without so much as reading the signature. They all have their own quirks and mannerisms that makes them as recognizable as an old friend.<br /><br />One particularly rough day while traveling, I found myself downloading it on my Kindle. I just wanted to catch up with my old friends. In total, I've read the book five times in a year, finding a new reason to love it each time. It has all the hallmarks of a classic - an original story, heartwarming characters, a natural arc, and even an educational component. The novel takes place on the occupied island of Guernsey during World War II. Even with the Nazi occupation, I found myself wanted to pack up and head to Guernsey!<br /><br />The book's leading character Juliet Ashton is a feisty, self-assured and intellectually curious writer who could have stepped fresh off the pages of a Jane Austen novel. I wanted to be her best friend! As Juliet is drawn into the world of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, a book club that serves as an alibi to protect neighbors from German harassment and arrest, she meets all the quirky, original, strong-willed members of the club -literature lovers, farmers, fisherman, market sellers, even the disapproving Adelaide who judges all of them. As Juliet meets and falls in loves with the members, so do we.<br /><br />It's the hardest book to articulate, but read it... and read it again. I hope it takes its rightful place amongst literature's modern day classic.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I have always been a huge Sherlock Holmes fan and was excited when the movie came out. I was not disappointed, lots of action, humor, good cast, a very good movie. Highly recommend it!
0307474275|4.0|Dan Brown masters the art of suspense, thriller, and twist with The Da Vinci Code. However, I feel as though he did it a bit too much and ended up sacrificing the overall quality of the book. Throughout it, Dan Brown will have a plot unfold and abruptly end the chapter right at the climax. While I'll admit that this makes me want to read much more, it's also annoying to the reader. I also feel as though Brown did a better job with creating romantic tension between Langdon and Sophie than he did with Langdon and Vittoria in Angels in Demons. Dan Brown also did a better job with researching historical facts that help point Langdon to the answers than he did in Angels in Demons. While Brown did use his knowledge of history and art to masterfully create an excellent mystery, he sometimes will lecture the reader on history that seems to be completely irrelevant to the story. The Da Vinci Code is a great read that will encapsulate the reader and keep them sucked into the story until its end.
B003Y5H4SY|3.0|For entertainment purposes Devil is a solid movie. It does a good job of drawing you in and keeping you interested. Where the movie lacks is character development and plot. The plot is rather simple and easy to follow. It's hard to like or dislike any of the characters because we never really learn much about any of them. The revelation towards the end made things interesting and had me looking forward to how the movie would end, which was a good ending in my opinion. For me personally, I'm gonna buy this because it's a solid Shyamalan movie. For most though I would recommend renting it first, as I did.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was Sparks at his best. It just makes you want to move to NC to see if there really are men like his characters in real life. I hope someone makes this one into a movie too, it would be a must see !!
1906735875|4.0|All I knew of Judge Dredd was that movie with Rob Schneider and some big dude with muscles whose name escapes me.  Give me a minute.....naw, I can't rememebr.  So I wanted to know the real story and I figured what better way than to start at the beginning.  This collection is exactly that - the birth of Judge Dredd.    The short story format is easy to digest and makes the book a fabulous bathroom companion.  It is a bit dated, being born of the 70's, but you get past that quick enough.  There is some silliness and levity but it's all good fun.  The film was a bit gloomy but the comic does not share that trait.    My rating has to be positive because the product is very much as it claims to be- the first several appearances of Dredd in all their glory.  There are a few places where the transfer quality drops a bit but it never impedes the ability to read and enjoy the story.    If you are a Dredd-o-phile then you already have this book. If you are a Dredd virgin wanting to know what it's all about, buy it.  It's a BIG book so you'll get plenty for your money.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Let me just say I've been a huge My Chemical Romance fan since their underground stuff. I've loved them so much up until \\"Danger Days\\". I'm sorry, this might offend other MCR fans, but... \\"Danger Days\\" was a disappointment. And \\"The Black Parade\\" wasn't such a great album either. I still consider myself a fan because of my love for their old stuff, but not so much anymore. \\"Bullets\\" is an excellent album in my opinion. It seems to be that in this album there is a lot more feeling and poetry to the songs than others. I think the reason why it's so emotional and from the heart is because at that time Gerard was going through a really hard time and the lyrics just flowed directly from his heart to the paper. There's a lot of screaming involved, but that's how they started. If you can't accept their first album how can you call yourself a fan? I know, I may sound like a hypocrite because of me not liking \\"Parade\\" and \\"Danger Days\\", but hey, that's me. I'm sure there are a lot of MCR fans who like the new stuff. I'm just saying that now they've become more poppy and I don't fancy that much. I guess what I'm trying to say is their first album was brilliant in many ways. I still adore Gerard, Mikey, Bob and Ray with everything in me, though, nothing can change that.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Even though I am not a cinema buff, I can tell you this: this movie is perfection, right from the start, in every detail. Starting with the setting, black, white and with shades of gray, to the \\"Ballerina\\" nailpolish right next to her makeup, to the colours of the city - strangely enough, you never see the sun, it´s always grey in NYC. And the final credits, oh, the credits! No funny scenes, no cute pictures: it just lays to you what you have just seen - and, having seen the ballet or not, it will surprise you.    I cannot say much besides it - my command of the English language fades in the face of this movie -, but it is a movie worth seing once, twice, as many times as you wish. The first time it randed me catatonic in a movie theather seat in Sao Paulo; second time, reduced me to tears in the end, back in my hometown.    Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis and Vicent Cassel are the main part of a wonderful casting, and they will keep you on the tip of your toes until the final scene.    As the ballet that provides the background for the movie, this is a classic.
B00114MCAU|5.0|The Jungle Book is one hour and one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 18, 1967. This would be the last movie that Walt Disney personally oversaw. Basically the movie tells the story about a boy, Mowgli, who is raised by wolves in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is ten years later and the tribe of wolves feels that the man cub must be sent to the human village because Shere Khan, a tiger, has return and they feel that they cannot protect the boy. Bagheera, a black leopard, offers to take the boy cub to the man village and that where the adventure begins. Mowgli does not want to live in the man village and wants to stay in the jungle.    Bagheera tries to explain to Mowgli, but he does not listen. Mowgli finds several different animals who would like to get closer to him for different reasons. Mowgli first meet Kaa, a giant Indian Python, and Kaa wants nothing more then to eat the child. Kaa fails in the two attempts when he is with the boy. Next he is met by Baloo, a sloth bear, and Baloo is a care free, fun loving bear who lives one day at a time. Baloo immediately takes a liking to Mowgli and wants to raise him a bear also. Later on in the movie Bagheera informs Baloo the truth as to why he can't raise him because of Shere Khan. While Mowgli and Baloo are enjoying life, Mowgli is kidnapped by a group of orangutans and is brought back to their leader - King Louie. King Louie wants the boy cub to teach on how to acquire the red flower (fire). King Louie plans are crushed when Baloo and Bagheera comes to rescue Mowgli. It is about  into the movie that the main villain appears - Shere Khan. Shere Khan wants to kill the boy because he hates man and that includes women also. I will not go into how the story ends because of the criticism I have gotten in the past, but I will tell you that the movie had no ended and it was Walt Disney himself that came up with the ended himself.    The movie version of the Jungle Book differs greatly from the book version. In the book version there is no King Louie no vultures and the only resemblance to the book is the names used in the movie. Walt thought the book was too dark for children and instructed his animation department not to read the book. The Jungle Book was nominate for an Academy Award in 1967 for Best Song, The Bare Necessities, but lost out to Doctor Dolittle for Talk to the Animals. Gregory Peck tried to get the movie nominated and win for the Best Picture category, but the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science felt that animation films did not belong in that category. It would not be until 1992 when Beauty and the Beast would be nominated for an Academy in the Best Picture category. The Jungle Book is a delightful movie for all ages and gets an AAAAA+++++.

1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki's new book Enchantment is already a best seller, and it's very good - typical Kawasaki in its wit, irreverence and relevance. And it's really all about communication!<br /><br />Example chapters:<br /><br />  * How to Achieve Likability<br />  * How to Achieve Trustworthiness<br />  * How to Prepare - and much more.<br /><br />The Kirkus Review is a publishing world power that rarely gives great reviews - so these comments should motivate you to go out and get it:<br /><br />\\"The entrepreneur's entrepreneur is back with his ninth book, this time tackling the tricky art of influence and persuasion. Kawasaki (Reality Check: The Irreverent Guide to Outsmarting, Outmanaging and Outmarketing Your Competition, 2011, etc.) transforms the otherwise exhausted and overwrought tropes of how to win friends and influence people with a complete makeover here, whether he's talking about wardrobe choice or tips for effective swearing. The author, a modern-day Dale Carnegie, offers explanations on how to wield the most influence in the digital age: Push Technologies like presentations, e-mails and Twitter are discussed as active means of enchanting others, while Pull Technologies like Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn passively draw them in. The author's suggestions for achieving likeability and trustworthiness, as well as overcoming resistance, are thoroughly explained and can easily translate from the workplace to the real world. Kawasaki makes good use of subheads and bullet points, rendering information in a searchable format. He ends each chapter with an anecdote that illuminates the effectiveness of his techniques-while it's not original, it's effective. The author's trademark light and airy style is on display, but it's his humor and empathy that makes the heavy use of BusinessSpeak and buzzwords more easily palatable.<br />Informative, concise guide from one of America's most influential and, yes, enchanting entrepreneurs.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|It is always nice to see a show you can relate too. With this I can see how the charitors are drawn together from a past relationship and a trust of sorts. The poor student is a noise maker without abuility to back it up. As seen in all the hospital footage. It seems there are three good gags in each episode, even if they tend to be along the macabre tones.
0393307050|5.0|The Master and commander series is a wonderful friend to have at hand.  I have read them all several times, and each time I find something I didn't notice.  I have a tendancy to want action but realized that in between action and adventure themes there is also some excellent writing including romance, humor and history.  I have had these books for several years and having read them all several times I still continue to pull them out and start over again.  I love to read and these books are only a small part of the reading I do, but I would have to say that I have never been disapointed reading them again.  To get the full effect all of the series should be read in order of their writing.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I had heard of Craig Ferguson but since I don't watch late night TV, I didn't know anything about him. I happened to catch \\"A Wee Bit O' Revolution\\" and laughed my butt off, even though I didn't understand some of the inside jokes. When I saw the autobiography for Kindle, I thought, \\"what the heck!\\" His life journey to get to America is facinating and, to me, reminicient of what I know of my great-grandmother's emmigration here in the early 1900's (OK, except for the substance abuse). Reading the book explains many of the little inside jokes from the \\"Late, Late Show\\" and that makes it even funnier. It does have a serious side which should not be diminished, but it all ties together quite well. Here's someone you can look at and honestly say, \\"good for you! Just keep on keepin' on.....\\"  The Kindle version is good: no gaps in the text, no obvious spelling mistakes and no pictures that only come thru in greyscale. Very easy to read in Kindle format and definitely worth re-reading.

B002BJGYU8|3.0|It arrived promptly, which I appreciated. But one of the disks I couldn't get to play, which was obviously a disappointment.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|I watched this movie after seeing Natalie Portman in Black Swan, I didn't expect to like it because I'm not a big science fiction fan, but I thought it was hugely entertaining. Natalie Portman was really great in a role of a young woman who gets caught up in events much bigger than she ever imagined, and who goes through a grueling personal journey of discovery. I think she's the best actress of her generation. And the V character is very engaging despite not ever seeing his face. I don't know the actor but he did a very compelling job.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|A blossoming poet underneath it all.<br /><br />I have been anticipating this CD ever since I found out she had a new release in the works. I figured this would be an amazing album based on the fact that she got divorced last year and artists usually churn out masterpieces when going through an emotional spiral, such as a break up and divorce (Nick Lachey, Pink, Britney Spears, etc). It is clear Avril has channeled some very personal thoughts, moments that remain in the mind and the subconscious. She transcends this onto the pages of where she writes her lyrics, to having them leap off the pages as more then just mere words.<br /><br />The entire album has a very somber tone to it and the ballads are where she really shines (Plenty of rock ballads on this album). I understand the vision of `Goodbye Lullaby'. However, there were a few songs that I didn't care for including the first single. I believe she released `What the Hell' because it's upbeat, radio-friendly, and probably ordered to do so by her record label. The album starts off with `Black Star' and it immediately sets the tone of the album and the upcoming tracks, but it is completely thrown off by the second song, `What the Hell'. But `Black Star' is really an interlude and not an entire song. It only last for ninety-seconds. Once I got to track four, the album really flowed and had a natural flow to it. The album overall is very cohesive. She has a few obnoxious songs and those are the ones where she is trying way to hard to be an eighteen-year-old-punk rock-leather-gurl. I didn't care for any of those tracks and I am a huge fan of up-tempo songs.<br /><br />There is also a song on the album called, `Everybody Hurts' and I thought this would be a remake of the famous REM song, but it wasn't. When the song reaches the chorus part, it reminded me a lot of the Lisa Loeb song, `I Do'. I also wanted to mention that Avril is a true poet. That budding poet is hiding underneath all these songs. Yes, there are tons of clich&eacute;s on this album and many of the tracks are filled with them. I even found myself being able to guess the word in the upcoming lines before she even sang it. For example: She would sing something like, \\"If you were mine. Then why did you say goodbye?\\" She has two words both ending with an E which gives it a lyrical touch, a small sense of rhyme, and alliteration with repetition. For the most part, it works. It didn't bother me that much and she truly does have a unique voice that is all her own.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this album. It is very personal, sacred, and the standout tracks are: 1, 4, 6 - 13.lbum and many of the tracks are filled with them.

0307454541|5.0|With over 2500 reviews, I will make this short and sweet. With hyped up books, one never really knows what they are going to open up to. I see that this one lives up to the hype. It's great. You may or may not make your buying decision based on what I have written but just know that I am yet another satisfied reader.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I like this, but I use it for a pager at work. I didn't get it for the actual headset it's made for. I tried to fit another model in it. It sits close to the body, and it's an excellent option for the headsets it fits because it's easier to access than a pant pocket, and it's more protective.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This was a wonderful light watch that I lost and have been depressed about ever since, especially since the price has ballooned to over $100. It ran a tiny bit fast, but was pretty acurate for an automatic. Although well made, I don't think this watch could take much of a beating meaning not for work in the trades. The band was a bit flimsey, but easily upgradable. I'd keep an eye on it for the price to drop again.
B000066744|5.0|One of the best 'Family Movies\\" WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE. Very clever take on a child born on a cruise ship,and traveled around the world, never leaving the ship. He had no \\"papers\\" and was fated to travel on board.    He was known as \\"1900\\" and became a piano phenom.!!  Wonderful music and enchanting story.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|this album is so good, it is so different than her three previous albums especially \\" The Best Thing \\" which as much as I liked it, I was kinda disappointed in Avril. GOODBYE LULLABY is such a goodbye lullaby. once you listen to this new thing you're gonna understand what I mean. this is so much like her second album \\" Under My Skin \\". the skill she has, the talent and the way she plays with words, you couldn't find that in her last album \\" The Best Damn Thing \\". the album has some amazing songs. you are definitely gonna forget all about \\" What The Hell \\". that's not her best song. you are gonna fall in love with her again, you are gonna feel the words, and you are gonna see how hard she has worked and what she's put in this album!   so .... enjoy it guys... you're gonna love it!!! especially if you've been a fan since day one!!! yay!!! way to go avril!!! <3<3<3<3
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was so impressed with this series when I was visiting my daughter in New Orleans. When I returned to Mexico I actually had to buy a new DVD player that would accept CD´s from the states in order to buy a set for me, that´s how much I loved it. It shows the earth like no other video that I´ve ever seen!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|What to say about Season 3 without giving away important plot points? Well... Walt and Skyler's marriage is in trouble, Hank's search for the elusive Heizenburg draws ever closer, Walt and Jesse's setup changes, and there is a hell of lot that Walt and Jesse do that you would never have thought they would have done having seen Season 1 and 2.<br /><br />I thought the series started off slowly with the early episodes focusing of Walt and Skyler a bit melodramatic, like soap opera schtick. Then the aftermath of the ending of Season 2 and how the town deals with it was a bit overblown as well. But then the series picks up as Walt and Jesse's chickens come home to roost. A couple of badass Mexican assassins are coming to town and it's these guys combined with Walt's benefactor and Hank that really helps the series find 5th gear midway through the series. I watched maybe four episodes in one go and it blew me away, best movie I've seen all year!<br /><br />In the aftermath of the carnage that happens mid season, things develop even more interestingly for Walt as the situation he finds himself in starts to slowly turn on him. It's always been the case that Walt and Jesse's good things often go bad quickly and it's the case here - only for them it causes them to act more desperately than ever before. And the ending? Everything leading up to it made me wonder how Walt and Jesse were going to survive going head to head with the cartels but this was one hell of an unexpected, gutsy ending.<br /><br />The writing throughout is utterly brilliant, full credit to Vince Gilligan and his team for knocking it out of the park even in the less explosive episodes (of which there are maybe 4 out of the 13). It's always witty, clever, and the twists and turns always imaginative and unexpected. Fantastic, wonderful writing, maybe the best seen on TV since \\"The Wire\\".<br /><br />And the acting - well, both Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul earned Emmys for their performances in this series and let me say that they both deserved it. Aaron Paul's work in Series 2 was enough for the trophy but he was finally recognised with his work in Series 3. Gilligan and co. give him some excellent speeches to make, especially when Jesse is physically impaired in some of the middle episodes, and Jesse's character becomes more and more interesting with each passing show.<br /><br />And Bryan Cranston, man this guy can do it all can't he? Walter White goes to some dark places in this series and at every step Cranston is able to make you watch him in every scene without having you take your eyes off of him - he is an actor who takes a scene and turns it into an acting masterclass. Despite all of the darkness in this series there are moments of levity that are really funny because Cranston and Paul have this excellent chemistry (pun intended) and great timing.<br /><br />Dean Norris who plays Hank the DEA brother in law also knocks it out of the park. His character is given some very difficult and some very human situations and Norris is completely believable throughout. I always liked Hank up to this point but now he becomes more than the loud mouthed indestructible wall of confidence he's been up to now and develops further. Excellent work as well from Anna Gunn, Bob Odenkirk (the deliciously seedy lawyer), and the two \\"baddies\\" Giancarlo Esposito (who brings an intensity to every scene like you won't believe - you watch his face during his scenes and that work alone deserves an Emmy) and Jonathan Banks, the badder than badass enforcer.<br /><br />If you're reading this then you're a fan and wondering if Season 3 holds up to Season 1 and 2 - well let me assure you it does. I would say as a whole it's not as perfect as Season 2 was, but there's too much outstanding work in Season 3 to say it's nothing short of an excellent continuation of the best TV series at the moment. It's too watchable, and though it started slow (for me), once it got going, it got going GOOD, and though I tried to space it out with 1 episode a night, I ended up watching the last 8 in 2 sittings. This is the best TV show out there and puts to shame most everything else that calls itself \\"drama\\". Cannot wait for Season 4. Go go Walt and Jesse!t, I ended up watching the last 8 in 2 sittings. This is the best TV show out there and puts to shame most everything else that calls itself \\"drama\\".

B000JJS8TM|3.0|I adore the Beatles and I adored seeing this show live here in Vegas. I'm also an audiophile with an amazing stereo system and a discerning ear. After listening to this DVD-Audio I was both impressed and let down. Opening track, \\"Because,\\" shines bright and the vocals sound great, but this disc is overwhelmed with poor recordings and poor mastering. At times the highs are so abrasive you're compelled to turn the volume down and the imaging leaves a lot to be desired.
B003I4HI1Y|5.0|What to say about Season 3 without giving away important plot points? Well... Walt and Skyler's marriage is in trouble, Hank's search for the elusive Heizenburg draws ever closer, Walt and Jesse's setup changes, and there is a hell of lot that Walt and Jesse do that you would never have thought they would have done having seen Season 1 and 2.<br /><br />I thought the series started off slowly with the early episodes focusing of Walt and Skyler a bit melodramatic, like soap opera schtick. Then the aftermath of the ending of Season 2 and how the town deals with it was a bit overblown as well. But then the series picks up as Walt and Jesse's chickens come home to roost. A couple of badass Mexican assassins are coming to town and it's these guys combined with Walt's benefactor and Hank that really helps the series find 5th gear midway through the series.

B003Y7L5W8|1.0|OMD once wrote a lyric, \\"science is never wrong, gravity never fails.\\"  Yes when science is done with data driven analysis is it is never wrong, but now OMD writes with lyrics that glorify ignorant superstition, \\"set your mind and spirit free.\\"  There is no self initiating force in the universe, much less the brain.  There is no spirit inside us anywhere.  We don't have minds.  We have brains and bodies.  We behave!  Based on our experiences and the consequences of every experience we behave AND the cumulative effect of natural selection determines behavior, behavior becomes more or less likely in the future.  That is science.  The miseducation of BS shovelled down the throats of people who have no understanding of the science of human behavior by people that have no undertstanding of human behavior is superstition.  Superstition leads to right wing propaganda and lie after lie of religious controls and mentalistic controls that lead to systems of education. justice, social interaction, health, etc... that all fail because complete stupidity is perpetuated without dire consequences.  The consequences suck! Listening to OMD reject science for BS and spew the same ignorance spouted by every human conditioned to reject conditioning perpetuating problems that are ruining any chance to live long and prosper is just sad and the music is boring.  This production is a tragedy from melody to message.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I read a review of this book and was immediately interested. The book lived up to my expectations and more. Thankfully all the questions are not resolved through many pages of delightful reading. I'm looking forward to spending more time with Diana and Matthew in the future.<br /><br />I see via the tags that there is some concern over the price. I did agonize over the cost, but in this case due to the newness of the book and no paperback available made a very rare exception. I still object to the publisher's agency model approach to limit retailer's ability to discount ebooks as they can with paper books. However, I'm glad I made a *rare* exception for this amazing new author.
B003EMFC04|5.0|I'm always uncomfortable reviewing items that have hundreds of reviews. That said, here are my impressions.<br /><br />I've read all of the Holmes \\"canon\\" so that no doubt colors my opinions. I always identified with Watson (which I think was Doyle's intent) so I am positively disposed toward any adaptation that depicts Watson as more than a buffoon a la Nigel Bruce. This film really delivers on this front. Watson really holds his own against Holmes here. Holmes and Watson are tailor made for a \\"buddy\\" movie and this film really shows that.<br /><br />The movie is almost perfectly cast. Downey and Law are superb, but Rachel McAdams, Kelly Reilly, and Eddie Marsan are terrific also. Mark Strong is perfectly adequate but was somewhat overshadowed by the mysterious (and uncredited) Moriarty.<br /><br />The plot was fine, with action sequences that were well choreographed without being over the top. But it isn't all action. Holmes' deductive powers are amply tested. The DVD came with a comic book/storyboard that was used to sell the project. I can only be grateful that the story was changed to rationalize the supernatural elements. Sherlock Holmes is not a vampire hunter, exorcist, etc.<br /><br />Summing up I really enjoyed this film and am pleased a sequel is in the works. Sherlock Holmes is one of the enduring supermen of English literature. He is treated with the appropriate respect here. Highly recommended.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|It might be presumptuous of me, but Peter Buck has always struck me as the kind of guy I could have a beer with and talk for hours about music and whatever else. Over the last, say, two decades or so, he's gotten into a habit of touting the latest R.E.M. release as \\"our best one yet\\"-- although even he knew to hold his tongue when Around The Sun was released. A few weeks ago, I read an interview with Peter where he talked about driving home after the Nashville sessions, listening to the finished mixes of Collapse Into Now, and thinking to himself: \\"song for song, this is our best album yet.\\"     Well, it isn't, but Peter's enthusiasm is not entirely without foundation. (In my opinion, anyway.) I didn't care much for Accelerate, and especially disliked Around The Sun, but this album strikes me as the most effortless and fun recording R.E.M. has released in a while, for once largely avoiding the ponderous quality that has begun sneaking into their music around 1998. I instantly enjoyed Discoverer, Uberlin, That Someone Is You, Oh My Heart, and Walk It Back. Heck, I even enjoy the unabashed cheesiness of Every Day Is Yours To Win. So sue me. There's not one song I really dislike, in fact, although the closing number Blue seems like a hasty shotgun marriage between Country Feedback and E-Bow The Letter, and is to my ears not as successful as the band probably thinks it is.     Finally, I briefly want to address the mastering engineer for this project, a vulgar audio criminal who calls himself Stephen Marcussen. Listen to me, dude: when the Loudness Wars are over, and you're put on trial for your atrocities, for your ruthless limiting and for your utter lack of subtlety with dynamics,  and when they finally sentence you to the (musical) chair, I will be there to laugh in your face. There's no excuse for an album from a major band to sound like THIS. Go back and listen to Automatic To The People (which you also mastered before the insanity took over) and try to remember what an R.E.M. album is supposed to sound like. (Maybe some of the blame lies with Jacknife Lee for his mixing job, I don't know.) I can only hope that R.E.M. fans find a way to enjoy this recording despite your mastering. Alright, I'm done venting. I'm off to ruin somebody's day now...
B0041KKYBA|5.0|For those still wondering how it happened... This DVD makes it clear what deregulation did & has done to the USA & other countries. This is neither complex nor over the head of the average American. There should be long prison sentences handed out to the malefactors.  We need tight regulation of the entire financial sector... As well those in academia who consult, for fat fees, to the financial sector. The DVD clearly shows what greed, corruption & lack of ethics and/or a moral center can do.
1591843790|5.0|The 10th book by Guy Kawasaki, and he's done it again. We use enchantment (as he explains it) in our social communications to create long-term relationships -- whether with other people or with a brand. Read it and then read it again with a highlighter.
B000021XR5|5.0|STP made a masterpiece with their No. 4 album. Generally all the reviews of this album are mixed, but I love it. They are one of my favorite bands and always will be. It comes in second place only to Purple being the best. Yes, Purple and No. 4 are my favs. I think it is much better than Tiny Music. All the songs go together nicely, and tells sort of a story. With eleven tracks, it is a tight LP, and nothing is filler. Stand-outs are \\"Heaven & Hotrods,\\" \\"No Way Out,\\" and the epic \\"Atlanta.\\" But all the numbers on here are fine, and STP created a solid album here. It's just too bad that they don't play much from No. 4 live...
1591843790|4.0|Guy Kawasaki's Enchantment is like an updated version of Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People.  In less than 12 Chapters and 200 pages, you will learn how to make your customers fall in love with you.<br /><br />If you don't have a lot of time to read the latest business books, Enchantment will be a great turbo lesson in persuasion, how people choose, social media and marketing.  Kawasaki's bibliography includes 20 of the most popular and authoritative books on the subject.  I'd read about half of the books in the bibliography and found that Kawasaki did a great job of integrating the information in a usable, practical and easy to understand format.<br /><br />In addition to practical how-to advice and examples there are also sidebars and callouts that contain personal stories from everyday people who responded to a request that Guy made for people to provide their own personal examples of enchantment.<br /><br />If you're already a fan of Guy Kawasaki's you won't be surprised to see that there are all kinds of pictures that he included throughout the book.  Many of them look like they come from his own camera of iPhone.<br />Everything about the book speaks to enchantment as it can occur if we would only let it.  Instead of some overly designed web site, you can experience the book Enchantment via it's Facebook Fan Page.  It's an extension of the book where readers, reviewers and fans post pictures, examples and stories.  So while you can read the book, you can experience the daily evolution of its principles in practice.<br /><br />My favorite chapter is actually \\"How to Use Pull Technology\\".  In it, you will find a super easy and practical primer on how to integrate all the social media tools that you have into a cohesive purpose and campaign.<br />This is really a great book if you're looking for a summary and an integration of a lot of more intense and academic books.  I'd recommend it to any business owner, sales and marketing person or Guy Kawasaki fan.
0439023521|4.0|I think that this was a very interesting book for many reasons.  It was in a setting in the future but had a strange divided government that you would think to hear about in the past.  Just the concept of the hunger games was interesting; they punish the whole nation every year for something that was done nearly eighty years back!       The story of the poor teenage girl that sells game to feed her younger sister and her mother sounds like something that could possibly be going on in our society today.  It got even more intriguing when you would think that the main character gets picked to fight for her life but really it turns out it is her young, innocent sister!  I had to go back and reread that to make sure I was seeing straight!  But of course she took her place out of love because that is what almost any good older sibling would do.      I will not give away much more of the plot but how the author chose to set out the storyline and how she laid out who the characters were and what they were like was different in a better way then I have ever read before.  It is a great read and one that you will not want to put down.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I very much enjoy Jodi Picoult's novels and I've read each one shortly after release, religiously. I wait anxiously for her next book to come out.   This story was very thought-provoking. This is the story of Zoe, a woman trying desperately to have a baby using scientific IVF methods until her husband divorces her, then struggling with falling in love with a woman. The novel brings in several controversial, ethical topics (including divorce/scientific reproduction/homosexuality) in a way that Jodi Picoult is known to do and challenges the reader to see both sides of each issue at hand.   I did find the ending to be predictable and could have called many aspects of it early on (I won't give it away here for those who haven't read it yet, but Max's actions are all quite expected) - but that didn't stop me from enjoying the story as it progressed.     Overall, my feeling was that it is not as great a read as some of her former works, but still worth picking up.
0525423273|5.0|This just might be my favorite YA this year. Possibly my favorite up to date. I couldn't help but be pulled in by the story and I couldn't put it down until it was finished. The writing was fantastic.<br /><br />Perkins has given her characters a human feel. Neither are perfect while the other struggles. They both struggle and they both make mistakes and they both are pulled in by an unseen force. Amazing. It was just amazing. I usually find that the guy in most romances one character is just near perfect while the other can do no right. I loved how they were both able to make mistakes, both realize it (later, of course) and both able to work to correct those mistakes. Neither was perfect and it really made the characters come to life.<br /><br />I don't know why I didn't grab this the minute it came out. I've read reviews from other bloggers that said pretty much the same thing. It was fantastic, couldn't put it down, favorite book, and the writing was wonderful. Now that I've gotten to experience the book for myself, I whole heartily agree! This book was phenomenal in every way.
B000FZETIO|3.0|I enjoyed this movie and am glad there is a dvd for it. The special features are disappointing. The alternate/original ending should be included. I loved this movie and always wanted Andie with Duckie. Cryer's Duckie made the movie for me and it's disappointing that the dvd did not include it and more.
B004MMEIK0|4.0|I enjoyed this book for the most part. I found myself laughing at some points, then cringing at some others. I am not sure if I will read any of the other books within this series, especially because I believe I found about 10 of them at an average on $7.99 a pop. That's a lot of cash for a series I did not completely fall in love with. Enjoyed the freebie though, and would definitely suggest you give it a chance too. If it goes up to $7.99 like its many partners in the series, however, I would pass.
B0034G4OWM|3.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It did get pretty boring at times though.  The animals were funny so I kept watching.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|How would you feel if your idle was a total jerk?  After getting fired, Becky Fuller (McAdams), lands a producing job at a struggling morning show called \\"Daybreak\\".  Her first task is to find a new lead anchor.  After deciding on Mike Pomeroy (Ford), her childhood idle, she soon lives to regret the decision.  She is forced to try to make it work with him in order to save the show.  Let me start by saying that this is a pretty good movie.  My one huge problem with it is that they tried so hard to make it a chick flick that the added a love story sub-plot that dragged the movie down.  The interaction between Becky and Mike was strong enough on its own that there was no need for the five minutes of love story plot thrown in every now and then.  It may be because I am a guy, but the fact that they tried so hard to make it a chick flick it ended up hurting the movie. Besideds that aspect it actually was a pretty good show.  I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Probebly not.

B000PMLFRA|2.0|If George Lucas still feels the need to tweak \\"Star Wars\\" nearly 35 years after its release, then it should be painfully obvious that he never had a clear and distinct vision for that film.<br /><br />In his early days as a filmmaker Lucas wanted to be an \\"auteur\\" and make all kinds of films.  He has proven with the SW saga (and particularly with the ill-conceived, poorly-executed prequels) that he is really a one-trick pony.  He has proven that he is unable to move forward with new films and new ideas.  In fact, he can't even let his existing films rest as-is.  Is he OCD?<br /><br />As is evident by the changes he has made to \\"Empire\\" and \\"Jedi\\" in recent years, he has no qualms about altering OTHER directors' work either.<br /><br />The recently-announced (or leaked) changes to \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Jedi\\" for the Blu-ray release have succeeded in getting me off the fence in terms of making a purchasing decision:  the answer is a big, Darth Vader-ish \\"Noooooooo!\\"<br /><br />No doubt plenty of people will buy these Blu-rays because of the outstanding picture quality.  But I can live without it.  I'm willing to buy the Star Wars movies I grew up with and loved, but the ones in the Blu-ray sets are not those movies.<br /><br />They're George's movies and he can do whatever he wants with them.  But in making these non-stop and needless changes he is exercising poor judgment and alienating his fan base and even his former staff and colleagues.<br /><br />Between Lucas and Jay Leno, too many people in showbusiness just don't know when to leave well enough alone and go home.
B00168ML1G|5.0|Looked everywhere for this Blu-ray and could not find it.  I was especially surprised when Walmart and Target did not have it.  Found it on Amazon and am happy with my purchase.  The movie was brand-new and never opened as promised.  And the price was very reasonable.
0395389496|5.0|This is one of our family's favorite books!  It arrived quickly and in perfect shape and the price was right! $10.99!  There even was a DVD of the movie!  It is the special 25th year edition!

B0038BBA4I|5.0|I got this album after I broke up with my girlfriend and was just what I needed. Besides being intelligent, passionate music, the songs helped me feel both sadness and joy and hope, and almost every song is about love, mistakes and family. The only person that has not loved this album is my foster sister, who is a passionate follower of Justin Bieber. I guess some stereotypes are true.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|I selected this case to hold both a Samsung MemoryCAM and a FujiFilm F300 EXR camera. I already have individual cases for each of them, but wanted a quality case that would both hold and protect them, because when traveling, I'd rather have one case to keep track of, than two.<br /><br />Granted these devices are quite small, but both fit perfectly, along with extra memory cards and battery packs, within the confines of the Lowepro case. I simply placed a piece of felt between them for protection, and the case worked well for my intended purpose.<br /><br />I also appreciate the options offered for carrying the case - hand or wrist strap along with a belt loop. My other two cases only offer one option each - one has as wrist strap and nothing else, and the other has a belt loop and nothing else.<br /><br />Partially unzipping the case to remove and/or replace one of the cameras ensures that neither the camcorder nor digital camera falls out - a small but necessary step. This is not my first Lowepro case, and I continue to be impressed with their high standards of construction. The cameras will undoubtedly be replaced long before the case shows wear.

B004FGMV0W|4.0|Four years is an ice age between albums when you're a recording act whose music is primarily aimed at a young, mostly teen audience, yet that is exactly how long Avril Lavigne waited between 2007's \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" and \\"Goodbye Lullaby.\\" The results are surprisingly strong, showing increased maturity and thoughtfulness - a natural progression with Lavigne now in her mid 20s.<br /><br />The subject matter runs a longer range and the songs have increased depth - certainly a lot more than the peppery rockers that cluttered the overloud \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" - yet the overriding themes of love unrequited and gone wrong are presented in a way that has wider appeal than expected. \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" is an album that strides the lines of teen and adult pop, and the songs sound raw, unpretentious and unmanufactured.<br /><br />\\"Smile\\" is reminiscent of the high-punch attitudinal pop of 2002's \\"Let Go,\\" as is the catchy sing-a-long \\"What the Hell,\\" Lavigne's best single in more than five years, but neither is indicative of the album's strong emphasis on downbeat, ruminative balladry. Even the insistent, chugging, gorgeously produced \\"Push,\\" with reflects the forthright personality listeners have come to expect from Lavigne, is restrained and contemplative in spite of itself.<br /><br />\\"Wish You Were Here,\\" for instance, has an endearing hook amid simple, easily relatable sentiments about longing for renewed intimacy. Like the robust \\"I Love You,\\" its chorus is repetitive enough that the song would have been stronger had its running time been shortened.<br /><br />\\"Stop Standing There\\" has crunchy, foot-tapping production and a joyful melody, and Lavigne's vocals are surprisingly impassioned on the vulnerable \\"4Real\\" and \\"Darlin'\\" as she tries to make sense of being in and out of love.<br /><br />This is certainly a change of pace for Lavigne - it's an album by a young adult making music for a fan base, one part growing into adulthood with her, the other still considerably younger and unable to appreciate headier, larger themes. Happily, she has managed to accommodate both on \\"Goodbye Lullaby.\\" It is by no means a classic - the songs bare considerable similarities in texture and palette, and the lyrics, while thoughtful and sincere, are not particularly impressive. However, most of the tracks catch hold on repeated plays because they have passion and definable melodies to propel them in addition to Lavigne's capable, heartfelt singing. It is a commendable effort and pleasant listen.<br /><br />3.5 starsier, larger themes.

B002UHSDUK|3.0|This could be a technical problem.  I haven't tried all workarounds yet.  I purchased the MP3 download of the compilation, went through iTunes and put it on my iPod.  It sounds terrible.  Overloaded, like it was mixed too loud.  Every time the bass or a drum hits the highs drop out and it's completly distorted.  I've listened to my other music to make sure something wasn't wrong with the iPod, I've switched headsets, about the only thing that I haven't tried is reloading it or trying to change the bitrate.  This is the only thing that I have that sounds like this.  Any suggestions would be welcome.  If not for the sound quality I would've rated it higher.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Easy A is a teen comedy that is just as good as those 80's teen comedies. Oh, and Clueless. Actually, it might be better because those movies didn't have a cast that includes Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, Malcolm McDowell, and Lisa Kudrow. Easy A is clever, funny, and gay-friendly. Emma Stone is great as Olive, as is Amanda Bynes as a \\"Jesus Freak\\". And Penn Badgley continues to melt hearts as Olive's love interest. Easy A is one of those rare teen comedies that gets an A!

Art and reality shake hands in this complex psychological study of a shy and dominated girl (a suffocating mother and a very exigent dance teacher) whose repressed sexual life and the excessive tension caused by intern rivalries of the cast who ardently are trying to beat her to get this first -rate role will origin a very hazardous cocktail of immeasurable dimensions that sooner or later,  will lead her to experience a set of  tense situations, unbearable stress which will conform a web of majuscule proportions and an unexpected finale.<br /><br />The \\"somber\\" was a term designed by Jung to label all of those repressions and dark labyrinths of the human soul and encloses all sort of hidden dragons who nestle into our unconscious.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is outstanding in the role of her lifetime. Don't miss it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Having felt a bit lukewarm about her debut album 19, I was eager to see what Adele's sophomore effort would sound like. 21 feels much like a promise fulfilled. There has never been any denial of Adele's soaring voice. In fact, she simply puts most current artists to shame in the days of so much auto-tuning. Adele's producing partners have been a tremendous asset on this album, working with the likes of Ryan Tedder and Paul Epworth. Her collaborations have produced a deeply emotional and personal album. You can feel the emotions of each song.    From the first track to the last, Adele holds your attention and conveys so much power and feeling that it is difficult not to push repeat on each song just to hear it again. \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" begins with a gospel-bluesy feel. Adele has said that she channels Beyonce's Sascha Fierce when she sings it, and it definitely shows. Her haunting voice floats effortlessly over the strong beat. Other standouts on the album are \\"Turning Tables\\", \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\", \\"Take it All\\", \\"One and Only\\", and the haunting \\"Someone Like You\\" (though you would be hard-pressed to find a song on the album that is sub-par. Maybe only \\"Dont' You Remember\\" falls a little flat).     Note to artists out there - if you wanna get a great ballad, go see Ryan Tedder. With \\"Apologize\\", \\"Bleeding Love\\", and now \\"Someone Like You\\" to his credit, he is proving to be a ballad writer like none I have seen in the past two decades.     It is hard to believe Adele is only 22 years old. It is exciting to think of how many albums and wonderful singing will come out of her in the years to come. This is easily the best album release of this year, and possible of the last 4 or 5 years. It is an amazing display of vocal ability and beautiful, sometimes heartbreaking songwriting. A must own.

I usually wear a sixe 9 or 10 depending on the shoe , so i ordered a size 10 just to be on the safe side. they are TRUE to size very SNUG and comfortable. i was so surprised to see the arch support in these shoes. normally in flat shoes there is little to NO arch support so thats a PLUS for the TOMS. very comfortable shoes, i could walk all day in these shoes.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I love Les Mis, overall I will say that most of the performances were moving, there were several times during the program where I needed a tissue.  The music always moves me to tears.  Awesome performances, except for Nick Jonas, what were they thinking when they thought it would be a good idea to put this pathetic ameteur on stage with true professionals?  With his weak voice and pained expression, it was pitiful to watch and just as painful to listen to.  I wouldn't let it ruin my overall impression though.  This is why I only gave 4 stars, ignore the meak and meager Jonas and you get 5.  The encore was spine-chilling, the voices of the 4 Valjean's were stunning together, more crying from me here.  Highly recommended.
B0006B3UEQ|4.0|I am not a big Tom Cruise fan but he is very good in this thriller and semi-bonding movie. Jamie Foxx is excellent. I had actually owned the movie for a while without watching it and was surprised at how good it is. Foxx is the better of the two and does a great job as a low key cab driver who has his dreams but little chance of seeing  them happen.  There is very little back story to Cruise's character and what there is may be just a joke. This fits the character well. We don't want to know who he is and he would probably lie anyway.<br /><br />The story gets a bit jumbled, for me at least, in the middle. Who is Cruise killing ? Are they bad guys or witnesses ? They give the impression of bad guys, maybe rivals of his clients. Then, at the end, we learn they are witnesses and, presumably, good guys. Well, you don't watch such moves for plot subtleties.<br /><br />It is well done and enjoyable.
B00402FGEE|5.0|I'm going to try to address the many issues swirling about this series without spoiling the plot:<br /><br />1) Similarities to other shows: There has been a great deal of speculation that the show is a 'ripoff' of Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, or even Lost. While I certainly don't disagree that it bears a striking similarity to Battlestar Galactica, I don't count that as a strike against it.<br /><br />Prior shows are always going to have an impact on future shows. Film-making (whether it be TV or Feature) is an art that builds upon itself, and stands on the shoulders of those who came before it. The fact is the Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, and Lost are all GOOD shows, regardless of your impression of it or whether or not it struck you the right way, they were the best of their genres at the time, and even bent their genres into something new.<br /><br />That being said, to call this show a 'rip-off' or 'carbon copy' of any of those shows is grossly over simplifying things and intentionally misleading. Perhaps we should just create a new genre name, like 'Adult Sci-Fi', so we can get over all these intellectual property theft allegations.<br /><br />2) Dissimilarities to other Stargate franchises: This review will probably take a lot of heat for this, but - past Stargate shows actually weren't very good. Don't get me wrong, I've watched every episode of SG1, and most of Atlantis (still working on that), and enjoy just about all of it, but even while enjoying it, I was fully recognizant of the fact that it wasn't actually good. It's campy. The acting is sub-par, even when there are good actors in the shows. The sets are generic and bland, reminiscent of the original series of Star Trek, the scripting is packed with fromage, and the plots, no matter how original, were all clearly predictable.<br /><br />But to a niche crowd (myself included) they were thoroughly enjoyable through a mixture of silly humour, sci-fi gratification, and a unique self-aware self-deprecation. But even so, the cinematography was regularly lackluster, the effects unconvincing, and the ratings carried along by loyal fans.<br /><br />SGU lacks most of these shortcomings. There is the occasional campy humour, though typically coming from the same character. In that way this one character, Eli, has come to be the only vestige of the old Stargate franchises. This is made believable, though, because this character is quite similar to the people (like myself) who enjoyed the camp of previous Stargate in real life.<br /><br />3) The mood: Many would say it's much too dark, both in production design and in mood. I say that it's about time. In past Stargate series', no matter how far gone a situation was, no matter how much danger they were in, the show was never EVER tense. It never mattered. Nothing ever really mattered. The characters were always too happy and fun and funny and confident and amicable to be capable of expressing any kind of peril. As such, the plots were always completely hollow. Nothing mattered, because it would all be fine in the end.<br /><br />The only episode in both original Stargate series' that managed to capture any kind of deep emotional commitment or tension was Heroes, which just happened to be filmed in the documentary style similar to that of SGU. I don't solely blame the cinematography for this effect, though, but instead, for just once, the characters were encouraged to be vulnerable and hurt, like real human beings.<br /><br />When people are in a serious situation, they get serious (mostly), and their flaws become more apparent. This is evident in this series, as it should be in such situations.<br /><br />4) The set/production design: As for the dark set design, it makes some sense, as the ship is very old, and trying to save power. In past Stargate, no matter how old something was, it always looked like it was cobbled together the day before. The ancient city of Atlantis looking like it was maintained by a team of maid-bots and carpenters right up until the team's arrival. I will admit that the purposeful gloom goes a bit too far at times, but as far as I'm concerned, that's better than skirting the edge of cardboard box grade production.<br /><br />SGU is simply a great show. Yes, it shrugs off its past franchise for the sake of its artistic intent, but it does so with wonderful results. The acting is largely superb, and even the episodes that in other shows would be considered 'in betweeners' come off as being some of the best episodes on television (like the episode Human).<br /><br />I definitely recommend this show to anyone, and I absolutely recommend that past Stargate fans try to leave their preconceptions at the door, and respect it as its own show.<br /><br />UPDATE: You will no doubt notice a massive spree of negative reviews on top of the 'helpful' pile on IMDb. Please take these with a grain of salt, as they are largely spam generated by a select few alienated Stargate fans who are working very, very hard to get this show cancelled. Rest assured, I myself have yet to meet a single classic Stargate fan who doesn't LOVE SGU, and I sure do know a lot of them!oseful gloom goes a bit too far at times, but as far as I'm concerned, that's better than skirting the edge of cardboard box grade production.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Yet another great film by one of the very young-at-heart veteran filmmakers around.     Is Hereafter, really a film about a guy who communicates with the dead? The general consensus is that Lonegan (Damon) manages to connect with the dead relatives of his clients and acts as a medium. However, if we observe what he says to his \\"clients\\" it seems that the dead do not reveal anything that the living didn't know beforehand; there are no surprises at all. Perhaps the only surprise is that the dead seem to be up to date with events after their death. Either they can see what is happening \\"here\\" or simply it is not the dead speaking through Lonegan.     In fact, what Lonegan conveys, and what the \\"clients\\" learn, is that their dead forgive them or ask for their forgiveness so as traumas, guilt, unfulfilled desires should be dropped aside and they (the living) should get on with their lives. In such an interpretation, it is the living that speak through Lonegan to themselves. Lonegan reads their deep feelings and desires to be set free from whatever past load is weighing them down and tells them to do so. At the third \\"reading\\" in the film, that of the young boy, it seems that Lonegan is aware of this aspect of his work since he appears to insert some of his own advice in what the dead brother \\"says\\".     One point about all this is the view that we all know what we need to do with our lives but we require someone else to tell us to do it, in order to accomplish the big leap forward. In the film, to round up the situation, even Lonegan needs some of his own medicine in order to move on with his life and it is the boy who acts as the catalyst. He \\"reads\\" Lonegan's not so deep desires and sets him up with Marie Lelay (the French woman).     The film, as I see it, is not really about \\"hope of what happens afterwards\\", as a review suggests, but about life before death; the fact that usually it is so very obvious to everyone else what we want and need to make our lives work that it is a pity to have to reach the hereafter in order for each one of us to understand it.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Serenity is my top movie for 2005, and I'll tell you why: the characters. It is based on, and in conclusion to, the prematurely cancelled (thank you Fox) TV show Firefly. If you have seen the show before, you probably already love the characters, if not, you will.<br /><br />Instead of being inexorably drawn by the tides of the universe, even though the main character at one point states that he simply follows the wind, this movie is drawn forward and driven by the characters. Their choices, their emotions, and their relationships are what guide this. Not technology, deus ex machinas, or even their desperate situation (which becomes increasingly so, as in any great sci fi flick).<br /><br />Yes, the action is great, though not on par with the Matrix as some commercials state for some reason. Yes, the special effects are spectacular, although obviously not created by ILM. And yes, the story and the big twist revelation at the end keep you guessing. But what makes this movie is the characters. Believable, fresh and compelling.
1591843790|5.0|I've been a big fan of Guy's for years, but I must admit this is the first of his books I've gotten around to reading.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />His latest, Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions(affiliate link) is a breeze of a read and one that I found delightful and, well, enchanting.<br /><br />While some might be quick to simplify the book's advice  to nothing more than good ol' common sense, I would argue it is much more than that.  Think of a great mentor you've had, or one you hope you might one day have.  If he or she were to put every ounce of advice into one tome and attempt to do so in a way that is relevant in an always-connected-world, well, this might be the book they'd write.<br /><br />Along the way, Guy references the dozens of books he read and researched while in the process of writing Enchantment.  Many of them I wasn't familiar with and I plan to dig into several of them soon, as if my list of must-reads wasn't already long enough.<br /><br />The single biggest takeaway for me were the two chapters outlining what Guy refers to as \\"push\\" and \\"pull\\" technologies where push technologies are your presentations, e-mail and Twitter, for example.  Examples of pull technologies on the other hand would be your website, blog, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube pages, though I think Facebook and LinkedIn could also fall into the \\"push\\" category.<br /><br />In these two chapters, he outlines some best practices for utilizing each.  Some of them I've seen from Guy before and have actually implemented and used with great success.  While, again, some points made are arguably common sense, I suspect many individuals and organizations still aren't implementing them.<br /><br />Throughout, the basic and on-going theme of the book, for me at least, was the idea of altruism.  I could invoke biblical concepts and verses here, as Guy does: put the needs of others before you own, treat others they way you desire to be treated, not only in the real world, but in the virtual one many of us spend so much of our time in these days.  Additionally, Guy's desire is that this book remain relevant for decades to come, regardless of the inevitable technological changes ahead.  I believe he has succeeded in making it so.<br /><br />Something I didn't expect to get out of the book was this little gem (a concept that Guy initially applies to your relationship with your boss):<br /><br />\\"If your wife asks you to do something, drop everything and do it.  You may not think it's important, but you aren't juggling four kids, a career, and several charitable causes.  You may see the big picture, but you don't see her big picture.\\"<br /><br />Worth the price of the book, as Guy suggests?  I think so.nd so much of our time in these days.

It's got the essential songs from Number Of The Beast, two from Powerslave, and whatever else one would expect on such a limited collection.

B003O3EKJC|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese's CASINO is a superb crime drama that concerns successful football handicapper Ace Rothstein (DeNiro). Ace is put in charge of a Vegas gambling resort by the syndicate that owns it. He makes the mistake of marrying a hustler (Stone) and trusting her. To feed her drug habit she hustles him for a bundle of cash and jewelry, then splits. Ace's best friend (Pesci) is a psychotic mob leg-breaker who goes too far, too often.<br /><br />The film is adapted by Nicholas Pileggi from his own book. Pileggi also wrote the book and screenplay for [[ASIN:B000P0J09M GOODFELLAS]] (1990) and [[ASIN:B00000JGHL CITY HALL]] (1996).<br /><br />CASINO's main character is loosely based on Chicago-born sports handicapper Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal, a frequenter of Miami racetracks. With Florida authorities breathing down his neck for bookmaking activities, Lefty relocated to Las Vegas in 1968. In '76, it was discovered that Rosenthal was running four Vegas casinos without a license. He was consequently denied one due to organized crime &aacute;ssociations. In Nov. '82, Lefty's drug-addicted ex-wife O.D.ed on booze, Valium and coke in a motel room.

B004N66XYE|4.0|I haven't actually watched the old \\"Upstairs Downstairs,\\" but it's pretty much become the standard of historical dramas where we see both the aristocrats and the servants.<br /><br />So I was deeply intrigued by the news that the BBC was reviving the show for a new three-episode miniseries, serving as a sequel to the original series. It's a sleek, glittering affair with lots of actual historical figures and events, but the story never forgets that the real focus is on the people both upstairs and downstairs.<br /><br />The year is 1936. George V has just died, his feckless son is involved with Mrs. Simpson, and Hitler is on the rise. Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and his wife Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) move into 165 Eaton Place, intending to turn the \\"mausoleum\\" into a livable house. So they employ Rose Buck (Jean Marsh), who was once a maid at their house, to find them some suitable servants.<br /><br />Soon the house has plenty of new inhabitants. Downstairs: fussy but kind butler Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), snobby cook Mrs.Thackeray (Anne Reid), hot-tempered footman Johnny (Nico Mirallegro), and others. Upstairs: Agnes' snotty fascist sister Persie (Claire Foy), and Sir Hallam's bossy globe-trotting mother Maud (Dame Eileen Atkins) and her warmhearted secretary Amanjit (Art Malik).<br /><br />And while Lady Agnes hoped to have the \\"perfect\\" home, 165 Eaton Place is soon rocked by a series of problems -- an arrest, dabblings in fascism, a pregnancy, a birth, a death, constant friction between Maud and Agnes, and the discovery of secret children upstairs and down.<br /><br />Technically the new \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" is a sequel to the old one, but it's not necessary to have seen the older \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" to understand what's going on. There are some nods and references -- particularly the presence of housemaid-turned-housekeeper Rose -- but it's mostly a self-contained story.<br /><br />The writers do a great job of packing a whole season's worth of drama, sorrow, joy and soap-opera mayhem into just three hours, but somehow it never feels rushed. And they also do an adept job at weaving the story of 165 Eaton Place together with real-life events -- Ribbentrop and Simpson make cameos, Persie becomes involved with fascism, and Hallam is good friends with the Duke of York (later the king).<br /><br />And it has a talented cast of well-respected actors (Keeley Hawes, Dame Aileen Atkins, the weirdly stiff Ed Stoppard, Adrian Scarborough, Art Malik and of course Jean Marsh), as well as a few newbies (Nico Mirallegro, Ellie Kendrick). The only problematic character is Claire Foy's -- Persephone is such a selfish, repulsive character that it's pretty much impossible to care what happens to her.<br /><br />\\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" is a solid miniseries that stands on its own merits, but leaves the door open just in case.

159420229X|4.0|Joshua Foer's \\"Moonwalking With Einstein\\" is a good book, but it will leave some readers thinking about how much better it could have been. In \\"Moonwalking,\\" Foer tries to have it both ways: to write a serious book about an important subject, memory, while at the same time writing an accessible bestseller (which it no doubt will be). He does this by hooking his excellent writing about the science, history, and cultural significance of memory into the tale of his competition in the 2006 U.S. Memory Championship competition, complete with idiosyncratic competitors, many of whom apparently have neither the time, inclination, or in some cases the basic hygiene required to earn a living other than by hawking \\"memory secrets\\" with all the dignity of late night TV pitchmen.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Overall, \\"Moonwalking\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read. Foer has a breezy writing style, and is at times delightfully funny. But it is that same entertaining, shaggy-dog style that ends up contrasting so glaringly with his sometimes profound and always though-provoking sections that tell the serious story of memory and its devaluation in the 20th Century.<br /><br />Foer's writing on the importance of memory in societies before the development of writing is excellent. The ability of such cultures to pass down knowledge and their own history from generation to generation depended on the development of techniques that allowed individuals to memorize astounding amounts of information. Foer recounts the discovery of the 2,500 year old mnemonic technique known as the \\"memory palace,\\" by which Simonides of Ceos supposedly recalled the exact location of the victims of the collapse of a banquet hall in which he was speaking in order to guide grief-stricken relatives to the bodies of their loved ones.<br /><br />In fact the passage of knowledge through writing was disparaged by such men as Socrates, who believed that witten words \\"could never be anything more than a cue for memory - a way of calling to mind information already in one's head,\\" and that \\"writing would lead the culture down a treacherous path toward intellectual and moral decay, because even while the quantity of knowledge available to people might increase, they themselves would come to resemble empty vessels.\\" In the 21st Century, when two-thirds of American teens don't have a clue as to when the Civil War began, and one-fifth don't know who the United States fought against in World War II, Socrates' predictions seem prescient rather than merely a quaint longing for the good old days.<br /><br />Foer reveals some remarkable facts about the evolution of our attitudes toward the written word. The use of punctuation and word spacing was tried out in the 2nd Century A.D., but was ultimately abandoned for 900 years. Until Guttenberg and the invention of moveable type, books were largely regarded as aids to memory rather as primary sources of information in themselves.<br /><br />Foer also does an excellent job of describing the ways in which the increasing availability of written sources has created a world in which, if one reads at all, one reads extensively rather than intensively. Breadth of knowledge replaces depth of knowledge. Lack of a foundational memory pool inside our brains results in a reduced capacity for critical thinking. Comparing what we learn with what we know, integrating new material with previously acquired and remembered material to gain new insight and understanding about the world, is sacrificed at the alter of Google and instant but unconnected, and largely uunretained, knowledge.<br /><br />Likewise, Foer's exploration of the neuroscience of memory, including the stories the astonishing abilities of so-called savants, is both insightful and even touching.<br /><br />It is when he tries to interweave his own experiences as he first reports on and later enters the U.S. Memory Championship competition that Foer stumbles. Foer seems to be working overtime to engage the reader in the story. To his credit, he at least partially succeeds in making a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Some episodes are even laugh out loud funny. But the raw material weighs him down. Unlike recent accounts of other potentially snooze-worthy contests such as crossword puzzle competitions and spelling-bees, his compatriots in the rarified world of super-memory often come across as unlikable or just plain dull. There is no one root for except the obvious candidate, the author himself.<br /><br />It is too bad that the author, who tells so many important stories that have great relevance in this age of hyper-information, chose not stick to those stories. But we are lucky that Joshua Foer has given us as much as he has in \\"Moonwalking With Einstein.\\" Without the hook of his shoot-out at the memory corral, this timely and informative book might have gone largely unread by anyone.t partially succeeds in making a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

0891419063|5.0|This book is worth your time.  One man's horrifying experience as told from the front lines of WWII Pacific war battles.  With the Old Breed by E.B. Sledge is a rare glimpse into what the war in the Pacific was really like for the Marines who fought there during World War II.  Told in an unflinching, no holds barred narrative, E.B. Sledge gives the reader a front row seat into the island war fought by US Marines. It is nothing short of brilliant, extremely honest, and as heart and gut wrenching as one could possibly stomach.  Many war memoirs and narratives are told from the perspective of officers and, most specifically, colonels and generals.  E.B. Sledge speaks from the perspective of someone who actually fought in the war, the beach assaulting, front line U.S. Marine.  With the Old Breed has been recognized by the U.S. Marine Corps as a solid example of what actually happened at Peleliu and Okinawa.  It is endorsed by several upper echelon Marine officers, and has been used in the training of officers.<br /><br />If you want to find out what it was really like to have waged the Pacific Campaign of 1942-1945, you need look no further than With the Old Breed.  It is more than a memoir, it is actually a historical reference.  Throughout the book Sledge supplies us with photos, footnotes that give added detail, and additional comments by Marine Corps leaders who were there.  But the book does not come across as a text, it is told from a personal perspective, from someone who actually experienced two intensive campaigns, face to face with the enemy night and day.  The fear, the over-bearing, all encompassing fear is related to us in terms any man or woman could understand, brilliantly conveyed.<br /><br />Reading With the Old Breed along with Robert Leckie's Helmet For My Pillow will give you an additional and worthy reading experience.  Both men volunteered for the U.S. Marines and were proud to have served in the war as Marines.  But both men took away a very different and negative experience of having been in the war. Reading the two books back to back gives an interesting glimpse into what it must have really been like.  Sheer terror comes through in both books.  Both books were also used by the producers to weave the triad experience of three different Marines from the beginning of the Pacific war until the final day.negative experience of having been in the war.

0143039431|5.0|I think it may be a crime in Oklahoma that I've lived here all my life but never read this book.  I've rarely read anything so moving as this book and couldn't recommend it higher.  The struggles of this family as they made their way from their dusty home to the paradise on the coast only to be treated as trash makes for a truly compelling read.  Any number of parallels could be drawn to present day but I'll not give any more away.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|I can't believe that disney made this depressing movie! I didn't think it was really geared toward children; more toward adults. I found it very sad & depressing.  First off, the movie was described horribly in the preview! The preview looked like a movie about an old man wanting to go see the rainforest, so he attached a bunch of balloons to his house. A young boyscout came up wanting to earn a \\"Helping the Elderly\\" badge. He got onto the house right at the time of the \\"Lift-off\\" and comes with him. It shows them in the rainforest and it looked like it was going to be a fun movie about getting back home.  How did the movie start out? He (Carl) met a girl when he was young, they got married, then they wanted children. They go to the doctor's office to find out she is unable to have a child. (Depressing point number one) After that she wanted to go see a waterfall in the rainforest. When he finally got enough money to go, she collapsed and died! (Depressing point number two)  Don't watch this movie unless you are too happy!
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I love historical fiction. But I also like knowing how much of a story is based on fact in order to keep the fictional aspects in perspective. When I first watched \\"Rome\\", I was initially incensed at the writer's use of modern profanity thinking that people wouldn't have used the \\"f\\" word in that time period, but quickly realized they probably did, only it would have been an Roman/Italian version. And of course, they didn't speak English either, in which case I wouldn't (as an English-only speaker) have related as easily to a movie all in Italian. As for the accuracy of the storyline, it was close enough to inspire me to research the real historical events that framed the fictional story presented and I was better off for it. The same for \\"The Tudors.\\"    Much has been said here about the historical truths (and fictions) of Showtime's \\"The Tudors.\\" Of course there are many inaccuracies and inventions in the script just as there are in any period production - some deliberate but perhaps unnecessary. There are also silly, unintentional mistakes that can be spotted in the visuals and choices of music. But since this is a made for television series, one has to admit, it's entertaining and sumptuously made in spite of those errors and inaccuracies. If, after watching or reading any work of historical fiction, you are one of those who is inspired to sort out the real from the fiction as am I, here is a link to a website that can help you put \\"The Tudors\\" in perspective.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|When you watch it, be sure to make enough popcorn to hurl at the parade of fools who've brought the global economy to the precarious place we now enjoy.    While the film unlimately challenges the viewing public to take action to mitigate the present and potential econoimic damage by prosecuting the miscreants who've wrought our universal predicament, what is seems to lack is a set of instructions about how to effectively leverage political and financial processes to pot the world's balance sheet back in the black.
0316098337|5.0|Of all the books that I have ever reviewed, I think that this one is the toughest to do without any spoilers. I was very tempted to plaster a warning on my write-up and go for it, quotes and all, but have decided in the end for a quick, unrevealing version. Due to its celebrity, this was a novel which I approached with some caution. When a book is over-hyped, I tend to walk away disappointed because it didn't live up to my expectations. This was certainly not the best novel I ever read, but it stands out in several respects by virtue of sheer originality. Room is, in brief, the story of a nineteen year old woman who is abducted and held captive in an eleven by eleven foot square modified shed, where she spends seven years in captivity and bears a son, Jack. We see their minuscule world through the eyes of Jack, at the age of five. Jack as narrator was an amazing device for author Emma Donoghue to use and one she pulls off with astonishing aplomb. As I read her stream of conscience type prose, I could hear the voice of a young child in my head. Some reviewers have had difficulty adjusting to the style, but to me it was flawless and perfect for setting the tone of the book, especially in the second half. The second thing that really stood out for me was Ms. Donoghue's amazing attention to the smallest details. She thought of things that never would have even occurred to me, and as a result, the narrative was completely believable throughout. These two factors, the choice and deft handling of the narrator, and her incredible consideration of every possible element of setting and characterization, earn this novel five stars.

B004NSVF7C|4.0|This book provided a fascinating glimpse into the world, both past and present, of rare book collecting-beyond simple bibliophilia into the realm of bibliomania, an obsessive state of being where the afflicted will do anything, legal or not, to possess the books they desire. An eclectic mix of collector's and dealer's stories, rare book lore, valuations of various books, and some auto-biographical information, author Allison Bartlett does an excellent job of merging her various elements into a riveting narrative that smoothly carries the reader from tidbit to tidbit. The glue that ties the book together is made up of two main characters: rare book dealer Ken Sanders and thief John Gilkey. Sanders became involved in tracking down book thieves while holding a volunteer security chairmanship in a professional organization. John Gilkey was his biggest nemesis. Bartlett spent over ten years interviewing Gilkey, Sanders, and many others involved in the rare book trade. One added sideline grows out of her narrative-that of journalistic involvement and legality/ethics. In several instances the author was placed in situations with John Gilkey that made her uneasy and left her wondering if she had a legal, and if not legal, then ethical, responsibility to report him to the authorities. Towards the end of her interviews, she fervently hoped that Gilkey would reveal, due to the rapport they had built, where he had stashed his stolen books. She became increasingly conflicted as to which would be of greater value: reporting things he told her or holding out in hopes of his entrusting her with this greater secret, knowing that reporting him to the authorities would destroy any chance of recovering the fruits of his pilfering and returning them to their rightful owners. Definitely a book which has left me wanting to learn more about rare books and the lore that has built up around them!
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Let me start off by addressing the fact that other reviews from years past voice concerns that the subtitles for the discs they've received through ordering online are the botched print.  Magnolia has since discontinued these discs and started printing the movie with more subtitle options, including the theatrical (correct) version.  I recently received my copy through Amazon and it was the corrected disc, and as it has been two years since the issue was last reported, I think it's safe to order this movie online.<br /><br />On to the movie itself.<br /><br />Most movies have music playing during the opening credits that sets the tone for the film and lets the viewer know exactly what kind of experience they're getting into.  With Let the Right One In, there is no such pandering, and the effect is a somewhat unnerving silence throughout a simple list of names set against a snowy backdrop before the movie begins.  From this moment on, you know this movie is gold.<br /><br />12 year old Oskar is alone.  As a child who is viscously bullied at school with no real friends to talk to, with a mother who works most of the time and only goes through the motions of parenting, Oskar is alone.  Fascinated with murder and fantasizing about revenge on his tormentors, he spends his evenings playing with a knife and cutting out murder stories from the newspaper.<br /><br />Eli is a girl who moves from place to place frequently with a man who appears to be her father.  As she seems to have no other choice, she keeps to herself, and is alone.  She and Hakan, her caretaker, have just moved in next door to Oskar.  Eli is 12 years old.  But she's been 12 for a very long time...<br /><br />Let the Right One In, at first glance, sounds like just another vampire/romance flick.  But let's be clear: this is NOT just another vampire/romance flick.  This movie casts a strange, almost eerie, innocence on the world, aided by the frozen, Swedish backdrop, and achieves something that most other horror films strive for but fail to reach - realistic, very believable characters.  It's a very meaningful film that will stay with you months after viewing it.<br /><br />The relationship between Oskar and Eli is incredible, helped all the more by the wonderful performances of the child actors.  Kindred spirits in isolation, the two are inevitably drawn towards each other despite Eli's initial reluctance.  Founded on a need for companionship and strength, the love that eventually blossoms between the two characters resonates with the innocence and purity felt throughout the movie, and is much more believable than your average \\"oooohh, you're a vampire! Let's get it on!\\" drool fest.  In fact, Eli tries to keep her vampirism a secret from Oskar until the last third of the film, terrified that Oskar will fear her and run away.<br /><br />There are, of course, some very gritty and disturbing moments throughout the movie, which contrast sharply, even beautifully, with the aforementioned innocence.  Eli is a vampire, after all, and she is capable of killing in a most gruesome fashion when necessary.  The horror of what Eli is becomes truly realized when one of her victims survives, and for the first time that I can remember, we get to see what happens when a vampire breaks the old, traditional rule that it must be invited into someone's home before entering.  At the same time, the torture Oskar is put through at the hands of his bullies is portrayed as almost Christlike, making Eli's encouragement of Oskar to hit back even more effective.<br /><br />All of this is balanced together with a sense of detachment.  The violence is shown at a distance from the camera, and unlike your standard Hollywood fare, the movie doesn't try to grab your attention or engage you in the characters, rather it simply takes you along for a ride, leaving it entirely up to you to sit down in the passenger's chair.  The beautiful cinematography helps to draw you in slowly, and the music never callstoo much attention to itself, instead doing what it needs to and putting a subtle emphasis on the dramatic moments of the picture.<br /><br />A strange, haunting movie, Let the Right One In is ultimately the best vampire story since your favorite version of Dracula. It's intelligent, cute, horrific, funny, and disturbing all at once.  There are questions that the movie leaves open to interpretation, so you'll inevitably want to read the book it is based on, which goes much more in depth in every aspect.

(I guess I was so excited just to find the book, I didn't read the full description to see this was included. What a bonus!) The book is a nice size, with beautiful illustrations filling the pages and stories set out as the writer's originally published. Also includes photos of the writers, a brief history of their lives, work, and other stories. Beautiful book, wonderfully priced.
B004BLJQOK|1.0|I decided to place my pre-conceived feelings on the film aside and watch \\"LET ME IN\\" with a friend to see how it held up as a movie, and (obviously) to the original film. Without getting long-winded, I walked away with this as my overall feeling: the director (Matt Reeves) did nothing on his own to make this film work. He re-created a lot of the same scenes and shots, and stylistically made the film look similar to the original, but in a way that felt forced, and knock-off, ham-handed and amateur. The care didn't seem to be there for each shot, the painstaking craftsmanship was gone, and what was left was a shell of a film, with it's only legs being the memory of its predecessor. I can't recommend the film to anyone, and would implore you to watch the original (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) to see what a beautiful, and unique movie experience is supposed to feel like.<br /><br />Truly disappointed, and put off.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|JJ Abrams is a good director of CGI type action movies.  JJ Abrams is also a Star Wars fan as opposed to a Star Trek fan.  Star Wars is futuristic fantasy.  Star Trek is harder sci-fi.  Hence JJ Abrams did not stay true to the Star Trek franchise & made a JJ Abrams movie with Star Trek characters.  No Respect for the Star Trek fan base.  No respect for the original body of work that Gene Rodenberry created.    Spock is sexually active and in a relationship with a former student- not a Vulcan thing.  The time line story isn't very good.  The screenplay has an air of being written by 3 people- a Star Wars fan, a Teletubbie script writer, and a Lifetime Network Man-hater Movie of the Week.    I lost respect for Leonard Nimoy on this one- the things actors will do for a paycheck.  I'd rather see Spock team up with Ron Jeremy for Skin Trek.  I get more enjoyment watching Priceline commercials with William Shatner; I find them more sincere.
1439102724|5.0|Sing you Home is the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult, and I found it a wonderful and entertaining novel. Her writing is excellent, her sentences flow, her dialogue is sharp, and her humor slips in among the serious. The telling of the story from three points of view gave the book an interesting perspective--and it was different enough to make the reading even more engrossing. Same sex marriage,gay lifestyle and lab birth measures are very current subjects and hot topics, but Picoult handled these matters with great skill. She wrote with intelligence, knowledge, an open mind, and keen observation.  This is one of the best books I have read this year. I will be buying more of Picoult's books.
0756404738|5.0|This is a book to write a song about...It's brillant and everything I hoped it would be. When I realized I was more than halfway through the book, I started rationing the pages like I'd never have another story to read. Hopefully it won't be another 4 years until the next one, but however long it takes for Day Three to come out is fine by me, only because I know Mr. Rothfuss will be giving us the end to a masterpiece.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|It's been stuck in there for at least two months.<br /><br />Just wanted to add another well-deserved, five-star review for this incredible album. I cannot remember the last time I was so immediately taken with an album upon first listen. It's downright exhilarating. The word that kept coming to mind, song after song, was \\"epic.\\" Every song is epic, or at least contains moments of thundering brilliance. It's percussive, it's intense, it's soaring. It's what the cosmos would sound like if it exploded in song.<br /><br />I know, I know -- perhaps that description is a bit overmuch, but it's just that damn good, and I don't gush easily. My early-on favorite was \\"Drumming Song,\\" and it continues to reign supreme. Even before I saw the accompanying video, the song brought to mind images of cathedrals and turbulent hymns.<br /><br />And as an unexpected bonus, my 19-month-old daughter recently discovered she loves swinging 'round the kitchen to the joyful release of \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" a song that leaves even this slightly cynical and reserved listener hard-pressed to stick with the bad mood she might have started out in.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|The one thing that mystifies me the most about comments like \\"R.E.M. are returning to form\\" is the implication that they LOST their form in the first place.  Sure, the post-Berry albums have not been anywhere near as strong as their earlier work.  No disputing that.  But the worst album they've put out has been Around the Sun, which was definitely uneven and mediocre but still had a few flashes of brilliance (most particularly \\"Final Straw,\\" which was a full-on political slam on par with any track from their mid-80s discography).  The same can be said of Reveal or Up.  The cohesiveness of Murmur or Automatic for the People might not have been there, but there were still some very fine songs produced during that period.  If the past ten years have been R.E.M. at their worst, then that's actually a mark in their favor, because their worst is still better than most if not all of their peers have been able to put together.       Which brings us to Collapse Into Now.  I am not going to waste anybody's time trying to compare it to Automatic or Murmur or anything else.  You draw your own conclusions.  What I will say is that this album has that cohesion that their recent albums (even Accelerate, which was on the whole a very strong outing) have lacked.  The tracks flow together.  All of the various stylistic masks the band has worn as they've tried to find their way artistically since Bill Berry's departure coalesce in a natural, unforced way (more than once I've read reviews that say it sounds like a greatest hits album, and that is not an unfair assessment).  Peter Buck alternates from full-out feedback-driven rockers to the softer, janglier style that defined R.E.M. in their prime, occasionally throwing in a few chords off a mandolin for good measure.  The vocal interplay between Michael Stipe and Mike Mills is as strong and melodic as it's ever been.  And most importantly, the album is strong from beginning to end.  The high point on the album for me is \\"It HappenedToday,\\" which explodes into the gorgeous, wordless, ecstatic harmony that Mills and Stipe (joined here by Eddie Vedder) have been masters of for twenty years.       The comparison that I want to make with this album is not with any of R.E.M.'s other works (as I said, you decide for yourself where it sits in the canon), but with the Beatles' Abbey Road.  The Beatles, enervated from the interminable and torturous sessions for what would become Let It Be, and genuinely sick of each other, reconvened and, for no other reason than to prove they could do it, knocked one out of the park, producing what was in many ways the most polished work of their career.  Listening to Collapse Into Now give me the same sort of feeling that I get from listening to Abbey Road; a band that has come off a rough patch (because whatever your thoughts on R.E.M.'s output since the mid-90s, you can't deny that their continued existence has been questioned more than once), who've had to wonder whether or not it still has what it takes after a legendary career, collect themselves and puts out a masterpiece, for no other reason than to shut everybody the hell up.  Given what the Beatles did after Abbey Road, taking the comparison to its logical extreme implies that this is it for R.E.M.  That's far from clear, but if it is, it's a hell of a parting shot.

Getting into trouble at various schools and diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, he just wants to manage to find a school to call home for more than a few months.    However, things quickly turn weird for Percy when he finds out he is the son of Poseidon and is sent to a summer camp for demi-gods.  On top of that, he is also being blamed for the theft of Zeus' thunderbolt.  Now, he needs to go on a quest to find and return it.    This is a fantastic story for the young and the young at heart.  I was completely taken into the world of the Olympians and couldn't put the book down.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
1416550550|5.0|This novel was my first introduction to Kate Morton as a novelist. The cover drew me into the story, and, not one to be interested in Australian stories, I was enthralled from the very first page. I was amazed at the complexities of the story, and the intricate way each story line weaves it's way in and out of the present moment. An excellent read!
B00004STPT|5.0|I've been listening to this sound track for 11 years now and recently got a new high quality CD player and good speakers.  The recording captures the full range of sound, from the subtlest, wispy sounds of pipes and flutes, to the fiery brass and thunderous bass and drums.  I am left almost breathless by the sonic beauty revealed:  lush vocals and beautiful melodies of Lisa Gerrard; the spectacular dynamics, soundstage, and imaging of the recording; and the textures of varied instruments like the duduk, guitars, various percussion instruments, perhaps Tibetan bowls also.  The theme of the 3rd track, The Battle, really gets your blood boiling!  Holst and Wagner are quoted almost verbatim in places, enriching the score by the connotations associated with Mars and The Ring.          Listen to the CD on a a high quality stereo to hear all the details and feel the full emotional impact.  A lot of the beauty is lost on an average CD player with average speakers.  Otherwise your CD might rest dusty on the rack, its depths unplumbed.

B002N5N5M0|3.0|Abit surprised after all the hype that this is my least favorite season of the four I have seen. Very rushed, sloppy, out of nowhere and annoying relationships, way too many give me a break moments. Even with a great cast the script is just painful and dexter is so off his game even for a season trying to justify that by his new life. The forced filler and prolonged confrontation just isn't believable, its like they knew they wanted an outrageous ending but couldn't figure out how to get there. I blind buy these season sets but I may rent S5 I am very leery now.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I have not spent a ton of time with this flash yet.  I have only used it a few hours.  But, I must say, I am quite pleased. I had been using an SB-800 for many years and liked it.  The SB-900 is definitely bigger but not hugely so.  I am using a D300 and it still balances very well on top of the camera.  Exposure seems to be more consistent than the 800.  Especially when the subject is closer.  The 800 seemed to often overexpose close objects.  The 900 seems to do a better job.  Havine a DX sized sensor in my camera.  I am really appreciative that the 900 is aware and adjusts accordingly.  I will write more once I have more time with it.  But, right now, I give it two thumbs up.  Especially given what I sold the 800 on the used market for and the cost of this one.  Only netted me an extra $100.  Money well spent!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It took me a while to finally decide to post something on here. I have basically just enjoyed reading the posts, 'reviews' (because apparently you already have them) and comments that are in response to the posts and 'reviews'. To say the least, it has been fairly comical reading, like a Comic Con debate.    I was 7 years old when Star Wars first came out. I saw it for the first time when it was re-released before TESB came out. When Jedi came out, I remember how bummed we were when a lighting storm caused about 10 minutes of the film to not be shown. It was around the time that Luke took Vader's helmet off. I took my niece to all three Special Editions, just because Star Wars is awesome and I wanted to make certain she could enjoy them.    When my daughter was first born, we would watch the original trilogy while I was giving her a bottle or just hanging out. It's a phonomenal creation that should be passed from generation to generation. I don't own the Prequel (yet) because I just never really wanted to buy it on DVD.     Now, with this being said, everytime a new Star Wars format has been released, I have been ready to purchase. Why? Because I am a fan. I have been a fan, and I will continue to be a fan. When it was released on VHS, I bought it. When it was released on DVD, I bought it. When the Two-Disc Special Editions came out (including the original versions) I bought it. When the Blu-Ray complete saga is released in September, I will but it. Why? Again, because I am a fan.     I haven't seen the Blu-Ray versions yet, because they haven't been released. Apparently, a good amount of the people who have reivewed them have though. Please let me know about the 30 extra hours of bonus material. If you could copy for me, then I wouldn't have to buy the set.     One more thing I want to add as well. If everyone is really hard up about Han shooting first, then just blink when that part comes on, because it will be over when your eyes reopen. It doesn't matter who shot first. Maybe Greedo had a lazy eye that caused him to veer to the right. We don't really know his background story, he could have had a shaky hand. It's hard to say.    I am very excited for the Blu Ray versions to come out.

B004259BMM|4.0|First off, I'd like to say that it would be in your best interest to get the Target version, since you get 3 extra new songs, plus 4 live versions for only a 2 or 3 extra dollars. And of the 3 extra new songs, 2 are really good, and one is just okay in my opinion. Here's a breakdown of the tracks:    1) Put You In A Song - Best song on this cd. I'm assuming everyone's heard this already... It's a really catchy, upbeat, unique love song. Great song 10/10    2) You Gonna Fly - A great feel good song; uptempo, very sing-a-long-able, the women of Little Big Town and Sarah Buxton sing backup vocals on this track, and that gives it a great unique sound. 9/10    3) All For You - A very raw love song... it's good and everything, but it's very, very similar (sounding and in meaning) to Without You, which I think is slightly better. 5/10    4) Long Hot Summer - Basically the catchiest song ever! Not very original lyrics... they just sound like every every county-summer song, but the instrumentation is wonderful! 8.5/10    5) Without You - Yep, this song is the better version of All For You. Still not a favorite because, well... it's hard to relate to unless you're in a professional band or a singer. Example: \\"the traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you. The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to this life, this love, that you and I've been dreaming of.\\" 6.7/10    6) Georgia Woods - This song is quite pleasant, the only con of this song is it isn't very memorable. I like it when I listen to it, but can't remember at all what the song was an hour later. 7.2/10    7) Right On Back To You - This is a pretty good sad song. I love the sound effects (like the sound of the ocean) and the beginning and end. 7.5/10    8) Shut Out The Lights - Great song, mostly because of the way the song builds up: it starts slow, and gradually builds to create the sense of urgency, which works amazingly well for the song. It's about an argument with a spouse/etc., and as the song builds you can just picture the people talking faster and louder. 9/10    9 Bonus) Big Promises - This song has an interesting beat for a love song. It's pretty good, love the unique-ness. 8.2/10    10 Bonus) The Luxury Of Knowing - Amazing sad song. This song is so real and honest sounding, it almost makes me cry! Love the raw emotion 9.2/10    11 Bonus) Winning - I did really like this song until the Charlie Sheen \\"Winning!\\" catchphrase... now that's all I can think of, unfortunately.  If you can get past that part, it is decently good (nice rhyme scheme) except that a few of the lines seem random/irrelevant. 7.2/10      Overall, I think this album is good (4/5 stars) but not as good as some of Keith's other CDs. And other than Put You In A Song, I don't see any songs on par with some of Keith's greats (like \\"Days Go By\\" \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" and \\"Somebody Like You\\").   Also, I would have liked to have seen some more concept diversity, because every song (except maybe one) is about romantic love- being in love, losing love, troubles with love etc. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I would have liked to see one or two songs with an unforgettable story line, moral, or world-relevance (think \\"The House That Built Me\\" or \\"Hello World by Miranda Lambert and Lady A respectively).
B003UESJF6|5.0|Everyone here really likes this fun movie. It's been watched more times than I can count, and it never loses the fun (and funny) factor.
B00001W9G0|5.0|So happy I was able to find the special edition for such a low price! Brand new in condition and speedy delivery
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I´m from Sweden and saw the orginal movie - Let the right one in - a long time ago. I liked it very much, and it was a new kind of subject for a movie in this country. Now I have seen the Matt Reeves version and I was to my delight impressed.  In many ways it was a more scary experience than the orginal, and I think that was a good thing.  Kodi Smit-Mcphee was the right choice for the part. I think his face had more feeling for the story than Kåre Hedebrant in the  Swedish version. - Chloe Grace Moretz was as good as Lina Leandersson.  This version gives a harder look at the mobbing problem for a child in school. You could understand the hell Owen was going through  very clearly.  John Ajvide Lindqvist is famous for this story, but this is not the only book by him worth reading.  Anyway - se both versions by any means. But I think you should see the Swedish movie first. You can love \\"Let me in\\" even better  that way.
B00406UK7S|3.0|With a really fine cast of actors and great locals this could have been truely good film, but falls short.  As mentioned by other reviewers it's clichéd and predictable.  I cannot fault it for that alone, as I was mildly entertained, but I was more puzzled by the blatant historical inaccuracies. Yes, the last major records of the 9th were in 117 AD, but other records exist that suggest they were active in the east.  Yes, there was a Roman governor named Julius Agricola, but he died almost 25 years before. Adventus was governor in 117. But why the switch? This kind of inaccuracy doesn't lend much validity to this solving of 'the mystery.'     Next, we have this subplot occur past the middle with the appearence of 'Arianne' (a Greek named tribeswoman in the north of Scotland????)with an Inverness accent, wearing clothing that is more Medieval than Roman era, and hair to her shoulders, instead of plaited, and she's been outcast as a witch by Picts. Very odd, as most of the activities she dabbled in would have been considered religious ritual, not witchcraft. Romans might have seen her that way, but not Picts. The film also seemed undecided as to which side we're supposed to root for.  The brutalized Picts (these tribes had names, Mr. Director)  or the mercenary Romans who are the subject of a relentless pursuit. I never felt involved with either of them.    One cast member said the stunt guys thought the fighting was better than Gladiator (the current measure of historical film) and it may have been on the ground, but on the screen it's a bit cartoonish. Watch it for Fassbender, Morrisay and the Scottish scenery, but expect nothing more, as its more of a swords and sandals fantasy than a historical adventure.
B000M5B6Q0|1.0|Love the soundtrack. Hate the audio cd.    Because of copy protection, the audio CD can't be played in a computer. Will be returning the CD and using the credits for the MP3 version.
B00008NRL8|5.0|The Gotan Project brought Latin/electronic fusion to a whole new level with their debut album LA REVANCHA DEL TANGO. Taking the sensuous tango as their base, they invigorate their music with a sinuous grace, creating music that's at once familiar and tremendously invigorating. The swelling accordions on \\"Queremos Paz\\" make you feel as if you're strolling through a Buenos Aires bazaar, while the rhythmic rigor and seductive vocals of \\"Epoca\\" are all about the ballroom. But tango isn't the only flavor on the menu: \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" and \\"Santa Maria (Del Buen Ayre)have hints of dub, while \\"Triptico\\" edges into house. \\"Vuelvo Al Sur\\" (originally written by tango master Astor Piazzolla) returns us to the pure delight of modernized tango. But my favorite track has to be the cover of \\"Last Tango in Paris.\\" While the melody is straightforward, the careful layering of instruments (piano, strings, accordion) give the song a cumulative strength and a swooning elegance. While their style has been emulated a hundred times over by now, no one has quite touched their achievement.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Ryan Adams has some solid songs on this CD.  His style is similar to Shawn Mullins, if you're unfamiliar.
B00013RC9I|4.0|TALKIE WALKIE sees a welcome return to form for Air, much closer in spirit to MOON SAFARI than 10,000 HZ LEGEND. \\"Venus,\\" for instance, has that beautiful, drifting quality that made MOON SAFARI a classic. \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" continues that trend, as does \\"Universal Traveler\\" and the instrumental \\"Mike Mills.\\" And despite the odd syllablization on \\"Universal Traveler,\\" the vocals on TALKIE WALKIE are passable (although I do miss guest vocalists such as Beth Hirsch.) \\"Alpha Beta Gaga\\" leans more towards the prog-rock that unfortunately weighed down 10,000 HZ LEGEND, but it's sufficiently buoyed by its whistling melody. \\"Alone In Kyoto\\" ends the album on a gorgeous, almost ambient, note. Air has done plenty of soundtrack work and that attention towards mood shows here. Let's hope they continue to grow in the right direction.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I skipped the last book because of the bad reviews.  Gone tomorrow is one of the better Reacher books - I've read all but 1!    This one has a lots of action, a good plot twist and a dramatic ending.  I read in one day.
B000M3452Y|5.0|LCD Soundsystem's second album, SOUND OF SILVER, picks up the rock-electro-disco torch of their first, eponymous album, and continues to run with it. Certainly, \\"Get Innocuous!\\" kicks off with a New Wave synth line gives way, almost imperceptibly, to some guitar work. \\"North American Scum\\" begins innocently enough, until it becomes a bizarre chant in support of the entire continent. And \\"Someone Great\\" starts out like a long-lost Kompakt track, before the bright bell that follows the vocal line reminds us that we're still in North America. They also leave room for some funky political commentary (\\"Us V Them\\") as well as a heartfelt torch song to the city that never sleeps (\\"New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down\\"). But the track that's (rightly) gotten all the buzz is \\"All My Friends.\\" It's a comedown song for the entire Xtasy generation--what happens when the party generation has to grow up. With the throbbing bassline and quiet longing synth line in the chorus (a heavy debt to New Order here), it melds happy nostalgia and sadness effortlessly into a swirling sonic concoction. Massively moving.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I liked this movie this movie this was my first time watching it and didn't know what to expect. Im sure almost everyone knows what this movie is about already, different street gangs gathered together, while gathered someone from another gang shot the gang another rival member as he was one of the strongest members. Throughout the madness someone yell that the rival gangs The Warriors did it and all kinds of madness broke lose on this one night. Very could watch and some of the actors that you see today it was good seeing some of them in this early work.
B00005JL96|5.0|\\"Lilo and Stitch\\" is an absolute blast. It's a creative, oddball masterpiece, beautifully hand-animated in Hawaiian watercolors, and set to a rockin' Elvis soundtrack. It is funny, exciting, and touching. Parents will find it totally ironic and way off-kilter in Perfect-Princess-Disneyland...and THAT's why it shines. Lilo and her big sister Nani are anything but perfect. They are orphans, constantly trying to appear as if they are \\"making it\\" in life so a social worker doesn't separate them into foster care.     But it's hard to act normal when a crazy little alien crash lands onto their island, is mistaken for some kind of mutant homeless dog, and Lilo adopts him from the animal shelter! Utter craziness ensues, to the delight of everyone. This film WILL tickle your funny bone and warm your heart in equal measure. It has MANY surprises up its sleeve, and was such a relief to see the House of Mouse take a break from the cliche princess fantasies.
B003INBNXO|5.0|My brother kept telling me to watch this movie, I finally did and I loved it.  The actor Donnie Yen did a very good job I think, it had a little humor, very good action and very good story telling. Even if your not a fan of these types of movie I think you can appreciate its story and the journey of Ip. Would surely recommend.
B004E547D8|5.0|This is one great flick! An ensemble cast in no particular order, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine! Yes, you did not misread, Ernest Borgnine! Many would remember him from The Wild Bunch, The Dirty Dozen or Airwolf, just to name a few. Bruce plays a C.I.A. retiree named Frank Moses who becomes enamored with Sarah , a young lady who works for the Pension Department. Over the years of retirement, Frank still tries to keep in shape & keep his senses sharp as ever. For good reason, he is on a hitlist which is being carried out by his former employer, the C.I.A.!!!!   A mission from 1981 comes back to haunt Frank & everyone involved in a greater conspiracy that could see the Vice President make a successful bid for the election of becoming the next President.   After he dispatches the hit team with devastating results, he meets Sarah & takes her with all around the country, meeting up with allies & trying to get to the bottom of this conspiracy.   The mayhem, chaos & fun continues right until the end! This movie never lets up! They maybe retired but they are still the best at what they do! Based on the comic book of the same name, it's just great to see all these actors & actresses have lots of fun doing what they do best!   Highly recommended!
B0036EH3WK|3.0|Everyone has said everything that can be said about LOST. A great television series and that's that. I want to talk about the features of the Complete Collection.    Lost: The Complete Collection comes with an assortment of neat little collector items, albeit, not in very high quality. The Senet game pieces are ordinary rocks and plastic pieces. The Ankh doesn't look anything like what is pictured, although it pulls apart to reveal a secret message. The Blu-ray guide is very high quality. Judging from the image of the \\"Island replica,\\" one could expect the replica to have some degree of 3D contours of the Island's surface - it doesn't. A blacklight was included, but I haven't had a chance to investigate the contents of the Complete Collection with it just yet.    The case for the discs is larger than normal. It will stand out in your Blu-Ray collection. To some people, that doesn't matter - to others (like me) it does. The texture of the case is grainy and calls up the impression of limestone ruins. Each of the individual seasons pulls out of the case in a single sleeve. The discs are secured in a paper fold of the season sleeve, cut to fit each disc. This is the biggest and most glaring drawback- the disc storage is abominable, but still better than the storage used for version one of [[ASIN:B001993Y2C Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with Collectible Cylon) [Blu-ray]]]. The disc rests on paper, with no plastic rings to elevate the disc and secure the read surface from damage.    LOST is a fantastic show. The three-star review does not reflect the quality of the show, rather, the quality of the product. The average-ness of extras such as the Senet game, the Ankh, or the black light are meh, and whatever, I can get over that. I bought The Complete Collection for the show. The discs for the show are stored in such a terrible and haphazard manner that it seems like too much thought went into designing a cool-looking box.    Over all, I'd say I'm content withmy purchase, but I'm also pretty disappointed as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|More than a thousand people have already reviewed the book, leaving me nothing new to say.  I am a science fiction fan who usually dislikes dystopia & post apocolypse themed novels, but I couldn't put this one down.  It is the first book in months to keep me up past bedtime. The premise is implausible, but the characters are compelling and the action so suspenseful one doesn't mind.  The story is very violent and is not appropriate for many younger tweens and teens who may wish to read it.
0956827810|5.0|As an audible customer and as the hard cover is out of print! Is this book available in audio format???
0743289412|5.0|I'm not one for words myself, but this book is written for the love of a train-of-thought story. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover for more reasons than I care to explain here. Though I love Stephen King novels, I feel this story would reach out to a wider audience than ever before. Give this book a chance and you won't regret it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I've seen this film three times in a theatre and I've ordered the DVD. Bush and Obama, the Democrats and the Republicans have all facilitated the biggest theft of public funds probably in the history of the world. None of these culprits shown in the film are headed for prison. In fact many have been promoted to even higher government positions. We have been duped. We are not \\"all in this together\\". Currently what is happening to the Unions in Wisconsin is the direct result of this crime of the century. These perpetrators are guilty of treason. They have created an economic crisis in this country and around the world that will last for years. Yet,while we tighten our belts they enlarge theirs. Please rent, stream or buy this documentary. Share it with friends, neighbors fellow workers. This nation is going under but there may still be time to stop the collapse or so I think. Demand these thieves be charged under the Rico Act and brought to justice. Until you arrest a bank robber they will continue to rob banks.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Although the film has big name stars, it really belongs to writer / director Stephen Gaghan, who took this complex story and cast it into a series of glimpses and hints, subtle but skillfuly rendered. Close attention is required to extrapolate from the little bits of information into the envelope of the whole global drama. This is filmaking of a high order not often seen from Hollywood. Bravo.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I've hiked solo in Canyonlands and Capitol Reef, in the slot canyons like Blue John (the scene of Aron Ralston's accident), down the Muley Twist, off trail more than on. I've always liked to hike solo, with my camera and now with enough iPods to last a whole backpack trip. I also telemark solo and kayak solo. I guess I'm a \\"hard hero\\" fool just like Aron Ralston, or at least I was at his age. Fatherhood made me take stock. My wife and son virtually shot me with a tranquilizer dart and planted a cell phone on me, though there's little threat of coverage where I like to go. As I said, it could have been Me that fell -- hey, I've fallen plenty -- and gotten my arm pinned under a boulder...<br /><br />... but there wouldn't be a film about me. I wouldn't have survived. I couldn't have done what Ralston did, couldn't have kept my sanity, couldn't have dared to hack off my own arm with a dull pocketknife. It's the impact of 'identifying' with Ralston that makes this film powerful for me, not the cinematography of the slightly dippy acting of James Franco. If you aren't a bit of a \\"hard hero\\" outdoorsy fool, I fear you'll be impatient with this film. No sweat; there are plenty of others.<br /><br />I read about Ralston's astounding survival in the newspaper just after he reached the hospital. I read Ralston's own account, in the book \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\\". Now I've seen the film. I knew what to expect when he levered his forearm until the bones snapped, so that he could hack through the flesh, and yet my heart almost hammered through my ribs at the scene. Between the film and the book, I wouldn't hesitate for a wink to recommend the book, but the film is way above Hollywood average.
0061726826|4.0|This book was pretty slow in the beginning.  Took me over a hundred pages to really get into it, but man I'm glad I kept with it.  The ending was jam packed with action.  I think this is more of a love story to me, than Hunger Games.  I do agree with other reviewers that this is not a new storyline - it is close to \\"the Uglies\\" and also the new book \\"Matched\\".  But I'm glad I read it and I'm recommending it to my coworkers.  Can't wait to read the next book.  If you liked this, try Hunger Games, Matched, and Graceling series.
0756404738|5.0|Much of the time I was reading I had little anxiety flutters because I knew the book was going to end. That's how much I enjoyed it. Not much Lethani in that, but it's the truth.     A fine read. Go ahead and get it.
067144901X|5.0|My 2-year old twin girls LOVE this book. We have several Sandra Boynton books, and this one is by far their favorite. This is a perfect bedtime book, as it is a quick, easy story that will involve your children without causing them to become overly animated, and it can be read several times in a row without eating up a ton of time.
B0046UGSNS|2.0|Mark Ruffalo played a great character in this movie, and I was disappointed that he was blamed for everything and chased away at the end of the story.
B004IM14RY|4.0|Wasnt really expecting much from this movie, but was glued to my PC after renting it. It starts out a bit slow, but the story keeps you involved. Loved Reynolds, his acting is really good, too bad he didnt take his shirt off :-). Overall a bit surprised how the picture made our government look like. Dont want to give out the details but even though it's a one man show, the story is very believable and makes you wonder about many current issues.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|latest in the line of Bruce Willis action movies. this is the best of the series, because it uses retired cia operators as the main characters. excellent combination of humor and drama.
B002ZG981E|1.0|I have to say that of all of the movies that I've watched in the last 30 years this one is in to top 10 worst movies. It stunk. For the life of me I can't understand why people were so impressed with this movie. If I could give it negative stars I would. And yes, I get the story line - it's not really all that complex - it's about planting an idea into someone's subconscious. And the way the movie ended, I was like \\"oh my gosh you have got to be kidding me!\\" Walk, don't run, away from this movie. You're much better off buying just about anything than this garbage.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|This movie was amazing. Mamoru Hosoda (Director) is getting the publicity that he deserves, directing spectacular movies that are worthy of becoming classics. \\"Summer Wars\\" is a movie for the now, involving the technological views of today and blending it into a masterpiece that all can enjoy. Like how Disney classics are portrayed as being a film of all ages, I believe \\"Summer Wars\\" will be a 21st Century classic. Winning awards for having simply outstanding artwork and animation, seeing it in 1080p resolution will blow your mind. Without a doubt, a must watch for those looking to see an all around amazing piece of work.
1400032717|3.0|The book gave a great new perspective to what it is like to have a personality disorder, since the book is written in the point of view from a child that is presumed to have Asperger's syndrome. However, it did not have a great finish to it, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|I purchased and read the first two books in the Song of Fire and Ice series on my Kindle, and they were both great--not just in terms of the story, but also the formatting of the Kindle editions.     I've only read the first few pages at this point, so I can't speak to the story yet; but the Kindle file is terrible. No chapter breaks, maps are small and blurry (completely useless). I just don't understand why the same care wasn't put into formatting this book as the publisher put into the first two.     Don't buy this title on Kindle--the paperback is cheaper anyway. That's how I'll be reading Feast for Crows (and I won't be getting it from Amazon).
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|The title says most of what needs to be said.  I loved the set.  The BD/DVD is perfect.  All the pictures are nice.  Good quality book with a bit of interesting history.  The certificate was slightly bent, but that didn't bother me.  However, the music box was very, very tin-like.  I was very disappointed in it.  I expected it to be have a cheap snow globe-like sound to it, but it really sounded bad.  The speed of the song sounded quite off as well, much faster than the movie, and the pauses were slightly off.
B0036OS3HY|5.0|I bought a pair of boots at the beginning of winter and after wearing them for a month or so my feet would freeze and get wet. I started searching for a pair of boots that would be both warm and waterproof and I came across the crocs. After reading the reviews I decided to try a pair and I am glad I did. I bought the yellow pair as they were half the price of the black ones...for $40 less, I didn't care what color they were! I am out in the elements all the time for work and these boots have not let me down yet. I did buy a size larger and at first I was unsure if this was the right decision, but I like to wear heavy socks, so the extra room allowed for this. If I had gone with my true size I think they would have been too tight with fuzzy socks. I have gotten numerous compliments on my yellow boots and I wear them proudly! Next year, I plan on buying these boots for the whole family.
B004PUG7MG|1.0|Okay so the last review I left for this album wasn't a very nice one. Let me take back what I said. This is not Avril's best album. I had high hopes because of \\"What the hell\\". I had hoped that she would produce more music like that song. I am not a fan of ballads. I like my songs fast and fun! With out the swearing. I know I said I like \\"What the hell\\" and that has swear words. However, I think it would be an even better song with out the swearing! That is just my opinion. You don't need a song that says \\"Damn, damn, damn\\" in the chorus. I might like the \\"clean\\" version better. (if there is one!) Anyway, this is not Avril's best CD. Although black star is very pretty.
1591843790|5.0|As an avid Guy reader, I have to say he is getting better with age. This books really lays it on the line and teaches customer service, branding, and company culture better than any other book I have read. Great job and you would be making a big mistake for not getting the book.
0066620996|5.0|I have read few things that have stuck with me so long as Jim Collin's Hedgehog Concept. The Hedgehog Concept is a central theme in understanding what can propel a company from good to great. It also highlights the importance of knowing your business and your customer, rather than flailing about trying to 'reinvent' every time there is a shift in the market or a dip in profitability, which is excellent advice for business leaders operating within our current economy.     This book provides insights to leadership, change, and a broad view across industries and traits and behaviors that successful companies and their leadership share in common. Lots of wisdom here on how to lead, not be distracted by ego, and to identify your company's Hedgehog Concept.
0525951652|2.0|As a fan of good, hefty historical novels, I sought out Follet's latest tome, Fall of Giants.  I should have passed.  All his usual faults are in place, his ignorance of the real social mores of the early twentieth century, his cardboard characters, but most of all his leaden prose.  I tried, I really tried to ignore the awful writing, but it just kept intruding into the story.  He may me a good storyteller, but anyone with a liking for good writing, and a decent knowledge of social history should ignore this book.
0307454541|4.0|I've read all three of the trilogy and they are wonderful. A heroine who is smart, tiny but mighty. Vengence is hers. The violence seems secondary to the story. I wonder what the American remake of the film will be like?? Can't be as great as the first one.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|My first introduction to the blues and what an introduction.  You may not believe this but I listen to it every night, sometimes more than once.  gregg allman's voice is smooth, soothing and even sexy?  Ifind myself humming the songs throughout the day.
0061743526|5.0|I bought this for my wife who is a real fan of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", Atticus, Scout, Jim and Boo.  She has the DVD and watches it while doing her chores and cooking in the kitchen.  She can almost recite the movie's dialogue.  This was a great gift at Christmas.  She has read it now and claims it was very close to the movie, rather than the movie being close to the book.  It is of very good quality and we have proudly added it to our library.  It arrived quickly and no damage and the price was excellent!  Gordon Ferguson
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This Movie is a KEEPER!      The movie is kinda a love story which is not necessarily about the polarized News and a little bit like the movie `Working Girl' but other than that I can't tell you anymore without spoiling it for you.
B004BLJQOK|2.0|I did not love this. I thought there would be some out there American interpretation. It was as if the same screenplay from Let The Right One In was used. Movies spoil books!
0393324818|5.0|With sports and statistics coming together, Lewis has a perfect recipe for a great book.  But Moneyball is far more than a book on baseball and statistics.  It is about using analytics to create a competitive advantage.  It is about questioning conventional thinking and by doing so discovering innovative ways of delivering business results.  And it is about leadership and the courage to do things differently.  You don't have to be a baseball fanatic to enjoy this book.  The storytelling Lewis provides and the characters he describes are highly engaging and made Moneyball impossible for me to put down.  I highly recommend this book.
030746363X|3.0|very interesting book, and it is huge! it looks more like a college textbook.  diet is very hard to keep up.  I travel for my job and its nearly impossible to pack a lunch to eat this way.
B004FQKY5Q|4.0|I am so tempted to give this a 5 star rating just because Marie is back and in excellent form. Realistically though I would rate it a 3.5 or so. It is really good overall but is lacking any of the real hit potential that is present in most of their past works. There are no power ballads here that are truly moving. There are no really catchy hard rocking cuts either. It is more toward the middle and kind of a safe effort for them. I get the feeling of more of a \\"B\\" side collection here, which in their case says a lot. After all Silver Blue was the \\"B\\" side of The Look! I don't expect every album to be the same and they surely haven't been for Roxette but every other release pretty much opens with an up-tempo track like \\"How Do You Do?\\" or \\"The Look\\". Then you have your \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" and \\"Salvation\\" type ballads that are just missing from this release.    I really think this is more of a celebration album for Marie to return to form. I hope we continue to see new work from them in the future and that she has a long career left. I truly am very happy just to be listening to new music from them. After I listen to this 20 times or 50 times I might come back and apologize as I know it will grow on me more as I get used to it!
0307269191|5.0|I do not know the fiction of Murikami. But if it is as good as this small memoir it is very good indeed. Murkima tells us about his life as a runner which began when he was thirty- three. In parallel he tells us about his life as a writer. In the course of this he distills lessons about the two activities which bring him joy in his life. He at one point emphasizes the supreme importance of Focus. For four hours a day Murikami sits at his table and writes. Nothing disturbs and nothing else exists. In working he may be listening to music but he is too focusing on the goal and the task. Along with Focus the second Value he endorses is Endurance. Murikami tells us he runs every day at least six days a week. One rule of his is never let two days in a row go without running. His claim is that the muscles tend to readily lose their good condition, and lapse back into a lower level of fitness. He also speaks about the pain which comes with running, and the option of regarding it as suffering or instead knowing how to work through it. The book is full of stories of various marathons triathalons that Murikami has gone through. He is obviously a person of superior will and discipline. He in the course of this also tells the story of how he became a novelist, of how he persisted in this encouraged by the support of his readers. Murkami also analyses his own character in this memoir. He points out how much he enjoys being alone and working by himself. He speaks about his running and his writing as activities in which he is not in competition with others but rather only contending with his own goals and the tasks he has set for himself. He writes in a very clear and vivid way. The book is well- paced and is a real pleasure to read.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|Every now and then a movie comes along that jumpstarts a genre that has grown tedious, tired and torpid.  Witness the stream of 3-D computer-generated animations that beg for our attention.  And then Rango saunters onto the scene.  Like the dry wasteland this self-proclaimed lizard hero enters, so is the domain of contending cgi comic iterations assaulting our senses.<br /><br />The first daring and glorious decision the cool kids at Nickelodeon and Blind Wink made was to forgo 3-D for a bright, crisp, highly detailed and daringly artistic two dimensional world that verges between the merely surreal and a full-blown lucid fever dream.  I couldn't help but think of Carlos Costeneda.<br /><br />Directed with a loose hand by Gore Verbinski from a terrifically unhinged screenplay by John Logan (THE AVIATOR) the story follows a pet lizard, a terrarium-bound, hipster, stand-up chameleon in a Hawaiian shirt (and no pants) with dreams of going on a hero's adventure a la Joseph Campbell's mythic conceit.  Suddenly, out of the blue, an accident thrusts him into his adventure.  Rango goes without a name for a while and then defines himself as western gunslinger Rango who will save the town of Dirt from its manufactured drought.  Yes, Rango is true to the beats of the mythic hero's journey and true to form, finally brings the elixir to the desperate town's inhabitants of semi-civilized varmints and assorted desert dwellers -- all of whom are voiced and designed with a finesse rarely seen.<br /><br />The thing that I really liked about Rango -- the character and the movie -- is that all the self-referential material, the homages and the sly winks to the adult audience never seemed in any way contrived or condescending.  It was part of the tapestry from frame one.<br /><br />Rango is a terrific icon of our shared, post-modern, existential dilemma of not being able to escape our own story.  I love that.  But ironically, the film allows us to do just that - even if for only 90 or so minutes.  Don't miss this sly masterpiece about how to dream and live the life you desire.s sly masterpiece about how to dream and live the life you desire.
B004FQKY5Q|4.0|I was so excited for a new Roxette album, been hoping and praying over the last 10 years that Marie would even be around to contribute and if she did that the result would be good. Good news it's a great album, cohesively as a whole production, but there are very few songs that shine individually. More than ever now Per shows signs of his influence by The Fab Four - so much it's almost like a tribute album.     That said, \\"Way Out,\\" \\"Dream On, \\"Nothing On But The Radio,\\" \\"Big Black Cadillac,\\" and \\"Only When I dream\\" are the standouts here. while that may seem like a lot for one album, this is from a fan who considered almost the entire album of Have A Nice Day, Joyride and Crash Boom Bang to be full of \\"stand outs.\\" Interesting that this time around Per's songs seem to shine more than Marie's but as noted I'm thankful she is here to make an effort and what she gives is still good, just not the highlights of the release.    This is still much better than most of what's out on current American radio, it's just that compared to past releases, it's not as strong as a release for Per and Marie. But that still means it's pretty darn good.
B003L20IFQ|2.0|I don't see credit given to the true experience of Roy Hallums who, in 2004, while a contractor in Iraq was captured by terrorists and buried alive.  His incredible story is worth finding and reading.<br /><br />That said, the movie version of this similar story is a masterpiece of clever filmmaking.  Everything takes place inside a coffin-like box.  Ryan Reynolds is terrific as the encased victim and director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s captures everything with a creative use of unexpected camera angles and masterful lighting, sound design and editing.  The move never cuts away to flashbacks or actions above ground.  As one might expect, this taut tale is extremely claustrophobic, and utterly terrifying.  In many ways, this movie, though confined to a single location, kind of reminded me of an Indiana Jones set piece.  But it's really more like a Hitchcock murder mystery about a victim in a box instead of a locked room.
B004FGMV0W|2.0|The best thing about Avril is that she always expresses what she wants.  I anticipated this album because she kept saying how hard she fought for it. Her record company was on to something. She was a huge inspiration to me as a songwriter growing up, with Let Go.  But, after Under My Skin I got a little bit worried.  Lyrically it fell flat and I had a hard time relating to most of the tracks. The Best Damn Thing picked me back up because it felt like it was better then Under My Skin and had a lot more layers in the music. Still nothing like the maturity and detail in the lyrics as in Let Go. So, when What the Hell came out, all I heard was a girl who liked to sleep around with guys then sing a little diddy, and repeat \\"whoa oh\\" and \\"what\\" ever other bar.  What the hell indeed. Like a die-hard Avril Fan, I still bought the CD Goodbye Lullaby the day it was released.  I am not impressed.  What made Let Go so much fun was the variety in the melody's, lyrics, and tempo.  Under My Skin hit us at that age when we feel a little dark and needed to really talk about heartbreak with songs like Forgotten and My Happy Ending.  The Best Damn Thing came out when we were at college partying and having fun, Hot and Contagious.  Goodbye Lullaby is sang in the key of E, nearly every song.  Is she trying to cover this up by singing an octave higher? It doesn't work.  The lyrics repeat themselves in other songs; smile, love, lalala.  How many times has she said she wants to 'loose control' (Runaway!)  There is a lack of maturity and depth to the lyrics and music except in two songs Everybody Hurts and Darlin. Black Star is the name of her perfume and does not add anything to the CD, why is it there?  The Deluxe, those are not acoustic tracks her voice is modified, we've heard Alice a hundred times, Bad Reputation belongs to Joan Jett.  She couldn't come up with something original to offer the fans in the last two years she's been trying to make up this record. It is a horrible CD.  So,my two stars go like this.  One Gold Star for Everybody Hurts and another Gold Star for the effort, she tried.  But Avril, since you are signed to a record company, have access to the industry, next time find some musicians that tell you the truth when all of your songs sound exactly the same. I just bought this CD, and only liked one song. I hope you have better luck.
B004CIIXFA|4.0|The hard, gritty life of fifteen-year old wanna-be hip hop dancer Mia (newcomer Kate Jarvis) is tested to the limit when her mom moves a new boyfriend into their apartment.  This terrific film won the Cannes Jury Prize and is perhaps the best recent example of British social realism, a genre that persists from the 50s. Writer director Andrea Arnold has forged a nearly flawless character-driven film that is not quickly forgotten, especially young Jarvis.
0671027344|4.0|If you're looking for a light and interesting book, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky is the perfect choice. It is a series of letters written to an anonymous person all from the perspective of the main character, Charlie. This style allows for simple and informal language. Charlie writes in the first person and talks directly to the reader, making the story very relatable. Charlie tells stories of his everyday life about being a 9th grader. Charlie starts his writing because he is nervous for high school, something almost all readers can relate to. He takes the reader on a journey through the struggles a typical 9th grader goes through.   The reader is introduced to all types of people that have touched Charlie in some way. Each member of his group of friends adds a little spark to the story. Some of his friends include Sam, Patrick, and Mary Elizabeth.  Sam is a strong and compassionate girl, who helps console Charlie. Charlie develops a crush on Sam, which leads to an unexpected twist at the end. Patrick is a character that is always looking for adventure. Patrick is homosexual and his struggle with the secrecy of his partner and other people's judgments are exposed throughout the novel. Mary Elizabeth is a free spirit, who is always up to debate. Charlie's opinion of Mary Elizabeth shifts throughout the novel based on the experiences they encounter together. The author combines these characters, along with many others, to develop a unique friend circle. Every reader will be able to find a person in this novel that they can relate to. A great deal of the novel in spent on Charlie's family. Charlie idolizes his older brother, a football star at Penn State. Charlie is protective of his sister and strives to gain her acceptance. Charlie also tells funny stories of times when his whole family is together, again something that is very relatable.   Charlie is dependent on his English teacher, Bill. They develop a special relationship, which Charlie uses for support to get him through high school.  This book is not in the least bit dense. There is hardly any plot. It is a story of a boy describing his days. Some letters are just filled with Charlie rambling on. However, I enjoyed how ordinary the story was.  Charlie offered opinions on a lot of different parts of life. I liked hearing someone else's opinion about events everyone has been through. The book also made me look at little things differently. \\"I think that these are the glory days for that boy, and this moment will just be another story someday because all the people who make touchdowns and home runs will become somebody's dad.\\" (page 53) This made me realize how an experience in high school that seems so significant will be looked back upon as a trivial thing.   At first, I found it difficult to get past the choppiness of the writing. Charlie's sentences are short and to the point.  \\"I didn't enclose a return address for the same reason. I mean nothing bad by this. Honest.\\" (page 2). This structure is very noticeable throughout the novel, but after a while I began to appreciate its simplicity. I wouldn't like it if all novels were written this way, but it was a nice change from typical novels. It made the book effortless to read.    If you have some free time, you should get a copy of this book. This book is a short read, yet each letter has something different to offer. Each is witty and simple in its own way. Each person who reads this book will find something in the book that they can relate to, as well as something in the book that they will then view differently.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Has there ever been a time when there was not a war somewhere on our planet?  War lessons from the past can inform us with warnings and insight.  But do we really learn anything?<br /><br />Documentarian Errol Morris deservedly won an Oscar© for THE FOG OF WAR: ELEVEN LESSONS FROM THE LIFE OF ROBERT S. MCNAMARA.  There's no fog in McNamara's startling, emotional, confessional rationalization of his life and involvement in the Vietnam strategy as Secretary of Defense under JFK and Lyndon Johnson.  It is as chilling and riveting as anything I can think of.  Everyone concerned about the globalization of religion and politics should see this searing film about the limited ability of humans to manage and contain threats to security and freedom.  And there's the ever-present cold-blooded rationale to stop killing by killing in ever-more massive onslaughts. Question: Can you really confront evil with evil?
0198326769|3.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, by John Boyne   Book Review:   The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a quick read and not one that I wanted to put down.  The book is unlike other Holocaust books that I have read because the main character Bruno is German and has a different understanding of the Holocaust, perhaps not even one at all. Bruno is an ignorant nine-year-old boy. \\"What exactly was the difference? He wondered to himself.  And who decided which people wore the striped pajamas and which people wore the uniforms?\\" Bruno now lives on the outside; his father had moved his family from Berlin to Out-With.  Bruno used to be in the center of all the action in Berlin and always had something fun to do.  Once he arrives at Out-With, he becomes bored and lonely, forcing him to explore.  The only people around were the ones behind the fence in the striped pajamas.  One day while exploring Bruno meets a boy named Shmuel and they have many things in common, except for the fact that they lived on different sides of the fence.  They meet every day and talk about life. One day Bruno tells him, \\"Well because Germany is the greatest of all countries, Bruno replied, remembering something that he had overheard Father discussing with Grandfather on any number of occasions.  We are superior.\\" This quote made me think of the various perceptions of the Holocaust and on life.  Every country appears to be ethnocentric at times, but it is interesting how it is imbedded into children's minds.  For instance, if you asked me what was the best country I would say America without hesitation, just as Bruno says Germany and Shmuel says Poland. Every person has a skewed perception of life.    While reading the book Night, a nonfiction memoir, by Ellie Wiesel I got an understanding of what life was like living through the Holocaust and it was interesting to compare it to The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (fiction) which is told from the outside.  When Bruno asks his father about the people in the striped pajamas he replies, \\"`Ah. Those people', said father, nodding his head and smiling slightly.  `Those people... well, they're not people at all, Bruno.'\\"  Bruno's father saw the Jews as inhumane while Ellie Wiesel saw the soldiers and people like Bruno's father as inhuman.  Bruno does not understand why Shmuel is always sad and so skinny and Shmuel cannot find a way to explain it to him.  Even if he could, I doubt that Bruno would believe him because Bruno's father is partially responsible for the pain and suffering that Shmuel was in.  No matter how mean or scary he can be, Bruno sees his father as a hero just as most kids do.    If you enjoy reading about the Holocaust, like I do, I would read this story; however, do not have too high expectations.  Before I read the book I was told how good it was and I had to read it.  After reading it, I did not have the same enthusiasm that my friend had.  I enjoyed the book as I read it, but I did not like how it ended and I am not sure John Boyne got his point across.  Night is a more compelling book and gives you more insight on the Holocaust and what life was like.   I was happy that I read Night before I read The Boy in the Striped Pajamas because I knew what Shmuel experienced and knew exactly what was going on.  It also allowed me to guess the ending and know what Bruno was about to get himself into.  Although Bruno does not completely understand what went on, on the other side of the fence \\"he put his face to the glass and saw what was out there, and this time when his eyes opened wide and his mouth made the shape of an O, his hands stayed by his sides because something made him feel very cold and unsafe.\\"
B004EQAVFU|4.0|Don't miss this powerful and touching movie about the bonds and friendships among a group of English children at a boarding school with a shocking secret --<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />They have been bred as clones for spare parts.<br /><br />ALERT OVER:<br /><br />I was mesmerized by the story and the poignancy of the circumstances.  But mostly I was reminded how fleeting life is for all of us.  This great film directed by Mark Romanek and starring Cary Mulligan, Keira Knightly and Andrew Garfield haunted me for days - and that's a good thing.  Time called the source material \\"the novel of the decade\\" and I can see why.
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki enchanted me many years ago.  At first, through his books.  And then, through his interaction, conversation and inspiration.  So when he sent me a copy of ENCHANTMENT to review, I was blown away by the note he penned: \\"Mani, resisting you is futile\\".<br /><br />That's exactly how I feel about Guy Kawasaki.  And in his book ENCHANTMENT I found the reasons why he is such an enchanter.  It's a formula anyone can follow, broken down into a step-by-step gameplan to go through.<br /><br />And there's something for everyone - a non-profit volunteer seeking enchantment for his cause, a hard-working employee wanting to enchant her boss, the energetic entrepreneur looking to enchant his team, workers and investors - even the harried husband who dreams of enchanting his wife!<br /><br />A pleasant, easy, yet value-packed read, ENCHANTMENT ranks among one of the best 3 books I've read this year - and if it works even one-third as well as I expect it to, I'll become like the 'Pied Piper of Hamelin' - and enchant donors and supporters of my non-profit work with children battling congenital heart defects (the story is in [[ASIN:B004MDLVO0 47 Hearts]]).
B002ZG99TK|3.0|It's rare when an exciting theatrical poster doesn't even begin to convey the true action of the film it's advertising! UNSTOPPABLE is old-school filmmaking notched to the nth degree.  Instead of photorealistic computer effects, director Tony Scott uses real railroad tracks, engines and cars for the high-speed race against time to stop a runaway train laden with deadly, volatile chemicals heading for Scranton, PA.  It's all \\"inspired by actual events.\\"  Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer and Chris Pine is the novice conductor and it's up to them to resolve personal differences and bring this impending epic disaster to a halt.  Rosario Dawson costars.  The Blu-ray is loaded with interesting and watchable extras.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult has done it again. With her talent and vivid description she has yet again created another captivating novel, Nineteen Minutes. Although this time she has touched upon a whole new topic, a school shooting. Picoult's story takes place at Sterling High School and in the lives of both adults and 11th grade children. In this book she explores the shooting from the perspective of the victims and the shooter himself. In a grueling court case, readers are intrigued as they discover the truths behind this event.   In this book, she not only explores a theme of violence but also discusses what it means to be a teenager and the struggles that acompany this period of life. Nineteen Minutes discusses the idea of teenage love, sexuality, the relationship between child and parent, and bullying which relates directly to our world today. The book heavlily touches upon the theme of \\"knowing who you are.\\" This is an ongoing question raised in the book. Characters are found toying with their role or purpose in life and what they could have, would have, and should have done. But as they all learn, you cannot change the past as much as you would like. \\"You can't undo something that's happened; you can't take back a word that's already been said out loud. You'll think about me and wish that you had been able to talk me out of it, I guess I should tell you don't blame yourself; his isn't your fault, but that would be a lie. I didn't get her by myself.\\" (page 1)   Bullying is unfortunately apparent in every high school. Picoult brings to reality the extent bullying can have on a child and the drastic measures a victim of bullying can take. In a tasteful, not dull, manner, Picoult reinforces basic rules that we all learned in pre- school such as \\"treat others the way you want to be treated.\\" Readers are put into the shoes of the shooter and go back and forth between feeling sorry for him and having absolutely no sympathy at all.   Since I have read many of Picoult's novels, I am familiar with her style and her usage of a \\"court trial.\\" I have to say I have gotten pretty good at predicting her twisted endings and unexpected outcomes, however I was stumped with this book. Even though she brought back some of her old characters like Patrick, Jordan and Selena, the ending was very unexpected and as interesting as ever. There was never a dull moment even when she went into detail about court arraignments and information about the legal system. Picoult managed to write the book with a twist on each page.   I recommend this book specifically to kids in high school. I am a high- schooler myself and I have throughly enjoyed this book. I was contstantly kept on my toes and found it to be very relatable to my own school and my own personal life. It is amazing how Jodi Picoult as an adult can capture the lives of a high schooler almost perfectly.   \\"In Nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third hockey game. In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five. Nineteen minutes is how long it took the Tennesse Titans to sell out of tickets to the play- offs. It's the length of a sitcom, minus commercials. It's the driving distance from the Vermont border to the town of Sterling, New Hampshire. In nineteen minutes, you can order a pizza and get it delivered. You can read a story to a child or have your oil changed. You can walk a mile. You can sew a hem. In nineteen minutes you can stop the world, or you just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge.\\"   Everything in this quote is true, yet it only took me nineteen seconds to get hooked on this book.
0312383436|2.0|As has been noted by other reviewers, there is a disconnect between Sophie Kinsella books and Madeline Wickham books.  I agree, but being an avid reader, and someone author loyal, I've decided to give Madeline Wickham a try (I've read about 4 of her other books).  While MW stories are not nearly as lighthearted as SK stories (the characters often have fewer redeeming characteristics, a bit mean spirited, the storylines are heavier), this was by far my least favorite.  Perhaps it was because I just finished reading the lighthearted and surprisingly touching The Twenties Girl.    At any rate, I found this book difficult to finish, especially considering it is chick lit.  The plot seemed too over the edge, the characters were immeadiately unlikeable, and I felt that while it tried to end happily ever after it didn't seem to resolve anything.    I'll think twice before reading another Madeline Wickham.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|This show is so refreshing, almost brings me back to the X-files era.... The show leaves you intrigued to watch the next show, and what's great is it's not a reality show, and is geared towards adults. No mindless chattering about social life, or celebrities. An entertaining and mind boggling show that should remain on the air for as long as the fans stay intrigued.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|If you are a man of a certain age, you are familiar with the work of the A-list 80s action stars - Schwarzenegger, Stallone and Willis.  It was very cool to see them all in one scene together.  You are also familiar with the B-list action stars and the Z-list action movies of the 80s.  Heck, I've seen Cannon Films messterpieces in the theater!  Those movies were simple, didn't require you to think too much, had a few cool set-pieces and one-liners, and gave you something cool to talk to your friends about the next day.<br /><br />\\"The Expendables\\" is just that kind of 80s action movie.  The plot is simple, the characters are larger-than-life, and the movie doesn't worry a lot about backstory or plausibility.  We're thrust into the world of the Expendables, and either you buy into it or you don't.  The script makes it easy for you to buy into it.  I really enjoyed seeing the huge group of 80s and 90s action stars (including Dolph Lundgren!) as well.  These guys are experienced actors and really know what they're doing in a movie like this.  Part of the genius of keeping it simple is giving these actors a chance to do what they do best in front of a pretty basic canvas.  Stallone, who is consistently better at writing and directing than he gets credit for, brings his A-game to this film.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't care for was the intrusion of 21st century shakycam and quick edit techniques.  I realize this movie didn't have a huge budget, and the actors are getting older, and these techniques are often used to reduce the need for precise fight choreography.  But, sometimes the viewer is left not quite understanding what's going on.  Along those lines, during the big boss fight at the end, you can't even tell which of our good guys is actually fighting him.<br /><br />Having said that, \\"The Expendables\\" is at least worth a rent if you like or are interested in 80s action films.  Recommended.
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferris is good at evaluating basic assumptions. He analyzes and deconstructs how things work and comes up with new methods that are simpler and more effective.  In this case he looks at Diet and Exercise and Fitness amongst other things and offers simpler, minimalist methods to tackle Fitness.    My personal experience with the Low-Carb diet/Temperature manipulation allowed me to lose 14 pounds in 2 months, pants waist size from 34 to 32  and a 3.5% decrease in Bodyfat(I have my tracking data support my claim).    I am now trying the \\"Swing Minimalist\\" Russian Kettlebell workout, with awesome posture and posterior improvements in general. I can't wait to test the rest of the principles.    I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to transform their body with simple but effective solutions.     The last thing I want to add that I like about this book are the resources Tim used in the book. From PHD's, doctors, to professional bodybuilders and fitness experts/pioneers back up the foundations of the book.
B004APVI1G|4.0|I knew virtually nothing about this movie before it was delivered to me. I had just gotten a new 3D TV and was looking for some movies to watch in 3D and this seemed like a good choice. I was not even aware of the book series by Kathryn Lasky but decided the movie could be entertaining to watch.<br /><br />When I watched it for the first time I was interested in the standards of morality promoted by the movie; the age-old conflict between good and evil was clearly defined.<br /><br />The temptations that evil might present to some and the difficulty of resisting if one is not solidly grounded by a moral framework is presented in a way younger audiences can appreciate.<br /><br />The movie is an adventure filled with excitement, danger, and heroic acts of bravery. The 3D effect is nicely done and the surround sound very good.<br /><br />I've not seen the 2D version but would recommend this movie for the family as it promotes those qualities most of us want for ourselves and those we love.

1591843790|5.0|Common sense and creative insights on how to enchant people and make them join your cause.    This book is much more than simple advice on how to do things right or how big companies do things right. You'll have fun reading it because you will relate to the stories and will feel empowered by the practices suggested by Guy Kawasaki.    A very enjoyable read that's amazingly enlightening and inspiring.     Highly recommended to anyone!

1897093519|5.0|Readers will be surprised to read this nineteenth century \\"horror story,\\" because the English woman Mary W. Shelley (1797-1851) did not write this book as it is shown in the many motion pictures that were made of it. She published this gothic tale, which many scholars see as the earliest version of a science fiction novel when she was only 21. Scholars think that she wrote it as an attack against the emerging industrial revolution, but perhaps, as we will see, it is more than that. The story is written in the delightful style of its time, like the mystery tale of the Englishman Wilke Collins, which was serialized in 1859-1860 and published in 1860, The Woman in White, which some scholars say is the first detective story, while others give the honor to Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849).<br /><br />Mary Shelley became the wife of the famous poet Percy Shelley after writing her novel. She subtitled it The Modern Prometheus. According to some but not all Greek myths, Prometheus was a giant who created people and latter brought them fire. It appears that the Prometheus in the tale is the creator Frankenstein, who was not a giant in height, but in intellect. Most people consider Prometheus a hero, but not Shelley. She thought of fire as being bad because it caused people to kill and eat animals and gave people more implements with which to wage war and murder people. Frankenstein tells the story to a man who saved him while he is pursuing the man he created. He warns the man not to pursue scientific goals that will harm humanity.<br /><br /> The Shelley story is about an educated man of science who was born in Switzerland and educated in a German university, who is interested in helping people. Everyone who meets him likes him. He comes from an educated amicable family who love him, and he loves them. He searches for an answer to what is life. He wonders if he can create life, and succeeds in doing so. He creates an eight-foot man, who is never named in the novel. He is repulsed by the man he creates and thinks of him as a monster as soon as the man is alive. All people who later see his creation are also repulsed and this causes the man to hide and live alone and it accounts for the profound loneliness that the man feels. His creator becomes depressed at what he has done, rushes away from his lab, and is sick in bed for four months. He is Frankenstein. The unnamed man he created leaves.<br /><br /> Frankenstein returns home from Germany and discovers that someone killed his younger brother. He is convinced that the man he created did it, and pursues him to kill him. He meets his creation and is unable to harm him because the man is larger and stronger than he. His creation tells Frankenstein that he killed his brother by mistake. The boy saw him, was disgusted at seeing him, and started shouting. All he did was place his hand over the boy's mouth. He tells how he has been traveling about for more than a year, found that every human despises him, and has become very lonely. He begs Frankenstein to make him a female companion because he, like the biblical Adam, can't live alone. Frankenstein agrees.<br /><br /> However, when he finishes making the female he becomes frightened that two monsters, as he thinks of them, could harm mankind. So he destroys the female. The man he created is enraged and vows vengeance against Frankenstein for destroying his life.<br /><br /> What happens to Frankenstein and the man he created, I will leave for readers to read and enjoy. Will the creation carry out his threat? If yes, how? Which of the two will outlive the other? What will the survivor do? Is it right to call Frankenstein's creation a monster because of the way he looks? Readers may also want to ask themselves: is Mary Shelly's pessimistic approach to scientific advances justified?<br /><br /> Perhaps there is another interpretation of the story.

159448385X|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I read The Kite Runner first and I did like that book better, but I am not sure if it was just because I read it first. Read this for a book club and it brought up great conversation.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|People who saw this show in a conventional theater, such as on Broadway, as I did, will enjoy seeing that this show is more superb because of the larger location. The sound on the video is clear, and viewers can understand the words that are sung. The filming and costumes are excellent. It is backed up by three large TV screens so that the large audience in the theater can have close ups, and this also enhances the viewing and pleasure of DVD viewer.
0393338827|1.0|Not only did I not understand what were CDO's , or was it CSO's( though I suspect I have plenty of fellow unknowing travellers ), I don't understand why this book is so well received.  The subject would have made an OK article, but whole book ????  Please.        Lewis must have repeated the same story line a dozen times, ie smart, nerdy  guys short stocks and other paper then go around everywhere trying to learn what they aren't seeing. Boring. I guess there was something wothwhile in learning of one of those worlds we common people do not know exist, but the author did not need a whole book to educate us.   I suggest there is a lot less than meets the eye in this book.
B00117QA0K|5.0|This show is not stupid. It is well written, well acted, and has great music. If it was on Fox it would have been cancelled after two shows. Yeah it's that good.
B000002JOH|1.0|I got a Lady Gaga CD the other week and ever since then I've really been getting into music. I'm really digging this CD by the brutal death metal band Panther. The groovy rhythems make me want 2 dance, and the guitarist is really talented I hope I can meet him at their next concert!!<br /><br />I'm a little put off by the fact all the songs are either about hitting a guy or wanting to hit a guy, but we all have our days, LOL. :D  XD
B003EH2WN4|5.0|Breaking Bad is at the top of my list of favorite shows. A perfect blend of character portrayals, drama, humor, and action. You'll want to actually get the whole series, but this little featurette will refresh your memory of where the story has been, and what may possibly lay ahead.<br /><br />The character portrayals are stellar. Some of the marital conflict portions can be somewhat slow.<br /><br />Each episode begins with what turn out to be a clue to a coming piece of the saga of a chemistry teacher, drug dealers, and other characters, and how their lives intertwine.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|If you love Horse Racing you will Love this Movie. History & A Record was made by this Horse and it will never be broken by any Horse again. I was able to visit this Horse when he retired to stud and he was a show-off & Bigger than I thought he was!!!!!!! I will always remember him as a hero in racing!!
B004FGMV0W|4.0|Ok, so here's my take on this new record. 4.5 Stars!!!  Here's why.  It's a little toned down from her past releases.  But I will be careful how it used \\"toned down\\".  Some others here-in mention it's an album full of 'ballads'.  Where I might agree I also disagree too.  This record definately has a lighter side, which is perfectly fine.  Good that she got it out now, and she'll get back into her Punk-self in the coming years (we'll have to wait and see?)  BUT.....after 4yrs a divorce and growing pains getting through it (mutually-according to Avril) this album is actually quite perfect.  These Past 12months have been a year of self-assurance, self-promoting, and self-image to the female (Pop,Rock,Hip-Hop and Country) stars.  Look at; Gaga, Swift, Perry, Pink, Britney, and now Avril all have released music promoting women being empowered/ing and self-fullfilling in their skin.  This isn't a bad thing....musically anyway.  It doesn't say much for originality though.  That aside, every musician goes through this.  It tends to do 1 of 2 things; creates utter failure, or a sliver slight of genius.  The failure part will be moving away from original style (alienating fanbase) or the genius part moving back towards original style and \\"sticking to their guns\\"-as Motley once did.  Musicians adapt as this is what makes an artist strive to evolve and become better.  Avril is doing that on this record.  As I listen to \\"Remember When\\" while typing, \\"as these feelings I can't take no more\\" \\"I'm not coming back around again\\"  If this is to Ballady >(Cool I just made-up a word)< just wait she'll be back.  I kinda expected something on the softer side from her this time around.  A lot of what this record is, is her getting over and moving forward from a Loveloss so take it with a grain of salt.  For those looking for music to get them over a 'heartbreak' this is a great record.  Keep in mine there are a few pickme ups here.  The fact that she puts \\"Bad Reputation\\" (a J.J. fav!) onthe Deluxe CD, is a reminder to those, that although softer, she'll be back w/a F.U. to the record biz and Punk it out soon enough.  I'm an Avril fan (both image and musical) and this is progress, you'll see. For those looking for more punk music, get over it there's not too much in here, but what is, is good.  Notable songs(Deluxe vrs); Push, What the Hell, Bad Reputation, Stop Standing There, Smile, Wish Your Here and 4 Real. I also dig the acoustic version of 'What the Hell' and to put a a perspective of how Avril's talent is, she can easily make everyone of her songs an acoustic and sound great.  Not every band has the ability to do this.  Well, if your fan, get the record (Deluxe if possible)....if you're a bandwagon fan, don't buy it stay on the wagon (Loser!) or grow up (Avril sure did here)....c-ya and thanx4-readin...Hey Avril, more covers....BE THE NEXT JOAN JETT, MUSIC NEEDS IT!
B001P5HI4A|4.0|I think it was back in 2007 that I got a bootleg copy of this movie from somewhere on the web. The DVD came in a very official looking case and elaborate cover art. The DVD also included some special features including two audio commentary tracks. Although this was probably ripped from a VHS copy, I'd have to admit the picture and sound quality are remarkable. In fact, it's almost blu ray level! I don't know where you can find a copy of the version that I have. But one thing's for sure, this time the pirates' have gotten this one right.
0670022411|3.0|This book was \\"okay\\". I felt it could have been written in about 200 pages, not the lengthy almost 600 pages. It finally got to the story and then it was over, which just screamed \\"sequel\\". There did not need to be a sequel, it could have all bee wrapped up neatly in the pages allotted.    Diana had every imaginable power, the story had demons, vampires and witches, and geez, it even touched on the Knights of the Templar, a little much. I think the author was trying too hard, trying to dazzle us with history and too much magic. I would give it a B-/C+.
0756404738|3.0|I, like many others, had waited a long time for the 2nd installment of the Kingkiller Chronicles. The first book, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was one of the best debut novels of fantasy I had ever read. Perhaps the the bar was raised to high by the the first book, because I definitely feel the sophomore jinx has taken it's toll on \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\".     The first book established itself with all the usual elements of epic fantasy. A young orphan boy with great promise, comes of age and starts on the path of becoming a great Wizard. What was unique was the perspective the author chose to employ. The tale being told through a series of flashbacks from the main character who is older and semi-retired from Wizarding and is now operating an inn some far off corner of the world. The second book picks up right where the first let off with Kvothe retelling of his continued adventures in magic and music at the University.     Here is where my first minor complaint begins. There's nothing wrong with an author borrowing ideas from other authors especially successful ones. However, the first 3rd of The Wise Man's fear reads very much like one of the Harry Potter books. There's an analog for every major character from Snape to Draco to Luna Lovegood.     After about 350 pages of Kvothe learning more magic and outwitting his adversaries at the University, Rothfuss abruptly changes the setting and has Kvothe set out on the road. At this point, Rothfuss does another thing that frustrates me. Instead of just saying Kvothe arrives in the far away land, he lets us know that he barely makes it with nothing but his Lute and his wits intact. Why let us know about road adventures, but then skip the details.     Regardless, the change in scenery is welcome, and we get to know more about the other realms of the world Kvothe lives in. What follows is a \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" type tale where our young hero must use his various skills in the employ of a powerful Duke. His first task is to \\"court\\"a young nobel lady who the Duke wishes to marry. Along the way he prevents an assassination attempt upon said Duke (whose motive is never explained) and as a reward gets sent out to fight bandits in the Woods who are stealing the Duke's tax money.     From there, its one adventure after the next. In summary he manages to defeat the bandits with his magic, enters manhood with the help of a legendary fairy creature, has a chance encounters a evil oracle type create which apparently will shape his future fate, and finally learns to fight with hand and sword from the mysterious Adem mercenaries. On his way back to the Duke, he solves another minor mystery and as a reward is banished from the Duke's service after offending his new wife with the revelation of his heritage.     The story ends with Kvothe back at his University with fatter pockets and a new reputation as a ladies man. We end up with a better picture of how the Kvothe legend formed, but still no significant progress on the main mystery of the series which would be who Chandrian and Amyr are and where they can be found.     To sum up, its an entertaining read, but the sense of wonder I had in the first book is squashed by the rambling nature of the 2nd book. Rothfuss has a lot of work to do to finish this up in a 3rd book.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|My wife loves action films. Even loves bad action films, I had no idea who [[ASIN:6305232725 China O'Brien]] was until we got together. So I got this film for us to watch together, put it on with high hopes.<br />Even Dwayne Johnson couldn't save this film. My wife got the giggles early on and didn't stop laughing until well after the credits ended. My hopes for cuddling while watching it were destroyed by the fact it was so bad it was funny. Like an unintentional parody of what's a bad genre to begin with. She said \\"It's Kill Bill without the charm, blood, swords and action. The Bride is being played by Dwayne Johnson.\\"<br />Nothing in the soundtrack stood out, nothing in the plot or action stood out. It was just a film that's been made a bunch of times before and a lot more well done. Parts of it just lagged, like they were trying to put in some bit of sympathy for the characters or plot but none of the characters were sufficiently developed to care at all. The one they spent the most time on was The Killer who was utterly unlikeable.<br />If you're really into revenge action films, check out nearly anything with Jean-Claude Van Damme made in the 80s, or Cynthia Rothrock or even the [[ASIN:B00008V5RO The Angel Collection (Angel / Avenging Angel / Angel III)]]. It's still unbelievable, but the 80s were the best time for this sub-genre.

1400031567|4.0|Someone is murdering men with a hatchet, cleaving their heads and taking their scalps. Author Mankell relates this tale from two perspectives, that of Kurt Wallender, lead detective, and the killer himself. It takes a while before these perspectives begin to merge, and Wallender berates himself for not recognizing the awful truth sooner. The crimes themselves constitute the bones of this tale, which is fleshed out by the thoughts of cop and criminal. Wallender is, as always in this series, a lonely man whose joys in life derive from the company of his daughter, and sometimes, of a good woman. He's feeling burnt out by all he's experienced as a cop, but he doesn't have a clue about what other path he might take. But he's considering it. The killer is deranged, but he's not what he's assumed to be by those who've studied his crimes.<br /><br />From what I've read by Mankell and Stieg Larsson, the Sweden of today is struggling with the prevalence of crimes against girls and women. While I enjoyed their books, including Sidetracked, I found myself growing irritated by comments in dialogs that express surprise that such crimes, considered typically American, could happen in Sweden. Well, they can and they do. Annoyance aside, Sidetracked is a police procedural with a heart, well worth reading.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|I purchased the Alien Anthology Blu-Ray movie set after reading the review on High Def Digest. The first two discs, Alien and Aliens were rated very high in terms of picture quality and sound. The second two movies Aliens3 and Alien Resurrection were rated lower but still acceptable.     My rating is excellent for Alien and good for Alien3 and Alien Resurrection. The problem is with Aliens which I would rate poor. There is a constant flicker of the picture during dimmer scenes. This is most distracting, I returned the first copy to Amazon and received another which demonstrated the same Problem, I return it.     Being a big fan of this movie I decided to order Alien Anthology direct from Fox Connect, thinking that I would have better luck buying direct from Fox, the movie company. Well guess what the same problem of the flickering picture on Aliens. I called them and they sent me an individual disc of Aliens.  Same problem again!!!    I have a high end Theater System so I know my system is not the problem. I even tried the Aliens disc in another Blu-Ray player..same problem. When I called Fox and discussed the problem they said try attaching the HDMI cable direct to the TV...same problem.     Whatever the problem is it has ruined an otherwise great movie collection.
B001JNNDBA|1.0|Let me just start off by saying I love this movie. I rented it a week ago and now I want to buy it. The thing is, when I got the movie the discs were out of the slots and sliding around the case. I checked and they were a little scratched. I am sending it back for a new copy.
1577314808|5.0|I have read countless books on spirituality and cognitive-behavioral psychology, procrastination/motivation, you name it.  I'm hesitant on any \\"Bestseller\\" spiritual book, but was highly recommended by a trusted friend.    This book is completely accessible and draws it's wisdom for different schools of thought - Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism etc.  Tolle speaks of the importance of being present; this is, to be fully immersed in each moment.  Ruminating about the past is a completely futile behavior and only produces resentment, regret and longing; seeking validation in the future is also an energy-sucker and produces many times anxiety and fear.  Ie, \\"I shouldn't have ________\\" and \\"when ______________ happens I'll be ok\\" are no longer accepted in my thoughts.      The section on love is so beautiful.  Completely changed what I thought - I will forever review this.    This definitely takes practice, and just the other day I was introduced to someone and couldn't remember their name five minutes later because at that moment I was consumed with my own thoughts.... but, the beginning is awareness.      I'm actually not giving this book enough justice - I just finished it.  Please read it.  Amazing book.
0307272702|5.0|I am a 41 yr. old woman who started eating a higher protein/ fat , low carb diet a year ago after reading Good Calories Bad Calories. The advice seemed sound and the research was available, but I did remain a bit dubious. But here I am a year later: I have lost 45 lbs(190 down to 145)and my cholesterol numbers have dramatically improved (Total: 160 down from 250, LDL 75 down from 125, HDL 60 up from 44, Triglycerides 140 down from 240)    I have been challenged with Fibromyalgia for 18 years and the inability to exercise without triggering hyper-pain response left me gaining weight even though I was eating a low-fat, mostly vegetarian diet. After a few months on a high protein /low carbohydrate diet I began to feel much better and my fibro-flares diminished to only on occasion. I did need to take some herbal assistance to regulate my hormones a bit more than just the diet, but today, I am able to work fulltime and live a much more active and enjoyable life.     I did find eating this way difficult at first, but I love to cook and soon found the challenge to create low-carb baked goods and meals to be fun.  I no longer crave sugar or carbs, although I do allow myself to indulge around the winter holidays. I do always gain a few pounds at that time but once I get back to low-carb after the holidays, it comes off quickly.  I have suggested this book to many friends but they all are so indoctrinated into the \\"calories in/calories out\\", low fat model of dieting, they find it hard to believe hat my weight loss and improved health came from a low-carb diet.     This book is an easier read that his first and I highly recommend it to EVERYONE.  People are killing themselves with all the crud they call food these days, and even worse, duped into believing low-fat foods, diet foods, etc.  are good for them when in fact they are contributing to the problem.  This is a MUST READ and MUST SHARE book!
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|So, when I first watched the first four episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, I was pretty impressed with the story, but no so much with the art and animation itself.  After watching You Are (Not) Alone, I cannot say the same thing.  It WAS a little boring to watch the fights between Sachiel and Shamshel -- other than the huge minigun that Shinji used against the latter and the way the progressive knife was deployed, little had changed.  The battle with Ramiel, however, was mind-blowing.  I had to watch Operation Yashima several times to catch all the nuances of Ramiel's new features.  In summation, the story up to Ramiel is pretty much the same, but there are differences in animation techniques, content, and even character behavior (just look at how Shinji acted in the original, and the little changes he's gone through in the Rebuild).  I eagerly await the deployment of You Can (Not) Advance.
B003SUP12Q|5.0|Some will deride this album as not being \\"prog\\" or \\"metal\\" enough, but if labels are what you're looking for, you're listening to the wrong band. They've changed, again, and still continue to make some of the most emotional and intelligent music out there.    Speaking first-hand, you can't lose members of your band and NOT change, so I'm not really sure what people were expecting. I personally did a double-take to make sure that I had the right CD the first time I put it in, but it's been one of my favorite CDs since the first week I started listening to it. It's moving, raw and exceptional stuff.    And apparently white people CAN even play the blues...or their version of it.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|Yeah it did...! The tv show was called \\"AUTOMAN\\" and it starred (funny enough) Desi Arnez Jr., yeah Lucy and Ricky's kid! He played the part of a police support computer programmer who \\"programs\\" an artificial man called Automan. He shows up as a hologram that has all the TRONiness going on. I bought the DVD disc of this show and Automan can exist in the \\"real world\\" as long as he has a power supply to draw from. He also could make vehicles that have the cool light-lit lines like TRON (car, helicopter, plane) lightcycles. In all, the tv series was hard for the lambs to follow so it was canceled. I loved it, it looked cool and since it was from the 80's it had all the funny 80's appeal running through it... So the original movie rocked, the sequel rocked but check out the tv show too!    -Chris
B0049P1VHS|3.0|Based on the comic book by Robert Kirkman, AMC's \\"The Walking Dead\\" is the first zombie serial made for TV. The story begins with Andrew Lincoln playing Rick Grimes, a Sheriff Deputy who wakes up from a coma in the hospital and finds the zombie apocalypse has taken place around him. He attempts to heal and find his family though it is a struggle just to survive in this new world. The pilot is like a feature-length movie and takes its time setting up the story with amazing tension and visuals.<br /><br />The opening scene is gripping as the Sheriff is attempting to maneuver through tons of abandoned cars as quietly as possible and sees a young blond girl holding a teddy bear walking barefoot. He calls out to her offering assistance and she slowly turns around to reveal wide blue-eyes and a missing bottom jaw, covered in blood. She begins to approach him and he gulps, steadies himself, and begrudgingly shoots her in the head and winces as he knows it will attract more zombies any second.<br /><br />The first two episodes of the six are incredible. They are so suspenseful, the characters are exciting and interesting, and the people have common sense survival skills. Other main actors appearing in this series are Jon Bernthal, Sarah Wayne Callies, Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Steven Yeun. I won't say who the characters they play are in relation to Rick to avoid spoilers. The zombies are very detailed and disgustingly cool. One memorable zombie only has an upper body and is dragging herself through the grass with entrails behind her. There's a subplot of a father and son duo surviving day to day in the suburbs that can't bring themselves to leave because the mother is wandering around outside as a zombie and they can't leave her or bring themselves to kill her.<br />Rick Grimes once he has his bearings decides to head for the city where there are rumors of a safe zone where people have gathered. He hopes to find his family there but the city turns out to be completely overrun with a zombie infestation. Like I said, the first two episodes -- fantastic! After that...it goes downhill a little bit. The group of characters you meet that have assembled together trying to survive begin to make really poor decisions. This just proves that in the zombie apocalypse scenario, the more people you have, the more danger you are in because someone is going to screw up in the name of being human. Oh, you can't bear to leave the most ignorant, racist jerk on the planet  stuck on a rooftop in the city because he's a person? If you go back for him, he'll probably kill you and you'll lose members of your rescue party! It's painful to watch people do stupid stuff and argue amongst themselves over unimportant things and endanger themselves and others around them in the process.<br /><br />Aside from the stupidity of some characters, the production values are excellent. Every episode feels like part of a big budget movie that keeps going and going and you don't really want it to stop. This show isn't afraid to use silence to establish tension, eeriness, and realism. Then when the music comes in, it is quite a bit more effective.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The Blu-ray menu is SCARY. You see a skyline rotating across the screen and then that little blond girl's back and she slowly turns around and moves toward you, eeeeeek! It makes me want to run right out of the room.<br /><br />\\"The Making of The Walking Dead\\" explains the process of how creator Frank Darabont came across Robert Kirkman's comic books and wanted to make them into a TV series. They strove to find the best actors for the roles but managed to find people who looked quite a deal like the illustrations in the books as well. This featurette goes into production values, makeup, editing and effects, sound, and how they decided to change some of the details of the comic book story in order to be able to surprise the audience.<br /><br />\\"Inside The Walking Dead\\" goes behind the scenes with each individual episode and they talk about their characters, the breakdown of civilization, and the strenuous situations that they undergo. You also get \\"A Sneak Peek with Robert Kirkman\\" about how the series isn't exactly like the book so that the audience could be kept off balance and there is a featurette on Zombie Makeup tips.<br /><br />There are clips from the San Diego Comic Con Panel with the producers, but it also has the main cast members explaining their roles and the course of the story. Sarah Wayne Callies spends her time on the panel staring at Andrew Lincoln as if she has goo-goo eyes for his accent. They all say the bare minimum, look terrified at the sea of people, but are gracious to be there. Also, there's a trailer on the Blu-ray. There are really good features here for a season with only six episodes and I think they knew that and beefed it up a bit for a better value. The Blu-ray quality is spectacular and it does make me want to tune in for the next season.characters, the breakdown of civilization, and the strenuous situations that they undergo.

0671027344|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from reading the novel, Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. The reason I decided to go ahead and read it was the quirkiness of the title. I heard several different opinions about the book, but I felt it was my job to create my own. The novel describes adolescence in a new and unpredictable way. I felt after every page I was looking further into Charlie's life. My favorite part of reading a book is getting to know the characters as real people rather than just simply a name on paper, and that's exactly what I got after reading this book. \\"Personally, I like to think my brother is having a college experience like they do in the movies. I don't mean the big fraternity party kind of movie. More like a movie where the guy meets a smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa.\\" This book was not only hard to put down, but kept me entertained and humor-filled throughout the entirety of the novel. Although the book had several comedic parts, it was a novel filled with sad parts as well.  At first it was hard to judge whether Charlie was going to be an interesting focal point for the novel. I felt he seemed almost too sweet to be a main character, however, I was mistaken. His curiosity of the world makes the read much more intriguing and insightful. Chbosky's writing style makes one become so engrossed in Charlie's world that it becomes difficult to remember whether it's fiction or not. I feel I can relate to Charlie because being in high school, I go through all the same drama that any other teen goes through. Why exactly is this story so special? Charlie's honesty and curiosity. I have never heard anyone voice their own opinions on life, and after reading this book, I wish more people would. Charlie says, \\"I love Twinkies, and the only reason I am saying that is because we are all supposed to think of reasons to live.\\"   One thing I really loved about the novel was the honesty that is portrayed. Charlie is faced with manyobstacles entering his freshman year of high school. He is told to keep secrets at the expense of one's safety, and at the expense of one's popularity. I feel I can genuinely relate to Charlie because of this. Everyone has secrets, sometimes not always their own, that they are forced to keep no matter what. The novel is so true to life. When I read this book, it seemed like Charlie was a close friend of mine, just explaining his complications in life with me, face to face. The novel brings up several topics such as death, homosexuality, sexual abuse, drugs, family life, friends, and plenty more. The reason I found this novel more interesting than other \\"coming of age\\" stories was that Chbosky's tone was not didactic.   Normally epistolary novels don't appeal to me; however, \\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" changed my mind. The format only helped with discovering the tone of the story. As Charlie describes his sister and her abusive boyfriend, or his love for Sam, the reader always feels like she is reading a letter sent from Charlie. The opening is always \\"Dear Friend\\", so the reader never knows whom the letters are actually going to, or if these short letters are just entries in a diary. With every page and every moment, the reader can find something both hilarious and devastating. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a humorous yet interesting coming of age story. Whether you are a popular kid or a wallflower like Charlie, I can guarantee you will enjoy the book. This is one novel that definitely exceeded my expectations.

While it is a little weird to be reading from the perspective (and therefore the language) of a six year old, I found Jack's train of thought easy to follow and understand. This novel kept my attention during and after reading it. I would definitely recommend this novel.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|An intriging, heart-wrenching page-turner based on the preference of BOY BABIES over GIRL BABIES that, amazingly, even in this day and age, still exists in certain segments of India's population. How does one even begin to make a choice when the only options she's given are abortion, adoption, or becoming a outcast pariah for the remainder of her dismal life?<br /><br />I finished the book wanting to hear more about the lives of the characters that Gowda created.  Maybe a sequel with Krishnan and Somer moving to Mumbai to set up a clinic in the basti (Somer to pursue a more fulfilling career and Krishnan to carry on the good works of his recently deceased father)???? It's fodder for thought!<br /><br />Shilpi Somaya Gowda is a born writer.  Loved her portrayal of the variances of life in India and America. This was Gowda's debut novel and, as such, aptly illustrates the fact that she most definitely has that certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\" necessary to make a name for herself as an author of renown.<br /><br />I totally disagree with Publishers Weekly's review which stated that the \\"shifting points of view weaken the story\\".  I found the varied perspectives made for a compelling read, actually strengthened the story, and made the entire tale more cohesive...NMR
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Heartily recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a 50,000 ft. overview on the topic of the global financial crisis. Explained in terms I could understand, the basic ideas of CDOs, derivatives and how the mortgage crisis came about.    I've had some of the best laughs I've had all year watching this movie - particulary those being interviewed about conflict of interest, how the rating systems worked, the explanation of \\"insurance\\" etc. FUNNY stuff. Too bad it's non-fiction, not fiction and the joke has been on us.    If you want to know about Mississippi's average income in their retirement fund vs. what some of the Wall Street folk got paid to sell those CDOS or deratives to those pension funds (AAA or A2 securities when they were really junk - but the Credit Ratings folks said they were \\"gold\\") - this is the place to go. No wonder we're going after those teacher unions instead of criminally prosecuting anyone for trillions of dollars of debt!    When some of the Ivy League schools are interviewed - it gets even funnier! The discussions with the folks from Columbia and Harvard are classic.     Deserved the Oscar, the average American should watch this WITH A REAL SENSE OF HORROR.    Well done Mr. Ferguson.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have read and re-read this series while waiting (not so patiently by the way) on Book 5 Dance with Dragons! (YEAH WE HAVE A HARD RELEASE DATE!!!) I have read the poor reviews while I was looking to download it to my new kindle. I don't understand why people would even bother finishing a book that they disliked so very much. That is insane to me. Do they have a near pathological need to finish what they started? People, really...if you don't like the book, they style, the plot, the author or the type of font used put the book down. Youare not going to go to meet Ice if you don't finish the series.<br /><br />The characters are plagued with humanity. They face the oft times cruel world in the ways that their individual personalities and experiences allow the to face it. Some good and some bad. Why is it that all epics have to have a single person that must play out the age old plot. Boy/Girl saves world with magic and sword or rocks.<br /><br />As of the end of book 4, I have no idea who the hero might even turn out to be. My guess would be Sam (Hehe). This book is a complex web of people, lives, and the world as it is known to them. I isn't a pretty place. It is cold, vile and painful. For heavens sake, Winter is Coming!<br /><br />If you get too attached to characters in a story or if you can't handle dark epics in a more realistic setting than most then this isn't the series for you!<br />If you like Gritty Characters, a deep plot line (more than one at a time) and can almost feel an alternate truth in the underlieing story then this is the Series for you!
B004E547D8|3.0|Who would make a Blu Ray with no HD sound? - Summit would! I did not read the small print and bought the Movie Only Edition $7 cheaper, now I know why. If you only have an SD Sound system (Dolby Digital etc )it is fine.  Audiophile beware!!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Like many Otterbox Defender owners, I've been disappointed by not being able to use my dock devices or my newly-purchased car stereo iPod addon with my iPhone 3GS. This small device finally solved the problem, and it allows non-compatible devices to charge the iPhone as well. Without the CableJive (and without the Otterbox), my Klipsch speakers allow me to play sound from my iPhone but will not charge it. With the CableJive I can keep my case on and play Pandora all day at work while maintaining 100% charge on the phone. It also works with my USA Spec iPod Interface Honda PA15-HON2, whose cable is a standard length cable that did not work by itself with my Otterbox case. I'm thinking of purchasing a second one so that I can leave one in the car and one with my dock. It's small enough that I'll probably lose it if I keep carrying it back and forth between the two devices I use most!
0740797719|5.0|I was unsure about this purchase, since it's written by a painter who did nice work, but for what I thought was a kids' book.  The information is so great: things it reminded me about that I used to know; new things I never knew.  It's one of those rare how-to books that delivers a great deal of useful information.  If the author has even more information to divulge, I'm buying that book, too.<br /><br />I feel this is a must reed for any level of painter, which is a statement I usually don't believe when I see it in print.  The way it's written, you could read it like a regular how-to book, or stick it in the john and it will be the best bathroom book you've ever read a little at a time.  The only problem with that is, where do I keep the yellow highlighter?<br /><br />By the way, I personally discount all book reviews from people who have only reviewed the one book you're looking to purchase.  I tend not to believe them because it's so easy to write nice things when asked to do so by an author friend who wrote that book.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I am huge beatle fan in my late 40s, so I would be expected to love this. However, I watched it with my wife and both of our parents. From their standpoint, they enjoyed seeing some some of the other talents they knew. We all were fascinated with the commercials -- mainly Pillsbury products that make cooking easier. The traditional male-female roles of the time were evident.     From my standpoint, I had only seen clips of the shows (mainly the first on in NY). I didn't realize they performed three weeks in a row. This DVD allows a better perspective of these historic performances. Someone just watching the first two shows at the time could easily think of Paul as the leader of the band. I noticed in the other shows, John's singing was highlighted more.    Worth it for every Beatles fan, and fan of the British Invasion.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm on my 17th day and at the end of Level 2 of my shredding. It is an intense workout that leaves me spent by the end. It seems to be working my upper body more than my legs and butt, but maybe that's because I've always been weaker in the arms. She progressivly puts more intensity on the legs as you move up in levels so I'm hoping Level 3 will leave my legs wobbly.    She's got some great moves that are unconventional but surprisingly work well - especially the warm-up. There's not much time spent on it, but the moves have you ready to go quickly. For someone with knee problems, I haven't had an issue yet.    The only complaint that I have is that she has you going from an intense aerobic activity straight to lying on the floor. My poor heart is racing! I thought you weren't supposed to do that.    Overall, it was definitely worth the purchase!
B004BBDHEK|1.0|I cannot believe the number of positive reviews for this album, are we all listening to the same album? I loved the review of renaming each of the track titles and grading them accordingly........right on!!!  I'm also a HUGE Yanni fan and have been there since his very first album...LP's mind you and I have to agree with his other beloved fans who likewise see a less then inspired work here.      YANNI.......where's your HEART? You've received your fame and have risen to the top but at what sacrifice?  The part that inspires you and therein inspires us, that huge part that seems to open up the floodgates of your immense creativity seems to be completely missing in action on this album.  Where's the melody in your life these days?      I don't know what you the (4-5 star) supportive audience here are listening to but this recent work is a drone compared to virtually all of Yanni's other fantastically inspired works.      Yanni!!!....Please (I repeat) open up your heart, shut down your brain and come back to us.    Anxiously awaiting your return,    your fan.  r
1572816112|5.0|I bought these cards and was so excited when I got them, that I had to go see my best friend and try them out. Not just for a tarot spread but we sat in her living room so INTO the artwork. The artwork blows my mind!    I had wanted something dark but not corny or cheesy, and this was just PERFECT.    It comes with its own spread sheet and its very straight-forward so even beginners can do tarot readings too!     This is now my favorite deck and I take it every where I go. I love these cards!
B000F9RB8K|2.0|This movie took a very long time to make it to Blu Ray.  So when it did I couldn't wait to upgrade this film from dvd to blu.  Imagine my surprise to find this elegantly written, and beautifully photographed film to be quite grainy, overly contrasty, and drab.  At one point I actually put in my old dvd to compare.  Although it was softer in comparison the blu isn't that much of an upgrade. Heavy sigh.  I believe the marketing term that they used is newly 'remastered'. Extremely hard to believe.       John Toll deserved the Oscar that he won and the film is worthy of a better 'remastering' than the one that is offered here.  Its a huge disappointment to see this movie in Blu.  It is one of the poorest discs remasted in the medium.  Buyer beware.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|You can watch the gears turning, while they ask themselves, \\"What am I supposed to feel that I don't feel? What can I say? What do they think was wrong with what I did?\\" Just like Tony Hayward of BP, or his successor, who referred to those hurt by the oil spill as 'The small people.'
B0037XPP7U|5.0|Wow!  In one word that is what the Blu Ray disc looks like.  This movie was always one of my favorites but in Blu it looks almost three dimensional.  The disc quality is THAT good.    It was a pleasure just to view the colors and get a better appreciation of the costumes and set design.  The lake scene with the masks is simply superb.  The blacks are velvet not grainy as some darker scenes tends to be - even in blu.    A worthy upgrade don't hesitate to buy - now.
0671207822|5.0|This is one of the great books. It should be read by all who care about why they are here, what life is about and who need a grounding in the joys and sorrows we all experience.
B004GP3DTK|5.0|Ok, it's been a long time since the original members of Mr.Big made a record. Most bands reunite and try to fit into whats going on now and turn off their loyal fans, usually do a half a#% reunion tour never to be heard from again........... Not Mr. Big....if you are a Mr. Big fan do not hesitate to get this one (What If) They have managed to do what I haven't ever heard a band do before. They sound just as they did in the late 80's and early 90's...I mean exactly...and after all isn't that what we want when one of our favorite bands finally reunite?? Thank you for staying true to what you are and giving your fans what we have missed so much over the last 20 years. I can ony hope otehr bands like (Van Halen) that plan to record a new record after decades pass follow this ingenious plan to just be who you are and not try to fit into the now......Thats why you have fans that will keep buying your records....we want to hear you sounding like you not anyone else...  Great Record and I hope to see Mr. Big on tour this summer.     TRB
B002QH2NUA|4.0|For this `live' outing Paul sticks strictly to Beatles fare and to solo fare worthy of the Beatles. A handful of these tracks ARE the best `live' versions ever, but most aren't. It's quite a job going through a third of a century of `live' Paul recordings to pull off the best and assemble a `best of Paul live'. But for Beatles fans, why stop there? Why not pull off the best `live' song performances from John, George and Ringo as well? Why not create the Beatles reunion `concerts that never were'. Of course these wouldn't be the Beatles per se, but rather an alternation of each Beatle fronting a band of his own choice, performing the best of the Beatles/solo eras. In several respects the results would probably be better than what a bona fide reunion would have produced.
B000003CMB|5.0|I just heard 2 tracks on the radio. (WBGO 88.3 / wbgo,org).    This album was recorded 40, yes, FORTY, years ago.  March 12 and 13, 1971.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Start with `The Long and Winding Road'. Finally we have the version from the film. Trouble is: Mac toys with a lyric in the middle-eight. \\"Anyway you'll never know...\\" becomes \\"Anyway you've always known...\\" Which just won't do. The revised words don't flow, and they mean the opposite of the old lyric. Paul would perform the song `live' many times but would never again deploy \\"you've always known...\\" So, it was a mistake. Moreover, this middle-eight isn't sung as feistily as on the `Beatles Anthology III' version. What to do?After all, there are so many nice things about this film version. Lennon's bass-playing doesn't wander off the map. Billy Preston does a simple melancholy childlike keyboard solo that fits the mood beautifully. And Paul's vocal, for the most part, is sublime. So I got to wondering if one could just switch middle-eights. I tried it, with some rudimentary music-editing sofware, and lo-and-behold, it did work--perfectly, to my ears.  I did something similar for the `Let It Be' track. The guitar solo as heard on this version is perfection, much preferable to what we hear on the single (which is perfectly adequate, but...) Trouble is: The original mix by George Martin for the single still sounds superior, except for the guitar solo. Once again, I simply switched one for the other and it turned out brilliantly.  Much else on `Naked' is misguided. Lennon's vocal on `Across the Universe' NEEDS a little orchestral help, and we have two such versions already that are perfectly fine--the original produced by George Martin and the Phil Spector version. All tracks from the roof are much better raw than after Spector gets through with them. That a six-track rooftop concert did not form the backbone of a Let It Be/Get Back album is THE stupidest blunder tn the history of pop music. Lennon was totally wrong re. these and other `Get Back session' tracks. They were never just a pile of s__t  that only a genius producer like Spector could salvage. Spector should have stuck to finishing the unfinished `I Me Mine' and to re-working `Across the Universe'. If I could listen to only one side of any Beatles album the rest of my life, the six-track `live' on the rooftop side would be my choice--without hesitation, and yet it has never even been officially released. Rolling Stone magazine rated that lunchtime concert as THE `live' rock'n'roll event of all time. And Rolling Stone was right. So get ahold of a bootleg. (Just skip the soundcheck version of `Get Back', the fumbled-lyric version of `Don't Let Me Down' and the less-inspired run-through of `I've Got a Feeling'. Transfer the rest to CD-R or iPod playlist.)
B003OWVHVC|5.0|I am absolutely mesmerized by this CD.  I have listened to it over and over.  His voice, his ability to perform in a variety of genres.  He transports me all the way back to 50s deep country blues, to 60's Motown R&B, to funk to gospel...it's all there.  I am a fan for life.  Give it a listen.
B0025KVLV0|3.0|The `Get Back' sessions were fantastic, especially once the Beatles left insalubrious Twickenham Studios behind and ensconsed themselves in Apple's makeshift basement studio. But you have to go through the bootlegs to grasp just how badly the job of representing them was botched by Phil Spector (and even Glyn John before him). Not to dump on Spector in principle; he WAS capable of brilliant work, if only sporadically, with John and George. But not with any group containing aul McCartney.  If a PROPER 2-record set had been made from these sessions, Paul would have deserved his knighthood for that alone. Paul is the great hero of the `Get Back' albums that never were. It is so incredibly ironic that these sessions--surely the most productive 19 days in rock' n 'roll recording history--got hung around his neck like an albatross. And the herd-like conventional wisdom about these sessions that passes for music journalism is a disgrace. There ARE other sources that will show you how to assemble from multiple sources the unique twin-CDs `Get Back' masterpiece that the meddling of Allen Klein and Phil Spector and Co. threw away.
B0042816YK|1.0|I have tried reading Eat, Pray, Love and could not finish it.  While I am sure that it is difficult making a radical change so late in life, I still found the author's story dull.  I was looking forward to the movie and perhaps would be able to get a different opinion on the matter.<br /><br />That being said, this movie was worse than the book.  The highlight for me was being able to see gorgeous parts of Italy, but it was a complete struggle not to leave the theatre before the movie ended.<br /><br />It's very difficult to translate a book into a movie and this one failed.  The movie felt like it went on forever and it didn't connect with the audience.  It was difficult for me to sympathize or even like the Liz character.  The movie is boring, yet it also felt rushed.  If they were trying to convey Liz's struggles and her journey to self-discovery, it was done poorly.  It's difficult to understand how the character could learn anything when we don't really get a chance to connect with her since the movie just speeds through the entire process, while managing to bore the audience.<br /><br />A big BOO to this movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie package was a perfect combination of movie, documentary, and inside stories from the original Easy Company.  I've been wanting to purchase this movie package for some time now and am so excited to finally have it.  The war story, the actors and the final outcome, really installs the feeling of Pride that every man in Easy Company had in being an American.  The men of WWII were all true heroes and incredible men and soliders.<br /><br />I will watch this whole HBO Series over and over again and will share it with friends/family.  I was never able to be in the military, but really feel the pain and suffering and these men truely felt during and after they captured the Eagles Nest.  Just a all and all awesome move series.
0345528581|5.0|This  book is great. It is like having your own personal trainer at home. I am in week 7 of the first 10 week program. The strength and muscle I have gained is amazing. You just follow the programs, do the exercises, and you start to look more like the guy on the cover every day. I don't have time to go the gym. I do 20-30 minutes a day at home in the morning before work. The program routine is 4 to 5 days per week. I feel great and look forward to spring when I start wearing short sleeve shirts and can show off my new muscle.
0756404738|4.0|I'm not much for reviewing books, but I just have to say this: the book was good, fun, and entertaining... for the first 600 or so pages, but after Kvothe left to go hunt bandits, I think it took a sharp turn downhill. It was definatally about 300 pages too long, and a lot could've been cut out without hurting the story. One thing I particularly didn't like was the fact that, after he had sex with Felurian (the fae woman), he basically became a man-slut. Now, I don't have a problem with the sex itself, I have a problem with the fact that it came out of nowhere! He spent the last book-and-a-half mooning over Denna, but seems to lose interest in her. There are points where he'd think, \\"I sure do miss Denna,\\" and then proceed to have sex with--literally--almost every woman he meets in the second half of the book. I thought it was strange, and it didn't really fit the character. Other than that, I found the book good, a little slow at times, but readable.
0553584537|4.0|It's obvious that Gardner has done her research for this exciting thriller. Bobby Dodge is a special forces trooper who is called to a domestic/hostage situation. He ends up killing the husband, but there's a lot more to the story. Is the wife the abusive one? What is wrong (medically) with the child? Also, the wife, Catherine, had been abducted and sexually abused when she was 12. How much does that situation have to do with what happens in the present?<br />An incredibly realistic suspense novel. No plot holes or characters acting with fuzzy motivations. Beautifully written, despite a tendency toward excessively relating conversations without using dialogue. It was almost impossible to tell who was a 'good guy' and who was a 'bad guy' (with two notable exceptions on either side). Just riveting. I couldn't put it down.<br />(And, like I said about the research: my husband is in law enforcement, and he gets irritated with a lot of books/movies/tv shows for inaccuracy. This book did not irritate him at all.)
0307474712|4.0|One-Day by David Nicholls. I received a reprint-advance-copy of this book last year when the publishers were building hype for the upcoming movie. I had grand plans to read it at that time and life got in the way. It sat on my shelf waiting for the day when I would be in the mood for a love story. That day came sometime within the last two weeks as my body reeled from the utter exhaustion of moving apartments while prego (GOOD times, let me tell you).<br /><br />On my way out the door to work one day I grabbed One-Day (hardy-har-har) and slid it in my bag. Peeled back the covers on the train and was absorbed into the lives of Dexter and Emma. One-Day is unique in that each chapter is July 15 beginning in 1988 when Dexter and Emma meet and ending in 2006. Since each chapter is a year apart, things change dramatically each time and it's quite fun and exciting to see where our protagonists will be each time a new chapter starts. Nicholls has portrayed two equally empathetic characters who feel and read real and each year pulls us forward into their lives.<br /><br />Witty and charming, British, beautiful and fun. That's One-Day. Definitely recommended and very much looking forward to the movie in July.
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|I would like to preface this review by stating that I am a huge REM fan and have been for many years. I understand that the band has evolved and explored many different directions throughout its long career. I am also comfortable in the realization that as far as I am concerned, the band will most likely never be able to release anything that matched the brilliance of its late-80s/early-90s material. That stated, I am trying to listen to Collapse Into Now without any biases or preconceived notions, and just take it at face value.<br /><br />Stylistically, this album picks up where Accelerate left off. It showcases the band's \\"middle-aged with a vengeance\\" attitude with loud, ferocious songs. However, while Accelerate seemed to get a little repetitive after a while, Collapse Into Now offers a variety of sound dynamics throughout the album. It goes everywhere from loud to light; from fun to moody; from fast to slow. As far as the style and overall feel of the album goes, I would place it somewhere in between Accelerate and Automatic for the People. Think of it as if Accelerate and Automatic got together and had a child... that child's name would be Collapse Into Now. The problem is that since both the parents are related [i.e., they're both REM albums... get it?], the child has a few issues. Problem is that the songs themselves just don't quite measure up to what REM is capable of.<br /><br />Collapse Into Now starts off strong and angsty with Discoverer. It's not one of REM's best tunes, and certainly not the best on the album, but it is a strong, energetic start that sets the tone well for the rest of the album. It's like a good lead-off hitter that legged out a single and is waiting for the batters behind him to drive him in. Discoverer leads well into the next track, All The Best, which is a heavy, up-beat track that has a good driving groove to it. All The Best does not have a very catchy hook to it, so it certainly is not the best effort on the album, but when coupled with Discoverer, it becomes a great one-two punch to start the album off. Runners are on first and second with nobody out. Incidentally, as a production note, it would've been cool to not have any silence between the first two tracks and have Discoverer bleed right into All The Best... but alas, I was not the producer. All The Best would make a great opener to a live set as well.<br /><br />In my opinion, the album's real strength comes on the back of the next two songs, UBerlin and Oh My Heart. Both songs showcase REM's ability to still write great melodies. Both songs are slower and lighter than the opening two, and feature the acoustic guitar. Both also feature passionate performances from Michael Stipe.<br /><br />From here, the album begins to fall a bit. It Happened Today and Everyday is Yours to Win are decent songs, but are not quite on the same level as the opening four. Mine Smell Like Honey is an upbeat song that sounds like classic REM. This song probably features the strongest chorus on the album. Walk It Back is a ballad reminiscent in style to a song that could have appeared on Automatic for the People or New Adventures in Hi-Fi. It's a good song, but not as memorable as its counterparts that appeared on those two albums. Alligator... and That Someone Is You get back to heavier style that the band presented with the first two tracks. Unfortunately, these two songs have little to offer and will probably end up getting skipped when I listen to the album.<br /><br />The album ends strong with a pair of well crafted songs. Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I is a slow, moody, melodic song that finds Peter Buck dusting off the mandolin. This is easily one of the best songs on the album. It leads into the final track, Blue, which features spoken-word lyrics from Stipe over droning distortion and a backing vocal from Patti Smith. Think E-Bow The Letter meets Country Feedback. Blue is an excellent close to the album. Toward the end of the track, theopening riff to Discoverer is repeated to give the album a complete, full-circle, feeling. Unfortunately, this sounds a bit contrived... it doesn't sound like Blue naturally flows into Discoverer. Instead of sounding like the conclusion to an album, it sounds more like the beginning of a thirteenth track. It doesn't, however, sound awkward enough to make me dislike the song, but I do feel like they probably should've left well enough alone.<br /><br />All in all, Collapse Into Now is certainly not REM's best album.... actually, when compared to the rest of their catalog, I would probably put it in the lower 50%. It's certainly not a bad album either. I would still rather listen to Collapse Into Now than most of the music that is out there. This album is probably not going to produce any huge radio hits, it's certainly not going to introduce the band to new fans, and it is most likely not going to convert any causal fans into becoming hard core fans... but I kind of get the impression that the band doesn't really care about any of that anyway at this point in their careers. They just want to write and release whatever the hell they feel like, and after 30 years they've earned that right. Collapse Into Now is most likely an album that I'll have to listen to a few more times to truly appreciate [unfortunately with little promotion behind the album, most of the people that are going to buy it are the hard core fans that will pick it up in the first couple weeks after its release, so it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to post a review a month or so after buying the album]. Ultimately, again, the album can't really be compared to the material that was released while REM was at their peak. If you're looking for this album to be the second coming of Automatic For The People, you will be disappointed. If you have been able to appreciate the post-Berry albums and enjoyed the direction that they started to go in on Accelerate, then there will most likely be something on Collapse Into Now that you will enjoy as well.d to give the album a complete, full-circle, feeling.

B004856SQ8|4.0|If you're looking for a movie that you don't need to think about, this may be the movie for you. With the typical high explosives and high octane action expected from a movie in this genre, as well as a few laughs thrown in, it should keep you entertained. For the most part, the cast is pretty good. All four members of the A-Team play their role well. The only person I didn't like was Jessica Biel, who was annoying and not as hot as usual in this movie.   As for the picture quality of the Blu-Ray version, it's top notch.
0393061310|4.0|Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is a highly interesting and informative book, which I found fascinating. The lengthy, somewhat wordy book covers a wide array of subjects, with a focus on the main premise of the book: societies developed differently on different continents because of differences in continental environments, not in human biology.  Diamond examines the spread of plant and animal domestication on the different continents, and how that led to writing, diseases, and technological innovations.  The main premise of environmental location, proximity to other evolving cultures, and biological factors like resistance or susceptibility to certain diseases is traced throughout human history.    Diamond does a phenomenal job of synthesizing scientific data with historical information and making clear, concise connections between the two, as in the instance of his comparison of biological factors such as genetic predisposition to disease and cultural circumstances in explaining why Yali's culture was considered one of the `have-nots.'    The prose is engrossing, the argument is well-planned and executed, and Diamond does a complete and thorough analysis of his thesis.  While lengthy, and as aforementioned, wordy, Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is a book that would certainly be well worth the $17.00 spent.  Academics and history buffs alike will find this discussion of 13,000 years of human history fascinating and enjoyable. I surely did.

B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Kanye West is undoubtedly one of the most unapologetically honest rappers to ever pick up a microphone. He knows what he is and what he's doing and as such, produces some of the most self-aware and truthful music in the industry. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the penultimate Kanye album in a long line of already highly competent albums and one of the best albums of 2010.<br /><br />This is the ultimate realization of the themes that have shaped his music career. Materialism, rejection, love, loss and sadness, MBDTF has a very dark overtone about it and the more you listen to it, the more you begin to feel as though you're delving further and further into West's subconscious. Similar to 808s and Heartbreak, Kanye lets it all hang out. He's unrelenting, unconcentrated and strangely focused. Like an expert sniper, he zeroes in on his target and strikes with precision. There's no nonsense, just an unfiltered display of raw emotion.<br /><br />Lyrically, this is Kanye's strongest and most consistent work yet.  Where he showed glimpses of greatness on the track Gone from his second album, Late Registration, he now seems capable of replicating that level of lyricism across an entire album. The level of depth and complexity in his rhymes has exceeded that of any other album he's released so far. Kanye's greatest asset in my eyes is how self-aware he is and it shows in his rhymes, such as in the song Gorgeous in which he says \\"I'll choke the South Park writers with a fish stick\\". This line sounds appropriately cathartic within the tone of the song itself.<br /><br />Guest appearances are also excellent, demonstrated best on the feature heavy tracks Monster and So Appalled. Jay-Z is as lyrically potent as one would expect from such a veteran in the industry but it is Nicki Minaj that surprised me most on her verse on Monster. She outshines both West and even the venerable Jay-Z in her performances, playing with many differing lyrical and vocal styles in her just over a minute long verse. I was very impressed and I saw for the first time why she has been surrounded with such a great amount of hype in her short career.<br /><br />In terms of cohesion, this is one of the most well put together album I've heard in years, second, at least recently, to Janelle Monae's The ArchAndroid. Each track flows logically from one song into the next. Layered perfectly, building on the foundation of the song before it but still sounding fresh. The album's title almost perfectly reflects the music contained within it as you really get a sense that this has come from the darkest recesses of Kanye's subconscious and is reflected in not only his and his guest's lyricism but the production behind it.<br /><br />My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is an amazing album that really comes together in every way. It's the most consistently brilliant, cohesive and lyrically impressive album Kanye West has released since 2005's Late Registration and is easily one of the best albums released in a year that was already quite good for great album releases. It remains to be seen whether or not Kanye West can top himself with his next album going forward but based on what he has done here, he seems perfectly capable of pulling it off.s very impressed and I saw for the first time why she has been surrounded with such a great amount of hype in her short career.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|We need more people like Josh Fox because we can no longer trust our state and federal officials to protect us from the corporations that often elect them into office. As a resident of the state of Louisiana I am well acquainted with the machinations of big oil.  People no longer even bother to question what is safe here. It is understood that too many people in this state either work for the oil companies or depend on the seafood industry. We were \\"bought out\\" long ago and no longer complain, even though everything his film says about our state is true.<br /><br />It isn't safe for the local media to spend too much time talking about the open oil field waste pits or gas injection wells.  They have learned that \\"bad press,\\" isn't in the best interest of their advertisers. Oil feeds too many families here and even if that family is being poisoned by the waste seeping into water tables and over-flowing from pits during our frequent floods, who wants to learn that they may be causing cancer with an income they can't do without? Most people here in the oil and fishing industries are under educated and know little else. It is certainly easier to pretend that no one knows why cancer strikes so many people here. We even call one part of the state along the river  \\"cancer alley\\".  Food is an important part of Josh's story and he shows us that you can't simply turn your back on what goes on in Colorado or Wyoming were the beef cattle (soon to grace your dinner table) are ingesting tainted water with the governments blessing.<br /><br />As Josh illustrates in his film these companies pick on those who cannot easily move or band together to fight back. Poor to middle income people in rural areas are easy prey. Here we have a name for that, \\"environmental racism\\". We call it that because many of the rural folks now living in the shadow of wells and chemical plants are poor, black, elderly or all three. They can't afford to run and their lives and properties are cheap. Incidently, a frequent target of big oil/chemical in Louisiana is the Tulane Environmental/Poverty Law Clinic. If your case isn't worth much it is very hard to find a lawyer willing to take it and endure the endless appeals that a billion dollar industry can mount against you. The industry went to our state legislature and authored a bill asking that the law clinic be banned from representing clients asking for monetary damages. They said it was \\"unfair\\" because a succession of law students could keep them in court forever! Apparently it is not unfair for them to use their billions to keep a landholder in court until they die from chemical poisoning.<br /><br />You may not be aware that an oil related PR group tried to talk the Academy into removing their nomination from this film for best documentary. They refused. Support this film and others like it with your dollars. After seeing the kind of PR spin manufactured by BP I can say that truth is easily scrambled in the press and you should be VERY afraid of what you don't know. As I write this Erin Brockovich, famous for her earlier fight against chemical laced water is back in Hinkley California again....yes...it is happening all over again. She was nice enough to visit us during the oil spill. I wish her and others like her all the best.arget of big oil/chemical in Louisiana is the Tulane Environmental/Poverty Law Clinic.

0783228600|1.0|A film without plot or dramatic tension, with two forgettable (however deplorable) one-note leads (the rest broad caricatures unworthy of a seven year-old), some faintly memorable minor moments but not one memorable or sustained scene. The main appeal here, far as I can see, is that of a film that glorifies mindlessness while making dumb people feel superior by comparison. But not a single authentic note struck throughout. A silly flat cartoon: seventies gonzo seen through the eyes of Hollywood brats.

However, if you love historic mysteries set in England with some modern sleuthing and a little romance thrown in, this is for you. Charming characters,  past & present stories deftly intertwining and a sub- mystery of finding a novelist's inspiration for his spookiest tale play a part in a modern girl's search for her mother's past during the evacuation of WW II London.

0670022411|4.0|Vampires, witches, daemons, and ghosts.  Forbidden love, impending warfare, history lessons.  Deborah Harkness's debut novel, A Discovery of Witches,  has it all!  This book is like the grown-up lovechild of Twilight and Harry Potter!   And just like those two phenomenly popular series, this book is FUN!  I predict that it will be the next big thing!    The book centers around a witch named Diana Bishop, a visiting professor studying at Oxford.  Although descended from a long line of powerful witches (including Salem's Bridget Bishop - 1st dose of history!), Diana has suppressed her magical power, choosing to go through life as close to a \\"normal\\" human as possible.  As in HP and Twilight, there are magical creatures everywhere, walking and living among humans, unbeknownst to us dumb Muggles (she doesn't use \\"muggles\\").     Diana recognizes the other creatures that surround her, but chooses to ignore them and their power, that is, until she meets Matthew Clairmont.  Matthew is really like a grown up Edward Cullen.  He  is unbelievably attractive (can't wait to see who'll play him in the inevitable movie version), rich, strong, and worships Diana to the point that his love sometimes turns into chauvinism. Oh, and he's also a vampire!  Matthew's love and overly protective / controlling ways actually become somewhat necessary since Diana quickly has many creature enemies, who think that if they find her, they'll find the lost manuscript.     It is here that Harkness's writing really shines.  Like JK Rowling before her, she describes Diana's potential powers and the cultural mores of the magical world with great detail.  Somehow the rules, practices, and history of the magical world make sense.  Harkness combines the magic with the real world so well, that when I read about Diana's DNA sequencing, I never even stopped and questioned that I was reading scientific language about a witch's DNA.  Interesting that Harkness manages to combine science & magic in 500 pages, even though religions haven't been able to in over 2000!  As for the 500 pages, I just mentioned, don't worry!  The book moves at a fast pace too, blending the exposition in with the action.  Despite the length, I never felt bored.    Perhaps my one gripe with the book is with Matthew.  As a 1500 year old vampire, he's pretty much the Forest Gump of the Common Era, somehow playing a role in all of history's great events. His life is obviously fascinating.  It's his \\"save the damsel in distress\\" attitude that at times bothered me.  Like Edward Cullen w/Bella,  Matthew's chivalry towards Diana is sometimes over the top.  While I'm sure it's nice to have a hot, strong vampire loving and protecting you, Matthew seemed a little overbearing and controlling, making up rules for Diana to follow & never allowing her to be alone.  Also, he carries her a lot.  Weird.  Let her walk.     All in all, this book was a very fun read!  I would recommend it to any female.  It was romantic, exciting, sometimes even a little scary.  It'd be a great book for a vacation or the beach, or really any time.  Sometimes it's nice to take a break from reading about people with real life problems and just get lost in a fantasy world!  While this book isn't going to change any one's life, or hopefully get written about by anyone in school, it was a very fun read that I highly recommend!  I can't wait for the second book to come out.

0061537969|5.0|For anyone who has ever owned a dog or is a dog lover, The Art of Racing in the Rain is for you. Garth Stein tells the story of an aspiring race car driver, Denny, and his family through the eyes of his dog Enzo. Enzo takes the reader through happiness, sadness and moments filled with comedy. It is a story that pulls at your heart strings from beginning to end as Enzo tells his story.   For those of us who have a dog, there are events in the book that we all can relate to. For those who were fans of Marley and Me there are many scenes that remind us how dogs are, and the funny things that they do from time to time. Unlike in Marley and Me though, Enzo tells us why he is doing certain things. For anyone who has ever wondered what drives dogs to chew up stuffed animals, Enzo explains why, \\"... One of her stuffed animal toys had come to life... I stalked the bastard as it abused and humiliated each of Zoe's (Denny's daughter) with great malice. Finally I could take it no more and I moved in, teeth bared for attack, to end the brutal burlesque once and for all.\\"  Even those who are not dog-lovers or have never had a dog cannot help but laugh at some of Enzo's comical descriptions of how we (as humans) go around living our lives, and the assumptions that we sometimes make. The story is far from being only light hearted, though, as Enzo takes us through the hardships that Denny encounters and shows us how he helps Denny through his hard times.   Denny's life is by no means an easy one. He is a mechanic with a wife and daughter who aspires to be a racecar driver. His world is turned upside down, though, when his wife is diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor and dies. Enzo tries to help his master through his struggles but can only do so much, wishing the whole time that he could talk. Since Enzo's love of his life is Denny, Denny's heartbreak is also Enzo's. Their struggle to cope with the actions around them makes you root for them page after page.   Another key component to the story is that Enzo is getting older. The book begins with Denny telling a friend on the phone that the trip to the vet may only be one way. For anyone who has ever had a dog that has gotten older to the point at which they are but a shell of their form puppy selves, it is easy to see Denny's conundrum. At what point are you letting the dog live for your own selfish reasons? Enzo says that he is ready to go, and that he wants to go on to the other side. He constantly believes that he will come back as a human who will be able to talk to Denny and be near him always. \\"In Mongolia, when a dog dies, he is buried high in the hills so people cannot walk on his grave. The dog's master whispers into the dog's ear his wishes that the dog will return as a man in his next life.\\" Enzo heard this once on the History channel and believes it to be true with all his heart.   All in all, I found this book to be an excellent read. As a dog owner myself, I couldn't help but connect to Enzo. Those who aren't dog owners may not appreciate the book as much, but will still find the plot of the book exciting. By the end they may find themselves going out to get an Enzo of their own.

1453682929|4.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of 12 short stories chronicling the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his accomplice, Doctor Watson.  This compilation of adventures is what I believe to be the golden dozen of the detective series authored by Arthur Conan Doyle. I hadn't read any of Doyle's work prior to this and I find myself walking away satisfied and intrigued by his style of writing. He is a master at drawing the reader in while not giving away too much, then hitting us with the resolution of the tale right at the end. The extreme detail in each clue reminds the reader how important it is for a detective to pick up on the little things. \\"I took the tattered object in my hands and looked as I thought, carefully at it. It was a very ordinary black derby hat of the usual round shape, and much the worse for wear. The discolored lining had been of red silk. No maker's name, but the initials H.B. were scrawled on one side. Its brim had been pierced for long, black silk elastic to be attached to the wearer's coat button, to save the hat from being lost in a high wind. But the elastic was missing, and I noticed that several of the worst places on the hat had been covered with ink.\\" At first thought the reader thinks, `oh a hat, ok' but Holmes emphasizes the importance of each specific detail and how a detail that would appear complete irrelevant may be the deciding factor in the case.<br /><br />The stories do tend to get a bit repetitive. I would recommend reading only one or two at a time as each individual story follows basically the same format. Most stories begin with a paragraph setting the scene, \\"I was sharing rooms with my friend Sherlock Holmes in Baker Street at the time that these horrible and extraordinary events took place. I remember it was in April, 1883, that I awoke one morning to see Holmes standing, fully dressed, by my bedside. As it was only a quarter past seven, I was surprised to see him, for he was usually a late riser.\\" The opening gives insight into the relationship between Holmes and Watson. They converse together, discussing their personal life and experiences. Without warning, the client will enter with a problem for Holmes to solve. More often than not the client has summoned Holmes after failing to receive the expected result from the police. They don't like the conclusion drawn from the detective work and want Holmes to take another look and solve the mystery in his own way. The book is set up in way in which the reader has an opportunity to solve the case before Holmes presents his theories at the end. We get an extremely detailed account from the client, and a window into Holmes's thought process. However, none of his major ideas are given until right at the end. It's exciting to put the pieces together yourself and find out if you're right.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is a timeless classic character and I think this collection could be enjoyed by anyone.  However, I would definitely recommend reading in chunks as I do find that there is a lot of repetition and similarities among the 12 `adapted classic tales' in this book. The book is written in a way that virtually any age group can understand it. Advanced readers will get a deeper sense of what's going on, while younger readers can still enjoy what the story is about. Truly a classic that everyone will enjoy.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|Rachel McAdams ([[ASIN:B000683VI4 The Notebook]]) gives a performance I can only describe as strenuously perky in this hectically edited 2010 comedy that seems to be equal parts [[ASIN:B0047P5FVI Broadcast News]] and [[ASIN:B001RIYVYK The Mary Tyler Moore Show]] but with little of James L. Brooks' sharp sense of humor or ironic ambivalence shared by both. This film does not offer a terribly shrewd perspective about media manipulation or accountability. Rather, director Roger Michell ([[ASIN:B000NOKFHG Venus]]) and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna ([[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]]) go for much softer targets like career versus love and youth versus experience. The approach strikes me as somewhat of a shame since a more than capable cast has been assembled for what amounts to bland, fitfully funny studio product. McKenna's script will remind viewers of \\"Prada\\" in that both stories focus on a young career-minded woman trying to buck the odds in order to take her place in a profession filled with sharks and naysayers.<br /><br />This time, her name is Becky Fuller, an upbeat, Type-A producer of a New Jersey morning TV show. She gets fired due to staff cuts, so she immediately applies for a job in Manhattan at the fourth-place network for their Today Show wannabe, \\"Daybreak\\", stuck in the ratings cellar for years. Out of desperation and a hunch, network executive Jerry Barnes decides to give Becky a chance to produce \\"Daybreak\\". Things start out badly when she gets browbeaten by longtime anchor Colleen Peck, whose cheery on-air disposition masks a simmering frustration with having a revolving door of co-hosts. Becky decides to hire veteran newsman Mike Pomeroy who is sitting out the rest of his multi-million dollar contract after being let go of his coveted evening news anchor spot. Most of the movie is about how Becky tries to coax the human side out of Pomeroy's curmudgeonly personality to find his inner Matt Lauer. Of course, getting the ratings up for her show makes her less available to romance \\"young buck\\" evening news producer Adam Bennett.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays Pomeroy strictly on a constant note of indifferent constipation, which is fitting for his character but not all that interesting to watch over the course of the film. Diane Keaton fares somewhat better as Colleen because the character plays well to the dichotomy of her most persistent film persona, the polished professional and the dithering doormat. The best thing about the film is how the two veterans display a sharp, nasty-edged on-air rapport which I wish Michell explored more. As Adam, Patrick Wilson ([[ASIN:B000N3SU92 Little Children]]) is simply wasted in a himbo role constantly flustered by Becky but strangely drawn to her at the same time. Jeff Goldblum makes his few scenes count as Barnes because unlike the other actors, he's not afraid to show the cold, ruthless arrogance that probably made his character successful. Ty Burrell (likeable Phil on [[ASIN:B002JVWQSW Modern Family]]) has a barely-there part as the slimy co-anchor Becky fires minutes after being harassed by him. Production values are reasonably polished, although I found the soundtrack irritatingly loud and intrusive and the editing rather uneven. Extras are sparse on the 2011 DVD - a commentary track from Michell and McKenna and one deleted scene.her less available to romance \\"young buck\\" evening news producer Adam Bennett.

0743496736|5.0|Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult is one of the most incredible, inspiring and thought provoking novels I have ever read. This book has changed how I look at people my own age. This novel takes place in New Hampshire, a small quiet town, where not a lot happens. However, that is until a boy, named Peter, comes to school with four guns, explosives and two bombs. The school breaks out in chaos. Peter is sent to court, charged with eight acounts of 1st degree murder and two acounts of 2nd degree murder. After reading the first two chapters about Peter, you would think of him on an evil person. Yet, Jodi Picoult does an excellent job of giving a deep understanding of who Peter actually is. He is a kind and misunderstood boy.    I extremily enjoyed that each chapter was a different story that revealed something more about each character. In each chapter, my opinion would alter about each character. In the begining of the novel, I thought Peter was a monster, yet after reading how he was treated from the time he was a boy by his classmates in Elementary School, Middle School and High School, I completely understood how Peter felt. Moreover, the only person that ever really understood him ditched him when she wanted to be popular. Peter was always a joke to all of his classmates and never had many friends. He was teased everyday from the first day of kindergarden until March 6, 2007, the day he came to school with guns and bombs. Although, Josi, his first and only true friend, stood up for him constantly, her support stopped in 6th grade when she became popular and forgot all about Peter.    Another quality in this novel that made me want to keep reading is that I loved how relatable all the character are in this book. Any high school student including Peter who was considered a \\"monster.\\" However, I thought Josi was also a very interesting character. When I was reading about Josi's life, I was not sure how I felt about her. She was one of the popular girls with her perfectfriends and perfect boyfiend, who would not dare to hang out with someone like Peter, with fear of hurting her reputation. However, on the inside, she hated her abusive boyfriend, minipulative friends and herself. Now reflecting on it she was an insecure and scared girl who would probably rather hang out with Peter than anyone else. She even knew this about herself but was scared to say those words outloud until it was too late, \\"The rest of us, we're all like Peter. Some of us just do a better job of hiding it. What's the difference between spending your life trying to be invisible, or pretending to be the person you think everyone wants you to be? Either way you're faking.\\" (pg 447) As much as I hated Josi as a character at times, I could not help but feel I have been in her position before. Reading about Peter and Josi in high school made me think how often I have had the same thoughts and wanted to do some of the actions they have done.   This book has touched my heart. One of the most heart thumping, tear jerking moments is when Peter sacrifices the rest of his life for Josi, a girl who would never do anything for him in public because she was too selfish and scared. When Peter went to court, his lawer, Jordan, told Peter he had to tell him everything he remembers about the school shooting in order to help him. Moreover, Peter had told Jordan everything he had done, but he did not tell him he also had help. Josi ended up lending a hand in the school shooting and Peter never told anyone, \\"Josie realized he was offering her a way out- a deal sealed in blood, a partnership of silence: I won't share your secrets, if you don't share mine. (441)\\" this is one of the most powerful moments in the book. Peter could have had very different results in court if he told this information to Jordan. However, Peter would have done anything for his \\"friend\\" Josi. This book described a deeper meaning of love than I have ever read before. This book can change how you look at anyone. This novel is a must read!
B004FGMV0W|2.0|Well the title of \\"Goodbye Lullaby's\\" first single about sums it up for me.  As in Avril, what the hell were you thinking?  I've been a MAJOR fan since the start of her career ten years ago, I've always been very satisfied with her songs.  When I first heard \\"what the hell\\" about two months ago, I couldn't wait for the new album, thinking it would all be that way.  This song is merely a guise for a slow, \\"just going through the motions\\" sort of album.    I waited to write my review for a couple days after buying GL, hoping that it would \\"grow on me\\" as other reviewers said it did for them.  I now have listened to it five or six times all the way through, and I now think my feelings about it will not change.      I'm not going to talk about the simplicity of her lyrics, Avril has always been that way.  The thing that bothers me the most about GL is that it all seems to run together, with no song in particular standing out to me.  When I look at the track listing, the song titles seem to relate to how I feel.  It's a \\"Push\\" for me to get through it every time I listen to the album.  \\"Wish you were here\\"- as in I wish the old Avril were here.  It's \\"not enough\\" for me, especially after a four year wait between albums.  Is this album \\"4 Real?\\"  I \\"Remember when\\" Avril was great.    Where's this album's \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Unwanted\\", or \\"Forgotten?\\"  I don't doubt her ability to sing a ballad, she's been great in the past with \\"Tomorrow\\", \\"Slipped Away\\" and \\"When You're Gone.\\"  The songs that make up GL are hardly of the same caliber, a whole album of ballads just doesn't make sense.  If this album had been released second in her career as opposed to fourth, people would be saying she hit the dreaded \\"sophomore slump.\\"- a second album that goes downhill.    I will still remain a fan, I haven't come this far to turn my back now.  I will just be looking forward to the fifth album and hopefully she can turn it around then.
0198326769|2.0|Unfortunately, after reading The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne I could not possibly envision myself selecting this book from my shelf anytime in the future. Though this novel sheds some light on the misfortunes of the Holocaust by introducing the life of a regular, everyday family, it was not an enjoyable read. Though this German family living in Berlin may seem normal, there was one twist to these people's lives, and that was their father's career. A mother, a son, and a daughter, followed their father, a Nazi leader during the Holocaust to a new, unwelcoming home. The hardships they faced were unexpected and interesting to read about, yet I found many flaws throughout the novel.  Bruno, the son in this German family, seems to be the youngest, yet the wisest. He forms an incredibly close bond to a young Jewish boy who lies behind the fence that separates society into two. Just outside their new home, lies camp Out-With. Bruno's selfish and snobby sister Gretel, who lived in the bedroom next door, seemed to show little care in the brutal lifestyle of those behind the fence. Being that she was older, she seemed to have known much more about the camp itself than young Bruno. Though Gretel knew so much more, Bruno's lack of knowledge gave him the opportunity to ignore the discrimination that his people inflicted upon Jews. \\"Jews,' said Bruno, testing the word out. He quite liked the way it sounded. `Jews,' he repeated. `All the people over that side of the fence are Jews.\\" (p. 182)   Bruno was unaware of his brave, courageous, and rebellious actions, but in becoming best friends with a Jew, I find him to be the wisest of them all. His weak Mother knew exactly what she was doing when she brought her family behind her husband to their new home. She was obviously against the way the Jews were being treated and the fact that her husband led a majority of it, but she was unable to stand up to him or anyone else around her. It wasn't clear in the novel, but she seemed to have had a relationship with one of the Lieutenants in the home, Lieutenant Kotler. I found this to be nothing but a distraction from the story, for there was not enough information about the relationship for me to have felt an impact. Lastly, is the Father, the reason this novel has come to book stores. His leadership seemed to be his most prized possession. Being a leader in the Nazi revolution, Bruno's father was strict, ignorant, and incredibly distant. There were no bonds between the Father and any character in the book. This brings me to inform readers around the world that The Boy in the Striped Pajamas portrayed an incredibly poor sense of relationships. Not only that, there were very limited views of the characters in the book besides young Bruno and his new friend.   Bruno's friend was a young Jewish boy, same age as he, who lived on the other side of the fence. Shmuel was skinny, tired, and seemed incredibly miserable all the time. The young boy's friendship was an inspiration and quite amazing to read about, but I disliked the fact that Bruno was simply just clueless. If Bruno had known about the discrimination and the reason behind camp Out-With and the large fence yet still loved Shmuel the same way, there would have been a much deeper message with a larger impact on the reader. It seemed incredibly unrealistic that this camp was in his backyard, and he knew so little about it. Being that he was jealous of all the people in the Striped Pajamas, it was obvious he was completely unaware of his life and the lives of others around him. It was his ignorance that allowed him to be so wise.   Bruno eventually takes a large step and crosses the fence, joining the other half of society. The description that the author left us with was vague and pathetic. \\"Instead there were crowds of people sitting together in groups, staring at the ground, looking horribly sad; they all had one thing in common: they were all terribly skinny and their eyes were sunken and they all had shaved heads, which Burno thought must have meant there had been an outbreak of lice there too.\\" (p. 208) The description given left the reader with no new knowledge and no deep feelings of sadness or shame. I grew irritated from this description because it is merely foolish to be in camp Out-With and to assume the reason for each individual's shaved heads was due to lice. There were no strong moments for the reader or for Bruno to feel deep emotions for the people in this situation.    This novel does not give a pleasant, meaningful, or even darkening mood to a reader. I felt very little emotions, connections, and relationships among the characters and between myself and the book. I cannot recommend this to anyone who is looking for a thoughtful and evocative book.

1433502410|5.0|The ESV study Bible hardcover just arrived today in my mailbox. It's very beautiful and the resources inside are very very cool.  The only thing I have to complain is the paper. Goodness, it feels like it's gonna torn so easy...very very thin.I have to be careful. WIsh it had the same quality paper as the Application study bible. But overall its a very nice study bible and, full of resources.    This is an update after having the bible for a week: Well, while still full of resorces, the application study bible is a little more helpful to me. May be it is just my opinion, but I found myself always refering to the Application notes while studying to get a better understanding.
0061537969|5.0|Garth Stein's third novel, \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\", is phenomenal on so many levels. Told from the perspective of a wise, old dog, Enzo, the novel is told retrospectively and is brought to a heart-wrenching end that had me on the verge of tears. Enzo tells the story of the life of his owner, Denny Swift, who also happens to be an up-and-coming car racer. As a result of being alone all day while Denny is gone, Enzo gains a lot of knowledge of the outside world just by sitting and watching TV; he gathers knowledge by simply listening as he cannot speak. Enzo is also able to harbor knowledge of racing by watching footage of Denny racing; Enzo constantly connects the art of racing in the rain with the art of being a human, repeating the mantra, \\"That which you manifest is before you\\".  The book tells of a very happy family: Denny, his wife, Eve, and their daughter, Zoe. The book also tells of a very torn family. One night, Enzo realizes something is wrong with Eve, but he cannot do anything about it. Terrible things happen to good people, as Denny, Eve, Enzo and Zoe are thrown into a whirlwind of tragedies. Although the outcomes of many of those tragedies are somewhat predictable, Stein still finds ways to evoke a multitude of emotions from the reader. At points I yearned to be in the book and to fix everything as Enzo, as a dog, could not.    My only complaint is that Enzo's knowledge and behavior gradually appears to be too human. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his musings about being a typical dog (watching crows, coping with loneliness, the lack of an opposable thumb), however I found it very strange when, later in the book, Enzo began philosophizing and making profound connections between car racing and human life. I don't mean to sound doubtful about dogs' intelligence and their ability to be emotionally attached to their owners, but Enzo seems to frequently transcend the boundary between being a dog and being a human. At times it seems as if Garth Stein istalking, not Enzo.    This is a book I would recommend to just about anyone, but especially to dog owners and pet lovers. Don't be repelled by the philosophical musings and the occasional racing lessons. The book explores themes such as rebirth and destiny, as Enzo thinks he will be a human in his next life; Enzo fantasizes about the day he gets to meet his owner and shake his hand, opposable thumbs and voice intact. The novel is full of life lessons that I certainly took a lot away from. One that stuck with me is something Enzo thought when referring to his future life as a human: \\"To live every day as if it had been stolen from death, that is how I would like to live.\\" (pg. 160)

0805028846|5.0|As other people have written in their reviews, I also own several books on Pop-up techniques ... and for me, this is one of my favorites.<br />The book starts with very simple basics. Once you create the easy \\"basics\\", the lessons advance with each project... building on the \\"previous\\" lesson/formula. And with each consecutive lesson... they becomes slightly more changeling.<br /><br />If you don't take the time to \\"make\\" and truly understand each lesson, you will soon find yourself \\"lost\\". So take the time to fully learn each lesson before you move on to the next lesson. Even if that means repeating the lesson... over and over.... until you do understand it completely or see a mistake you have made.<br /><br />For this reason, I find this book an excellent teacher. You can't just jump randomly all over the book. And yes, some lessons are \\"tricky\\". But, wow! Once you finally \\"get-it\\", you see how amazing paper engineering is. And you'll start to get creative ideas of your own.<br />This book pushes you to \\"think\\" and \\"create\\" on your own.<br />If you want templets and every single measurement down to the millimeter, this book is not for you.<br />If you truly want to learn paper engineering, so you can \\"create\\" pop-ups using your own brain and idea's... this book is for you.

Having grew up with many of them we have now turned over the visual and story lines to our grand daughters and the same holds true for them too. It just proves the quality and staying power of the Disney quality that has so long endured over the years. Always a win-win situation.   Thank you for for all the family enjoyment.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Wonderful CD. I like the diversity of his songs he didnt focus on one sound or topic. All the songs compliment the other. I really enjoyed thi CD and seriously can listen to the whole album. I only skip \\"the way you are\\" because it is over played on the radio. However the songs are well produced. If you like Cee-lo Green and B.O.B they feature on a song thats fire.
0756404738|4.0|If the first book was a 10, this one is a 7-8.  I enjoyed the story and found it entertaining. However, it was not worth waiting four years for.  At this pace, Kvothe is aging slower then the books are coming out.    My advice to the Author and his staff, get the next book out in 2012.  Quit the year round partying, worldwide book releases, and the constant interviews and pats on the back and get the next book edited and to market.

B003F3NDP8|3.0|I have watched Desperate Housewives for the last few years and have tremendously enjoyed the episodes. In Season Six the inhabitants on Wisteria Lane are back to regale us with their quirky and idiosyncratic behavior.<br /><br />Ominous and evil characters - the Bolens move into Wisteria Lane and take up the house in which the previous inhabitant had committed suicide. Soon things become sinister and people start getting 'bumped' off apart from beautiful girls who suddenly vanish. Susan Mayer's daughter, Julie, is hospitalized and Susan is left to grieve - bringing out Teri Hatcher's acting ability that is as flawless as she considers everyone to be.<br /><br />Lynette and Tom are expecting the stock to visit them and their children find it strange that their parents are \\"still at it\\". Later when Angie Bolen is in danger the surprising life-saver is none other than Gabriel, who puts her own life on the line.<br /><br />Unfortunately the extras with this sixth season are very few, which leaves the viewer 'wanting more'- gasping for more. That apart: Too many new characters and story-lines seem to have drowned out the lives of the main players. Let's hope that Marc Cherry creates a better \\"packaged\\" and juicier storyline in Season Seven.<br /><br />I do strongly feel that something should - read MUST - be done about the packing of the DVDs in Season Seven. Season Six packing left a lot to be desired. The flimsy middle partition that contained DVDs on either side is certainly not the best way to package DVDs. That aside Desperate Housewives Season Six is series worth possessing on DVDs.

B004LOUD80|5.0|LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972) is the film that brought Wes Craven to the movie world, and the movie was a smash hit.  But the film proved so controversial and caused people so much discomfort that theatre owners and projectionists cut each copy of the film to keep audiences from over-reacting.  The plot is absolutely clear from the ads promoting the film:  A young woman is dying in the woods.  What happens next?  LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is one of the few films that actually tries to express what violent acts not only do to the victims but also the perpetrators.  When the parents of one of the victims find out that their daughter's killers are staying in their house, they exact their own VIOLENT revenge.  Many people hate this film for its depiction of torture and violence, yet Hollywood keeps churning out revenge pics with glowing critical support.  LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is brutal and difficult to watch, but it doesn't pull its punches, which makes it a brilliant little exploitation flick.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|As the 31st reviewer it's going to be hard to find something novel to say, so I'm going to keep this short.  \\"Collapse Into Now\\" is a fine album.  Yes, it's not as good as Accelerate, but that's likely to be the case for many albums to come.  It beats Accelerate in that every song is excellent (I'm looking at your \\"Sing for the Submarine\\"), and that there is a decent variety in styles and tempo. It could be argued that lyrically the album is weak, but let's be honest, nobody should be putting R.E.M. lyrics under a microscope since that would be missing the point.<br /><br />Packaging-wise there are few surprises. It's the pretty standard 3 piece gate-fold cardboard affair, and sadly the artwork is less than inspiring. The CD comes with a lyric book, which disappointingly does not have lyrics to the closer, \\"Blue\\", the one song on the album that could really do with printed lyrics.<br /><br />Surprisingly my favorite song is the oh-so-simple \\"Walk It Back\\". The first time I heard it I hated it, but it's a grower.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like R.E.M. then you're likely to enjoy \\"Collapse Into Now\\".  For $9.99 you're going to be pushed to find something more enjoyable.  Money well spent, I say.
0553573403|2.0|First of all, I love these books.  The characters are rich and well thought out, and the world they live in has not been matched by anyone, save Robert Jordan.  With that said, this e-book is atrocious.<br /><br />If I have to stop every other page and try to figure out what word goes in place of the disjointed letters on the page, it completely pulls me out of the story.  In one instance you just see \\"200\\" in the middle of a sentence that is important to the plot, leaving you to have to figure out what was meant.<br /><br />Especially in a book so complex as this, every spoken word, turn of phrase, or setting description may be important, it seems foolish to so poorly proofread it.<br /><br />TLDR: Great book, crappy e-book translation.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|A very sobering movie about both the good and bad in life. It is very real and could be sad but at the end all is well and there is a sensible and happy ending

B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|Hm. This is an intriguing listen. For years R.E.M. fans have been defending the band's various post-Bill Berry missteps by proclaiming them \\"underrated\\", but come on. We all know they were not nearly on the level of the late `80s, early `90s material. Then came Accelerate, a powerful, if somewhat straightforward, musical representation of anger and frustration. And here we are. Now.     I judge music on intentions and how well those intentions were carried out. Collapse Into Now's intent was to show us that a band with 14 albums already under their belt can take their basics and make them new and exciting. For the most part, Collapse Into Now does this. The fun, thumping \\"Discoverer\\" is a great album opener, reminiscent of the kind of \\"These Days\\"  excitement that has been missing for a long time in the R.E.M. catalogue. It gives way to \\"All the Best\\", which is not a great follow-up song and is all too reminiscent of Accelerate, but its message that R.E.M. is trying to prove something (\\"I'll show the kids how to do it fine\\") is crucial to the meaning of the work as a whole. Perhaps it was just misplaced. Then there's \\"Uberlin\\", which is a terrific update of \\"Drive\\" and, though we feel the tiredness of the narrator, the song feels fresh, and that balance can probably be entirely credited to Stipe for his fantastic performance and effective lyrics. \\"Oh My Heart\\" chronicles a man's return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina, and is possibly the most effective piece on the album, giving a shout-out to \\"Houston\\" from Accelerate with the lines \\"The storm didn't kill me/The government changed...\\". The mandolin sound is straight from \\"Losing My Religion\\" but it does not sound hackneyed here; rather, it is haunting and beautiful. \\"It Happened Today\\", if lazy on lyrics, makes up for it in the sheer beauty of the harmonies that make up over half of the song. \\"Every Day is Yours to Win\\" is an odd one, and I think it gets mixed up in itself thematically, but it is a pretty piece of music. \\"Mine Smell Like Honey\\" is refreshing in that Stipe is not afraid to be a little silly like in olden days, but I fear that it is the wrong choice for a lead single. \\"Walk it Back\\" feels like filler but is tolerable, and then comes one of the best: \\"Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter\\". The song's lyrics are whimsical and the riff is catchy to say the least. And I applaud for Peaches for doing a great job without overshadowing Michael Stipe. \\"That Someone is You\\" is a fun one. It's succinct and the lyrics are unpretentious and honest. Then comes \\"Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I\\". It is an introspective, surreal head trip, bringing us back to the atmospheric effects of New Adventures in Hi-Fi, and it's a noble attempt, if slightly overbearing. \\"Blue\\" was an excellent choice as an album closer, with its grand poetic rants backed by Patti Smith grumbling out words, her voice wavering and haunting as always, eventually giving way to the \\"Discoverer\\" riff, which is a brilliant idea. The overture connects to the finale, the beginning to the end.       So all in all, what is this album? It is a collection of songs, held together by a theme. The theme is R.E.M. From beginning to end, this album is very R.E.M. It takes from all their different phases and brings it all together. I wouldn't mind if this were their last album in the sense that it does so much justice to the rest of their career. Perfect? No. But damn near.

0374139563|3.0|I can't say that I 'enjoyed' this work -- the prose is stilted and the audience is more of an academic bent. That said, I still found elements of this to be quite fascinating. All NGO's should take a look at this and see if their intentions and the likely results really line up. Too many believe that throwing money at the problem is adequate, but the truth is that this is often counter-productive. Her ideas are noteworthy, particularly when set against the fact that she is from Zambia and can be expected to provide a true picture of life there.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile piece to study. Should be required reading for the State Department, the liberal side of the political scene and NGO's.

0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chboskky is a captivating novel about adolescent development through social experiences and interactions. The story, written in the form of letters, is narrated by a shy introvert who is intelligent beyond his years. The accurate and rambling voice of a troubled freshman is what makes this book unique and touching. Charlie is a confused boy bordering adulthood who takes the reader through an emotional and dramatic journey of his first year of high school.    Charlie, like most high schoolers, is faced with every day battles: an older sister who thinks he is a pest, parents who don't want him staying out too late, and bullies in the school hallway. But Charlie is also exposed to extreme and intense situations such as violence, rape, and the suicide of his best friend just a year earlier. These exposures, along with the sexual abuse he endured as a kid, cause Charlie worry about things that others would find insignificant and immerse the reader in his life to the point at which we feel like his experiences are happening to us.    Charlie, although he is unaware of it, struggles with the disloyalty of those closest to him. He loved his Aunt Helen very dearly, but her betrayal is ultimately the reason why he can't \\"participate\\" in life. He is \\"very interested and fascinated by how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.\\" Walking through the hallways or sitting alone smoking a cigarette leads Charlie to strange and unsettling realizations.   The idea of submission plays a huge role in Charlie's life, especially when he starts dating a girl named Mary Elizabeth. Mary Elizabeth is infatuated by beauty and is constantly asking Charlie if he thinks she is pretty. Charlie, not knowing any better, completely gives in to Mary Elizabeth's pleas and this eventually leads to their breakup. When Charlie's homosexual friend, Patrick, makes advances at Charlie, Charlie doesn't object. At the end of the story we learn that Aunt Helen's actions made a strong impact on Charlie's character even though he was unaware of this.    With the help of his teacher Bill, who recognizes his potential, and his friends Sam and Patrick, Charlie attempts desperately to figure out what is wrong with him. Every day in Charlie's life is filled with dramatic events and heavy thinking. But Charlie is wise, and he therefore knew when he was going to that \\"unhappy place,\\" or in other words a mental breakdown. When he was feeling happy, he would say things like \\"I don't want to start thinking again. Not like I have this last week. I can't think again. Not ever again.\\" Of course, Charlie wasn't able to stop his thinking and he was usually left feeling even more confused and frustrated.   This is a story that will stick with you long after you've finished reading. Each letter leaves you feeling more intrigued by and sympathetic towards Charlie. The only part of the story I found unsettling was that we never learn whom Charlie is addressing these letters to. All we know is that Charlie is anonymous and he therefore speaks openly and freely to the recipient of the letters. I would definitely recommend this novel to teenagers and readers who don't always need a happy ending. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is quick and easy to read. You will either identify with or be irritated by Charlie, but as a reader you won't be able to detach yourself from this quirky narrator. Chobsky perfectly captures Charlie's heart wrenching tidbits in this novel.
B002ZG999U|5.0|this is just a great action movie to watch i just rented the movie off Amazon instant video and i thought about buying it once but now i will buy it for sure. i have to say my favorite character was Christmas in the movie he wields a knife no like no other can and he has some what more of a story than the other guys do. i also liked Crews character (sorry cant remeber his name) for those of you that played COD MW 2 you should recognize his weapon of choice the AA-12 shotgun and he knows how to use it. you can tell age has hit some of the actors (Stallone and Lundgren in fact) but that still does not trash this movie. and to mention the fight choreography was great its been a while since ive seen a movie with this much hand to hand combat with such good fighting scenes. there are some parts that turned me off kind of as in sorry(SPOILER ALERT) Austins death it just generally looked fake but i overlooked that and just kept the rest of the film in mind which still came out as a 5 star reveiw.and last the violence in the movie is almost that of the latest Rambo but not quite there. if you just want a good action movie with some of your favorite action movie actors in it this is it.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|The worst movie I have ever seen. Absolutely the worst.   Actors who are normally somewhat tolerable are horrid, including seagal trejo, deniro, and alba.Script was made apparently when writers were stoned,am sure it sounded very good at the time.     A quarter at a yard sale for this would be overcharging; and would have to say 12 hail mary's for taking advantage.
0545265355|5.0|It's hard for me to review this without sounding like a fangirl. I'll just say this: I read them because I had so many of my friends (adults) tell me how much they loved it. They were absolutely right. It's one of the few books that make you feel as if you belong in the world the author created more than your own real life. Fantastic.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have been a Les Miserables SUPER fan since I first saw it on Broadway in 1994 and everytime since.  There is just no better than this show.  This concert was out of this world.  While no one does it better than Colm, Alfie Boe gave it the role of Valjean such power.  You can read everything else on the other reviews, I agree with them.  I would like to talk about Nick Jonas.  First, can we please stop comparing him to Michael Ball!? Ball originated the role and no one can compare to him, but that was 25 years ago (and again 15 years ago) and he isn't Marius any more.  While I agree that Nick's voice was weaker than the others, there was a naive and hopeful quality to him that really suited the role and was well cast against Katie Hall as Cosette.  So, while his wasn't the strongest of the show, it isn't fair to compare him to the original and someone who is a veteran of Broadway.  I think we need to allow Nick to develop his voice and recognized that he carried the character well.  When you look at the whole picture of this AMAZING concert, you'll see that the characters that really carry the show are so beyond well cast and the DVD is sooooooooo worth owning for anyone who is a fan.  Enjoy it and take the role of Marius for what it is, a young boy hopelessly in love finding his way, which Nick Jonas (a young boy finding his way) plays well.

1453682929|4.0|Although The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle consisted of only a small collection of the vast library of short stories that Doyle created surrounding his famous, quirky detective, the reader was still easily able to envelop himself or herself in all of the stories. It certainly does not take a Sherlock Holmes afficionado to quickly grasp the relationships between the main characters, Holmes and his trusty sidekick Dr. Watson, the gloomy setting of nineteenth century London, and the consistent formula in which the pair go about solving the mysteries that they are presented with. His subliminal, cunning approach to the mysteries in front of him leave both his allies and adversaries awestruck. \\"Whenever you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\\"<br />Sherlock Holmes employs a combination of logic and visceral sensations to come to his conclusions, which almost always make the most intricate crimes and mysteries seem simple and rational. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle teases the reader in all of these stories because the brilliant Detective Sherlock Holmes is always more than one step ahead of the reader. Holmes always keeps you in the dark until the last moment then suddenly unravels the entire mystery in front of your eyes. This consistent structure to the stories of Sherlock Holmes that keeps the audience on their toes sets the pace for a very light read and a rapid-page turner.<br /> The most inspiring of Sherlock Holmes many impressive and eccentric characteristics is his insatiable appetite and unwavering hunger to solve every single crime that he is confronted with. Detective Holmes often expresses his excitement for a mystery right before he begins to hunt for clues by saying \\"The game's afoot,\\". The unique language that is used in all of the dialogue between Sherlock Holmes and his trusty ally Dr. Watson are guaranteed to enchant Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's audience.<br /> Reading these short stories was so pleasurable because even though the author didn't explore the depths of more serious themes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was able to charm his readers with captivating plots and one of the most original, brilliant characters in all of literature, Detective Sherlock Holmes. These stories can possibly become tiresome because of their analagous traits so reading these stories should be read in measured quantities. Nevertheless, Sherlock Holmes is an undying literary hero who never disappoints. He attacks every mystery with the same relentless vitality and genius and is able to strengthen the minds and evoke admiration in all who are familiar with his work.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Yes I am a \\"Breaking Bad Junkie\\". I love to watch this show because the peformaces are phenomenal! Jesse and Walt really have some serious talent here.  Bryan Cranston is a genuis. Breaking Bad is the most unique show I have ever watched on television.  I seen some great shows that AMC has released however this one is by far the best I've seen so far.  I love \\"Mad Men\\" as well because this show was altogether oustanding and remarkable. Thank you AMC for this wonderful production!!!

1905236042|5.0|I have four children, ages: 2yrs, 5yrs, 9yrs, and 11yrs.  The three youngest are girls.  We are new to yoga and have enjoyed these delightful, playfully illustrated cards that teach kids yoga poses.  Some of the names are changed to make them a little easier for younger children to relate with, but even my tween son likes this. The poses that require two people are extra fun.  I like that it is easy to make up my own set for them.  They love playing Yogi says where one person picks a card for everyone to do.  It has been a great way to introduce my kids to yoga.  We have this set as well as one other kids yoga card set and two different kids yoga dvd's and are able to do something different each day so they don't get bored.  I love this and highly recommend it.    P.S. We homeschool and are able to use yoga for our physical education each day.
0807014273|5.0|There are an ton of reviews on this book already and I couldn't possibly come up with other insights that haven't been mentioned yet. I just felt I needed to add another 5 star review and recommend this life changing (saving?) book. When you feel like you're slumping or life has you down all you need to do is read this book. It's all about your attitude of life and you have complete control of this fact. Enjoy this book and read it over and over.

B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|\\"This is my time and I am thrilled to be alive\\", sings Stipe on \\"Blue\\", the final track from 2011's \\"Collapse Into Now\\", and he damn well sounds like it here. I am enjoying every second of this album, from the first listen it struck me as something special, something different, something of a revival from what REM have released in the past four or five albums. These are masters at work here, doing what they do best.    2006's \\"Accelerate\\" was a great album, I do however consider it a Peter Buck album, due to the fact that it is his guitar playing that shines throughout it's entire run.    \\"Collapse\\" seems to be Stipe's moment. Don't get me wrong, Peter Buck and Mike Mills are fantastic here, top form, and Peter Buck's return to the Mandolin is here! It's just apparent that Stipe's lyrics and vocals are some of his finest to date on the album. The lyrics are very introspective and he genuinly seems to have a direct connection to what he's saying, the poet side of him is alive and well on \\"Collapse\\".     It's the 1st time I've listened to an album from REM in the last 15 years and thought, now THESE are the guys that wrote \\"Automatic For The People\\".    What I like most about the album is the diversity it contains, the album opens with a couple of rockers that are reminisant of \\"accelerate\\" or \\"Monster\\", then the acoustic guitar comes out and REM pulls some ballads out, that bring to mind \\"Out of Time\\", or \\"AFTP\\", not duplicating though, just reminders that they can still write the masterful heartfelt ballad.     Then there's the final track, which in my opinion is without a doubt the most personal thing Stipe has ever released to the public. His vocals are delivered in spoken word form, as if he were sitting on a stool in a coffee house, pouring out the words that he's written down on paper. He's reflecting on his life and work, relationships and philosophies, showcasing a kind of pride, and optimisim toward the future..what ever it may bring, hoping that he's made those most important to him proud and happy. It's quite touching, plus Patti Smith adds background vocals, making the whole song quite rewarding!    I went back and listened to \\"Accelerate\\" again after quite a few listens of the new one here, and I think that I have gained a new appreciation for it, seems like that album was what they needed to kick themselves back into the limelight, a fast paced guitar driven album to get the fun elements of music back into their system, so that they could write such a meaningful and impiortant album the next time around, and folks that time is here, and it's called \\"Collapse Into Now\\"!    Stands alone as a new classic.

1401224253|4.0|Though it is certainly not on the level of something like, say, Watchmen, this is still a decent book, and I found it entertaining enough. My chief criticism would be that while most of the story was very intriguing, the climax and resolution felt a bit contrived and ham-fisted. The resolution of Superman's struggle happened too suddenly, and though there was plenty of set-up, the story didn't seem to be setting up for the particular conclusion it reached. But apart from this somewhat clumsy ending, if you have a few bucks to spare and have bought all the other great graphic novel essentials (Watchmen, Batman: The Killing Joke, etc.), this story is still worth reading.
B0034G4OVS|1.0|I bought this and started to watch it but the actions of the characters were so implausible I had to stop it. After the three knew they were trapped, a snow cat drives right under them. It even stops. Do they bother to throw down their skis or ski poles or something to alert the driver where they were? Nope. They do nothing. Lost me right there. It will go in the trash and I will never watch another Adam Green movie.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This turned out to be a great book.  Loved reading about Oxford.  I thought the historical details really made the book work well.  I thought the pacing was good and the characters interesting and well drawn.    2 main criticisms  1)  that the relationship between the leads while moving, beliveable and intense is also strangly tepid and asexual.  It is almost as if the author is afraid of writing the more intimate bits.  (Spoiler alert***)  It is hard to imagine they are not having sex... it is odd and distracting.  It does not ring true and seems more like author simply does not want to write about it...the bits that she did include.. I was not exactly certain what they were doing?  It was not until the main female lead notes that they had not yet consummated the marriage that I realized that the earlier \\"bundling\\" scene did not include sex.  Strange.    2)  While I like a series, I am not thrilled when the individual book does not have an ending within the series.  While I could see the demarcation between first and second book, and it made sense I did not feel like this first book had an ending.    All in all, I almost wish I had not found this author until she had finished the series.  I hate to wait.  It so much easier to find them when all the books are done and you can read them all right away.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B0045FTR0K|5.0|Apparently it is true what I have read that some sacd and/or dvd/sacd players have difficulty playing this new shm-sacd \\"songs in the key of life\\", particularly the 1st track; however, I listened to this green disc and sonically it is superior to all other versions and can be called the \\"definitive\\" version of this outstanding album.  Instrument and vocal details are astonishing, I listened to it on a Yamaha CD-S1000BL sacd player that had no skipping problems at all, just outstanding! Personally, I would avoid buying low-end sacd players.
0446195529|3.0|Not quite sure what the intended audience is here.  There's people dying every five minutes but nobody is having s*x and the story centres around a group of allegedly mature professional adults who refer to themselves as the Camel Club.  Rather reminiscent of some juvenile books I read in my childhood, but as far as being an adult read, this books falls far short.  I've read all of Mr. Baldacci's books over the years and for the most part really enjoyed them.  Granted, his earlier style was to always focus the plot around some kind of long-distance chase, but still I was entertained.  Not so much by the Oliver Stone/Camel Club series.  Methinks this book was \\"mailed in\\".
0525951652|5.0|I am shocked other reviewers only gave this one star--I simply could not put it down. It is the first book I have ever read by Ken Follett and I was not dissappointed. I chose this book because I have never really understood the politics of WWI and this book really helped me understand everything that was going on.     Some of the other reviews stated that this book was not as good as Ken Follett's other books, but does that mean it only deserves one star? I should hope not. Each book should be rated for the content contained in that book alone. Also, I noticed one reviewer was upset because there was \\"too much fact\\" and not enough fiction included. The true-life events that took place in this book were just as entertaining (and shocking) as the fictional story taking place.    I really do love this book, and I have even ordered more copies for some of my friends. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves historical fiction. I really can't think of one negative thing to say about it.

B000M53GM2|5.0|In the winter of 1995, James Bond was finally back.  After a six-year drought involving a lengthy film rights lawsuit, Agent 007's dangerous, post-Cold War world was boldly transformed by director Martin Campbell's $50 million budget into a sexy, thrill-packed spy adventure that re-introduced James Bond to a whole new generation.  After actor Timothy Dalton's quiet exit from the franchise, replacement Pierce Brosnan (formerly known as TV's Remington Steele) would nimbly transcend his previous typecasting as a suave small-screen actor (much like Roger Moore did years before him) by effortlessly assuming Agent 007's license to kill and taking his rightful place in film history as the fifth James Bond.    The plot quickly ignites with the theft of an experimental helicopter in Monte Carlo by the mysterious Russian terrorist group, Janus, which includes flamboyantly vicious Russian assassin-pilot, Xenia Omatopp (Famke Janssen), in order to soon engineer an even greater robbery.  With their brutal theft of a supposedly non-existent device known as Goldeneye, which destroys electronic pulses, Janus is in a position to blackmail countries for potentially billions of dollars or risk having their vast electrical technology rendered non-existent.  Hence, Bond's subsequent investigation leads him to Russia and then to Cuba to finish off a personal vendetta nine years in the making against a renegade ex-00 agent who can anticipate his every stealthy move.    Anchored by excellent supporting performances from Sean Bean, Izabella Scorupco, Alan Cumming, Famke Janssen, Joe Don Baker, Samantha Bond, and Judi Dench, plus two terrific cameos by Robbie Coltrane and Minnie Driver, \\"Goldeneye\\" ensures that Brosnan's explosive debut as Agent 007 gives viewers literally the most bang for the buck.  Make no mistake, though: as intended, Pierce Brosnan is the show in \\"Goldeneye.\\"  Even though Dench and Janssen steal some scenes, the new James Bond ably holds his own with them and makes onebelieve he is indeed the legendary spy.  To Brosnan's further credit, his reliability here and over the next three Bonds he made (between 1997 and 2002) prevented the venerable Bond series from descending into the inconsistent, leading man revolving door mentality that the competing \\"Batman\\" franchise suffered from in a span of only eight years.    Overall, I would rank \\"Goldeneye\\" up there absolutely among the best Bond films ever made (somewhere in the Top Five), and most certainly it would prove to be Brosnan's peak Bond flick by far.  What works so well with \\"Goldeneye\\" is that the cast's fresh, invigorating performances seamlessly mesh with the amped-up budget and a sleek, inspired storyline.    Rating (scale 1-10): 9/10 (Suitable for ages 15+ due to its obvious sexual imagery).    P.S.  For nostalgia's sake, you should consider checking out the two-part, 1983 second season premiere of \\"Remington Steele\\" entitled `Steele Away With Me.'  It is really a fun romp foreshadowing Brosnan's destiny.

B000001FV1|5.0|Always liked Traffic and Steve Winwood.  Originally bought this on vinyl, then cassette.  Just completing and updating my cd collection.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|In 1986, the light-hearted \\"Star IV: The Voyage Home\\" opened to rave reviews and would go on to easily score the franchise's largest financial haul up to date.  As a result, due to a contractual clause involving two-time director (and co-star) Leonard Nimoy, the film's grand success put star William Shatner into the driver's seat for the inevitable sequel.  Three years later, his supposedly epic vision, \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" hit theaters during the first mega-movie summer, but quickly sank into oblivion joining Timothy Dalton's last 007 adventure \\"License to Kill,\\" as 1989's biggest sequel disappointments.  The question remains: if Shatner had three years to get it right vs. Nimoy getting maybe 18 months to put together the relatively solid third film, how could Shatner possibly have failed so abysmally given that much extra time and $30 million dollars to play with?    If you are unfamiliar with the plotline, the synopsis for \\"Star Trek V\\" is the following: a failed rescue mission of a trio of Romulan, Klingon, and human diplomats results in the U.S.S. Enterprise's hijacking by a mysterious Vulcan named Sybok for an odyssey to the center of the universe through something called \\"The Great Barrier\\" in search of the mythical planet \\"Sha-Ka-Ree\\" where God supposedly resides.  Along for the ride, Captain Kirk, Spock, and the crew confront their own worst past emotional traumas before discovering that Sha-Ka-Ree is ominously not what was expected.      Years later, Shatner has readily acknowledged that his lukewarm film was torpedoed by ineffective re-writes and, most certainly, shoddy special effects.  After reading in Shatner's memoir, \\"Star Trek Movie Memories,\\" about his original, fire & brimstone-themed premise, I can grasp why his employers considerably muted the storyline's excessively religious overtones.  Apparently, though, the idea of Paramount Studios telling Captain Kirk to start completely over was not an option here.  The end result is, unfortunately, proof enough.  Shatner's commendable desire for a spiritually uplifting theme once again confirms that good intentions don't necessarily translate into good movies (i.e. Christopher Reeve's similarly disappointing 1987 \\"Superman IV\\").  While Shatner and his production team occasionally conjure up a number of fun scenes, the whole film inevitably crumbles beneath the tired Shangri-La premise (and not to mention, some seriously bad science).  In other words, all too often \\"The Final Frontier\\" plays like an expanded retread of various episodes from the original 1966-69 television series.    To sum up, the combination of a weak, recycled script and disappointing FX waste a collection of nice performances while effectively rendering this \\"Star Trek\\" as a voyage boldly going to nowhere for all involved.  Perhaps writer-director Nicholas Meyer (who directed installments II and VI) might have somehow salvaged this debacle, aside from deleting the absurd half-brother gimmick between Spock and Sybok.  Realistically, though, even a screenwriting magician like Meyer would have wisely started from scratch to make it worth anyone's time exploring \\"The Final Frontier.\\"    Rating (scale 1-10): 3.5 / 10 (Suitable for ages 8 and up)    P.S.  As a note of trivia: yes, in his book \\"Star Trek Movie Memories,\\" William Shatner acknowledges that the mystical name of \\"Sha Ka Ree\\" actually originated as a not-so subtle play on Sean Connery's name, as he was the production's first choice for Sybok.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Eric Clapton \\"CROSSROADS\\" Guitar Festival 2010 is without a doubt some of the BEST guitar work by GREAT guitarists that you will ever see in your life. So if you love Blues and Rock and a little bit country you will absolutely enjoy this 2 DVD performance. Thwe only flaw is: The next Crossroads needs to add Chaz DePaolo an international blues / rock guitarist, if not, well then catch a Chaz DePaolo show wherever you can, because Chaz Keeps his guitar talking through the whole performance. Any promoter or agent looking for a sound unlike traditional blues will find a marketable treasure chest in Chaz DePaolo. (c) TazTopics

B004CRR9G0|4.0|This review is for Nausicaa on Bluray, unfortunately I have to specify since amazon has compiled reviews for Warriors of the Wind, Nausicaa on DVD, and also Nausicaa on Bluray all under this Blu Ray release.  Also, this is not a \\"movie review\\" it is a review of the BluRay edition of this film. If this was a movie review it would easily earn five stars since this is one of the greatest works of animation ever created, but has it been treated so with this BluRay release? read on to find out.    I couldnt be more excited upon hearing that Nausicaa as well as some other Studio Ghibli films would be released on Bluray in the United States!  I bought this release day at my local Target, it wasnt easy to find at least for its initial release, it took a few tries at other major retailers to find it. And even when I did it wasnt on the shelves they had to retrieve it from the inventory room, the man told me they only recieved 3 copies.   I was very pleased with the chosen artwork for the front cover, a beautiful hand drawn nausicaa with a very minimalistic brown and blue color palette.   Unfortunately, The packaging has no more surprises up its sleeve.   I was a little bummed with the obvious lack of effort that went into this packaging. When opened you will find only Disney advertising inserted inside. No collectable artwork like the new releases of Totoro, Kiki, and Laputa?  nope, you get no inserts that pertain to the movie, just two ugly discs with the same artwork on the disc as the front cover! lame, could this have been any more lazy? It is great artwork dont get me wrong, but repeated 3 times!  The strange thing is the printing on the DVD is really good with high resolution and DPI. But some lazy designer tried to add some really lame design patterns over the BluRay disc art and the image is low resolution and blurry. Thats right, it looks like it was printed on low setting on a home printer. I was very dissapointed with this.    Now on to the BluRay version of the film.    Video    After watching the bluray version a few times I can honestly say this is the ultimate version of this film, but that still doesnt mean it is as good as it could have been.  This is by far the noisiest bluray film I have ever seen. And by \\"noise\\" I mean digital picture noise. Its really bad. Some scenes look very nice and the Noise level is down, usually on the darker scenes or scenes with a blue tone palette. But some of the day scenes, especially the very beginning of the film and the dust storm look awfull! I would actually prefer watching some of those scenes compressed, and blurred over.  But, on the other hand I realize this is  now a pretty old film, about 27 years old now yikes! So I can give them the benefit of the doubt and understanding that converting this film to bluray isnt always going to be a seamless transition.  But just so im clear, there is far more eye candy in this movie watching it in high def, enough at least to forgive some of the noisy textures. The planes and rigs, as well as some of the scenes from the sea of decay look phenomenal!    sound    The jump to BluRay also doesnt really help with the sound catagory of this film at all. So if you are buying this hoping to watch this film in booming surround sound you wont. Though the english dubs are fairly new recordings the music and sound effects are mostly original and so you are still playing early 1980's recorded music and sound. It still sounds compressed. The quality lacks but the actual musical score is still in my opinion one of the best of Joe Hisaishi.    Extras    The extras are very lacking in this realease, there is nothing new here that isnt on the DVD version of this film. The\\" Enter the lands\\" world of ghibli is nothing special and is essentially just ads for other ghibli films. The only new addition is the trivia game. It will ask various questions about the film and give you a ranking of your knowledge. Its only mildly entertaining the first time through.    overall 4 out of 5    If your a fan of Nausicaa you are still going to want this release, but if your on the fence about upgrading from the DVD  remember your really only spending the extra money for slightly better picture. If you dont own this film at all I would still recommend this version.  I hope with the future ghibli BluRay releases a little bit more care and effort will go into them.    p.s. the menu screen is really lack luster and at least for me its a pain to load! also the sound effect for the buttons is mixed really load, even when the sound is only playing from the tv speakers the title screen music will be really subtle and the buttons go BOP! BOP! BOP! yikes Disney.
0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay Review   My review was on the book called, Mockingjay, by Suzanne Collins. The book is about Katniss Everdeen, who after being in the hunger games two times, has survived and is ready fro the war between the Capitol and the rebels of the some of the districs. Peeta, altough has been captured by the Capitol. Gale has managed to escape with some of the people of distric 12, and distric 13 has arised from the shadows and ready for a war. Now the war rages on for the final battle between the Capitol and the rebels who want to be free. Katniss is going to have to be ready for everything.   I thought that the book was really good, but not as great as the other two books in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong it has some really good details in some parts, but it didn't meet my standards of what I was expecting for the final book. I would have expected more war or more romance, instead I read a lot of conversation or training. Like I said before it was a full waste, it had some good moments, especially towards the middle of the book. There is where my standards were meet with the book. I finally started to feel what I was looking for. At the end I thought that it was an okay book, but could have been put more thought on to be inproved. It would have been a better book and more people would have liked it.

0756404738|2.0|***Potential Spoilers***      Jarring -   I'd rate the book higher except descriptions of, and references to, casual sex came across to me as an author's commentary about real-world personal events, not the character's impression of a different culture.    In style, the sex stuff stands out like some other author's inexplicably inserted edits, not matching the lyricism and fairytale feel of the character's telling of a story in an inn.    No relation to story -   The in-story comments along the lines of \\"I do not understand your culture's hangups about casual sex\\" felt like author wish-fullfilment, not story-telling.  Without the casual sex stuff made part of the character's...character, I fear way too much ink was spilled in early onset \\"Old Male SciFi Writer's Syndrome\\", which I describe as, \\"Went here and women threw themselves at me, went there where same damn thing happened and I can't explain why\\"  (i.e. later works of Heinlein and Asimov).  I mean really, if the author is spending his effort writing it and reader's attention is spent on it, it damn well should be made part of the protagonist's characterization, which it isn't.    The in-story excuse \\"I was a young male, do you think I'd say no?\\" just does not fit the character given us.  That sort of attitude is not referred to again or reflected anywhere else.  It felt like the author was trying to after-the-fact excuse his wasting reader's attention.  Instead, that young male self obsession is contradicted without explanation in everything else the character does; for example in the rescue section, which would have been an ideal time to compare/contrast attitudes about casual sex.     For readers, here's my recommendations to make it a more enjoyable story for yourself and more like the excellent first of the series:  a) skip the pages of running about naked with fey and secret super sex tricks that intrude like an excerpt from some Star Trek Ferengi's boasts of home life.  b) skip the teacher's frequent casual sex with student, it disrupts reader suspension of disbelief.   c) skip the scene with the superduper swordswoman, maybe its purpose was to present cultural misunderstandings and missteps that were actually better storytold elsewhere but it felt more like a frat-boy's conquest boasting.    Following the above you won't miss a thing because these scenes are never referred to again and are not part of the story arc.

B004LGPBZI|4.0|Oasis never made any bones about who it was they were emulating. Everyone knew they were paying homage to the Beatles. Never a rip off just a pay back in their own sold form of songwriting and style. Beady Eye is no Oasis,but \\"DGSS\\" it is still a good album and is a promising look at what the future may hold for the band.Every song is pretty simple but not shallow,similiar to the sound of the good old rock from the sixties. Some songs are pretty repetitive and some seem almost childlike,however there is still a catchiness to them that keeps a listeners attention.     Liam G. is not trying to change anything about himself for the band. He is still the statuesque front man that he was for Oasis.(this refers to the cd/dvd version).    I was surprised to learn that the rest of the band is also the members of what was Oasis. The fact that these guys stayed with Liam says alot in my opinion. I think maybe the boys need time apart,to prove something to them selves (or maybe Liam is the only one that needs that). I think they will be fine and good apart,in their own elements. They will only be great together and hopefully they will learn that,just as previous great bands have had too. That being said,I am not one of the Oasis fans who will be slamming Liams efforts and spinning ideas that he is riding anyones coat tails. I wont be doing that because it is obviousley untrue. There is great effort here,and this product coupled with the \\"Pretty Green\\" clothing line is evidence that for some reason Liam was stifled before,be it of his own imaginings or be it sound reasons,his creativity was not blossoming. It is now budding and I do encourage its growth.
0439023513|5.0|I loved all three of these books.  Spent whole days just reading when I could.  This one is pretty sad though.  I was crying at the end.  I'm still thinking about weeks after I finished reading these books!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I like that this show has a solid story arch even though it's easy to pick up on an episode independently, somewhat like the earlier seasons of X-files.
0756404738|5.0|Well, I have to say that before reading this book, I spent a while looking up all the bad things people had to say about Book 1. Just to cool my Pat fanaticism down. And after reading it, I read all of the bad things people say about this one. All in all, there are those who like NotW but do not like WMF, and those who simply dislike Rothfuss's style. I personnaly love the flowing poetic prose, the strong internal perspective. I believe that this is like The Great Gatsby in that the way the story is told should tell you more about Kvothe, just like the narration of TGG shows Nick's true self(for those who discard Kvothe as a cardboard character at best because the see him exel in everything).  This said, WFM is quite different from NotW, not in the style but in the subject. In the first book, we meet Kvothe. We learn more about him. He settles down at the University. Most of the book is basic character building through the actions and reflection of the character. Little is said about the world and it's peoples, or places.  However, in book two we know Kvothe, and it simply continues his evolution. What you DO see is other places, peoples and characters. People who are not \\"weak characters\\". Kvothe simlply does not know all there is to know about them. The Adem, the Maer, and all of the different places Kvothe travels to, serves to make the world of Kvothe more real, more interesting.  The one worry that haunts the reader throughout the book, however, concerns its slowness. Indeed, Book 2 takes us through Kvothe age 16-17. Kote is 23, has been innkeeper since the age of 22 (about). How on earth will Pat finish up all of this in the 3rd book?    I love the way things are written and described. The fragility of Kvothe's relationship with Denna keeps tension through happy lighthearted scenes. However, it's true that WMF is almost entirely written in the same style as the Trebon adventure in the end of NotW: detailed action. How will Kvothe kill a king, learn about the Amir, become a master of names? While finding the time to squeeze a little trip into the realm of the Fae and pick up Bast on the way? Not to mention his chase for the Chandrian and the apparition of demonlike spiders...  One thing that strongly disappointed me was the passsages skipped over by Kote. My dearest wish would be for Pat to take his time, look into each nook and cranny of Kvothe's life for wonderous stories, and make a 5-book series out of it. The book is not slow by any means, it is intense. Time passes slowly but many things happen. If some of Kvothe's raw emotion from his tough childhood is missed in the second book, he becomes more or a commanding character himself. This is why I give this book 5 stars: Rothfuss polishes his delightfull prose, strengthens his fanstastic universe and shows us Kvothe's growth. To top it all, Kvothe's personality changes more than his powers do.    That said, I am convinced that Pat still has a lot of work to do, still has a way to go before his style truly is polished. This is the greatest thing about this novel: it is delightful, yet I feel that Pat has and will improve. It makes me trust that the author knows what he is doing: Book 3 will be action-packed and maybe the best of the three. I sure hope so.
B000SXOI66|5.0|I remember a time when I heard the name Pink Floyd and just laughed.  Like many, I asked which one was Pink.  I had no idea what they were about but I didn't think I would like them.  Fast forward a few years.<br /><br />This is the fifth (I believe, could be more) time I have purchased this album.  This is my first mp3 download, but fifth (I believe) overall purchase.  CD's get scratched, lost, stolen, broken, etc.  I can't get enough of this album, as I have listened to it 1,000's of times over my life.  This is a classic album - period.  This is one of the best musical pieces of all time, regardless of the genre.<br /><br />This is timeless. This is classic.  This is music.  If you have never heard their music, buy this album.  If you are curious, spend the few dollars and become a fan like millions of others.  The only thing better is seeing them live, which none of us have done for a few years now.  The best we have now is replica bands (Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!).<br /><br />Buy it.  'Nuf said.
0439023491|5.0|I loved all three of these books.  I'm still thinking about them two weeks after I finished reading them.  Definiatly one I will read over and over again!  Also the price was great for a hard back!

0312600844|2.0|There were a few entertaining moments in this book, but for the most part, it was about unlikeable people behaving selfishly.  I would recommend [[ASIN:B001KWFIBS We Were the Mulvaneys [Hardcover]]]  as a similar but more invigorating look at family misfortune.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is an absolute \\"must have\\" for anyone who grew up in the 70's. The DVD is absolutely awesome - to see these 2 icons together, not only as musicians, but also as friends is just amazing.  I actually had tears in my eyes watching the video - it's like putting on your favorite pair of denim jeans.  The \\"fit\\" is perfect.
0385504225|2.0|Not a strong plot.  But entertaining almost in the same way as the film \\"National Treasure\\".  It actually reminded me of that movie a lot.    One thing that bothered me.  Granted I'm not quite done with the book, but \\"INOUE SATO\\" is not a Japanese name.  Well, they are.  But they are two very common last names.  INOUE is never a first name.  So unless it turns out that this character decided to use two last names for some weird reason that is explained in the last half of the book, it is a very obvious mistake.  I can't imagine how hard it would be to ask a Japanese person \\"Hey, does this name sound OK?\\" before publishing a book this high profile.      For now, I have no faith in anything he writes in this book.  If he can make such a simple mistake (or his assistant), what else is completely wrong in this book that seemed to be filled with information that appear incredible.  Perhaps the whole book is a joke on us.    P.S.  It's possible that he did explain why this person has two last names for a name (we don't do this in Japan - yes, I'm Japanese) earlier in the book and I completely missed it.  It's not a kind of book you feel like you want to read every detail.  In fact, I am trying to practice speed reading for the last half!
B001E45XT4|4.0|Headset is great for the price. I use it on a xbox 360. Since headset is a PC gaming headset it has separate mic and earphone jacks, I had to get a xbox controller adapter that had inputs for separate mic and earphone jacks. The adapter works perfectly and with a bit of a modification with an audio splitter for the earphone part, I am able to get both game audio and voice communication at the same time while having clear mic voice communication with the people that I am playing with. The headset has large cushioned ear pieces that completely cover the ears and a padded band that goes over the head making the headset comfortable to wear. I will agree with other reviews that the bass isn't as great as it could be, it does have base but is a deep low base, just not a loud bass. During gaming I can tell from which direction gunfire is coming from (left or right) just not front and back as this is not a surround sound headset but a stereo headset. If you are a PC gamer (or an xbox gamer with the ability to modify connectivity) and are looking for a decent headset, I recommend this headset. If you want a headset for xbox and don't want to modify connections, I would recommend a Turtle Beach headset. Otherwise this is a great headset
B003Y5H542|4.0|Gore Verbinski's animated feature Rango, with voices by Johnny Depp, Ned Beatty and a host of other talented actors, is a hard film to review, mainly because its real target audience is not the one it's being marketed towards. Let me just flat out say it:  this really isn't a kids' animated movie.  Not because there's anything in it that is not suitable for kids - there isn't - but because 95 percent of what really makes it worth seeing is going to go right over most kids' heads.<br /><br />On the surface, the plot is fairly straightforward, at least in the set-up. A terrarium-housed pet chameleon lizard (it's significant after the fact that you never know his real name) ends up stranded in the desert where he is directed to a small town that is on the verge of extinction because of a mysterious water shortage. In his efforts to blend in (he _is_ a chamelon after all), he adopts the name Rango and in quick order suddenly finds himself appointed sheriff and given the mission of finding out what's happened to the town's water.<br /><br />Stylistically, Verbinski was willing to take some real chances with Rango, and anyone who appreciates animation as an art will find a lot to see here. The level of detail and sheer originality is stunning. Rango does not resemble _anything_ I've seen in an animated film before. Though set in the current day, the world of Rango is essentially an Old West town - aptly named Dirt - that's literally drying up, populated by a cast of animal characters who look like they stepped out of any number of classic Westerns. The difference between Rango and your usual animated take on this theme though is that the residents of Dirt are _not_ cute.  In addition to being much closer in look to the real animals they're based on - lizards, tortoises, toads, possums, snakes, prarie dogs and such - they're also grizzled, dusty, sun-bleached and wind-beaten, and in many cases, just downright _ugly_.  Including, or even especially, the good guys.  One suspects that merchandising for Rango will be somewhat problematic.<br /><br />But it says something that everything fits together seamlessly.  The town really looks like an Old West town on the verge of becoming a ghost town, and the characters look like they really do live there.  And again, the level of detail is stunning, from the clothes the characters wear to the characters themselves, the buildings and other structures, the interiors. The four desert-owl mariachi players who sing narration at various points in the film are a case in point.  The level of detail that is taken with their intricately shaded feathers, their embroidered mariachi costumes and their musical instruments - and the way all of these things _move_ when the characters do - is amazing.  This is a movie you could watch again and again just to appreciate how much the artists put into it.<br /><br />I have to mention two characters in particular that really stood out:  the Mayor (marvelously voiced by Ned Beatty), a tortoise modeled directly on John Huston's genial but chilling Noah Cross from the classic film Chinatown, and Rattlesnake Jake (also marvelously voiced by Bill Nighy), absolutely one of the best animated villains ever created.  It's absolutely spell-binding just to watch Jake _move_, a stunning feat of animation. I've never seen an animated character manage to radiate sheer menace on the level that Rattlesnake Jake does.  In thinking about it, I now have to amend my earlier statement somewhat; Rattlesnake Jake could definitely scare some younger children.  But that said, Rango is worth seeing for Rattlesnake Jake alone.<br /><br />My mention of Chinatown brings me to the other prospective audience for Rango:  film buffs. Rango references a truly astonishing number of movies: several classic Westerns (High Noon; The Good, the Bad & the Ugly; The Quick & The Dead, Paint Your Wagon) as one would expect, but also a number of non-Westerns, some fairly recent (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, A Bug's Life), some classic (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now) and some obscure (Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas). And of course Chinatown, not only for the Mayor character but for a number of scenes (watch for the glasses) and a good deal of the plot. And there's also a key scene that's a nod to a famous actor/director who is still remembered for his association with Westerns and for a certain classic character he created. A good example of the little in-jokes in Rango is what he's carrying around in the back of the golf cart. As I said, most kids are going to miss 95 percent of this stuff. Me, I want to get the DVD just so I can watch it again and pick out all of the references I probably missed the first time around.  It's that kind of movie.<br /><br />About my only real criticism of Rango - other than its being marketed to the wrong audience - is that parts of it are uneven and do tend to drag a bit. I think this is because the parts that do seem to be meant for kids tend not to mesh that well with the rest of the film. The parts that adults will enjoy most will probably be of little interest to kids, and the parts that kids will enjoy most will probably make things drag for adults.<br /><br />But overall, I highly recommend Rango.  It's not your typical animated film, and most kids will probably complain that a lot of it's boring, but for anyone who loves the sheer art of animation or who just loves films that reference all manner of movies from the great to the obscure, this is definitely a film you'll want to see.c (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now) and some obscure (Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas).

B002ZG99N6|4.0|Well, there is some talk in this film. There is a tender, albeit somewhat unlikely romance that entails moments of quiet conversation. But for the most part, this is a shoot-`em-up that's set, not in the Wild West, but on the mean streets of Boston. As this crew of bank robbers follow in the presumed tradition of their Charlestown section of Boston and make their living by robbing banks - the bullets fly and the blood spatters. Whatever became of just slipping a note to the teller?    So the violence shown here is rather unlikely. Rarely does even one bank robbery involve so much fire power. It would be rarer yet for a neighborhood to experience a series of bank robberies involving such exchanges of projectiles from heavy artillery. But then this is the movies, and we know we have to be prepared to suspend disbelief.    Actually, the robbery and retribution scenes in \\"The Town\\" have the quality of a violent video game. For whole sections, it's non-stop gun-fire. An adversary will pop-up and be greeted with blasts of bullets. If I had a dollar for every time someone blew someone else's head off - I'd have more than paid for this DVD.    I personally prefer to learn something from movies about bank hold-ups. I want to be in on the planning and process of pulling off such crimes. For example, we're told the robbers in \\"The Town\\" disabled phone communication from one targeted bank by \\"going into the corner junction box.\\" I would have liked more details about just how this was accomplished.     I craved even more minutiae of process. I wanted to know where the robbers bought those eerie masks they used. You'd have thought the police could have traced the robbers merely by finding the supplier of those uniquely frightening wizened nun costumes. You don't see such outfits sold at any Halloween store. They must have been custom-made. Instead of just being in on the kills, I would have liked to follow Ben Affleck and the others as they found a supplier of such masks and accessorized themselves accordingly. That would have been Seinfeld-serious fascinating to me.    But if you are action-oriented, this is the movie for you. It has slick production values, good acting, and the violence, as improbable as it is, is well choreographed and arresting.
B00005JKES|3.0|My review is about how the first season is packaged. The pilot episode isn't included in this particular version, \\"Twin Peaks - The First Season (Special Edition),\\"  so unless you luck up on a cheap one, not likely, you may be better off buying the GOLD BOX SET. but double check if the pilot is included.  the show is great, though, but won't make much sense without the pilot.
006190628X|4.0|I want to note the fantastic reading by Tom Stechschulte instead of the story, which has been analyzed enough in the reviews. Stechschulte gives characters a distinct sound, even the women, which is difficult to do. His reading and interpretation alone made the story even more enjoyable than if I had read it. The reason I gave it four stars is Dennis Lehane uses a but of language. I don't mind language when necessary, but a lot of times he seems he adds profanity just to have it in the story, and it doesn't add to the novel at all. Two examples that comes to mind (no spoiler) is the scene with Teddy and Delores in the morning and Teddy and Chuck playing cards with the orderlies. The profanity in the scenes seemed unecessary and ended up being distracting.

B000W796OM|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is the first movie in the series to feature a directorial change.  Alfonso Cuaron(the 1998 edition of \\"Great Expectations\\") steps in for Chris Columbus.  Mr. Cuaron delivers a unique Potter experience, and his \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is arguably the most creatively nimble film in the franchise to date.<br /><br />This time, Harry(a very good Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts under the threat of an escaped murderer.  It is whispered that Sirius Black betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort, and has now escaped from the wizard prison seeking Harry's death as well.  Harry must also contend with dementors, the dark guards of Azkaban who permanently extract true happiness from their victims.<br /><br />Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are again solid as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.  Newcomer Michael Gambon plays a different variation of Albus Dumbledore, less distant than the deceased Richard Harris.  David Thewlis is particurlarly enjoyable as Remus Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who takes kindly to Harry. Gary Oldman is absolutely superb as Sirius Black.<br /><br />The single thing in this movie that I truly didn't care for was the handling of Buckbeak the Hippogriff, and it goes as far back as J.K. Rowling's novel.  In the novel, the creature comes off as a distraction and something the author should have edited or eliminated.  The character translates to the screen with as much pizzazz as modern visual effects can bring, but still falls flat for me.  It's a much worse version of Fawkes The Pheonix from the previous book and movie.<br /><br />With a darker soundtrack highlighted by a choral version of the Shakespearean verse \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes,\\" \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is mostly excellent.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|Having grown up watching the original Karate Kid in the 80's, I was anticipating something a little deeper than this movie.  The original Karate Kid was simple and effective.  This new Karate Kid had fighting that was like something out of the Matrix and was totally not on par with the way kids their age would be able to fight.  I watched kids leap 20 feet through the air, jump over buildings, take hits that would leave an adult keeled over in pain yet they brushed them off and carried on for 5 minute fight scenes.  Simply too overdone in my opinion.  Although the new Karate Kid followed much of the storyline of the original, Daniel's character, now played by \\"Dre Parker\\" was a whining child who struck me as annoying through the whole film.  The ending scene was so ridiculously fake it was just plain disgusting.  In the original, with one leg hurt, Daniel used the Crane Technique which he kicked his opponent with one leg in use.  In the new version he does a one legged backflip and kicks his opponent in the face on his way down landing on his good leg.  This whole movie just left a bad taste in my mouth and was another example of why producers should leave the classics alone.  Want to buy The Karate Kid for your child?  Buy the original!
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I've been a fan since '86 when I heard Fables and that album is still my favorite.

Nicely done.

B0037AGASG|5.0|I'm 30, college educated (BA & Masters)established and I loooove Justin Bieber! I was intrigued by him when I first saw him perform \\"One Time\\" at Auther Ashe Day in 2009 b/c let's face it, there hasn't been anyone like him in a whiiiile. His music is fun, catchy and never fails to cheer me up. I purchased this CD because of the tracks \\"Baby\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\" and ended up loving all the songs so I also bought the 1st CD My World and of course I have Never Say Never-The Remixes. The track \\"Down to Earth\\" is heartfelt and relatable to all ages, actually I think all his songs are relatable. So what he's 16, well 17,there's no need to hate on this young man. Get off your high horse, lighten up and live a little. Just b/c teens girls like JB doesn't mean adults and boys should automatically dislike/hate him, give him a chance. He will be around for a long time...like Usher. He has gained the adoration of millions of fans and the repect of his peers. I'm a music lover so I appreciate all types of music/artist including JB-it's great Pop music. Not everyday can be a Amos Lee, Lady Antebellum, Coldplay or Mary J. Blige type of day. I'm a true Belieber and not ashamed to say it!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I am thrilled with this cooler.  Installed it on a i7 860 overclocked to 4 ghz that had been running temps around 72 C on the stock intel cooler at full load.  After installation, my temps now average 48-52 C under full load. It's that good.  I installed it with the two fan system - it comes with one, but for the small cost, adding a second fan is worth it and the push/pull arrangement seems to work very well.  Install is easy for anyone used to working with computer components - you don't need to be a pro.  However, I did have to remove my motherboard to install the supportive backplate because my case didn't have access to the underside of the motherboard. Overall I found the install straight forward. The build quality of the unit is excellent.  This is a quality cooler and excellent value.

0061148512|4.0|[3.6/5.0]    Esther is an extraordinarily gifted girl. Pretty, intelligent, and talented, she has qualities and accomplishments anyone would be proud of, anyone, that is, except her.  This novel is about Esther's (and Plath's) descent into a deep, dark depression that is likened to being trapped in a bell jar that separates her from the rest of humanity and from living a normal, happy life.     Esther is a bright overachiever who made straight A's her whole life and received a full academic scholarship to college. Because of her intelligence and writing ability she is invited, with 11 other girls, to be a guest editor for a popular fashion magazine for a month. The girls are treated lavishly and get to live an opulent lifestyle only a privileged few get to enjoy. Having lived in poverty her whole life, she should be delighted at being elevated to such elegant and lavish living, in the heart of New York City no less, but she is unable to enjoy her new position. In the book Esther says \\"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.\\" The hullabaloo being New York City, boisterous and lively, the eye of the tornado is her, empty and lonely.   During her paid internship Esther becomes very critical of herself, which is typical of depressed people. With all of her accomplishments, she acutely notices only her and other people's faults.     This novel is also a commentary on conventional society. Esther wants to be a poet, writer and a professor and feels stifled by the domestic role women are supposed to play during the 1950s. She finds it hypocritical how women are supposed to be pure while men sleep with as many women as they desire.     The first half of the book is sort of fun, but there are signs of her deteriorating mental state. The second half of the book deals almost exclusively with her mental illness and her descent into a dark, frightening world. When she returns to hermundane home after her internship the bell jar quickly descends over her, suffocating and trapping her. Cutting all social ties and future plans, Esther gives in to her overwhelming despair. Experiencing insomnia, an inability to read or write, and extreme depression, she decides suicide is her only option. After numerous suicide attempts Esther ends up in an asylum, which ultimately saves her life and returns her to a state of normalcy.     After a while I started to dislike Esther because she is selfish, cruel, and extraordinarily judgmental; but I guess she perceives the world around her \\"through the distorting lens of a bell jar,\\" and it's very difficult to have a positive view of humanity when you are completely miserable. Only towards the end of the book does she begin to view the world positively and the bell jar is lifted, however temporarily that may be, since in reality Sylvia Plath tragically killed herself at the young age of 30.      The reason I gave this book 3.6 stars is because, although it is well written and poetic, I feel like Plath was holding back her talent. Later, when Plath was talking about her mental illness, shock treatments, and her experience at the asylum, she said they were \\"A time of darkness, despair, disillusion--so black only as the inferno of the human mind can be--symbolic death, and numb shock--then the painful agony of slow rebirth and psychic regeneration.\\" Only very rarely, if at all, do you find any writing as beautiful and complex as that in the book.  I read the above line 4 times to let its beauty and meaning sink in and only a few times in the book did I reread anything because the sentence was deep, aesthetic and complex. Another thing that bothered me was that Plath rarely described her own subjective suffering. The book was mainly just her opinions of other people, descriptions of the environment around her and her superficial reactions to events that occur. I didn't feel like Plath dove deep enough into her agonizing internal suffering.  One thing one must keep in mind is, when writing an autobiography the author is constrained by the events that occur in one's life, where as in a completely fictitious story, like the last book I reviewed, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the author can create all sorts of interesting and fantastic scenarios, which really bring a story to life. I think that is one of the reasons why I grew bored and impatient with the book at times.

B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|OK.  It's not the soaring epic of Hopes and Fears.  But it is really a great listen.  I saw them live, and was totally amazed.  He sounded way better live (in person) then on most of the live tracks I have heard.  Stop for a minute, kills.  My Shadow is haunting.  His voice is more refined and controlled then ever.  House lights is to Keane as Life in Technicolor is to Coldplay, a terrific opener.  I admit, when I first heard Looking Back, I thought it sucked.  But, it grew on me.  Just get it, and don't heed the nay-sayers.  I had this in my car longer then Under the Iron Sea (A great album).  Keane is one of the best bands around.
0823015017|2.0|Okay, so when I saw this book, I loved the front cover and thought \\"aha, beautiful beads!\\" Not the case. The swirly beads shown on the front cover are no where to be found inside the book with directions on how to make them! Talk about bait and switch! This book rambles on and on about color choices, hues, tint, etc. I didn't want a technical term book telling me ABOUT color, I wanted to learn to make the beads on the top portion of the front cover! It is a waste of money for those who want the \\"how to actually create a bead\\" rather than \\"what color do you like?\\". Save you money and buy another book, unless you need the sleep that it brings.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott Pilgrim vs The World is an amazing movie that unfortunately performed poorly at the box office, however that shouldn't prevent you from buying this great movie/package.  The blu-ray is a great transfer, and it looks great on a large HD screen.  The sound effects come through perfectly, and the music sounds fantastic in surround sound.  The extras are great (including the deleted scenes/alternate ending) and plentiful.  As for the movie itself, Michael Cera is fantastic, however Kieran Culkin and Ellen Wong really steal the movie.  The fight scenes and visual effects are some of the best seen in movies in the past few years.  I strongly recommend this to everyone just looking for a fun movie.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I bought this album when it was released and thought it was OK. I was hoping for more of a Powerslave or Piece of Mind. Anyway, I've remained a fan and have adjusted to the new Maiden sound over the last decade. Having said that, I pulled this off the rack today for a trip in the car and was BLOWN AWAY!!! I'd forgotten how good it is!! I think part of my initial response to the album was based on preconceptions of what I wanted to hear. What I heard today was a mature band, setting out not necessarily to break new ground in the genre as in the past, but to build upon their rich history with some amazing new songs! This album came out over 10 years ago, and Iron Maiden has been one of the few '80's metal bands that remain vital to the scene, writing new albums, touring, releasing DVD's. If you thought the last good IM album was Seventh Son of a Seventh Son or Fear of the Dark, you owe it to yourself to check this out!!
0800177177|2.0|.I am halfway through listening to the audio CD of Bram Stoker's Dracula. I disagree with the reviews that said the middle part is slow and wasted. So far I am intrigued and entertained; especially by the device Bram Stoker uses of having the entire story told in letters and newspaper articles. I have been remembering the movie fondly; trying to rent it to watch on a HiDef widescreen. Then last night the movie was playing on the REELZ channel. What a mess. It was a dark, blurry print, horribly edited, and most of the time there were large adverts plastered across the image. BUT, even though the continuity was destroyed; I could tell that the film is disappointing; especially after reading the book. I also think that we have become very demanding viewers, spoiled by digital effects. The movie looks clunky, almost goofy. The acting is real bad, almost laughable. Anthony Hopkins inhabits a particularly bad Van Helsing, screaming AHA a lot and acting brash and boorish. That is not the character in the book. Other things bothered me, like Keanu Reeves grey hair after escaping from Dracula's castle. It looks fake. Some of the plot changes make no sense at all: using elements from the book but changing them for no apparent reason; like changing the escaped wolf to a white wolf, and having it visit Mina and the Count in the movie theater!!! What was the reason for that?! As other reviews have already commented upon, the major plot addition of having Dracula trying to woo Mina as his reincarnated lover is just BLECHHH! It spoils the story and sucks all the terror and horror right out of the count. I think Coppola was trying to make the Dracula legend in to a wicked Italian opera, but he ended up just making it soppy.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Finally, a Robin Hood film that has a plot!  Ridley Scott's Single-Disc Unrated Director's Cut of \\"Robin Hood\\" (2010) sets the standard for future screen plays for this 12th century English hero.  Featuring an all star cast and filmed principally in Pembrokeshire this riveting flick is so much more than the usual swash-buckling save-Maid-Marion movie attempts of the past.<br /><br />Crowe, Blanchett, MacFadyen, Von Sydow, Hurt and the rest give stellar performances.  Costuming, fight scenes (one is the English Channel surf), village life (including arcane songs sung badly by the actors), and even the reeds across all the indoor floors give this film the feeling of, if not an eye witness to, 12th century life.<br /><br />And the plot is interesting and exciting (\\"Robin Hood's\\" two hours passes quickly even with the additions from the director's cut).  Robin does much more than save Marion- he saves the realm for the ungrateful King John.  It concludes as the Robin Hood legends begin.  It is fun to watch the director's impressions for the siege of castles.  It is interesting how large groups of chain-mailed soldiers might have moved down narrow muddy wagon rut \\"roads\\" heading into battle.  Costumes here are rugged, thread-bare, and often dirty (like they must have been 800 years ago).  Scott's vision here shows English hard living in 1199 (this treatment is useable for teaching the 12th century).  Beware portions of this film reflect the barbarous nature of that age.  There's lots of blood (but little gore) in the various battle scenes.<br /><br />Refreshingly, Director Scott seems intent to tell the story rather than mucking up this great film with foul language and skin.  Among the cursing, there's no profanity.  The lines of good and bad are clearly drawn.  Robin's and Marion's playful romance features no bed scenes or body parts.  In the end, at the very end, Robin wins fair Marion's heart as they vanquish evil side by side.  Even religion gets a hardy nod through the affable and clever warrior-monk Friar Tuck.  What more could one ask for from a movie classic?<br /><br />This is a great date film, family night movie, and teaching documentary.  It goes into my \\"Best of DVDs\\" series.  It is recommended to all as the Best Film of 2010!lever warrior-monk Friar Tuck.  What more could one ask for from a movie classic?

0307454541|2.0|I'd like to preface my views with a simple fact:  This book was translated into English.  It is possible that a lot of what I feel about this book can simply be attributed to being lost in translation.  That said...<br /><br />I feel that Larsson's writing style is matter-of-fact, and not in a good way.  It entirely lacks emotion, during scenes where emotions are absolutely necessary.  There are several suspenseful parts that are entirely lost because of this matter-of-fact style of writing.  Granted, it's hard to truly explain stressful situations in third-person, but it doesn't seem like much effort was given to that regard.<br /><br />As for the characters...I find that I didn't like a single one of them.  For that matter, I didn't connect with any of them either - except for the elder industrialist, and he wasn't even a prominent character.  This means that I didn't find myself caring about their emotional distresses, nor did I care what happened to any of them.  I also found the main character's relationships to be rather shallow and insensitive, despite the many descriptions of him being a \\"good guy\\" in the eyes of the other characters.<br /><br />There are two more books in the set, but I believe that this will be a good stopping point for me.  I will not be reading more of Larsson's work.
0756404738|3.0|Oh boy. I should start off saying that I loved the first book. I think the premise of this story is really interesting and different. Rothfuss's writing style is beautiful. The first book went through the first 16 years of Kvothe's life. It was funny, heartbreaking, fast paced, all things that I enjoy in a story.  I really don't know how to feel about this book. I literally just finished it. It took me a week to read it. Considering it's almost 1000 pages, that's really not bad. But the first book only took me a couple of days. I loved the first 2/3rds of the story. I felt like I was learning a lot and it was nice to spend time with the characters at the University and Denna and everyone else from the previous book. It's after Kvothe leaves the University where things got really bogged down for me. I thought the part where he was in Vintas was interesting, but then when he went on his mission to kill the bandits, that's where I lost interest. From there, to his time with Felurian, and his time in Ademre, it took me every bit of patience to keep reading. I was so close to giving up. I had no idea what the point of Kvothe spending so much time in these places were. He didn't learn anything about the Chandrian or the Amyr. He just learned how to have sex and how to fight with a sword. Why did Patrick Rothfuss devote almost a third of the book to this nonsense when he could have done it in about 20 pages? It was ridiculous. When Kvothe finally got back to the University, things got interesting again. But that left only 100 pages to talk about all the things I wanted to read this book for. I feel like the third book has to be about twice as long as this one if Rothfuss is going to explain all the mysteries that he has set up so far. He's put too much into these stories, too many webs that he needs to finish in just one book. It will be a miracle if he can pull it off.
159420229X|5.0|Author Joshua Foer leads readers on a fantastic journey into the human mind, which includes the deep recesses of the brain's known and unknown. He leads you into the competitive nature of the geekiest of geekiest mnemonists... culminating in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. The author's first visit to the Championship is as a reporter... his second visit is as a participating finalist! That's one hell of a deviation... and the roads that are traveled along the way go in every direction imaginable... just like unlimited memories are magically brought back from all portions of the brain.<br /><br />As Joshua tries to learn everything possible about the training techniques of the \\"mental athletes\\" that attempt to break world records in memory competition... the obvious question arises... can pure hard work and training routines result in a person's mind being able to \\"match-up\\" with what the world terms a \\"savant\\"? During the exploration into these intellectual mysteries the reader will meet sad characters as well as amazing. One person you'll meet is Daniel Tammet, \\"WHOSE BRAIN HAD BEEN ALTERED BY AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE HE SUFFERED AS A TODDLER.\\" \\"DR. DAROLD TREFFERT, AN EXPERT IN SAVANT SYNDROME, DECLARED HIM ONE OF ONLY FIFTY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS A \\"PRODIGIOUS SAVANT.\\" You'll also be saddened when you get to know \\"EP\\" who has an entire chapter on his heartbreaking plight entitled \\"THE MOST FORGETFUL MAN IN THE WORLD\\". \\"EP's\\" \\"MEMORY EXTENDED BACK ONLY AS FAR AS HIS MOST RECENT THOUGHT. HE HAD ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE CASES OF AMNESIA EVER DOCUMENTED.\\"<br /><br /> Throughout this entire journey the author's literary personality combines a wonderful combination of highly intellectual investigation... with an always present \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" humor... and never leaves the reader dangling with an incomprehensible intellectual term... that he doesn't define for the average layman. There are so many memorization statistics that are (excuse any accidental pun) completely *MIND-BOGGLING*. Such as a relatively unknown Japanese mnemonist named Akira Haraguchi who *MEMORIZED THE FIRST *83,431* DIGITS OF PI! \\"IT TOOK HIM SIXTEEN HOURS AND TWENTY-EIGHT MINUTES TO RECITE THEM.\\" After reading this book you may want to go to London just to talk to a cabbie. \\"BEFORE THEY CAN RECEIVE ACCREDITATION FROM LONDON'S PUBLIC CARRIAGE OFFICE, CABBIES-IN-TRAINING MUST SPEND TWO TO FOUR YEARS MEMORIZING THE LOCATIONS AND TRAFFIC PATTERNS OF ALL 25,000 STREETS IN THE VAST AND VASTLY CONFUSING CITY, AS WELL AS THE LOCATIONS OF 1,400 LANDMARKS.\\" How does that tie in to this story? Part of the author's vast research showed that \\"IN 2000, A NEUROSCIENTIST, ELEANOR MAGUIRE AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON BROUGHT SIXTEEN TAXI DRIVERS INTO HER LAB AND EXAMINED THEIR BRAINS IN AN MRI SCANNER, SHE FOUND ONE SURPRISING AND IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE.

B004PUG7MG|1.0|Big Avril fan have every CD.  This is her first dud.  She sings about the same thing in every song.  Her voice sounded really cheap raspy and bored on every song.  If she says YEA one more time the CD would go out the window. The only good thing about this CD is looking at her pictures in the booklet.  This CD sounds like she took all the songs that weren't good enough for her other albums and put them on this. Yea, Yea, She is a beautiful women and should devote her time to modeling because if she tours on this CD she won't be able to fill a High School Gym.  She has grown up in looks, but has gone backwards in her talent. I hope Avril clicks on Amazon.com and reads her reviews. Yea, yea,  Please stop saying Yea in every Song.  Yea.

B0048LPRCS|5.0|A first person film shot with eyes blinking and everything. Deffinately something to give a look just for its originality alone. I have seen alot of films, and this one is deffinately top 5. The first person is choreographed perfectly with self reflections in the mirror in some parts, and the actual look and experience of doing Narcotics. You feel like YOU are the one who is smoking the crack!!! Wild movie, the main characters life before and after his death, out of body experiences, a partial abortion viewing, entering someone elses body just so that you can have sex with your sister....................yeah, incredible. Finally get to do all of those taboo things without leaving the comfort of your home. You are not just watching a movie about some guy..............you ARE the guy, and you live HIS life......................oddly amusing.
1584282584|5.0|After deciding to fill in some holes in my skill set (learn flash photography) I started by reading this book.  Got the right speedlight, shot a bunch of pics and then read the book again.  It's a wonder that everyone doesn't use flash the way Neil instructs in this well written book.   With the home made snoot and flash pointed every which way,lots of folks ask me what in the world I'm doing.   When people see the resulting shots, it's \\"how did you DO that?\\"  Seriously.  Start here, or if you've been doing flash a while, read this book and learn how to take your craft to the next level.  Highly recommended.
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|And that is: an attempt to repackage a classic story (in this case near death survival stories) and a classic event (the Oscars) as something the new generation can connect with.  However, while in my opinion the Social Network pulled this off brilliantly (even after hearing all the hype prior to watching it) and was deserving of the praise 127 Hours was a bit of a let down (after the post-James Franco being nominated, the great reviews on here, my friend raving about it, etc...-hype).           Alright now that I made that interesting comparison on to a couple thoughts about the movie itself:    James Franco did good not great as an actor here.  Having not had my hand trapped under a rock for a few days I can't really say how I would act but I was kinda surprised by his response at different points.  In the beginning I was expecting a sheer panic expletive ridden outburst of someone in shock with the claustrophobic doom-filled knowledge that your hand is ummm...how should i put this?  Really f'in stuck.  He seems a little too together.  And indeed that would be my one main critique on his performance...he never really loses it.  More like \\"hey looked at my glazed over eyes and how out of it I am...this is really deep.\\"      The opening music is cool but as we get trapped with James in the crack the musical selection does less to build the ominous tension as it does to become a strangely out of place element...either by trying to be ironic, reminding us that it will all be over soon, and/or that there is something 'cool' about all this.  The end music/scene when he is reunited with people is over the top to me...screaming, \\"We just won the battle!!\\"  Ummm....no.  This story is still part tragedy.  The dude lost an arm among other things.  ...and incorporating that emotionally tragic element into the celebratory ending would have added some needed poignancy.     The flashbacks make me yawn.  Someone mentioned that James should be confessing these flashbacks instead of the film recreating them and I think that could potentially be a better idea.  Instead of pulling me closer to the character and fleshing him out more they seem to 'flesh him out more' and then ask you to emotionally invest more.  I feel like the filmaker's could have taken more of a risk here (potentially resulting in boredom if it were to fail) but instead played it safe.      Anyway, long story short this film isn't bad.  Its decent...and about what I would have expected when I initially saw the previews.      However, if you feel like this review was too focused on the negative and want something positive to take away here you go:    Go watch \\"Touching The Void\\" for what I believe to be a 'harrowing tale of near-death adventure' done right...very, very right in fact.
B004E547D8|1.0|Do not buy this movie.  Putting out a Blu-ray version without an HD audio track, or even Dolby Plus, is just a cheap money grab.
0671027344|4.0|As I began reading Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower I was confused by the format and unsure of the story to follow. I was bothered by the anonymous recipient of Charlie's letter and struggled with the raw and honest voice. But as I continued reading I was quickly absorbed into Charlie's narrative. I became intrigued by his detailed observations of character and honest accounts of the high school experience.    At the start of the novel, Charlie is lonely after the death of his beloved Aunt Helen and the suicide of his closest friend. Through heart-wrenching letters to an unknown classmate, Charlie shares his freshman year. In the first letter Charlie explains, \\"So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.\\" When Charlie befriends two seniors, Patrick and Sam, his life becomes more interesting yet more complex. With these newfound friendships, Charlie experiences love, sex, drugs and parties. As a \\"wallflower\\" by nature, Charlie struggles to become involved in the moment while still maintaining his observations.    I became captivated by Charlie's story, I felt exhilarated in his moments of bliss and a part of his pain when he was depressed. Charlie's letters create a story about being alive in the moment and trying to live these moments to their fullest. Charlie's tendencies as a \\"wallflower\\" led him to a life a submission. He is pressured into drugs, drawn into secrets, and thrown into relationships in which he surrenders control. He is easily manipulated by friends and while he enjoys being the loyal yet silent friend, he never shares his own opinions. With the help from his English teacher and mentor, Charlie begins to transform from a \\"wallflower\\" to a person who \\"participates\\" in life. At the end of the novel, Charlie observes, \\"Maybe it's good to put things in perspective. Sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there.\\"    Charlie's realizations about high school and relationships were eye-opening to me. Charlie has the ability to look around the world and at the people who live in our world and accept their strengths and flaws, whatever they might be. We do not know the happiness or pain another individual experiences and therefore we shall not judge them. Chbosky explores this idea through Charlie's prophetic observation of his own high school experience.  While I often pitied Charlie's lack of involvement in high school activities, I found his observations illuminating towards the high school experience.    Although I enjoyed the book, I don't think that The Perks of Being a Wallflower would be universally enjoyed by all. While I enjoyed the novel for description of high school and raw emotions, I do not think this novel would appeal to people over the age of 25. My ability to relate to many of the situations and share similar experiences made the story more realistic and exciting. Although I struggled with the start of the novel, I became engulfed by the text and was moved by the ending of the story. Charlie's freshman year illuminated so many conflicts and dilemmas of the typical high school experience through a series of heart-wrenching letters.

0763644765|5.0|Ok, so after sabotaging my child's potty training by thinking that I could MAKE him sit on the little potty, my son no longer wants to get within 20 feet of a toilet. Yay for me setting us back 5 yrs! I read that I should start reintroducing the idea of potty training by speaking positively about it, reading him books, and just generally getting him excited about peeing somewhere other than his diaper. I read through reviews of many, many books for kids and decided on 3 of them. Heck, if I thought it would help I'd buy all of them! I got the books in the mail yesterday afternoon...and proceeded to read every one of them to my son last night! Can we say, \\"desperate mommy\\"?!?<br /><br />Fortunately, my son (2.5 yrs old) loves to be read to and was thrilled to have new books. This morning I changed his diaper and put on his cloth training pants (much better, in my opinion, than disposable training pants because they give the feel of underwear, but the protection of disposable diapers!), which he happens to like wearing, and for the next hour and a half I offered the potty to my son several times. Each time he said no, I just said, \\"That's ok! Maybe later!\\". Each time he DID say yes, I immediately got the books out, and he asked for this book, \\"Potty\\", each time. While he sat on his potty, I read the book to him. He did this probably 3 times over the hour and a half and I was surprised that he kept his underwear dry this entire time (and completely shocked that he actually sat on the potty!). Then, he suddenly went over to the potty, and said, \\"go potty!\\". I think he was actually talking to his bear (that I had placed on the potty...another trick I read in a book), but I excitedly asked if he needed to go potty. He actually said yes, so I helped him get his undies off and he sat down and, again, chose the Potty book. We didn't even make it through the first page before he peed! I am so glad we got this book because it has helped to positively introduce potty training back into my kiddo's life.<br /><br />The book is very nice because it has simple words. In the books for children that I have read, the vast majority of them are too wordy, and seem as if they are written for much older children (4 yrs). I would assume that the typical potty-training child is around the age of 2-3, and therefore benefit from easy-to-understand, short sentences or phrases, and clear, engaging pictures. This book has all of that, plus some extra humor in there for children who understand it, and adults who appreciate it.ck into my kiddo's life.<br /><br />The book is very nice because it has simple words.

B000WZB944|5.0|U2 - The Joshua Tree (originally released in 1987)<br /><br />In his liner notes, The Edge wrote that the B-sides, finished a few months after the Joshua Tree was completed, \\"(are) without a doubt the finest U2 work ever not to be included on an album.\\" I was quite gratified to read this as I've felt this way ever since I collected them on vinyl as a teen in the 80s. These tracks alone make the 20th Anniversary JOSHUA TREE album well worth getting. But the whole package, like all of the U2 deluxe editions released so far, is fantastic. It's a wonderful, well-constructed booklet in a sturdy sheath that contains beautiful photographs, excellent liner notes and the lyrics to each song on the original album plus the lyrics to \\"Wave of Sorrow (Birdland).\\"<br /><br />I have to admit that the remaster sounds less than perfect to me - I'm no audiophile but it sounds like it has a bit too much sonic compression - it's very flat sounding. However, The Edge himself was in control of the job. Since he was involved, I trust it came out the way U2 wanted it to. There's something about the sound that doesn't seem quite right to me, but it still sounds acceptable enough and I expect that a good sound system and equalizer could make it sound perfect for the average listener. Still, I am disappointed in the way CDs are remastered these days. I don't see why they can't make a seperate master for downloads and a decent one with plenty of dynamic range for CDs and, of course, vinyl. I guess vinyl is catching on though and CDs are quickly disappearing...<br /><br />I expect that anyone reading this already knows that THE JOSHUA TREE is often considered to be one of the best rock records of all time and a strong candidate for U2's best album ever, so this review will focus on the bonus disk. The first seven tracks were originally released as B-sides in the 80s and the last five tracks are unreleased cuts taken from THE JOSHUA TREE sessions. Coincidentally, this review was posted on the 24th anniversary of the album's original release date...<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Luminous Times (Hold On To Love)\\" - U2 is known for being an incredibly soulful rock band. Bono strives to \\"reveal rather than conceal\\" as he once put it, and this song ranks among their most heartfelt and emotive. The drums are powerful, lurching, and the keyboards, guitars and vocals evoke fiery passion. *****+<br /><br />\\"Walk To The Water\\" - is one of U2's most unusual recordings and a top-three personal favorite of mine. Its sound is strange - kinda murky, kinda trippy. Adam contributes a meandering bass line while Larry pounds out a quasi-trip-hop beat (before trip-hop even existed!). The guitar parts are clean and meticulously picked, at turns contemplative and soaring. Bono's vocals alternate between melodic spoken words and passionate pleading. *****+<br /><br />\\"Spanish Eyes\\" - a strident rocker, very cool. It's not really one of their best written or most compelling songs, although all the band members turn in solid performances. All the classic U2 elements are in place and Edge's ringing guitar sounds great. Bono's vocals are a little out of control, but he sounds pretty cool regardless. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Deep In The Heart\\" - This is a mysterious sounding track, similar in mood to \\"Walk To The Water.\\" It's loaded with echo, very spacey and atmospheric. The rhythm is solid, yet it has this sort of open-ended quality. Another personal favorite. *****+<br /><br />\\"Silver And Gold\\" - one of U2's hardest rockin, straight-up rock n' roll tracks ever! It's much better than the original version created for the SUN CITY album (see below). Edge's staggered, heavily reverbed guitars are so cutting. *****+<br /><br />\\"Sweetest Thing\\" - really is a sweet song, a sweet love song. It gently rocks and swings along to a simple repeating keyboard riff. Bono wrote this song for his wife as an apology for having to work in the studio on her birthday. There's a re-recorded version out there, adorned with prettier instrumentaton and background vocals, but this is the original. ****<br /><br />\\"Race Against Time\\" - is a driving, vaguely Middle Eastern-sounding track, way off the beaten path. It reminds me of Pink Floyd's \\"On The Run\\" from THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON with its scattered feel and runaway train pace, despite the fact that it sounds completely different from that track. Adam Clayton is a good melodic bass player although he's hardly a virtuoso, so I've always suspected his bass part was speeded up on this one. It's mostly an instrumental track but Bono does add some chanting and he sings the words in the title. ****<br /><br />\\"Where The Streets Have No Name (Single Edit)\\" - The opening track on THE JOSHUA TREE, this is without a doubt one of U2's greatest songs - so great in fact that I imagine most people have little use for this truncated version. **** (album version - *****+)<br /><br />\\"Silver And Gold (Sun City)\\" - first appeared on the 1985 SUN CITY album which was created by several artists as a protest against apartheid in South Africa. \\"Silver and Gold\\" was written by Bono during those sessions and features additional guitar by Keith Richards and Ron Wood of The Rolling Stones. This is supposedly Bono's first attempt to write a blues song. It was recorded right after it was written, and to be honest, it shows. Bono hasn't yet found the groove of the song and the Stones' guitars, while cool, just sound kinda tacked on. The U2 rock version is far superior. **3/4<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Ghost/ Introduction To Songs Of Experience\\" - a failed experiment in which the band tries to put some poetry by William Blake (18th century poet and artist) to music. It's a valiant attempt, with subtle and moody atmospherics created with a few elongated Eno-esque tones. Bono picks out a melody for the words that seems fitting, but his vocals sound rather awkward and somehow just don't flow very well. **1/2<br /><br />\\"Wave Of Sorrow (Birdland)\\" - is a compelling song with a classic U2 keyboard sound. It was completed 20 years after the music was first laid down when Bono contributed new vocals and lyrics. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Desert Of Our Love\\" - a great song with a very cool, kinda funky beat (or U2's approximation of funk at least!) - great drums and piano chords and an acrobatic vocal from Bono. Although it was well recorded, it definitely sounds like a demo - but a very enjoyable one! ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Rise Up\\" - has a jaunty, slightly country feel, very optimistic with touches of banjo here and there. The spirit is willing, but the song itself is less than compelling. ***<br /><br />\\"Drunk Chicken/ America\\" - another strange experiment - this time Bono recites a segment from Allen Ginsberg's beat poem \\"America.\\" The track is only a minute and a half long and has sort of a strange mechanical sound. Larry's drums are arty and very cool sounding. On the first few listens, Bono's vocal sounded really awkward to me, but it sounds kinda cool now that I've gotten used to it. I do find the piece kind of intriguing. It's interesting, but ultimately just a footnote in U2's huge canon of incredible songs. ***1/4s is the original. ****     \\"Race Against Time\\" - is a driving, vaguely Middle Eastern-sounding track, way off the beaten path. It reminds me of Pink Floyd's \\"On The Run\\" from THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON with its scattered feel and runaway train pace, despite the fact that it sounds completely different from that track. Adam Clayton is a good melodic bass player although he's hardly a virtuoso, so I've always suspected his bass part was speeded up on this one. It's mostly an instrumental track but Bono does add some chanting and he sings the words in the title. ****     \\"Where The Streets Have No Name (Single Edit)\\" - The opening track on THE JOSHUA TREE, this is without a doubt one of U2's greatest songs - so great in fact that I imagine most people have little use for this truncated version. **** (album version - *****+)     \\"Silver And Gold (Sun City)\\" - first appeared on the 1985 SUN CITY album which was created by several artists as a protest against apartheid in South Africa. \\"Silver and Gold\\" was written by Bono during those sessions and features additional guitar by Keith Richards and Ron Wood of The Rolling Stones. This is supposedly Bono's first attempt to write a blues song. It was recorded right after it was written, and to be honest, it shows. Bono hasn't yet found the groove of the song and the Stones' guitars, while cool, just sound kinda tacked on.

0316077054|3.0|Beautiful Creatures was wonderful.  This sequel adds a back story and depth to the all the characters from Beautiful Creatures which made me reread that with appreciation.    Two cons:  gets into harry potter/lord of the rings territory with way too much time spent on deciding which way to go on the trek to Barbados from Gatlin (walking by the way).  Hated the additional character of a Keeper in Training who was not only arrogant but attractive to Ethan.  Big chinks in the credibility of the great love bond that keeps Lena and Ethen together.  Makes it seem like he would fall for any girl other than those in his high school.      Hope the 3rd lets the couple be and focuses on other interesting characters and the supernatural realm.
0756404738|5.0|I thought it was a great book two, solidly progressing the plot, and as always beautifully written.  Everything moves along but there are still lots of subtleties woven into the writing that are just wonderful.  I went to the SF reading/signing and one of the questions was if the author thought he would be able to wrap everything up in book three - which he claimed would absolutely happen (unlike a number of other world building fantasy authors I could mention.)

B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|Without a doubt \\"Still Live\\" (talking) is one of Pat Metheny's really greatest albums/CD. Pat along with his group at the time, including his gifted piano player Lyle Mays just knocks this one right out of the ballpark.  The incredible melodic, rhythmic, complexity of this musical collaboration is nothing short of life-giving reinforcing stimulus. Pat, and Lyle's playing on guitar, and piano are one of the great collaborations of present day music, similar to the best recordings of Keith Jarrett their music spirals to incredible heights. This is one of those \\"must have\\" recordings that belong in your Jazz collection. Buy it, listen to it in your home, tap the table, dance, and chant with it,  but just don't get too carried away when driving, as 95 MPH is illegal in most parts of the country.
B003SAF76Q|5.0|After looking into the album for quite some time, I managed to get my hands on it after several months. I shut the door, threw it into WinAmp, wielded the headphones, and let it roll through all forty-five minutes as I painted. At times, I literally stopped working and head-banged in the privacy of my own room. The heavy drums, the extremely rough yet soothing guitars and the almost skin-scraping sound of the screams above them got me drunk with excitement.    About lyrics: they are brutal, pessimistic, and yet has some gentle touch with out-of-the-box thoughts.    An absolute fantastic addition to any metal collection. Highlight sons of my liking are \\"Alone\\", \\"Home is for the Heartless\\", \\"Sleepwalker\\", and especially \\"Leviathon I\\".

0812973992|4.0|Let the Great World Spin, by Colum McCann, was one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in recent memory.  This quick-paced book, that chronicles the lives of twelve distinct and unique characters, is perfect for all ages and for people from all walks of life, because the author explores extremely different types of people and their distinct relationships with 1970's New York.   Stylistically, McCann utilizes a different narrator for each chapter.  At first, I found this to be confusing and altogether unpleasant, but as the book progressed I found that it complemented and added to the themes of the story.  Irish immigrants, New York City hookers, mourning upper-class mothers, judges and hackers seem to have nothing in common, yet McCann has the ability to link them together, create similarities and provide opportunities to understand the nuances of life in NYC.  We understand how each individual and each class come together to contribute to society.  The link among all people in the story is Philippe Petit's 1974 tight rope walk across the twin towers.  McCann proves that seemingly polar and opposite people have similarities.  Shared experiences help bind people and bring them together.  It was extremely interesting to see how this one event could be witnessed and experienced by such a unique group of people and from such varying perspectives.  Petit's tremendous feat, walking from one twin tower to the other on a wire provides an opportunity for the characters to learn and reflect on themselves.  Additionally, it provides hope and a feeling that anything can be accomplished, even in the bleak and seemingly hopeless lives of our protagonists.   I also really enjoyed McCann's ability to develop setting and introduce characters.  No matter the type of place or the traits of a character, McCann vividly and aptly depicts the scene.  Most notably, at least for me, is his introduction of the lowly tenement district of New York.  For the characters that live in the projects, nothing is easy.  McCann's depiction of the setting truly sets us up for the feeling of hopelessness and despair of the projects, \\"On one side was a row of high-rise tenements behind a chain-link fence.  Parts of the fence were topped with razor wire.  On the other, the expressway: the light-streak of cars zipping above.  Below, by the underpass, a long line of women.  Cars and trucks were pulling into the shadows.  The women struck poses.\\" (24)  McCann's description is clear, concise, and easily understood.  Even for someone who has never visited NYC, the scene can easily be visualized and understood.  His juxtaposition of what is seen  (the highway) and what is hidden (the prostitutes) is interesting and well-thought out.   A final trait of McCann's writing that stood out to me was his ability to play with and take on any voice necessary.  The narrative voice could be an Irish `monk', a hooker or an ordinary woman, \\"The days I recall finest were about as ordinary as they come--playing hopscotch on the slab of broken concrete, following my brothers through the cornfields, trailing my schoolbag through the dust.  My older brothers and I read a lot of books back then--a bookmobile came around our street once every few months, staying fifteen minutes.\\" (285)  This writing is just so beautiful--simple, yet descriptive.  Voice is the device that McCann explores most frequently.  He expertly changes his voice and tone as he changes character.   All in all, I give this book a resounding A+.  Everything about the writing, plot and style made me fall in love with the story and its characters.  I couldn't put it down.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|Maybe it got better after the first third of the book. I'll never know. I hardly ever put down a book once I've started it, but I couldn't imagine slogging through ten more books of this. The characters were flat, the environment under-described, and I found that I didn't care. I felt like I was reading through someone's notes from a D&D campaign.
0061726826|3.0|(I'm reviewing the ARC of this book).    Delirium is the sophomore effort by Lauren Oliver who shot to recognition with Before I Fall. It is set in a dystopian America after the \\"disease\\" of love (or any passionate emotion) has been largely eradicated by brainwashing, social control, medication, and surgery in order to maintain a calm, ordered society. Youngsters look forward to their 18th birthday when they can undergo the \\"cure\\" so they'll never be afflicted by unruly passions. Government patrols and cultural values do a good job of keeping them \\"safe\\" until they can have their blessed lobotomies, and any \\"infected\\" are soon dealt with, but our main character, Lena, is not the typical girl of her time.     Lena is an orphan whose mother was incurable and became infected; Lena has been raised with that stigma by her aunt and uncle and longingly awaits her cure. However, a series of events begins to alert her that all is not right and people are not well under this system. Lena meets a mysterious young man, Alex, who inspires her to think for herself and act in unprogrammed ways. He also convinces her to search out the truth concerning her mother.     The book's premise is compelling and the main characters are quite sympathetic, particularly Alex. There aren't any twists I didn't see coming but there is action, intrigue and plenty of turmoil. I enjoyed the story and was touched by the ending even if it didn't surprise me. I did feel the writing tended to bog down in description that interrupted the action, at times clumsily, but it was still a page-turner. I definitely plan to read the next book in the series.

Well worth the low price.

When I tried to return it, it said that I couldn't return it so I was pissed a lot more. So I live chatted with an amazon person and he told me I would get my money back and I would also get to keep the second vinyl free of charge! Therefore, not only is this vinyl awesome but also amazon!

B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|Very easy to review this one, as it flows right along with the career of Kanye.  Musically, its ridiculous; absolutely out of this world.  Great concepts, hot beats, awesome production, excellent job of sampling, good cast of characters to help out and contribute to the album.  Lyrically, well, if Common and Mos De arent gonna ghost write for Kanye, SOMEONE needs too!  Lyrically, Kanye is just not going to reach your core hip hop audience, which even speaks to your mature, adult audiences.  A catch phrase here and there that may make you laugh, but very little, if anything, to make you THINK.<br /><br />At the same time, Kanye is a POP star that RAPS over HIP HOP music.  Im sure every KANYE (is he ever going to go back to calling himself KANE West?) fan that grew up on his commercial pop music will give this 5 stars, yet those that are fans of HIP HOP and MUSIC that doesnt sound robotic, generic, and computer generated will give it considerably less stars and pay less attention to this.<br /><br />I do, and always have, appreciated kanye's determination to pull other genres into hip hop, but Trent Reznor puts together a much better album time and time again that appeals to more than just his crowd.  Perhaps Kanye should listen to more NIN for inspiration<br /><br />Now, had Kanye stayed behind the boards and just let Jay and Rza and Raekwon hold this one down, this could be a hip hop classic.

0671027344|5.0|A tale of one boy's coming of age, the perks of being a wallflower is honest and graced with a clean, direct writing style. It is about, Charlie, and his quest into manhood.  It chronicles the ups and downs of being a overly smart boy in the middle of a whirlpool of stereotypical high school drama.  It clearly outlines who Charlie is, supports his personality by showing the interaction between him and his family, and between Charlie and his friends.  It layers the importance of bonding and the relevance of \\"driving at night to your first real party as it begins to rain\\".  I read this book when I was a Junior in high school, this was quite a while ago and still, it's the social undertones of the story are as pertinent today as they were when the book was released.  So I feel that this book offers a close look into the psyche of that one, awkwardly brilliant kid we all may have know or may have been in those important, formative years.  It is all at once fairly easy for most to relate too on one level or another and is an extremely liberating read.
B000SO7INU|5.0|This is one of the few albums that I keep coming back to over the years. It's no secret that the darker tone makes it stand out when compared to albums from the Phil years. Ray Wilson's voice is perfect and the songs don't get in a hurry. Highly recommended. Too bad the band was so rude to Ray and Genesis ended. This album could have been the start of a new and even better band.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|Patrick may be gone, but this movie continues to live on even after 20 years! Picture is clear and crisp, and special features are good. A must for anyones DVD collection!
B0034G4OVS|1.0|Too bad it was marketed as a \\"HORROR\\" film.  That is my first problem with this movie.  At no time is it even close to being scary or horrific in any way.<br /><br />***SPOLIER ALERT***<br /><br />Let me start by saying that this is by far one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  If you like movies about unlikable characters making ridiculous and improbable choices, with a few scenes of forced frights, poor effects, and cheap gore, then this is the movie for you!<br /><br />First off, we meet our 3 main characters.  There are 2 douchebag guys and one idiot blonde girl who at no time reveal any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Believe me, by the end of this movie you will be screaming at your tv \\"Oh for crying out loud!  Die already!\\"  There are several \\"talky\\" scenes thrown in as attempts to get the audience to relate to the characters, but to no avail.<br /><br />Secondly, I honestly can't remember the last time I laughed at a movie that wasn't supposed to be funny but was so bad I couldn't help myself.  Case in point, there is a scene where, after being stranded on the chair lift for several hours, the best idea these yahoos can come up with is for one of them to jump to the ground, and this is AFTER the guy in the snowplow has already come and gone.  At least if he would've jumped when the snowplow was there they would have been saved.  Sure he might've suffered the same broken legs, but at least after being treated at the ER he could've joined his friends for a drink by the fire!  Anyway, I digress...so the guy is lying on the ground, legs all busted up, and yet I found myself laughing out loud at how ridiculous it looked, not to mention how unrealistic it was.  Shouldn't have shock set in at some point??  And as if that wasn't bad enough, WOLVES show up!  And not just any wolves, but HUNGRY wolves...wolves who feed on human flesh!  Perhaps if there was one or two skinny, malnourished wolves who were obviously starving to death, this idea might have been easier to swallow.  But such is not the case...these are an entire pack of what appear to be perfectly healthy wolves.  At this point, I slapped my forehead.  Really?  When I find myself and those around me are laughing at a guy getting eaten by wolves, I know there is something really wrong with the movie.<br /><br />Third, and I'll make this my last, I promise...these people are stranded on a ski lift for days, and we are to believe that they are in some sort of sub-freezing temps??  Maybe it's because I grew up in the upper Midwestern US, and have experienced real cold, but I found it very hard to believe because, even though they kept pointing out that they both indeed had frostbite on their faces, how did these people not think that maybe zipping up their coats completely and wearing their hoods might help them keep warm?  How about curling up with your legs closer to your body?  Or snuggling together for the body heat??  Not once did I ever feel like these people were cold, let alone freezing!  And it isn't that they chose not to do what they could to stay warm but that their survival instincts never kicked in to try and keep them from freezing to death??  And the part with the girl's hand freezing to the metal bar? Are you serious?!  Her hand is exposed to the cold all night and the only injury she sustains is her hand sticking to the metal a la the kid's tongue in A Christmas Story?!  C'mon!  These people never even shiver!<br /><br />I agree that the acting was sub-par, but I often feel if the story is well-written, poor acting can sometimes be forgiven, especially in a \\"Horror\\" film.  But this was just a terribly written script.  I felt that my intelligence was completely insulted after sitting through the entirety of this movie.  Am I really supposed to feel for these people or believe any of what I am seeing?!  I literally came up with at least 5 simple solutions to their predicament in the first 5 minutes of them being \\"stuck\\"!  I could even forgive the unlikely scenario that they are stranded without a cell phone in this day and age, but the numerous other plot holes were so gaping it was frustrating to watch.  I was exhausted by how angry I got by the end of this.  All the laughing certainly wore me out also.<br /><br />This is worse than B movie stuff because it tries to be smart and stylish and it is really just one big joke from start to finish.  So watch if you must, but don't pay too much...luckily for me I watched it after a friend rented it, so all I really lost was an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back...without a cell phone in this day and age, but the numerous other plot holes were so gaping it was frustrating to watch.

0756404738|5.0|What a fantastic book! Solid, character driven and believable. Patrick Rothfuss spent an incredible amount of time refining these books and for good reason. It seems as if every sentence, every passage and every plot is not only well thought out, but belong. I look forward to the third book.
B0001RVTXO|3.0|I hate to be that guy who reviews a greatest hits album by his favorite band and puts it down for being an incomplete waste, but since no one else seemed to want to do it, I suppose the task was left on me. I know you've probably heard this a thousand times but, with a few exceptions, greatest hits albums are a poor choice for an introduction to a band, especially a great band like the Pixies. The reason I say this is simple - this band is so good you'll almost certainly want to buy all of their albums eventually anyway. (They only have four, not counting \\"Come On Pilgrim.\\") For just as cheap, you could get their greatest, most accessible album, \\"Doolittle.\\" If you don't like that album, you don't like the Pixies. It's as simple as that. From there, you could easily just go ahead and buy \\"Surfer Rosa,\\" \\"Bossanova,\\" and \\"Trompe le Monde\\" and pretty quickly have all the Pixies' albums. All of them are absolutely essential and include several tracks not present here that are as good or better than the tracks that are included on this compilation album. I'm just trying to save you a few bucks, as it's inexcusable to have just a greatest hits album for this band anyway, and for not much more money you could get the complete discography. The one and only reason this collection was released was for the record company to capitalize on the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. At least \\"Death to the Pixies\\" had the bonus live disc. There's no new or unreleased material on this thing at all, rendering this collection completely pointless for both hardcore fans and newcomers.    Proper albums the tracks included on this compilation can be found on:  \\"Come On Pilgrim (EP)\\" (1987) - \\"Nimrod's Son,\\" \\"The Holiday Song,\\" \\"Caribou\\"  \\"Surfer Rosa\\" (1988) - \\"Bone Machine,\\" \\"Broken Face,\\" \\"Gigantic (album version),\\" \\"Vamos,\\" \\"Where Is My Mind?\\"  \\"Doolittle\\" (1989) - \\"Hey,\\" \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven,\\" \\"Debaser,\\" \\"Gouge Away,\\" \\"Wave of Mutilation,\\" \\"Here Comes Your Man\\"  \\"Bossanova\\" (1990) - \\"Velouria,\\" \\"Allison,\\" \\"Dig for Fire\\"  \\"Trompe le Monde\\" (1991) - \\"U-Mass,\\" \\"Alec Eiffel,\\" \\"Planet of Sound\\"  \\"Death to the Pixies (Compilation/Live Album)\\" (1997) - \\"Gigantic (single version)\\"  \\"Complete B-Sides (Compilation)\\" (2001) - \\"Into the White,\\" \\"Winterlong\\"    If you have all of the albums listed above, as well as \\"Pixies at the BBC\\" and the 2002 self-titled EP simply called \\"Pixies\\" that collected the other nine songs from the \\"Come On Pilgrim\\" sessions that were originally recorded for, along with the \\"Pilgrim\\" tracks, a demo called \\"The Purple Tape,\\" then you will have a more or less complete Pixies collection. This so-called \\"best of\\" album is completely inessential. Skip over this one, no matter your level of fanaticism.

B00338QENI|5.0|I learned of this book by way of my university's alumni magazine and was fascinated by the topic.  Reading it was both exciting and unnerving.  Couldn't put it down but was saddened at the ultimate results for the various members of the Lacks family.  I'm inspired by Rebecca Skloot's undying persistence to discover and tell this story.  I think every college student should read this and discuss it in an ethics class.  It might make a few more people think about the impact of their decisions (or lack of) before they act.

It did the same thing that those books did to me where I couldn't go to sleep, I had to keep on reading to find out more.  Great character development and creative plot will keep you interested while the suspense of the story will keep you flipping the pages.

B002NZK5VY|1.0|An obnoxiously bad movie containing just about every PC cliche imaginable. Not funny, except in a \\"how can a movie be this bad\\" sort of way. No romantic chemistry. Terrible in every way.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|I'm going to strangle someone.  I looked for a recent release of this movie to buy before I went to go see the new film in the movie theaters.  It has been over a decade since this was last released so the prices were sky high for used copies.  I finally gave up trying to get one and took my kids to go see the new Tron movie.  How a company like Disney came to make the decision to release this after the new Tron movie was in theaters is beyond me.    I will definately buy this to show my kids when it comes out so the new Tron movie will make more sense.  The original Tron movie was way ahead of its time with an interesting plot line and cool special effects that were ahead of its time.  Of course the special effects will look dated by today's standards but back in the day the movie inspired many other shows.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So, the DVD is harder even on level one than i remember it being, but i know it provides an excellent and accurate workout. Don't buy this DVD if you don't want people on your case when your working out. Jillian talks troughout the video to motivate you, and can be tough some times. Overall its a great DVD and if you have the motivation to complete a twenty minute workout then i say go for it, just keep in mind it's a little harder then expected, but you WILL see results if you start and finish the 30 day shred.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|I got this for my fiance who is a huge Gizmo fan. He loves it. The cute little head movements and humming is great. I wouldn't give it to kids to play with more of display only type toy. Gizmo also looked a little flat or smooshed to me but other than that it was great. I guess the only other \\"con\\" was he loved the gift so much I had to listen to the song over and over and it gets stuck in your head- a sign of a good gift.
0812973992|4.0|This novel by Colum McCann exemplifies the true spirit of New York City. It is a well-written and brilliant portrait of New York. As McCann travels through various personalities, he manages to tie them together by seemingly mundane actions. The raw emotions of New Yorkers, from a Park Avenue judge to prostitutes in the Bronx, capture the true chaotic essence of the city. Through his use of multiple characters, settings, and narration styles, McCann unveils different aspects of New York in every chapter. Each story and perspective happens in what feels like an eerie parallel universe with intertwining events which hold the stories together at the edges. \\"It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing is as strange as the last, and connected\\" (pg. 306). McCann successfully shows me a complex and intimately connected New York City landscape.  I appreciate McCann's efforts to apply a \\"six degrees of separation\\" aspect to his novel, yet it is occasionally overbearing. At the core of the novel, a tightrope walker walks between the World Trade Center towers and he inevitably affects each person in the world below him. Judge Soloman, who tries the walker in court, doesn't think about the act in the same manner as his wife Claire, or as the walker himself does. To Soloman, the verdict regarding the tightrope walker is a huge deal. His appreciation for the walker doesn't end at the successful court day it handed to him; he also acknowledges the art that the tightrope walker managed to present. \\"He had made himself into a statue, but a perfect New York one, a temporary one, up in the air, high above the city. A statue that had no regard for the past.... So brash. So glassy. So forward-looking\\" (pg. 248). However, to an isolated couple who live in a cabin, a fleeting newspaper article is the most they see of the act.  Although the various perspectives make the novel stronger, some snippets ofseemingly meaningless stories are included as well. Hackers from California, who \\"view\\" the tightrope walker through calls to pay phones in New York, merely shows the chaos of the city without their actually being there. I didn't fully grasp why that story is strewn into the mix, and it took a little while to fully recognize the voice of that particular chapter. Occasionally, it took a few pages of each new chapter to identify the narrator and the storyline behind voice, which in turn led to me missing some of the key thoughts--I ended up skimming certain details which I didn't know were crucial until I uncovered this voice of the chapter. This, however, also made me reread parts of chapters, which aided my overall comprehension and appreciation of the novel.   Another aspect of this novel that I didn't like included the fact that I resonated with some of the storylines more than others. The novel discusses two brothers' childhoods in Ireland, a monk Corrigan and his more sensible brother Ciaran, and McCann practically \\"raises\\" them throughout the beginning of the novel. The brothers end up in the Bronx and we travel through their lives alongside them. I felt as I had more desire to read and understand Corrigan and Ciaran than other characters because McCann discusses both their childhood and adulthood, and also because Ciaran contributes to a significant amount of narration--something that the other characters are missing. However, this storyline fades as the novel continues, which I disliked.   This novel's depth is truly outstanding. It incorporates a multitude of views on New York, from the Twins Towers representing \\"...the sky, the night, the colors: progress, beauty, capitalism\\" (pg. 248) to the evils of the city, where \\"Hooking was born in [Tillie]. That's no exaggeration\\" (pg. 199). Although the connections among portraits are sometimes obscure and only apparent to the reader, I believe that McCann successfully reveals demographic diversity at its best, andat its worst.
B004M6BQ9W|5.0|Movie was amazing... and I LOVED the choreography. It's an old-school burlesque movie brought current. I would definitely recommend it if you're staying home for the evening. Worth the watch!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is another one of those well-acted, beautifully produced BBC series on English life in the late 19th century.  If you liked Cranford, you will love this series.  Some of the same people are in it and each episode is almost a complete story with a thread running through the series.
0312370849|4.0|I enjoyed the story, especially learning something about the horrors of the Paris roundup of the Jewish people which I didn't know that much about.  I would recommend this book.
1563899426|5.0|This is my first entry into the comic book/graphic novel world. I wanted something that wasn't too \\"dark\\". This book clearly serves that purpose. I really enjoyed, often laughing, reading this first in the series of graphic novels. The connection to memories from my past coupled with modern day language and situations made this an easy read. I can't get enough of the series.
1416550550|5.0|this was a wonderful read which kept me up late nights reading.  I would recommend this book to many of my friends and family - female, not male, I don't think this is a book men would enjoy.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|As someone who's been listening to the Beatles for over four decades, it was fun to hear these songs overlap in interesting new ways.  The 5.1 surround was a blast.  I wish more titles were available in DVD Audio. The fidelity is exciting.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|You would think you would eventually get bored working through the various parts of the story for each of the 6 endings, but it's addicting until the end...when you're wishing it weren't over.  Make sure to take notes as you go on everything, espcially on the door combinations, because the various endings are unlocked by trying different door combinations.<br /><br />Tip: the game will tell you, once you finish one ending, that you can click hold the left direction key to skip faster during all the text/talking.  I found that if you HOLD BOTH left buttons it fastforwards smoothly and much faster...you won't have to keep clicking to progress the text.

B00005K3OT|2.0|Don't get me wrong, this movie is inspirational, uplifting, visually enticing, and utterly appropriate for a feel good movie. It is also simplistic, predictable, stereotyping, and contains one dimensional characters.<br /><br />First of all, the main character Vianne, is totally unrealistic. She travels from village to village and sets up a chocolate shop each time. How and where does she get the ingredients, not to mention, the ability to lug all her equipment is not explained. Throughout the movie, she constantly gives truffles and hot chocolates to the villagers in order to win their favor. Of course people want to be your friend if you give them free chocolate, but that is not a very sustainable way of running a business. And in a town where people have a moral bias against eating chocolate, it seems like you wouldn't have that much wiggle room to be buying pearl necklaces from gypsies, wearing nice clothes all the time, and serving four course meals to half the village for a friend's birthday. Realistically her part could only have been fulfilled by a rich woman selling chocolates as a hobby instead of an independent entrepreneur.<br /><br />I was also disturbed by the essentialization of Mayan culture in the movie. The story of the movie is that of injecting primitive, passionate, spicy, sexual, natural pre-Columbian culture (by way of chocolate) into sensually deprived Christian European culture. This is hardly the truth about either culture and in a movie about tolerance and overcoming stereotypes, the movie's portrayal of these cultures reinforces conventional stereotypes. Even in the most conservative christian societies, countercultures of promiscuity, drunkenness, revelry, and alternative spirituality flourished and were often an accepted part of daily life. Western cultures for centuries have exoticized Asian, African, native American and pre-columbian peoples as noble savages that live in an Edenic state. The movie merely reinforces these traditional stereotypes.<br /><br />My  third criticism of this movie is its simplistic message that indulging the senses solves Christian society's ills. If only people ate more chocolate then they would all be friends, have great sex, and become tolerant of outsiders. Especially in an age of rampant materialism and over stimulation of the senses, this is too simple a message for our times. Today, sugar is easy to come by. Over consumption of rich foods have led to obesity, short attention spans, and every kind of health problem out there. Young people  especially are motivated by sex, instant gratification, and stimulation of the senses as a way of filling the vacuum left by the absence of religion or spiritual meaning in their lives. A century ago, a dose of sensual gratification may have been remedy for our uptight grandparents, but today we see what a lives devoted to the fulfillment of instant sensual indulgence does for individual health, societies and the environment. At least an acknowledgment of this dichotomy would have made this film more than what it is, a simplistic, corn syrupy feel good movie that reinforces our preconceptions.My  third criticism of this movie is its simplistic message that indulging the senses solves Christian society's ills.

159420229X|5.0|The brain makes up just 2% of a human's mass, yet consumes 20% of the oxygen and 25% of the glucose we use. Unfortunately, researchers at UCLA have concluded that we use only 20% of its memory capability (Scientific American, 4/19/2007). On average, people reportedly waste 40 days/year compensating for things they've forgotten. In \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\" author Joshua Foer went from being one of those forgetful folks to champion at the U.S. Memory Championship after a year of memory training. His book summarizes the latest research, as well as several ancient techniques (eg. 'the method of loci' - aka 'memory palace,' dating back to 477 B.C.) to memorize speeches and even entire books. Much of the book is taken up with Foer's training.<br /><br />Foer begins telling readers that when Gutenberg turned books into mass-produced commodities, it became less important to remember what the printed page could. (Book indexes further reduced the need for memory.) Memory training until then was considered a centerpiece of classical education, along with grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Fortunately, during the last decades of the 20th century, these techniques have been resurrected, mainly by memory contest competitors (introduced to the U.S. in 1997) and those hoping to make money training others. The 'good news' is that becoming a memory master is not a matter of inheriting superior genes - per Foer, there is only one case described of 'photographic memory' described in the scientific literature. (\\"Rain Man\\" Kim Peek, the savant who could recite all of Shakespeare's works, etc., had an IQ of only 87.) The 'bad news' is that it takes hard work and creativity.<br /><br />Research in the mid-50s established that most can only think about roughly seven items (plus/minus two) at a time. Fortunately, 'chunking' is a way to decrease the number of items to remember by increasing their size, and provides the logic behind phone, credit-card, and Social Security number structures.<br /><br />A second useful research hint comes from examples of those with naturally superior memories. They're likely to have 'synesthesia' - sounds (including word pronunciation) to them are accompanied by color, texture, even taste. Thus, every word conjures up an image. Numbers may have their own personalities - '1' = a strong man, '2' = a slim woman, '8' = a very stout woman, etc. For synesthiacs, simple stories may become impossible to understand because the image-making bogs down their minds. Regardless, for them learning facts, etc. in sequence involves eg. imagining a walk down a known street while associating activities, etc. with various locations en route. Alternatively, a mental walk through familiar buildings, or train-ride station stops can be used - as long as there's some semblance of order linking one locus to the next.<br /><br />Researchers have also found that our brains remember visual imagery much better than other forms. Thus, it easier for us to remember 'baker' (occupation) than 'Baker' (name) because the occupation brings up images of what a baker does and looks like. Thus, the secret to remembering names, for example, is to turn Bakers into bakers, Foers into fours, Reagans into ray guns, etc. Generalizing this approach is key to strengthening memory, part of the method Cicero is said to have used, was independently developed by Australian aborigines and Southwest Indian Apaches, and is used by all top memorizers today to one degree or another.<br /><br />Continuing, Foer points out that the more associative hooks a new piece of information has (eg. smell, taste), the more securely it gets embedded into one's long-term memory - especially if one \\"revisits the memory palace later in the day, again the next, and the following week.\\" (Example: Imagine the first item on a grocery list one wants to memorize is bread, then eggs. In your mental walk from your bedroom to your kitchen mentally place a loaf of bread on your bed, eggs on your dresser, etc.) Also, the funnier, lewder, and more bizarre the hooks used, the better - eg. an image of Claudia Schiffer swimming nude in a tub of cottage cheese at one's front door. Expertise in the subject being learned/memorized also helps.<br /><br />Few, if any, use the memory palace approach to memorizing speeches and poems. Poets like Homer relied on repetition and rhythms to recite their work from memory (New York Times, 3/08/11).  Foer also reports that alliteration, dynamic images, songs, cliches, words that rhyme are more easily memorized. Turns out that those memorizing long poems and books don't do it totally verbatim.<br /><br />Those developing their memory quickly hit a performance plateau - Foer reports that setting higher goals and analyzing one's performance problems are essential to further progress. Foer contends that these barriers are more psychological than physical - thus, the sudden flood of milers beating the 4-minute mile barrier after Roger Bannister first did. Improvement requires feedback, and with that feedback eg. surgeons get better over time; interestingly, mammograph readers get much less less, if any, feedback, and their performance may deteriorate over time. To prevent this, memory experts suggest they practice on old cases where the outcome is already known.<br /><br />There are five events in the U.S. Memory Championships that Foer won. One is memorizing 99 names and faces within 15 minutes and recalling them in another 20. Another is memorizing an unpublished 50-line poem in 15 minutes; contestants must also memorize a list of random numbers, random words, and a shuffled deck of cards. The best associate every group of three cards into a sentence - the first card is a person, the second a verb, and the third an object. Similarly, they may remember every six digits as a sentence.<br /><br />Turns out that most memorizers have weaknesses - those good a remembering digits are often bad at names and faces. Poetry memorizers are often bad at cards.<br /><br />Finally, near the end of \\"Moonwalking with Einstein,\\" Foer raises the question \\" Why work to improve memory?\\" The answer - \\"How we perceive the world and act in it are products of what we remember.\\" Foer uses his trip to China as an example - while enjoyable, it would have been much more meaningful if he knew Chinese history.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\" is an interesting and useful read. Unfortunately, written material, lists, cellphone contact lists, computerized reminder systems, and Google are too easy to use as alternatives.

B002ZG98FU|3.0|\\"Morning Glory\\" is predictable but watchable.  The story is about a young female TV producer, Becky Fuller, (Rachel Adams), who loses her job.  She moves in with her parents and frantically searches for another job to get out of a \\"told you so\\" situation.  She finally lands a Morning Show job as Executive Producer, but the show's ratings are in the dumps.  Working with feuding co-hosts (Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton) keeps her hopping and hoping that something will \\"click.\\"  Nothing seems to be working, and the show seems dull and lifeless.  Soon her boss (played by Jeff Goldblum) calls her in to say the show is cancelled.  Becky begs for one more chance... and the rest is history.<br /><br />Overall the movie is entertaining, and you hope Becky, the young TV producer, will succeed.  She has many obstructions to overcome, but, like the Ever Ready Bunny, she keeps trying and trying.  The movie gets funny toward the end and, of course, Becky saves the day.
B000R9EG3Q|1.0|I read this book hoping to gain some perspective on how President Obama came to his ideas about our country, none of which I agree on.    What I found was a constant bashing from the black man on the white man. His mother, a white woman, raised him as best she could and shielded him so well from racism that he did not even know it existed until he had his first black friend in high school--a friend who poisoned his mind with pure hate for white people. Then, as if Obama was mad at his mother for not doing the same, he deserted her after high school and became more associated with more radical, white-person-hate-filled blacks. I don't understand how his mom concludes Barack gets his \\"honesty and good character\\" from his father, who deserted him as a toddler and eventually became a bitter drunk.     I think it is not coincidental that Obama holds such negative beliefs about white people, yet never experienced racism himself and is the President of the United States. If this doesn't prove that black people are offered as much opportunity as whites, I do not know what does.    Anyone who walks away from this book \\"inspired\\" I would quickly have to ask why/how. It is scary to think this kind of talk proliferates in the black community. Black men tearing each other down and constantly blaming their failures on the \\"white man\\" will not progress black men any further. Black men deserting the mothers of their children and not raising their children, in particular their boys, will do nothing to raise that particular segment of the community along. I know plenty of successful black people, and I can rest assured they do not look for racism in the faces of every white person they see, nor blame their problems on the \\"white man.\\"     White people have struggles too--I struggled my whole life and was told many times I would fail, yet I am here and have managed to accomplish most of what I set out to do. I have also experienced racism from blacks yet do not hold it against them. Racism exists within every community and every race. Yet I would have to argue that where I see most racism playing out today is actually within the black community. If \\"certain\\" oppressed black people want to move up in the world, then they should (1) commit and stay with the mother of your child/children and (2) stop blaming others for your mistakes and ignore what you may think to be racism. Constantly tearing each others dreams down and calling each other the \\"n\\" word, while saying the white man will never let you get anywhere does NOTHING for progress.    I opened this book hoping for a deeper understanding of a man I did not understand. I walked away with it more disgusted with racism and perpetual hate within the black community.

Foer contends that these barriers are more psychological than physical - thus, the sudden flood of milers beating the 4-minute mile barrier after Roger Bannister first did. Improvement requires feedback, and with that feedback eg. surgeons get better over time; interestingly, mammograph readers get much less less, if any, feedback, and their performance may deteriorate over time. To prevent this, memory experts suggest they practice on old cases where the outcome is already known.     There are five events in the U.S. Memory Championships. One is memorizing 99 names and faces within 15 minutes and recalling them in another 20. Another is memorizing an unpublished 50-line poem in 15 minutes; contestants must also memorize a list of random numbers, random words, and a shuffled deck of cards. The best associate every group of three cards into a sentence - the first card is a person, the second a verb, and the third an object. Similarly, they may remember every six digits as a sentence.     Turns out that most memorizers have weaknesses - those good a remembering digits are often bad at names and faces. Poetry memorizers are often bad at cards.     Finally, near the end of \\"Moonwalking with Einstein,\\" Foer raises the question \\" Why work to improve memory?\\" The answer - \\"How we perceive the world and act in it are products of what we remember.\\" Foer uses his trip to China as an example - while enjoyable, it would have been much more meaningful if he knew Chinese history.     Bottom-Line: \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\" is an interesting and useful read. Unfortunately, written material, lists, cellphone contact lists, computerized reminder systems, and Google are too easy to use as alternatives. Now I need something that motivates me to use Foer's material - perhaps explaining card-counting strategies. Foer says the best can memorize the sequence of a deck of cards within 21 seconds.
031603438X|5.0|I thought this was a great book (I have the audio version) - reading some of the reviews, it appears people don't really have a clue about what or who they are listening to at any given time. : ) When I first got it, I thought, \\"Geez - 8 million discs; this will be unbelievably tedious!\\" I have discovered, it's not at all. Richards does a bang-up job of remembering so much detail - heck, I can't even remember where I park my car when I go shopping. That's why it's so long - he has incredible recall. And, previously unbeknownst to me, he is interesting, intelligent, and has a great sense of humor about himself and his persona. I am mostly impressed at his own quest for knowledge and how he is really just a guy. Just a guy who loves music and learning about who he is and the world around him. He makes no bones about or excuses for some of the looney things he's done, and he pulls no punches and tells it like it is and matter-of-factly, in regard to himself and others.     I wish more people were as straight up as this guy is, and he realizes that, at the end of the day, we aren't really all that different - it's just some of us get seen much more when we do our jobs.     Admittedly, I was a bit unimpressed when Joe Hurley started narrating - as I'm quite the Johnny Depp fan, and I honestly thought Hurley was faking his British accent some - however, I've since learned that he is, indeed, a Londoner himself, and instead of going out of his way to possibly imitate Richards, he instead gives his recitation a good taste of Richard's developing 60's and 70's persona.     I'm only about halfway through the audiobook yet, and though I kinda sorta liked Keith Richards well enough over the years, and always thought him oddly interesting, not being a huge Stones fan, I didn't think about them too much. However, after listening to this book and understanding more about the guy, I have to say, I very much look forward to hearing the rest of it, and the book's turned me into a true Keith Richards fan. I give him credit for being just who he is, for better or worse, and there, in my opinion, can't be too much wrong with people who are as upfront as he is.
1591843790|5.0|I am an avid reader of uplifting and status quo challenging books,  and this pulls together the very best of those ideas in an easy to read  delivery.  Its a must read for those of us who have always believed that   its not just your IQ that counts, its how you view life and treat people  that adds the most value.  In this way its a bold departure from Guys prior writings  and all I can say is BRAVO!  Buy it, read it, apply it and the world   will be a better place!

B002VWNID6|2.0|As I was watching the movie with my hubby, the DVD first of all did not have a Label which was strange.  I have never encountered that before.  All my previous orders with AMAZON of NEW CD's or NEW DVD's have always been Superb, except for this one.  There was no label on the DVD, and the movie looked old and not crisp at all.  I thought something was different but I put it on anyway and at the middle of the movie after the scene where the obesed priest is kidnapped and taken to Sherwood Forest and Lady is about to see Robin Hood taking a bath in the waterfall, then kaput.  It ends!  What!? Never have I ever experienced this, not even when I have bought used ones.  It was very disappointing.  I am sending it back today in hopes to receive either Full REFUND OR another NEW DVD of the sam movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, with Kein Costner.  I love all his movies. Hopefully this situation will be resolved quickly.  Sincerely,  Irma Anaya

B002ZG9774|2.0|It used to be an unwritten \\"standard\\" that DVDs would allow you to press the \\"menu\\" button to skip all the ads and previews and go directly to the movie's menu.  Not here.  The greedy suits at Sony have front-loaded this disk with two mandatory ads for Sony hardware, followed by four previews for other movies.  These are programmed so the Menu and Search keys are locked out.  And when you fast-forward, they have included a code to cancel the FF as soon as the next ad or preview starts.  Two years from now if I want to enjoy this movie again I will still have to plough through six ads for hardware that is no longer made and movies that have been long forgotten.    Oh, and if your Blu-ray player is internet-connected, there is yet another ad embedded in the main menu, hawking various internet streaming services.  C'mon Sony, enough is enough!    I wanted to give this one star, but the movie is too good for that.  Had the disk not been encumbered by such in-your-face advertising I would have given it five stars.  So I'm knocking off three stars for greed.    Oh, and, BTW, the movie was great.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Have been trying to find a usb to serial adapter that would get recognized by the computer (Windows 7) so it could be connected to the Garmin GPS device and work with Google Earth to plot out the trip and flight routes taken. First tried installing a serial card into the PC tower (it used the same Prolific chipset) but the computer would not assign a COM port to the serial card. Had to return it back to the store and tried to research another solution. Most of the usb-to-serial adapter cables on Amazon rated poorly, except for this one.    Based on the positive reviews, I decided I'd give this adapter cable a try. After receiving the driver CD and cable that comes in a box, follow the installation instructions (the sequence, as indicated) and the computer should assign a COM port number. This adapter was immediately recognized by the computer and it worked with the GPS device to connect onto Google Earth!    Very highly recommended.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I ADORE ADELE. She is the most soulful, honest, real incredible talent out there today. Her sold out world tour is proof enough, but you don't need other people to tell you she's a unique rarity.    I saw Adele in concert in San Francisco on Jan. 29, 2009 at The Harfield. I can remember it like it happened last night.  She's a juxposition of what she presents with and projects at first glance and then she begins to sing and you know, without a doubt, if you too have depth, that this soulful, honest, extrodinary, god given gift of a talent, is exposing herself right before a bunch of strangers. She's letting you in on pain she's felt in her past and opening and projecting with her powerful voice, and all you want to do is plant yourself firmly and keep yourself from being swept away but then you finally give up after five torturous seconds and release all inhibitions and go with the magic of the knowledge that while Adele is singing live in front of you that you are having an incredible musical experience.  I hope it's not a once in a lifetime experience for me, but I know it's difficult to get tickets for her live performances, after she increased some performances in the US, the LA and SF sold out too quickly for me to get tickets.    If you doubt this listen to \\"Someone Like You.\\"  Also, youtube, \\"Fool That I Am\\", dear Lord, that woman has depth.  She feels deep.  She also, will give us more, I'm sure, as she as a person goes through more life experiences. Hopefully she'll be with someone she can be safe with and the world of true love will open for her.  Songs might come about that are so soaring, that we'll benefit.  Right now, as she describes herself as 'heartbroken soul', I want one day for her not to go through heartbreak.  You leave after one of her performances wanting the best for her.  She just lets you in, and be privay, to some of her past emotional pain and it leaves you loving how unpretencious she is. To say, you have a bright future ahead of you Miss Adele, if you want it, is probably an understatement.  Want it she does, she's given up drinking and now tackling stopping smoking, it hurts her though from what I've read, if that's a true quote, (you have to be careful what you read).  She might of seen how she could let her pain sweep her down stream to a dark lake and she is taking control, instead of what could take control of her.  She remind me of a tree, solid in the ground, soaring above most and growing all the time.     I had her CD quite awhile before the concert.  I didn't go to see her actually, I was there to see James Morrison who opened for her.  It was a sold out concert because of everyone there to see Adele not James Morrison, most people I talked to hadn't heard of James Morrison.  I, of course, liked both, but after James sang, the mood of anticipation for Adele in the room was palpable. She came on stage all in black, her hair wrapped loose in the back in a chignon kind of thing and a black wrap around her shoulder with ballet flats.  Her body language was insecure and kind of girlish, she kind of shuffled in a kind of young girl way to the microphone.  It surprised me because my CD of her was not what I expected of her.    Then she started to speak in her British accent, kind of Cockneyish to me.  I loved her accent, and then she introduced her first song,I was instantly smiling, loving her the minute she came out.  The stage was sparse with musicians, she had four violinists with her which I was looking forward to, but other than that just a handful of musicians and her and...ADELE'S VOICE.  She began her first song and the room was completely, all soul encompassing, listening to every beautiful note.  Her sophistication, her magic, her gift had us all captivated.  She could sing really basically anything and it would be good.  It's how she sings it, her depth, delivery, and how she FEELS a song and you feel it right along with her. I liked her before but after her performance I was a devoted fan.     Between her pure talent, her taste, and songwriting skills on top of that, this women could and,I am sure, will have a lifelong career if she wants.  She is that good.  She kind of defies her persona, that voice seeming to come out of nowhere, but just as an artist paints a beautiful piece of art, she delivers divine and it's always with her. I wanted to ask her, \\"Do you really realize how good you are?\\"  I think she knows but what she gives to her audience, you are amazed that voice comes out of her, her youth, that much sophistication.  I felt like Etta James was embodied in her, with a intuition of soul and jazz amd it's her beauty of face and smile. I left wishing the best for her in her life.  Also, wondering what would I give to have the gift that she has, to be able to express the depth of my soul through a kind of caliber of talent she possesses.    Today in my car I had track three, 'Turning Tables' on repeat, it's so good, it hurts.  'Rolling in the Deep', is burns, it's so good.  One day she won't be a woman scorned.  \\"He Won't Go', eludes to that.  \\"Take it All\\", breaks my heart.  I so relate to it.  Thanks Adele.  As Adele grows and doesn't need validation from males, and as she let's it sink in how much she is validated, her fans can't, because she knows that do not know her, so all of the validation won't do it through her music, I believe it will be, her risking, to let herself be even more vunerable and let break all walls down, no more stormy relationships, no more trying to find comfort from the wrong places, we'll all wish or her, the greatness ahead for her.    Meanwhile, I will always love Adele, be devoted, loyal and always buy her music.  Her uniqueness, that beautiful, beautiful porceline skin, that is so more than one would realize, that dimple in her chin, those large, expressive green, sparkling gems of eyes she has that give you a glimpse of her depth, and that manner of hers, when she puts in nail between her teeth, a gesture, I love that she does, her laugh, her taste, her gutsy, ballsy confidence that she projects that could be what she projects to protect her all of it, makes me love her more.  There is not one singer in the world today, that I could think is anyone close to what I feel for how I love and relate to Adele.  Gaga's little monsters, meanwhile as they are all caught in all the hype, we have her purity, all she needs is her voice and all that depth she has.  I love when she said in her ballyness 'I don't rely on my tits to make hits.\\"  Love you Adele!      Adele's latest, with her great taste and talent,is the reason we buy music.  Her career will, I feel certain, as she continues to live and experience more and more, will keep rising. I look forward to her future songs, her music is going to be a continual benefit for her appreciative and devoted listeners.  This is music as it was meant to be when you want it to speak to the soul.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Part of my resolution for 2011 was to lose the extra pounds I kept on after having my first child almost 2yrs ago.  I was determined to fit into those barely worn pairs of jeans I had hung up in my closet pre-pregnancy days.  So I looked into a work-out that would eliminate going to the gym but getting the same results.  Being a new Mom with a full-time job leaves very little time for the luxury of going to the gym 3 days a week.  Besides, if I couldn't afford a personal trainer to work on those trouble areas, I would quickly lose interest as I saw very little change in my body when I was going.  I was doing some research and came across this dvd program.  I was pretty impressed with all of the positive reviews but didn't think I'd be writing one myself today.  When I first did L1, it was HARD but after a few days, I found it to be much easier and looked forward to doing it. I did experience some pain in my knees which didn't last very long.  I figured it was probably my joints/body adapting to change and being pushed.  This program is definitely a challenge and I enjoy that I can work at my own pace.  I did L1 for the first 3-4 weeks/5-6 days and am now on L2 and within that time frame, I've lost 2-2.5 inches everywhere and feel great!  The workout is definitely effective and the results are quick if you commit to it with proper diet.  I didn't cut everything out but with reading labels and replacing bad carbs with good ones and eating more veggies, I saw even better results.  My only complaint is probably the music that sounds more like \\"hold music\\" which doesn't really motivate me to push myself on those days where I'm just not that into it.  I don't have time to play my own music and follow the routine cause it might get confusing.  The only thing left to push me is my 1yr old clapping for me when I've completed the workout (smile).  I also wish the abs workout was a bit longer since most women, like myself, yearn for flatter and tighter abs.  I will say, however, the \\"baby pooch\\" that I once thought I couldn't get rid of is now barely there and there's definition so I guess I can't complain.  This dvd is definitely worth a try cause it's surely a quick way to lose inches right before swimsuit season and way to feel great.     Quick Question:  Is anyone taking supplements for energy or any vitamins in particular while doing this program?  I find myself very tired and pretty mush forcing myself to work-out lately but I don't know if it's boredome or if I'm lacking something.  I was taking Tonalin CLA but stopped due to mixed on-line reviews.  I do take multivitamins but no energy booster/fat burner.  Any advice/suggestion is appreciated.      Thanks and good luck to all.
1591843790|5.0|Many books receive all sorts of great hype only to leave the reader disappointed from some rehashed information; this is not one of those books. Guy has done a fantastic job in laying out a book that can actually help the reader. You will find a path that explains how to become more passionate about what you do as well as how to really help people around you.<br /><br />There are plenty of examples of how to be more persuasive in both theory but also in the ability to really communicate with others on a higher level. There are also short stories at the end of each chapter that underscore what the chapter was about. The formulas used for success are also easy to follow but even better they would be easy to implement.<br /><br />There is some thinking involved on your part as a reader but that is one of the many reasons that this is an exceptional read.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The cast of this film is marvelous.  Dame Helen Merrin - is a magnificent actor and beautiful woman.  John Malkovich - gives his usual brilliant portrayal, marvelously quirky as former spook.  Morgan Freeman - one of our great actors of the last four decades, regret he was killed off did an excellent portrayal as an ailing former spook.  Mary Lou Parker - did a good job as BW love interest.  Karl Urban - the script for his part was a bit stiff for me, but acted well.    This was an interesting plot and shows possible convoluted actions of the spooks in the U.S. Government and possible lack of communications among the \\"intelligence\\" community.   I found the actions of the J. Malkovich character very,very entertaining and Dame Merrin is one of my favorite actors-her role as a killer was fascinating for me.  Morgan Freeman was his usual smooth self and regret his character seemed to have been terminated.  Bruce Willis has been a favorite since Moonlighting, and his roll in this movie was great as a Retired & Extremely Dangerous former Special Ops.member.    Enjoyed this film very much and will watch again soon, must get the Blue-Ray version too.  Waiting for the sequel ---
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a casual watcher of Buffy and Angel, I was not too fussed about this coming out - being weary of Star Trek type programmes. However the price of the DVD enticed me into trying it.     What a series.     The dialogue, plots and characters are unique and excellent. Nathan Fillion is a very likeable and ruthless captain.     I'd recommend this to anyone (and I do on a regular basis)
B0041KKYEM|3.0|While there were many merits to Black Swan, I felt the sex scenes were overdone to a ridiculous degree. They were unnecessary to the point of damaging the overall enjoyment of what could have been a marvelous film.
0887306667|3.0|This is an outstanding book.  It's a quick read, captivating, and compelling.  The advice it offers is mostly sound and, to some degree, has what appears to be a timeless element to it.  However, the claim to &#34;immutability&#34; of the laws is a bit overstated, and I think at times the authors are guilty of faulty reasoning.  The authors weave a convincing narrative, but when the chips are down, they still are picking and choosing facts to support their arguments, based on hindsights.  This book has aged somewhat, allowing the predictions to be tested.  Some of them hold, others do not.  The most glaringly false predictions lie in the realm of computers and software.  The authors predict that competitors to Microsoft will succeed in certain markets, such as word processing software, or Lotus in the spreadsheet market (or groupware market).  In reality, Microsoft crushed Lotus and Wordperfect, and it did so not by utilizing any of the marketing laws, but by exerting its monopoly power, leveraging its dominance in the operating system market.  And in perhaps an even worse prediction, the authors claimed that Lotus &#34;owned&#34; the word groupware, according to the laws of the book--and yet now Lotus doesn't even appear once in the first TWENTY pages of google search results on &#34;groupware&#34;.  But it's impossible to predict the future perfectly, and many of the other predictions in this book have come true over time.  Where does this book go wrong?  It is limited in its scope.  Note that the examples of failed predictions all come from the realm of information technology.  This book is limited in scope because of the cultural and societal changes being brought about by the information age.  The laws work well in mainstream consumerist society, dominated by television and a uniform suburban culture with big, corporate chain stores, television, and uniform suburban subdivisions.  This is the America of the 50's.  But this society is breaking down, declining.It's being replaced with alternatives coming from many different angles: the information age has created wonders such as social media and the blogosphere, which are giving rise to a more decentralized distribution of information.  On a grass-roots level, small towns and new urbanism, allied to leaders in small business, are changing the structure of communities, also moving away from corporate consumerism.  The laws described in this book are not immutable laws nor are they an inevitable result of the free market -- they're an inevitable result of a large, centralized society run by a small number of big corporations, and with a centralized media that is largely centered around television.  Many markets in today's world already behave very differently.  In the community of businesses with a local scope, often the most important thing for a brand to do is to simply persist beyond the first two years.  The laws of this book only really work for national, global, or large regional brands.  Another example of where these laws break down is ecommerce.  Sites like eBay, Half.com, and Etsy, which are major brands that seem to follow the laws of the book, have ironically created a different atmosphere where these laws don't apply--the thousands of &#34;power sellers&#34; on eBay compete on roughly equal footing with newer, smaller users.  Price and reputation drive decisions, not seller identity.  Another example which is an area I work in directly, as I run RateTea, is the online tea retailer market.  The largest player, Adagio teas, doesn't have a huge chunk of the market, and there are literally hundreds of successful, profitable online tea retailers.  This diversity is fueled by bloggers and a sea of individual users on social networking sites, which do the marketing for these companies, in a patchwork, decentralized fashion.  This atmosphere creates diversity of opinion and doesn't allow the sort of consolidation of brand power and brand loyalty that you see in the sort of system of TV + Chain Store + Products from Large Corporations.  Criticisms aside?  Still a great book.  Consumerism may be on the decline but we're stuck with it for a few more generations and if you're in business, you still want to know how to navigate it.  And this book is one of the quickest ways to empower yourself to succeed as a marketer in mainstream consumerist society.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This film had totally changed my view about the U. S. government and U. S. corporations.  I wish I will get a chance to go visit Joel's Polyface Farms one of these days.  He looks very good for his age, and it must have to do with his food.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|We loved the Firefly series, & were anxious to see the ending to the show.  The writing & acting were great as was the series, but this movie did have a lot darker theme to it.  We still enjoyed it, & it did finalize everything, but I preferred the  lighter side of the series. If you watched Firefly, then this movie is a must to put an end to things.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|I bought this for myself for my birthday and I can't watch it at all, by me returning it at my expence just cost me more money so either way I lose more, I did not know this movie would not play in my DVD player, so I am stuck with something I can not use, 1st of all I got nothing for my 63rd birthday so I figured I would buy myself a presant well this sucks not only do I have a useless movie I cant watch I totally lose all togater, this makes me not want to buy anything from Amazon now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely great show.  We love Firefly are were sorry to see the show canceled.  The interaction between the characters is great.  We like the comical yet seriousness of the show.  Nathan Fillion is great as a captain.  The rag-tag crew get themselves into a jam all the time, but always manage to save each other.  We liked the old west meets space travel twist - it's not something that we've ever seen before & really enjoyed the uniqueness of the show.  I think this is a great buy for anyone who is tired of the same old science fiction show.
B0001K9IJ8|5.0|A must, for any high end sound system.  Great selections well put together album.  Diana, the best always.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had Sci-fi and never was able to watch this series... after hearing talk about how good it was, thought I would check it out. Great acting, visuals, stories. Sad it was only one season. Greatest Sci-fi series ever made.

0670022411|4.0|I loved this novel. It was engrossing from the beginning. But when I finished it, I felt cheated. The whole novel gears up for a big show down among the Supreme Court of Supernatural Beings that NEVER happens. There's no denouement, there's no conclusion -- it just ends. Nowhere in any of the literature or reviews does it mention that this is a prequel or part of a series. And while it is well written and very engaging, it really isn't a complete story by itself. I'll buy the next one, but only to get the conclusion of the half-told story.
B004R10N6O|3.0|I'm not sure if Harrison Ford intentionally changed his voice for this role but man was it gruff.<br /><br />The movie was predictable but cute. A good rent once and leave it movie. I definitely will not be purchasing it.<br /><br />If you are a romantic comedy movie buff this movie will not disappoint.<br /><br />If you are a movie buff, don't bother.
030726999X|1.0|First I would like to state that the Millenium series is massively over rated. Lisbeth Salander makes these books worth reading but she is the only interesting character. This book suffers from Salander only being in a third of the book, spending most of the book in a hospital bed. This book also suffers from too many story lines and characters that do nothing more than distract the reader from the action. My suggestion is to read the first book then stop. The second book is kind of interesting but you have to read this poor excuse of a sequel to finish the story. Hornet's Nest could have been added to the end of Fire, but instead this part of the story is drawn out to an exhausting level. If you really need to know how the trilogy ends, watch the movie or read spark notes, don't waste your time with this book.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This was a great way to wrap up the story with Andy and his toys.<br />I think I enjoyed the movie more because of my connection with the first 2 films<br />and as a standalone it might be a solid 4 star movie.<br /><br />That being said this movie had everything I expected and more with a heart wrenching story.<br />I know it got to me because after the movie I went home and dusted off the old toys in the closet<br />to relive some childhood memories.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the first 2, do yourself a favor and watch them first before seeing this one.
0785134352|2.0|After seeing the movie I was psyched to read this book. I wish someone had told me not to bother. The movie greatly improves the story line and character development. Don't bother with this product, just watch the movie.
0060555661|5.0|I haven't even got half way through this book, but I can already see the applicability to one's overall perspective on investing. The end-of-chapter commentary provides up to date analysis of interesting trends that the general public once thought to be absolute. I would highly recommend anyone in the fields of finance, accounting, or general business to read this book.
0316113077|5.0|This book is great and give you so many ideas. I like that every technic and broken down and explained step by step. Definitely a good book to have around!
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I have been a huge Evangelion fan for a long time. When I heard that a new set was being released I was ecstatic. It is a great reworking of the original and the art and production is phenomenal. It is very much worth the money, and if you are a fan of this series then I urge you to get a copy.    UPDATE: I had only seen the movie when I wrote the above. I now own the DVD and can say it is pretty great. The packaging, while not as elaborate as 1.11, is very nice. The extras are not amazing, but there is some cool stuff in there. Still a 5 star product.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is truly unforgettable.  It made me laugh, cry and everything in between.  I think it is superbly well written and just engrossing to read.  A definite must for anyone who has dealt with Alzheimer's first hand or knows someone who is facing it.  I felt like I learned so much, just by Alice sharing what she was going through.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|Pretty mellow album for the most part. No surprise to Coldplay fans.<br /><br />Moods:<br /><br />-Rejuvenated<br />-Pensive<br />-Strange<br />-Religious<br />-Left-out<br />-Energetic<br />-Determined<br />-Passionate<br />-Optimistic<br />-Lonely<br />-Lofty<br />-Melancholy<br />-Sweet<br /><br />Based on what I saw on a lyrics-oriented website, there's supposed to be 2 hidden songs on Viva La Vida- \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\" and \\"The Escapist,\\" which I haven't heard of. Based on the lyrics, the former song is just basically about sleeping, and the latter seemingly short song is about a related farfetched matter.<br /><br />1) \\"Life In Technicolor\\"- an awakening momental instrumental<br /><br />2) \\"Cemetaries in London\\"- is sorta religious and against stat quo, but fails a vital point.<br /><br />3) \\"Lost\\"- Sounds like an upbeat song.<br /><br />4) \\"42\\"- is a wishful thinking song about preserving the dead's life. Eventually gets upbeat.<br /><br />5) \\"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\\"- a song of confidence.<br /><br />6) \\"Yes\\"- loneliness<br /><br />7) \\"Viva La Vida\\"-<br /><br />8) \\"Violet Hill\\"- questioned love<br /><br />9) \\"Strawberry Swing\\"- the most effective song on this album. Vitalizes the day.<br /><br />10) \\"Death and All His Friends\\"- Reasonable remarkable finishing touch to \\"Viva La Vida.\\" Anti-fighting theme.<br /><br />I didn't like all the melodies on the album. Either they were too slow or just didn't tickle my fancy. Certain lyrics degrade the related songs, and so, the rating.

0061997811|5.0|When I saw this book, being the Harry Potter fanatic I am, of course I wanted to purchase it. It was backordered for months, but I finally got it today. I must say, it was worth the wait entirely! The price was fair, packaging was quality, and with all the insider features so central to this series, what more could you ask for!?
1439177783|3.0|As far as memoirs go, this book is Diet-memoir, Memoir-light. She can write well enough but there's not a whole lot of substance here.. I found myself losing interest very quickly ... she was an over-achieving kid, she struggled with eating disorder, and her sexuality.. I have nothing against her, she seems like a nice person and I loved her on Ally McBeal and Arrested Dev. but the book to me was mostly fluff. I would not reccommend.
0446573698|5.0|I have to say that David Baldacci is an excellent author and I have read several of his books. I am particularly fond of the Camel Club and have read everyone in that series, the last being Hell's Corner. This book was no exception and it kept you on the edge of your seat. The large print version, is of course, thicker because of the larger print, but is excellent for reducing eye strain. I would recommend this book to everyone who is a fan of David Baldacci.
B004MMEIK0|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have ever read. New to kindle, I downloaded it b/c it was free and I enjoyed the Twilight series.  Well, save yourself.  I cannot believe this book was even published.  It had a surface plot line, immature and unrealistic dialog and unlikeable characters.  I wanted to like the book and kept reading hoping it would get better but it never did.  I wish I could get the 3 hours of my life back I wasted reading this book.
193413712X|2.0|I picked up this book at the airport in Toronto only because I heard it won a Pulitzer prize and because I needed something to read on the flight to Fort McMurry. A 200 page novel, that has won an important prize should definitely keep me interested for the close to four hours flight. So I was excited. I expected to finish the book in one go. It's been two weeks now, I am still half-way through and quite uninterested in finishing it. This isn't because the book is difficult. There's just no story here.    My observations are that Paul Harding is not a storyteller, he's a poet, interested in words, but who can't seem to able to pen a tale capable of keeping a reader interested from the first to the last page. A tale where you cling to the protagonist as if his fate was yours. There are no characters in tinkers, in the sense that I don't feel attached to any of them.    A man lies dying in a hospital bed in the middle of his living room, so the author decides to show us the dying man's memories of life during those last few hours. Instead of painting a clear and passionate story, the author goes on a mad ride on words, which end up suffocating the whole plot, if there's actually one and if there is none, at least the book should've been character-driven to keep the reader pinned. Because the characterization is lame, the author fills this gap with purple prose. It isn't uncommon that he says the same thing in ten different ways within the same sentence.      If you are looking for a novel on how to construct ridiculously long sentences, gain a fair grip on metaphorical language and flowery writing, at the expense of interesting and well developed characters that you feel attached to, then read tinkers. If not, run.      I can live with some of the beauty in the exaggerated language used. But I believe there are way better books out there worth a Pulitzer prize than this one.
0756404738|2.0|I loved the Name of the Wind, one of my favorite books of all time. I was shocked to see, what to me was sexually explicit content in this book, the Wise Man's Fear.

B000X0CYQK|4.0|HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE was the first-ever Cinemascope/stereo sound comedy, and the first such extravaganza on broadcast TV. In 1961, \\"Milionaire\\" was the premiere film on NBC's brand new \\"Saturday Night at the Movies\\" series.<br /><br />In this amalgam of two Broadway shows, \\"[[ASIN:B000R9COGM The Greeks Had a Word For Them]]\\" and \\"Loco,\\" the trio of Bacall, Grable and Monroe portray golddigging gals who aggressively target wealthy men. At the end, they all wed guys as poor as they are, or so it seems.<br /><br />It's frothy '50s stuff that's hampered at times by the censorship of that era. Example: Monroe must say \\"Men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses\\" instead of \\"don't make passes at.\\" There's still room for some zingers, such as Bacall's old age barb aimed right at husband Humphrey Bogart: \\"Look at Roosevelt, look at Churchill, look at old fella whats-his-name in [[ASIN:B002TOL4QO THE AFRICAN QUEEN]].<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.0) How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) - Lauren Bacall/Betty Grable/Marilyn Monroe/David Wayne/Rory Calhoun/Cameron Mitchell/Fred Clark/Wiliam Powell (uncredited: Merry Anders/Percy Helton/Philip Van Zandt)
B003Y5H556|2.0|Has it become increasingly difficult to write an ending? Have writers suddenly forgotten that the climax is the high point of a story? Or is Hollywood getting lazy? Red Riding Hood is probably the most frustrating and unsatisfying movie I've been to, and the above reason is just one of many. While it certainly isn't bad, I haven't finished feeling so let down since Haneke's \\"The White Ribbon\\".<br /><br />Of course, Hardwicke is a director who is willing take big risks. She did so with Twilight, which was a huge smash with teens everywhere. And she does have a good eye for a shot, and several scenes here show. If had to recommend the movie for one thing alone, it would be for the visuals. The look of the film has a gorgeous, lush and colourful palette that made this film worth seeing on the big screen.<br /><br />The film's biggest problem aside from being anti-climatic is that the plot is just... a mangled mess. It reads like a really bad fanfiction. If you thought Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland was bad... .wait till you get a load of this movie. We have several plot points that come in and suddenly are left do die, one of which includes Father Solomon played by Gary Oldman, who is made to be a crazy bastard type character, and we don't see anything to prove it. To top it all off, it's rife with clich&eacute;s, like the obligatory love triangle, the whodunit, damned protagonist.<br /><br />The actors are a mixed bag. Seyfried does a good job here and has plenty of emotion in her performance. She has plenty of cheesy lines but she does a good job for what she has to work with. Gary Oldman was also great, but that was expected as he always shines with every performance. On the downside, Shiloh Fernandez gives one of the worst performances ever here. He spends the whole movie looking like he wants to punch someone and reads his lines like he's reading them off a paper. And Virginia Madsen just awful here as well, and is over-acting Billy Burke.<br /><br />In short Red Riding Hood is a film that has plenty of promise, but sadly doesn't live up to it. It isn't a bad film by any means, but you are most likely to leave disappointed.ty of promise, but sadly doesn't live up to it.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have finished The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss.<br /><br />The short review: It was everything I hoped it would be.<br /><br />2011 is filled with promise. There are a number of high-profile releases taking place this year, and The Wise Man's Fear was near the top of my list. I know I am not alone. After the March 2007 release of The Name of the Wind (review HERE), author Patrick Rothfuss gained an immediate growing readership that, in the four years since, has spanned the globe and become a cultish following that even Neil Gaiman would be envious of. In essence, The Name of the Wind is one of those excellent debuts that most people fall in love with, due to one of the most fully realized characters I've read--Kvothe, Arliden's son.<br /><br />Imagine how difficult it has been for those fans, who will have had to patiently wait four years to read The Wise Man's Fear on March 1st.<br /><br />For the purposes of this review, however, the readership of Patrick Rothfuss is one of three parts.<br /><br />The first part of the readership is one that is apparent but rare, like those who haven't watched the original Star Wars trilogy or hate Harry Potter. If you read The Name of the Wind and did not care for it, you will not enjoy The Wise Man's Fear.<br /><br />The second part is one that is more apparent still. If you read The Name of the Wind and loved the entirety of it like your first read of The Hobbit or viewing of The Fellowship of the Ring, you will love the entirety of The Wise Man's Fear.<br /><br />The third part is possibly the hardest to explain because it encompasses both other parts. I am within this part. It is a readership who enjoyed the first book but also thought it had some areas it could have been improved.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is a fabulous book. As I said in my review, it is also a rare book. The life story of Kvothe is told with brilliant expertise for a first time writer, and it grabs a hold of the imagination and doesn't let go. That said, I felt it could have been tightened up, not just extraneous words throughout the prose but also in the middle of the story when the narrative slowed down quite a bit once Kvothe entered the University.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear is a great deal tighter when it comes to its words. Patrick spent four years rewriting it and it shows quite clearly. The additional words that hampered The Name of the Wind a bit are gone here. Each sentence is constructed with nary a word out of place; every paragraph flows smoothly page after page. I think readers will be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear does still have moments where the narrative slows down to a crawl. Readers within this particular part of three will notice it as I did. It is a large book and while the character development Kvothe goes through is fascinating, real, and tangible--to the point I'd argue he truly becomes a man in this book--it comes at a price. There were four different moments where I wanted the story to pick up and those were the moments I put the book down to work, go for a walk, or check email.<br /><br />Those other tasks didn't last long though. I returned to the book, as enchanted as before, and made my way through the areas I think could have been pruned back some. I was rewarded every time. Rothfuss is truly great at giving the reader a payoff like you can't believe after every lull.<br /><br />In this book, the stakes are even higher for Kvothe. Forced from the University, he takes to the road to find a patron. What he finds is nothing he expected to find. Lovelorn kings. Civilized mercenaries. The inhuman Fae. And the name of the wind.<br /><br />I'll leave it at that. No spoilers here.<br /><br />I sincerely cannot wait to discuss this book with all of you when it is published. I eagerly look forward to the third book in the Kingkiller Chronicle, The Doors of Stone! It can't come quick enough but I'll wait for it patiently because I can see the payoff for the entire trilogy is going to be something truly special.<br /><br />Overall, The Wise Man's Fear is as great a sequel book as we all could have hoped for.<br /><br />Final Verdict: 4 1/2 / 5 starsequel book as we all could have hoped for.    Final Verdict: 4 1/2 / 5 stars

0756404738|5.0|I read it; I loved it at least as much as Name of the Wind.<br /><br />This book is set up as a man telling another the story of his life.  Who among us could do that to the detail that this is being done?  If his memory is hazy about some things, and bright about others, then it's to be expected.  For those who think the story is boring, look at how far the character has come since the beginning of Name of the Wind.  Consider how a man, with all the years of learning that he has gathered, might look back and couch the phrases that describe what he knew as a child.<br /><br />This is a story about a tavern keeper that happens to be the object of fabulous stories and rumors.  He's a hero, he's a villain, he's immortal!  The tale we're hearing is the truth of things, and the man is painting himself as ...gasp!  A man.  With faults, and foibles, and personality, and humor, and an irrational, mystifying attraction to things that are not good for him!<br /><br />It's a frigging amazing story.  I too, hope to see the tavern keeper shed his phony cloak of wimpiness and sweep out to destroy all the bad things in the world with the might of his gathered knowledge!  But, it's a story about a man, and men are inherently flawed by humanity itself.  This whole trilogy could end in incredible tragedy!  I hope not, but it could.  Even if it does, the ride has been well worth it, and will continue to be.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful.  I wish I could spend as much time reading this book as the author spent writing it.  It's worthy of some serious appreciation by grammar critics everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, I was super happy about the interludes, because without them, I may have starved, let my dog starve, never slept, burst my bladder, and gotten fired.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I think the best CD in 2011 was released too early.  I think there will not be other CD better than the Mars' this year.  Congratulations to Bruno Mars!!!
0316666343|1.0|***BIG TIME SPOILERS HERE***    The Lovely Bones is a novel following the Aftermath of the murder of 14 year old Susie Salmon, who watches and narrates our tale from her \\"personal\\" version of heaven where everyone gets what they want, but it's really more of a prison, as they are helpless to intervene with the matters of their friends and family.    Really, as many others said, and I can't stress this enough, the first chapter is pretty much the best chapter in the entire novel. It's interesting, captivating and keeps you on hold with a \\"can't put it down\\" type of feel you just want to know more. After this however, it's a slow trip downhill. One of my problems with this book is that the characters seem very flat and lifeless, and when they did have life, it seemed very contrived and \\"wrong\\" from some reason.    Susie stopped sounding like a 14 year old after chapter 2. By Chapter 3 she used enough prose and description to sound as if she was approaching her sixtieth birthday.  Also, I found it disturbing that \\"Holly\\" an Asian girl, whom Susie meets in heaven, wishes to not have an accent. You would think that one wouldn't carry societal hang-ups in their own personal version of heaven and be proud of whom they are but I guess not.     Lindsey, Susie's younger sister by about two years, Also seemed to possess this disturbing amount of otherworldly maturity for a girl at the age of 12 to find out her older sister has died. I get it, she's smart and snaky, but really, who has that much composure at that young of an age, no matter how much they've been through? The entire scene where she loses her virginity to Samuel seemed unrealistic to me, just the way she handled it. She too, acted as if she was about 42 rather than 12 when the book started, and it doesn't get any better. Also, how many people do you know that have stayed with he same person since they've been 11 years old? And haven't fought once?     For the first half of the book, Susie's younger brother Buckleyis treated more like a houseplant than a character story wise; it's like you're aware he's there, but there's no description of him really and he's dismissed as quickly as he's brought up. It's almost massif the author was afraid to write about a character so young so she skipped him all together until he got a little older. When he does get a little older, he ends up becoming my favorite character and a lot of times, seems like the only sane one in the entire novel. He's also the ONLY one to not take his mother's bullcrap after she abandons them and walks out on the family for almost a decade.    The grandmother was an alcoholic mess/GILF that border lined on a Golden Girls style parody.    The father, I think was one of the most realistic characters of the stories. He has problems letting go of his daughter's death even though years have passed by and everyone else has moved on.  The mother, though. I could not stand. She was about as bad a Bella swan when it comes to Character Depth and maturity. I felt not a single ounce of sympathy for her. She doesn't even seem that sad about the horrific murder of her daughter, more like slightly annoyed. She decide she can't handle the grief and after briefly hooking up and cheating on her husband with the detective working on her daughters case no less; she decides to abandon her two young children and husband in their time of need to run away to California with little reason other than the fact that she was sad over Susie's death.  It was quite annoying to read about and whenever it go to describing the mother I just wanted to skip through it so badly.    Then you have some of Susie's Classmates: Clarissa, Ruth and Ray, the last one being Susie's *almost* boyfriend. Clarissa seems to be the most realistic out of the three. She's a bit of a floozy and while she's sad about her friend's death, she eventually moves on with her life. Ruth, a neurotic sixth sense girl with lesbian tendencies is eerily obsessed with her death despite the fact that Susie Barely knew her. While Susie seems to be happy about this, I found it to be deeply disturbing.    She's basically like Mr. Harvey; a psycho with a crush only she investigates Murders instead of being a murderer. Ray too, while a sympathetic character (his *almost* girlfriend goes missing and gets murdered. Ouch!)  But he too, seems unnaturally preoccupied with Susie's death, to the point where you wonder why he is still angsting about his middle school crush's death when he's in his late teens and early twenties, even. It didn't seem real.     I'll admit the second half of the book went by incredibly slowly and suddenly switched to Susie describing the day by day actions of her family and friends to suddenly skipping 5-10 years down the road. The second half was pretty painful to get through. The only interesting parts ere the ones about Mr. Harvey, the rapist killer of Susie and almost laughably textbook Serial Killer (Thick Glasses, really quiet, fairly weird ,makes DOLLHOUSES for god's sake) and watching him cover his tracks.    And don't even get me started on the ending: It almost made me sick. Mr. Harvey's demise ends in the stupidest way imaginable. He slips on an alluded to icicle and falls down a ravine. How silly. Might as well have him get attacked  by a gang of clowns in a clown car. I understand that Sebold was trying to tell us that not all crimes go unpunished but really, anything else would have been more realistic. I personally would have had him get killed by a bunch of thugs while stalking some inner city girl. On top of that Susie gets her one chance to come down from heaven and uses it not to tell her friend and family how she was, that's she's okay, or where her body was. She uses it to get laid. Which is pretty odd considering she was RAPED and KILLED.    Overall, The Lovely Elbows---oops,I mean Bones, was an utter disappointment and I cannot recommend it. One star.

0312360266|1.0|Did I like Marked? I am going to say, yes I did, but not likely for the reasons that the Cast mother and daughter duo wanted me too, which is why it gets a one star rating, rather then a five. I laughed my entire way through this book at the numerous number of plot holes, poor characterization and stereotyping of people. I mean, honestly... gay people aren't like the way the Cast girls portray the characters.    I'll start off with the fact I am absolutely shocked that this is labeled as a Young Adult novel. If it is truly a Young Adult novel, should I not feel safe giving this book to almost every thirteen year old girl I know, and any younger girl from ten and older whom I find to be mature. The sad fact is, I honestly don't feel like I can do this.     I now wish to move onto the fact that Zoey is not a likable character. Some people argue that a book can't influence girls to act bad, but that depends on how much they actually understand right and wrong about the certain issues in the book and how mature they are to understand the issues. If they understand, the books are going to effect the girls not to do these things, while if they don't, it is going to effect them to do.    Zoey talks down about a ton people, bad mouthing Aphrodite as evil and as a user of guys... I am trying to keep my review clean here. But the truth of the matter is, Zoey is just as shallow as Aphrodite is and she looks down on people just as much. I mean, she stereotypes how people act as being a certain way and she says one thing, does another.    And boy are people stereotyped in this book. The Cast family makes the claim that these teenagers talk like teenagers really do and I call bull on this. Maybe if they were from some school in the ghetto area of town and the kids don't have a good home life due to gang violence, this is true. But truth of the matter, I've seen teenagers be much more intelligent and a lot less shallow then they ar presented in this book.    I also can't help butnotice that Zoey... our dear Zoey, is an overly obvious self-insert for the Cast daughter. I hope for goodness sake she doesn't act the way that Zoey does in this book. Yes... Zoey is a Mary Sue, mondo sparkly, mondo special, over glorified and nothing really bad happens to her. She has no real flaws. No, she has flaws but they are painted as obsolete and don't effect the story. I mean, other character HAVE said flaws and are called out by her, but she never gets called out!    Oh, and lets get to the fact this book uses real living people. Paris Hilton is ironically bitched about by Zoey, yet I find Zoey to have no room to talk. The Cast females list among their famous vampires a Christian singer, yet ironically they also paint Christians as people who don't get things. And then there is Heath Ledger. He is NOT a gay actor. Honestly, I wonder if this book had been published AFTER his death, if people might not have been in an uproar. Actually, I wonder why this issue hasn't been brought up at all.    And then there is the issue of religion. Truth of the matter is, it is poorly handled. The Cast family use the stereotype of Christians being suppressive of other beliefs and they made mistakes on the other religions. They didn't bother one bit to do their research. The reason for this story is to create a wish fulfillment.    And the comparisons to Twilight? Yeah, they are both about vampires and they both have characters who come across as rather shallow, but I for once have to say Twilight is much better written and has better morals then this book, which is saying something considering I don't find Twilight to be a well written book, nor to have good morals and that I think should be understood and explained to girls as a read for enjoyment purposes only.

B001NHZ2KM|5.0|The finest biographical rock documentary, it is negligent not to include this with 'The T.A.M.I. Show', 'Monterey Pop', 'Woodstock', 'Gimme Shelter' and the other documentaries that have achieved legendary status. But I think there is one more thing that needs to come onto DVD to truly understand what The Who meant to their fans.<br /><br />Much more so than other acts, writers discussing The Who would bend over backwards to show that their opinions were not influenced by radio airplay - as a result they proclaimed ad nauseum that everything recorded before 'Tommy' was perfect while everything after was garbage (TKAA even has something to offer that crowd as there are four (!) versions of \\"My Generation\\").<br /><br />Growing up a fan, however, my friends and I would decide what to listen to and buy according to our own instincts about what was exciting and energetic rather than the pretensions or delusions of Rolling Stone writers. This meant of course that among one of rock's mightiest repertoires one album would always be the greatest ('Who's Next') and one song always the greatest - \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" - the original version a performance so stirring and majestic that it cannot be left off any SINCERE list of the greatest rock songs of all time.<br /><br />But as the song's reputation built throughout the 1970's the live performance of WGFA transformed into something far, far, far beyond a routine rendition. The grandest of grande finales, it became the single greatest moment of anticipation, drama and ecstasy in all of 20th Century music - I personally can't think of anything comparable other than the endings of the greatest Verdi operas. If you were lucky enough to be there when every last fan in a crowd of 20,000, 40,000 or 60,000 raised his hands and yelled YEEEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!! with Roger at the end of the last synthesizer break, then you knew you were part of a spine-tingling, goose-bumping audience thrill you could experience nowhere else.<br /><br/>All Who fans should be grateful to Jeff Stein for acknowledging the pride of place of WGFA in the Who canon by selecting it as the concluding number. The version here is magnificent, unto itself justifying a five star rating for the DVD. But because it was filmed on a soundstage, there is only the faintest glimmer of the audience dynamics that would help the viewer understand what that song, and indeed what the band, meant to its audience. I'm still hoping that someday there will be a DVD of comparable quality of one of the large scale shows (the Shea Stadium concert comes to mind) so everyone can understand completely why The Who inspired more devotion than any act in the history of rock'n'roll.

B001LNOOG6|4.0|This is an overall satisfying tale of sweet revenge carefully executed after a young man is wrongfully thrown into prison through treachery by three greedy enemies. Now that Jeffery Archer has spent time in prison as well as the court room, many of his stories contain a look inside prison life. Once this dreary setting was left behind however, it became great fun to watch our hero change his identity and stealthily sneak up on his prey and even the score, using their weaknesses against them. One reviewer likened this tale to a modern day Count of Monte Cristo - and a very well done version at that!

B001KTNW4G|5.0|As with another of his books, Kane and Abel, Jeffery Archer treats his readers to beautifully developed characters in opposition, spicing up descriptions of their early lives with his gift for inserting believable accidents and coincidences that lead to what we now refer to as \\"six degrees of separation\\". The two men in this book, both media kings, will remind anyone of Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Townsend. What is always such a treat when it comes to Archer's work is that nagging suspicion that with his own high flying career as a member of parliment and access to a certain portion of the glitterati, he might actually know something about the real life people that inspire his stories that we don't. It is also a well researched look into the world of news production, the fourth estate, including edifying behind-the-scenes- information. Though not as popular today, well worth reading.
0375842209|5.0|\\"The door was opened and shut, and a figure was crouched over him.  The hand splashed at the cold waves of his clothes and the grimy currents beneath.  A voice came down, behind it.\\"  And so I let the Book Thief speak for itself.  This short quote speaks volumes about Markus Zusak's debut novel.  This sentence is heavy with the novel's characteristic metaphoric imagery and subtly dark undertone.  The Book Thief is a modern Bildungsroman.  However, unlike many books in which the story is centered solely on the growth of a protagonist, the Book Thief's growing maturity serves rather as a reflection of the world around her.  The main character, Liesel Meminger, is a young girl in Germany during World War II and the Holocaust.  We meet her just as she witnesses the death of her younger brother, and just before she and her mother part ways, Liesel to remain with foster parents in the town of Molching.  Despite these unfortunate circumstances, Liesel retains the typical innocence of youth, with its fears, triumphs, and simple pleasures.  It is not long, though, before she is awakened to the troubles of the world by the quiet arrival of a man at her new home.  This man, whom she would come to know as Max, is a Jew, and he lives in her basement.     The Book Thief is wonder of modern literature.  In a time of Twilights, Harry Potters, and other popular pulp fiction, The Book Thief stands as a monument to what a book in the 21st century can be.  What makes Marcus Zusak's book so exceptional is the unique way he has chosen to write the story.  The first distinctive aspect of The Book Thief, and the one most immediately obvious, is the identity of its narrator: Death.  Indeed, it is the Grim Reaper himself who introduces Liesel's tale and will act as a constant companion and commentator for the reader.  One may immediately assume that they are surely embarking upon a grim read when they discover this fact.  Honestly, I can't imagine who wouldn't: a novel set in Nazi Germany narrated by Death himself, undoubtedly witness to theJewish genocide we know is to come.  However, as becomes apparent in the first few pages, Death is actually rather sympathetic, self-effacing, and jaded.  It is not only his ironic disposition that gives the book a distinguishing flair, but the manner in which he allows the story to unfold.  He does not reveal events in a typical manner, and perhaps this is an intentional reminder by the author that this is not your typical narrator.  Death's world-weary attitude is epitomized in this passage, one that follows Death's premature divulgence of an important character's death : \\"Of course, I'm being rude.  I'm spoiling the ending, not only of the entire book, but of this particular piece of it.  I have given you two events in advance, because I don't have much interest in building mystery.  Mystery bores me.  It chores me.  I know what happens and so do you.  It's the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and astound me.\\"  Death provides a unique omniscient perspective blurring the line between participatory character and narrator.     It is not only how the book is written that sets it apart and makes it memorable, it also the words with which it is written that leave a lasting impression in the reader's mind.  The language.  Markus Zusak has subtly woven stunning imagery into The Book Thief.  These moments are not a Dickens-esque orgy of detail, but instead careful, crafted instances of literary innovation.  Zusak treats these moments as a master poet would, carefully choosing each word for maximum effect.  The irony is that while the amount of words may seem spartan, the vivid scenes they conjure are anything but.  Zusak presents shimmering triumphs of diction and syntax, proving again and again that all it takes is the right words.  \\"The last time I saw her was red. The sky was like soup, boiling and stirring. In some places it was burned. There were black crumbs and pepper, streaked across the redness.\\"  This is a Zusakian depiction of a town post-bombing.  Metaphors and similes are apparent and yet it goes far beyond the simple use of such stylistic tools.  It is the way in which a scene can be delivered with language seemingly so far removed from the subject matter and yet still be painted more vividly than one would have thought possible.     The Book Thief is certainly not the first World War II novel to be written, nor will it be the last.  Neither is it the first work in the genre to discuss the Nazi oppression of Jews and the abuse which the members of the Jewish faith suffered.  In fact, it is this abundance that causes so many books which follow classics like Night by Elie Wiesel to fail to distinguish themselves.  Markus Zusak avoids falling into this trap by approaching familiar subject matter innovatively and thus carving his own place in the overburdened genre.  Unlike many other books, both fiction and nonfiction, The Book Thief does not rely solely on \\"shock factors\\" to make its message meaningful and lasting.  Indeed, where even Night is most memorable for the unprecedented cruelty and degradation it tells of, Zusak takes a different route.  He incorporates the same issues of the Second World War in a much subtler manner, making his narrative one with sweetness, adventure, and even humor.  The differences go beyond even this.  The protagonist of the book, as you now know, is a German girl guilty of no Jewish heritage.  Zusak seems to have chosen to examine the Holocaust not through an abused Jewish lens, but through the eyes of a child on the outside.  And this makes all the difference.  One can never truly rely on the accuracy of an account given by someone on whom crimes are being perpetrated.  They will always see the perpetrators as evil.  Whereas the young Liesel has not yet formed preconceptions of good and evil, she has neither been hurt by Nazis nor indoctrinated into their ideology.  Thus, it is the mind of a child that truly makes this tale believable.     At the risk of hyperbole, I would call The Book Thief a modern classic.  A book becomes a classic when it does something innovative or represents a supremely masterful example of its genre.  I feel that Markus Zusak has created something that succeeds on both fronts.
0743289692|5.0|Infidel is an amazing book.  It is the best autobiography I have ever read.  It is extremely well written and one of the most informative books I have ever found.  I couldn't put it down.  It should be read by everyone who cares about what is happening in America and in the world today.  As the story of a woman growing up within the religion of Islam, it describes the terrible way that religion treats women.  It clearly shows the danger that Islam is to freedom in Africa, Holland, the rest of Europe and in America.
B0013TTK9E|3.0|Was a bit disappointed about this Wentworth reading. I think I may have been looking for more fireworks early on when I remember how Anne and Frederick were in the movie. I thought there would be more stolen kisses and memorable moments for them during courtship. I did not think it worthy of its $11.00 pricetag.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|AMC really hit one out of the park with this one! As a devout fan of the graphic novel I was worried about the franchise going to this new medium, but my fears were unfounded. I really appreciate how the writers did not just follow the comic's plot. Had they done this the translation would have been very poor. By saving the key elements of the world that the story takes place in and the epic characters that fans of the series have grown to love this series is an excellent choice for fans of the graphic novel, zombie lovers, or the completely uninitiated.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I haven't watched this show at all when it's been broadcast but after seeing the first two seasons on blu-ray I am hooked. The picture looks amazing on my new 55' LG LED TV and the sound is great. Just finishing season 2 now and have already pre-ordered season 3. What an interesting and fantastic show. I was skeptical because I thought it the premise was too close to X-Files however they have clearly diverged on their own path. I love the performances of all the main cast, especially Dr. Bishop. Anna Torv is wonderful and Joshua Jackson has the right blend of seriousness and humor. Always a pleasure to see Leonard Nimoy too...I would recommend this show!! Here's to many further seasons!
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Why did I wait two weeks to buy this?  I knew I loved the first release off this album, \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", but nothing could have prepared me for the rest.  I'm a die hard fan of The Cure, and as such get a little irritated when someone does a cover of any of their songs.  Adele's version of \\"Lovesong\\" is incredibly unique and completely sets itself apart from the original version.  The samba style she used to give her personal touch to this song is fitting and makes \\"Lovesong\\" a wonderful song, not just a cover.    Adele brings us through the full love cycle again in her 21 album.  We see the joy, the heartache and the renewed hope that love brings time and again.  I doubt I will ever tire of listening to each and every song on this album.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|127 Hours is a gripping film, based on a true story book of survival. This movie is far more compelling to watch than it has any right to be. Actor James Franco portrays real life person Aron Ralston, as he attempts to survive the titualr 127 hours in a dire situation, with minimal food and water provisions. There's a brief opening scene and some sparse flashbacks, but essentially you get 90 minutes of one on one time with James Franco stuck in a canyon. It is therefore a monumental testament to Franco's acting skills, that I as the viewer never felt bored. Franco seamlessly portrays the helpless and desperate mental state you would expect of one who finds themself in such a prediciment. yet he does so in an unpredictable manner, that gives his portrayal of Aron Ralston distictive layers of depth. Complimenting Franco's standout performance, the movie soars on a combination of the creative directing decisions of Danny Boyle, a unique score by AR Rahmen, and gorgeous cinematography, showing off the best of Utah's landscape. A special note should be made of the usage of sound effects as well. The sound for examople during one of teh movie's more squeamish scenes are appropriately disturbing and hard on teh ears. This adds to a feeling of actually expierincing teh hardships as if you were tehre. Overall, 127 Hours is a film that anyone who is interested in the resiliance the human spirit can endure, or good and unique films in general, should take the tiem to see.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My twin boys received this for their birthday almost a year ago, and now they're about to turn three.  It is AMAZING how well it has held up.  NOTHING has broke on it, even though they take turns sitting in it, and the other pushes them around.  My only regret is we didn't get two of these!
1401323820|5.0|i am so happy that this item was up for sale. i absolutely love the show castle and to get this book was awesome. it was in perfect condition. it was littlerly like the book had been taken right off the tv screen and placed in my hands. it was mind blowing! besides the item itself this seller was very good. the item got here fairly quickly. i was highly impressed.
0439023521|5.0|loved it...<br />just loved it...<br /><br />plot, however unrealistic it may be, is very gripping...<br />since this book can be found in children's book section, it is a very easy read...<br /><br />kudos for ms. collins...<br />can't wait till get started on the second volume...
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I loved this book.  I was given my Kindle by my husband for Valentine's Day and am ADDICTED!    The book is true, gritty and a real insight into a women's prison.  A great read and I would recommend it.    Thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't stop reading :)
0756404738|3.0|After waiting years for this sequel and re-reading \\"Name of the Wind\\" several times, I find myself reluctantly awarding only three stars to \\"Wise Man's Fear\\". I was sure I was going to love it, re-read it, and sing it's praises.  I found it very uneven and not completely satisfying.  I am sad to say that I was able to tear myself away and go to sleep at a decent hour. Not what I was expecting at all.  I won't go into great detail... many others have already done that. But I will say that it was in serious need of further editing, and perhaps should have been two books rather than just the second in a trilogy.  I only hope that the third is once again filled with the magic that kept me up into the wee hours of the morning, unable to stop reading, that dazzled and delighted me, and left me loving Kvothe.  I fell somewhat out of love with him on this reading and I really missed the character who fascinated me so completely.  Patrick Rothfuss is a gifted writer... this was a challenging task. I remain a loyal fan, and wait patiently for the third in the series.  All I ask is please don't make us wait for years.
B003VPWXRO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Porcia has had a very interesting and harsh battle that she overcame well.    Only think I was a little dissapointed in is that she doesn't talk much about after her battle and how her life has panned out with Ellen, her wife, but then again maybe there is another book left in her life or she's wanting to be private, which I can understand.    I loved the book, a real inspiration to people suffering with an eating dissorder or just struggling with something in their life they find as a real obstacle.    Worth a read :)
0756404738|5.0|Having read and reread \\"The Name of the Wind\\" I was more than ready for \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\".  I was not disappointed. Kvothe's story continues and we learn of some of his travels outside the university-travels that will inform the man he becomes.  The book begins slowly, with Kote as our narrator, a sick shadow of the Kvothe of who we learn.  Rothfuss crafts a compelling, heart wrenching story juxtaposing past and present.  He answers questions and poses more still.
142311339X|5.0|I was so excited when I heard that he was going on with this series!  I couldn't put it down and can't wait for the rest of them to be written.
0307272702|5.0|I really appreciate how Gary has stepped way back and given us the big picture not only from history right back to the 18th century, but through research from all over the world. Though technical in some areas, it was not too heavy and held my interest to the end. I am normally skeptical of diet theories, which are usually espoused by those who have an agenda or product to sell. I feel more equipped after reading Gary's thorough investigation to make informed decisions about what I'll eat or not eat.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This sci fi series by Josh Whedon was terrific.  It is a real shame that it didn't last very long at all.  I bought the entire series and the completion film titled \\"Serenity\\".  I only wish that this series had lasted much longer.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|The voice of Josh Groban is in this album is bland and lacks the air previous to his earlier albums. The mixes sound like engineers purposely tried to expose the separate takes, as Josh's voice sits strangely in the mix. A huge fan, I am going to blame Rick Ruben this time.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I *love* *love* *love* these headphones, but just as others have said, one speaker goes out after extended use. (It sounds gross, but sweat running in your ear usually is the culprit.)   I buy a few pairs when I buy them.  Even with the \\"disposable\\" nature of these headphones I am still a huge fan.  I've used numerous other brands and styles and come back to these headphone every time.  I am not a fan of ear buds (they fall out!) and the ear-muff style (hot & impossible to workout in).  These are perfect!
0670022411|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The story was different and totally enthralling. I am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Very disappointing.  Used to be a Sparks fan, no longer.  It was predicatable like the last few of his novels have been, not to mention the fact that his description of the villian was like it was cut and pasted between chapters.  I wanted to scream, \\"Okay!  I got it!\\"  Capitalizing on his success but not giving us much more than his last novel.  Doubt I buy another Sparks novel.  They've become boring and cut and dry. Spend your're money elsewehere.
0786955570|5.0|Older Dungeons and Dragons fans are often pressed for time to enjoy their sword-swinging swashbuckling. And Wizards of the Coast is trying to treat them (and everyone else) to a game that requires less time, but just as much fun.<br /><br />In this game, you walk through various random tiles that spawn monsters and events using pre-built characters. You have a quest to finish (like \\"get to room X and kill the bad guy\\") and dozens of bad guys in the way.<br /><br />Each player is on the same side and has a set of skills vital to the success of the mission. The fighter might stand in front while engaging bad guys with the healing cleric while a wizard exacts utter destruction over the baddies.<br /><br />Everyone feels like they are vital to the game. Everyone has a ton of fun.<br /><br />Lastly, I should mention that the creatures generally have 1 or 2 or 3 hit points, not 40 or 80 or 200. So the math is easier and the game plays faster than standard DnD encounters.<br /><br />If you want to have some hack-n-slash fun with a board game, then get this today. You won't regret it.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This DVD is very nice and well packaged. The shipping was fast and it was at a good price too.
B000002KK2|4.0|Was glad to be able to restore pieces to my album collection after Hurricane Katrina through Amazon.com. Never ordered any thing online before. But, Amazon.com makes ordering so simple. Thanks for the sweet sounds of music and the opportunity to continue to jam down South.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Predictable.  Sleeping With The Enemy copycat, but description of the villian seems to be cut and pasted from chapter to chapter to the point where I want to scream, \\"Okay!  I got it!\\"  Sparks seems to be concentrating on quantity and not the quality he once had.  Spend your money elsewhere.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This is a WONDERFUL album.  I think that every track is good, although \\"Last Chance On A Stairway\\" would be the weakest of the lot.  For a long time, Duran Duran was dismissed as pretty boys who thrived on account of their looks, and the music was for awhile, not taken seriously.  This album is definitely their creative peak.  I like the album before this (the debut) and the album after this (Seven And The Ragged Tiger), but this one is the BEST!!  If you like heavy bass and guitar in your New Wave music, this album is for you.  A great, great sound.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a story for people who like stories. Keep in mind, even though this is a story with swords and magic, it is not a sword and sorcery novel. It's more than just a single-minded action slash and adventure. While many readers like speedy plots, this story isn't afraid to be quiet, or to take its time. So be warned. This is a heady story and features stories within stories.     Contemporary readers have become somewhat used to watching action unfold. And while there is action in this novel, readers need to know that action isn't what this book is about. It's about a character, and it's funny, introspective, and layered with history and culture.     Just don't expect sword and sorcery and non-stop action. But if you buy this novel with an open mind, and you don't mind a story that takes its time, then you should be very pleased.
0439023521|5.0|I love this book. I read the whole series in three days. My only complaint is that I read them to fast and that my friend have not read them because I just want to talk about them. What makes this a great book is the writing, the story and the characters. They are all flawed in ways no one is perfect and no one clams to be. There were times where I wanted to scream at the characters and throw it across the room but I think that is what makes this book great because you know you are going to go over a pick it up and keep reading.    Suzanne Collins has a way with words. She can make the worst possible moments and scenarios easy to digest. They are horrific at times but when is children fighting to the death ever fluffy, but they never are horribly unnerving and off putting. The way it is written makes it tangible and easily accessed. You will probably cry, laugh, scream and squeal with  joy and surprise with curve balls Collins throws at her readers. There is romance, fighting and politics, everything that makes a good book!
B0049D1TCM|5.0|Why are people hating on this album so much?  This is a GOOD album.  Yes, it's pop-y and the tracks are somewhat electronic, but c'mon people, it's 2011 and that's where music is heading.  If you're looking for a hardcore rap album, then this is not it...so sorry.  But if you're looking for a fun album, with good beats and lyrics, then this one is great.  I enjoy all the songs on here (except for Check It Out...that one is just horrendous).  Once again this is not a hardcore rap album, but it's FUN and you should enjoy it.
0670022411|5.0|I bought this book for my wife and she couldn't put it down. According to her the only thing she didn't like was the wait for the next book in the series.
1439102724|1.0|I love Jodi Picoiult and would list her as my favorite author if asked.     I am a Christian who believes gay and lesbian couples should be afforded the chance that straight couples are afforded. They should have every right to love and marry and adopt and anything else they so desire. Why then, does Ms.Picoult paint Christians out to be this ugly term? Why was Zoe so wonderful and the husband so ugly? I was so hoping she would present both sides of this debate, but atlas, she did not. Her personal agenda shown through very brightly.     If Ms. Picoult were to actually write an accurate portrayal of this debate, she would have presented the \\"Church\\" as a cult. The term Christian would never have even been uttered. Christians don't feel the way that was presented. However, haters and bigots do feel this way. Had she presented \\"the other side\\" in a cultish way instead of an Evangelical, Christian stero-type way, I believe her up until this book, loyal fans, would have remained loyal. However, I think she just set herself up for a big drop in readers.    By the way, I do know authors love when their book is discussed like this. I hope she can look past her giddiness of causing a stir and listen to the people and opinions of those who have excelled her her present status.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Awesome soundtrack, very pleased with the quality as I purchased it used. I buy 90% of my music and DVD' s used and have never been disappointed.
0446618322|5.0|So far so good.  This book has a good story line and has kept me wondering what will happen next.
1591843790|2.0|If you read a lot of books you eventually run into the same material fairly often. That's the case for me with \\"Enchantment\\". While I generally admire Guy's work, I was not enchanted with this book.<br /><br />It is extremely basic stuff. Smile, firm handshake, don't dress like a slob---enchanting? Steve McQueen and his wife are returning to LA from Las Vegas by car and she needs to relieve herself. There's a line at the gas station restroom so she tells the gals in line that there's a movie star out front---the crowd runs to see the stars and she takes a leak. That's an example of creating a win-win situation. Well, next time I need to pee I hope there is a celebrity I can use nearby.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother recapping the story about the TV producer who repeats that she just liked Howard Stern about a zillion times. (Puke)<br /><br />Frankly, by mid way I had to resolve reading this book on an empty stomach. I find celeb stories dull and somewhat grating. Hell yes, if you're Bill Gates you'll be enchanting no matter what the hell you do. BTW, swearing is encouraged but must be used properly. (Bill Gates is my example)<br /><br />Unless you can see the turnip truck that just dropped you off pulling away, skip this one.<br /><br />Chris Reich<br />(2 stars because the design is very good though the content is \\"see Flip run\\" basic.)

B0042RJWTC|5.0|I am happy that I bought the Tudors Complete Series DVD, as the production was thoroughly engrossing and too frustrating to watch a single episode at a time, week by week, on television. With the entire set, I enjoyed being able to watch several episodes at one sitting, which helped keep track of events. The actors were fabulous, and the changes of scenery and costumes made this production of the Tudors a pleasure to watch. I can only hope that the producers of the Tudors will continue the story with Henry the 8th daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.
1599218011|4.0|I like this book, but wanted to warn others about the Kindle version-you can't read it.  I was really excited to get this book and ordered the Kindle version because Amazon was sold out of the book.  I had to return it because the charts and list in the book were so small you could not read.  Really disappointed that Amazon would sell this product on Kindle when it is not readable!  If you thinking of ordering stay away from kindle version.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Having read the first two book in the \\"Millenium\\" series, I expected this to be worth reading, and I was not disappointed.  I struggled to get into this one as quickly as the first two as there was a lot of political history to wade through. Even that became more readable as I began to come to grips with it.<br />One of those books that I was sorry it came to an end!
0451163540|4.0|Well-paced thriller does a good job explicating the various plot threads. A certain lack of plausibility at times, but the book holds one's attention.
B000V698DI|4.0|Nirvana destroyed kurt k's life is some ways , and in some ways it helped to make metal one of the most unpopular forms of music on the planet. The reason wasn't nirvana's fault , they just wanted to make their own kind of metal which was fine.  and this is a good type of metal, The disaster occured when this was put up as the ONLY good type of metal , noone could have withstood that tag. metal should have been seen as a varied thing, instead we got now it's grunge or nothing. which was the start of the fall of metal, previously metal was a openarmed affair with all sorts of it accepted as valid from melodic , to pop metal to thrash you name it.  then the pinheads touted this as the answer, not only as the answer to metal but also a social answer! (heroin ethos?)  and that was a death sentence for metal. I like this cd , it's good alt metal but it's no better than other types of metal and it wasn't the answer. In fact after this all other types of metal were squashed , grunge lasted a few years and then we were in a situation of now it must be very hard or thrashy or nothing, this effectively destroyed the wideopenness that metal had been, killed off the format to most of the world and then laid waste to listenership completely. bad radio stations like colorado spring's kilo helped this disaster and bear the blame as well. why?, that was the station that for a while set the standard. So this should have been seen as a decent metal cd of it's own brand and put up alongside the many other types of metal including what was popular at the time, instead it was the answer to the end of a genres popularity in the long run. Still metal fans should enjoy this one because it's a good metal cd. with decent to great alt metal songs and that's all it ever really was , and that's why k.c. labeled with a messiah tag was doomed as eventually metal itself was in some respects ,doomed to be a shell of itself with little variety and little melody or listeners.

And when it is over I play it again. The dog days are over.  Five stars are not enough.  Do not miss this one!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|There is no way for me to review the 25th anniversary concert without comparing it to the 10th. While the overall production, video, and sound is spectacular, the vocals are just a bit less impressive. Though all the singers do a fine job, with the exception of Nick Jonas, who is just not up to calliber with the rest of the performers, they just can't compare to Colm Wilkinson, Phillip Quast, Lea Salonga, etc. The one vocal that I did think was an improvment was Katie Hall as Cosette. One thing I did like about the 25th anniversary over the 10th was the inclusion of more of the smaller scenes, like when Marius and Cosette meet on the streets of Paris, and when Marius sends Eponine with the letter. Overall any Les Miserables fan would enjoy this show.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|George Clooney certainly gives this movie his all and that is what makes it good but, for me, not great. This is a work of redemption.  Not total redemption but some redemption.  And I don't know if I even believe in partial redemption for someone this dark, which is why it is not great.<br /><br />In the first ten minutes he kills people trying to kill him, which is fine.  However, he also, without any hesitation, kills someone else, someone personal.  He then has to go on the lam in Italy.  He does many things in Italy and obviously he is waiting for bad things to happen all of the time.  Since he is an assassin, he expects another assassin every time a car backfires or he sees another person even owning a gun. (The Italians do not seem shy about gun ownership in this small town so that isn't hard.)<br /><br />Can he in any way turn his life around or is it too late?  Can we exceed that last redemption point?  These are interesting questions and that is what the movie addresses.  It is NOT a thriller.  It is a very cerebral movie and it verges on being slow in its pacing as a result.  If you are looking for a night's entertainment after an exhausting day, this film is not it.  In fact, this reminds me more of a foreign film but with an American film star in the lead.  If you love that kind of movie, then go ahead and watch this film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00368Q3UY|5.0|Very impressive speaker with intriguing design. What I received from package was a USB cable for charging and transferring files to the sd card, a nice looking blue earphone, a pouch for carrying, and the speaker itself along with the sd card already inserted inside.    PRO:  -The micro sd card included works well also. No problem arises there.   -The sound quality is quite crisp for its size. The loudness is immense.   -The blue earphone that came with it has surprisingly nice sound quality. Earphones came with the main product in general usually has crappy sound quality. But this one really sounds very clear. The only thing missing in it is some bass, but who am I to complain with something free and awesome like that?  -Battery life is definitely an attraction on the Happy. I let it on at full charge with decent volume level that can fill the room. Without turning it off, I received a kick-a$$ 12.5 hours of continuous playback. It's difficult to tell what the volume level was but I'd have to guess at about 1/3 full volume. Of course it would drain more power if it sets at higher volume.    CON:  I think this could be a flaw in the Happy since other reviews have also mentioned this. When I turn it on, the Happy immediately plays the song at MAX volume. This can be very obnoxious and disruptive to other people if you're in a quiet place. Even so, I have found a very simple tricks that might help against this annoyance:    -First, you notice when you turn it on, the LED indicator is immediately turned purple(this means it's at full power or enough power to play) for a second or two. Then it quickly turns to red for about 3sec before the red is blinking. The moment the red is blinking it starts to play at max volume. And this is what I suggest if you dont want to experience the full volume at the start: When the LED turns to red, quickly press the mute button before it has the chance to blink. Turn the volume down by holding it for about 7sec. before letting go. Thenyou can press the mute again to hear where you're at.    Besides the max volume blast at the start, it doesn't seem to have any other flaw.    I also have the x-mini II speaker and the Happy can extend upward more, so maybe more bass than the x-mini II? Cant really tell the difference but it should add a bit more bass nonetheless.
B004NFB4EO|5.0|There's no doubt about it, the woman can make great songs.  I LOVE this song!  I have listened to this song at least a dozen times, it's awesome.  I love the tune.  Furthermore, I love the way she very skillfully writes rhyming lyrics to match it.  Just awesome.    Lady Gaga's past accomplishments show why she has been able to rise from a virtual unknown less than 4 years ago to the most famous female musical artist in the world.  Telephone and Born this Way are thus far her best songs.  In the 80's, Jackson's Thriller was the best video ever made.  Then Rihanna's Umbrella and Shut up and Drive became the best videos.  Now Lady Gaga has surpassed them both:  Bad Romance IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER MADE.    Well done Lady Gaga.      ===============================  Technical stats of this MP3:  256 kbps*  44100 Hz  (true) Stereo**  Size:  8.1 MB (8,501,044)  ===============================    *I am glad Amazon is selling this as a true, full, 256 kbps bit rate.  Anything lower would have reduced the quality.  **I am also glad Amazon is not selling this song in the Joint Stereo format.  JS has problems with the midrange frequency.  Namely, there's too much of them.  It would have totally destroyed the song.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Avril is back and with an album that is a departure from her past albums, but more reminiscent of Under My Skin. For any fan who has respected and loved Avril since the beginning, this is sure to not disappoint. Avril needs to be commended for sticking to her guns and making the album that she wanted to, not what her record label wanted (like the techno pop sound that is currently popular). This album might not give Avril the chart positions and commercial success as the others, but it's full of beautiful, raw, emotional songs, and makes for a great listening experience. Wish You Were Here, Smile, and I Love You are the stand out tracks.
0316044695|5.0|This book is so well-written that it reads like a novel. Mr. Luttrel does an amazing job of describing the rigorous training required before someone can become a Navy SEAL. Just knowing that we have special forces who possess the skills that this elite group does made me so proud of our country and our military. The book is very balanced as far as describing the training experience and the incident that occurred in Afghanistan, costing the lives of his comrades and the additional lives of the SEALs and Army personnel who responded to the urgent call for help sent out by the team leader. Mr. Luttrell gives a vivid description of how the four-man team dropped into the country, acccomplished their mission, and were well on their way to the pick-up point when they encountered a couple of \\"goat-herders\\". Not being able to discern whether these goat-herders were \\"friendlies\\" or not, the four of them voted as to whether they should kill them or not. The moral dilemna facing them resulted in the decision to do what was \\"right\\" and let them go. Unfortunately, these men were not friendlies and immediately rounded up insurgents to seek and kill the Americans. The trials that the group of SEALs endured were superheroic, and Marcus's survival was a miracle. I majored in history, taught it, and still study it, so I read many war books, and I have to say that this book is one of the very best ones I have read on any war. Marcus Luttrell is an incredible human being, dedicated to his country and to his comrades. He is so thorough in relating the events of the nightmare that he endured that he makes sure to credit the tribal chief and the villagers who saved his life by prohibiting the Taliban from harming him by pointing out to them that they would not allow them to violate the true laws of the Muslim people. This book is an eye-opener in so many ways; it shows the rigorous training and testing required to become a SEAL, the dedication, loyalty, and brotherhood of this elite fighting force, and shows that not all Muslims are anti-American, but truly live by real Muslim laws which require that once a village takes a stranger in, he becomes their responsiblity to nurture and protect. If this book was a movie, it would be one where everyone would be sitting on the edge of his seat. This story is incredible in every possible way and is so well-written that it is as difficult for the reader to put down as a mystery/thriller.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The bluray included in this set had such amazing quality - in the beginning when you see a bird's eye view of the scenery it is so crisp and colorful, it made me want to go to  Austria.  It was beautifully restored and impressive to watch. We will use the dvd on road trips in the car.     I don't normally view the bonus material on dvd/blurays, but this time I did. My kids wanted to know about the Von Trapps,  the war and the family and songs - everything.  Some of the bonus menu is different- you get a view of a room in the Von Trapp House (but a graphical representation of it) and can click on different items to learn about different topics. It wasn't exactly straight forward to navigate, but once you clicked on the item, it was fine. I thoroughly enjoyed the background story of the Von Trapps and the restoration of the film.    I'm not sure what it is about this movie, but children always seem to love it. The songs are infectious and my daughters run around the house singing songs from this movie for weeks after watcing it. It was really fun to watch together.

B0049GYXDG|5.0|I'll keep this short as everyone knows how good this Disney Classic is.     The transfer onto Blu Ray is nothing short of fantastic! The colours, vibrancy and clarity are all there making it a treat to watch. The audio track is also amazing, its like watching this movie all over again with everything combined. The disc itself is Region A, B & C, in case you're purchasing from overseas, a gamble which I took.    In short, it's a must buy for any Disney fan.
B0012GMVG2|5.0|When I purchased Toto IV I was impressed with the studio recording right from the start. Excellent sound and mixing. The song selection is truly impeccable. Toto is a tight band that I enjoy listening to quite frequently. Anyone who likes Toto will definitely enjoy this CD!
B000BNI90O|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing. I am so thrilled to have it. I can't believe I waited this long to get it. Howard Shore is an amazing composer. I can see the whole movie listening to the CD. The whole soundtrack is worth every dollar if you are a Tolkien fan.
B00337KM2S|5.0|In a time when our world changing far too quickly, there is always a film that comes along to define the sign of the times. This time George Clooney takes us into the mind of a man who just flat out hates being around people and involved with their lives. Guess what he does for a living? He has to fire people from their jobs and connect with them in order to motivate them to find a new opportunity.  So now what do you do when your line of work is telling you have to stop avoiding all connections and stay grounded? That is what the film `Up In The Air' is all about.<br /><br />I knew that there was a huge buzz about this movie and I have to say I got a lot more than I expected out of this movie. First of all the cast is crazy amazing. Everyone from Clooney to Kendrick plays their roles unbelievably well. Anna Kendrick was of course my favorite, just because I was in her exact position not too long ago. I remember learning the tricks of the trade in my line of work and traveling to sit down with prospects. I remember sitting in a car almost crying because I found the job to be too much or just wondering if I was going to able to do this on my own for a living. What I loved about the film the most was how it depicted how distant we are becoming as a creature. How we break up with our significant others over a text message or that we can't sit face to face in the room with someone when we have to give them negative news. It shows that it turns us into soulless and spineless people. Whether you would agree with my views or not...that was what I got out of this film. Understand that this film can depress you at points, but it is a comedy and it has some great laughable moments and yes you do get a nice ending.<br /><br />This is a movie that I recommend you see at least once, because it just a story about ordinary people trying to live the lives they want to live. That is something we as individuals do every day. The question is what makes you stand out amongst the others.
0553062182|3.0|I got this book based on other's reviews that were generally good. This book describes HSPs and what could be expected with pep talks about how u shouldn't be worried that u are HSP. If u had thought about this issue (HSP issue) the book does not add any value but just tries to re-assure u that nothing is wrong with u. might be helpful for people that are really hurting but not for people who need more depth into this issue.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|What I Can Tell You:<br />Wow! I really wanted to see this movie when it was in the theatre. First, I am a huge James Franco fan. I love him and find him fascinating. Knowing this was a true story made it more interesting.<br />The screening took place yesterday and included me, Clary and Lor.<br /><br />If you don't know the story, Aron is a cave jumper who heads out to Blue John Canyon alone. He tells no one where he is headed, meets two female travelers, spends some time taking pictures and video with them and sends them on their way. While passing over a canyon, a rock suddenly gives way and together he and rock fall between on of the narrow canyons, his hand and wrist pinned against the rock and the wall.<br /><br />Trying to survive while running out of water, food in desperate conditions, Aron's only friend is his video camera that he uses to document, entertain and leave goodbye messages on.<br /><br />There was a lot of gasping, hand over mouth moments and Clary was at one point sitting on the edge of her chair with a straight back.<br /><br />There were some comparissions to Castaway with Tom Hanks without Wilson the soccer ball. We all loved it, in fact Clary asked me to leave it at her house so she can watch it with her husband.<br /><br />Yesterday I posted on Facebook about the movie being soooo good and how amazing James Franco was.<br /><br />Here are the comments on that post:<br /><br />Lauri  - Ditto!!! His acting was so real and it was definitely a thrilling movie.<br /><br />Maria  - Seriously! Very tense and it takes a great actor to carry a movie alone while keeping you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Lyn  - Daniel saw that movie last weekend. I asked if he was feeling sick when the guy cut his arm off, he said only when there was a long stringy bit... ewwwww lol<br /><br />Maria - Yes!!! That made my girlfriends squirm a bit.<br /><br />Clarissa - Great movie. Very suspenseful!<br /><br />The girls and I joked that we would have been dead in less than 24 hours if we were Aron.<br /><br />It takes an amazing actor to carry almost an entire movie by themself. James Franco's portrayal of an injured, parched, hungry, resourceful, Aron made me thirsty. I longed for a huge class of water. Franco looked like he spent 3 days in that cave. It is no wonder he was nominated for Best Actor.e movie by themself. James Franco's portrayal of an injured, parched, hungry, resourceful, Aron made me thirsty. I longed for a huge class of water.

0307272702|5.0|This is THE best researched book on the science of nutrition written for a general audience to date.  It literally changed my life.  Ten years on Weight Watchers, years of exercise, and I couldn't understand WHY I wasn't leaner.  Well, I am LEANER now, two months after finishing this book.  And, I will never, ever go back to my previous low fat diet (and the cravings and deprivation).  The science presented by Taubes is just too compelling.  If you are the kind of person who requires empirical, fact-based evidence in order to make informed decisions, then this book is for you.  If you believe in benign FDA bureaucrats, Dr. Oz, or unicorns, then not so much.
0670022411|4.0|I have read many books about witches, vampires, etc. Some are more romance, others historical, while others are horrific. This book mostly focuses on the history and romantic elements, with a bit of the horror. This book is dense, almost 600 pages, with a great amount of detail. I like detail so I found the information helpful and satisfying. Other readers who don't like great amounts of small facts may not like it as much. It was slow at first, given that I knew I could not just pick it up and put it down easily. Around page 200 I had a hard time putting it down at all and plowed through the rest of the book, staying up a little late a few nights!!<br /><br />Dinah, the main character is a strong woman who has lost her way. This first book seems to about her discovering her talents, strengths, and purpose in life. Matthew, her romantic interest and a vampire, has a greater sense and knowledge of his overall purpose, but falling in love with Diana has created problems for him. The book is full of interesting side characters who each fall into some stereotypes, in order to move the story along. Their champions however, have storylines with backgrounds to explain their opinions and prejudices.<br /><br />I like how the author infuses acceptance into the plot with more than the vampire/witch/daemon integration. There are gay characters and possibly others who are also marginalized, though they are not emphasized as much. This first book sets up the reader nicely for book two in the trilogy. Another element I liked is how the author introduced facts in history and alchemy. Sometimes authors present it in a way that feels false; I did not feel 'dumbed down' with facts I did not already know.<br /><br />If you want to read other books with similar concepts but are not as long - try Nora Roberts Circle Trilogy or Mindy Klasky's Girl's Guide to Witchcraft. The former has many elements similar to this book, with vampires, witches, daemons, etc. looking to stop an evil vampire named Lilith. The latter book is a trilogy about a witch who like Diana, is very powerful yet uneducated about her abilities. For heavy historian fans, check out Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.<br /><br />I am excited for the next book and hope it comes out sooner then next April. The book received 4 stars and not 5 because it is a bit longer than necessary-even with my preferance for detail. It took a while to get into the story and at times, Diana and Matthew's relationship was forced while they found their rhythm.tter book is a trilogy about a witch who like Diana, is very powerful yet uneducated about her abilities.

B004H2ZFPW|2.0|I like Avril's music, and I'm not her typical demographic. When I heard her new album dropped this week, I picked it up. It's a decent effort, and I liked the song \\"What the Hell\\" which I had previously seen on YouTube. However, as a parent of two younger kids, I try to respect their innocence and do NOT bring home any discs with explicit lyrics on them. It's not hard, most artists don't feel like they have to resort to foul language to make a point, and even if they do, their disc will have a parental advisory sticker on it. This one does not. It should.     If that makes a difference, you may want to consider something else. If you're okay with the lyrics, it's a good disc.
0920668372|5.0|A friend told me about the book.  I decided to purchase it to read to my little one.  At the time I didn't know if I was having a boy or a girl (turns out I am having a girl), but the book is wonderful.  I plan to read it to her once she's born.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|Teenage girl + sexy brooding might-be-a-monster + forbidden romance = dear Lord, it's a [[ASIN:B003ZKBELG Twilight]] knockoff.<br /><br />And let's not delude ourselves that \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is anything but that. Catherine Hardwicke (director of the first [[ASIN:B003ZKBELG Twilight]] film) runs over very familiar territory in this disastrously dull, tepidly acted borefest, which seems to just be an excuse to show us yet more gel-haired, pouting teenagers longing after each other. It's even duller than it sounds.<br /><br />Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in a small village in... somewhere where they sacrifice livestock to a giant ravenous wolf. It's not explained very well. She is planning to escape an arranged marriage to the staggeringly dull Henry (Max Irons) by eloping with her staggeringly dull Edward-Cullen-haired lover Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). You know, standard love triangle stuff.<br /><br />But then the wolf comes to the town and starts killing people, including Valerie's sister. According to wolf-hunter (Gary Oldman), it's not a wolf but a werewolf. Even worse, the werewolf has some kind of connection to Valerie -- meaning that it's probably someone she loves. So who is the werewolf, and does anyone in the audience actually care?<br /><br />Don't worry, Team Jacob -- \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is all about the hot maybe-werewolf guy taking center stage. Catherine Hardwicke tosses aside the possibilities of a \\"dark\\" psychosexual retelling of a fairy tale, mainly so she can try to reel in all the screeching hormone-addled tweenagers who rushed to see her last gothic romance.<br /><br />The problem is, \\"Twilight\\" was boring. And \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is even duller.  The only competent part of the story is the plot twist involving the werewolf.<br /><br />The rest of the time we're treated to pallid romantic melodrama is almost as bloodless as the CGI wolf attacks. The dialogue is ghastly (\\"It is time to put on your HARLOT'S ROBES!\\"), and the there are some staggeringly weird scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story, such as a giant metal ELEPHANT, or the medieval rave. Then again, the picturesque village looks like the love child of a RenFaire and a Medieval Times restaurant, so maybe the rave isn't too surprising.<br /><br />I'll admit it: Seyfried's clear face and big wide eyes are perfect (in theory), but Hardwicke seems less interested in having her act than in having her pose dramatically as if she's in a magazine shoot. Her two paramours are so dull that they're virtually interchangeable, except for Fernandez's gelled-up hair.<br /><br />And Gary Oldman is so hammy you could put him between two slices of rye -- his \\"evil inquisitor\\" role is so over-the-top that I kept expecting him to poke Seyfried with the soft cushions and scream, \\"Confess! Confess! CONFESS!\\"<br /><br />\\"Red Riding Hood\\" is basically Hardwicke's attempt to snag \\"Twilight's\\" teenybopper fanbase, but she only succeeds in making a movie even more passionless and dull than that one.he story, such as a giant metal ELEPHANT, or the medieval rave.

1932907009|3.0|As promised, this is an easy-to-read, to-the-point book of screenwriting advice. It is by no means the LAST book on screenwriting one will need, but it offers a non-academic, writer-to-writer perspective on the nuts and bolts of writing a screenplay--in particular, a GOOD screenplay that will be bought.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's the sole goal presented by Snyder: sell it. He does offer detailed directions and convenient schematics to help you write a screenplay that no one will laugh at, that doesn't suffer from the plot and character problems that plague American cinema, and he does so to help you have your screenplay sold and produced. In general, this is helpful, and his rules and lists, signs of a huge film buff, are entertaining and enlightening. But the arrogance with which he presents these \\"rules\\" (his main purpose in writing the book, he admits, is to take credit for these golden laws), his tendency to assume his reader shares all his movie preferences, and his misspelling of actor's and director's names all severely hurt his credibility as both a writer and a mentor.<br /><br />In the process of delineating good screenplays from bad ones, or explaining storytelling techniques, he arbitrarily assigns value to his movie examples depending on his current case. In one chapter, \\"good\\" means the movie follows his rules, \\"bad\\" means it doesn't--whether or not the movie was critically well-received. In the next, \\"good\\" means critically well-received, and \\"bad\\" means crappy writing that happened to do well at the box office. Often, his otherwise solid advice drowns in these discussions, and we finish a chapter with Snyder picking a fight with his reader while encouraging them to finish the book before they begin writing. (?!)<br /><br />Also disturbing is that Snyder equates box office success to artistic success, then trashes box office hits for their writing problems. He scoffs at unconventional storytelling (his seething hatred for \\"Memento\\" practically burns the page) and primarily uses comedies as examples, while dismissing films that focus on character or are plot-heavy (I'd like to see him try to explain \\"Inception's\\" success despite it breaking all his rules!).<br /><br />One imagines that Snyder has created a list of movies he likes, and movies he doesn't like, and expects all intelligent moviegoers and screenwriters have those same lists. And one has to wonder if his goal is really to help you write your screenplay, or to convert you to his approach to movies and screenwriting. Either way, his jealousy of more skilled screenwriters and his disdain for any movie made for the sake of art, not money, is both apparent and off-putting. I would rather read a screenwriting book that assumed its readers wanted to make money AND art, to have box office success AND awards. Or at least present the challenges to screenwriting in a way that didn't favor comedy writers, or help churn out more of the same crap that pollutes cinema. Mr. Snyder, you seem interested in sparing us from crappy movies...maybe in your next edition you should encourage a little more rule-breaking. That way lies real cinematic art.rily uses comedies as examples, while dismissing films that focus on character or are plot-heavy (I'd like to see him try to explain \\"Inception's\\" success despite it breaking all his rules!).

0316017922|4.0|You have read the stories about successful people - now it is time to read the story of success.    out-li-er \noun  1: something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body  2: a statistical observance that is markedly different in value from others is the sample      A year after publication Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers was still on dozens of best seller lists. Every airport book kiosk travelers passed by over the Thanksgiving holiday held Outliers and I suspect the same will be true for Christmas travelers as well. What is it about the story of success that has everyone \\"wanting to know?\\"      Perhaps our obsession with books about successful people is that we hope by reading their stories, some of their success will some how rub off on us. Self made millionaires - we want to be one. An overnight success, we dream of the possibilities.

The hypothesis of Outliers is contrary to every overnight success fantasy you have ever heard or hoped for. For Gladwell there are no self made men or women and no one pulls themselves up by their own bootstraps, not just because it's a physical impossibility but because success is a group endeavor.    Beginning with hockey stars in Canada and ending with the very personal story of his grandmother Daisy in Jamaica, Gladwell takes us literally around the world and through time looking at success stories.  In between these you will enjoy his foray into the lives of Microsoft mogul Bill Gates and the heart throbs of the 60s - The Beatles. The things that hold these stories together are the circumstances and contributions of the people around the outliers (the successes); they were in the right place at the right time with the support of the right people.    When I first read Outliers I was disturbed at the notion that success is so utterly dependent upon community and circumstance.  I have always believed the \\"it takes a village to raise a child\\" concept, but still at heart I wanted to believe that someone completely disadvantaged by circumstance and birth could change their fortunes.  Gladwell completely destroys this myth so you may wonder why the book is still so successful.  People don't like having their hopes and dreams dashed, unless, that is, they are replaced with something better.  Gladwell does give us something better.  In an interview about the book he contends, \\"When outliers become outliers it is not just because of their own efforts. It's because of the contributions of lots of different people and lots of different circumstances-- and that means that we, as a society, have more control about who succeeds--and how many of us succeed--than we think. That's an amazingly hopeful and uplifting idea.\\"  We as a society can control how we enable more people to succeed!  The most astonishing example of this in the book is the chapter about airplane crashes caused by culture. Yes, you read that right - but to find how they got that information from the black boxes you'll have to read the book! When the cultural problem was identified the corporations went to work retraining key people to act differently. It was expensive work.  It met with heavy resistance, but it saved lives.  Is that more hopeful than a dream about bootstraps?  This book reviewer says, \\"Yes!\\"
0060763280|5.0|I highly recommend this book. The author is direct to the point. The book is easy to read, very practical and sometimes funny.  I was never bored while reading it.  It will make you aware of the thoughts you have that's holding you back from getting successful and wealthy.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Bought for my wife and I to use as we are up at different times and she doesn't care to hear machine gun fire. Very easy to hook up and I already had an external speaker for our tv as we bought our LCD 2 years ago and didn't come with the best speakers; so I put the speaker pick ups on the audio out on the tv so that I can have the tv volume at zero and still hear through the headphones or my good speaker.    I really appreciate the chat volume feature as I love playing online but hate the lexicon of online play and now I can just mute them and enjoy playing against non-computer opponents. Noticed a lot of sounds in games that I have never heard before even though I have been playing the games for months. The sound is lacking some fullness but for the price it is great.     Very pleased with design and functionality.  Also I am a bass players so the lack of fullness maybe a purely personal opinion.    Also works with almost anything you can think to plug them into.    Highly recommended.
0307454541|4.0|This book starts slow but picks up after all the characters are recognized.  Pay attention because there are so many people to place and figure out.  I can see how the english could be difficult for some because of the dialect but you also get used to this.  Once the book starting picking up I couldn't put it down and ended up with some almost sleepless nights.  Good addition to anyones library.
0393338827|2.0|Could have done without this book.  It's the story of a fair amount of ignorance, malfeasance, negligence, and outright fraud on Wall Street in conjunction with a massive market meltdown.  The basic contours of the story are probably well enough understood by most from reading papers and magazines; only if you are interested in breathless descriptions of Wall Street heroes (and anti-heroes) operating on the basis of naked greed in a world of inside-baseball finance would you find this book exciting.  Yes, the subprime fiasco reached all the way through the fabric of American society, but reading about every little move these little wizzes made does not help to derive any greater moral from the story than we already have.  To his credit, the author does recognize repeatedly what a con job this was as to ordinary Americans.  Otherwise, this is plain old business history for a select group of folks.  Most galling was the author's riff on how second-rate the ratings company guys were - cheap ties, cheap suits, look like bureaucrats, make only \\"high five figures\\", etcetera.  You can probably do without this book unless you are either a complete insider, or totally ignorant as to what happened in the meltdown.  For the rest of us, your conclusions about the subprime crisis probably won't be improved (either way) by this book.
0756404738|3.0|To understand this review, know that Name of the Wind (book one in this story) is one of my top 3 books of all time, along side George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Tolkien is a pulp hack beside these works. The two parts from Name of the Wind where (spoiler alert for Name of the Wind:) Kvothe saved the girl from flames in the fishery and played the lute minus a string to earn his pipes will stick with me for decades.(end of spoiler) THIS BOOK, HOWEVER, has NO SUCH SCENES. It is 1000 pages akin to a shallow pool. Just when a certain story begins to take shape and become interesting, he ends it and moves on to another point in Kvothe's life. The writing is as strong as the first book, it's just that the stories are disjointed and brief. The only thing connecting them is that they are all Kvothe's past experiences. If you've ever read a collection of short stories, you'll know the feeling. You can't tell a 5-star story in 25-pages. Jamming twenty decent ministories together in a single book cannot make it somehow collectively better. This book should have been 3 or 4 separate books each giving time to create the richness I appreciated before. A 5-star story makes a grown man laugh and cry when he reads it. It's not a bad book, but it's light-years away from the first one. The disappointment factor alone is worth the loss of a star. As far as the ending, the only way I could tell the book was done was because there were no more pages to turn. It stunk. No cliffhanger, no real closure, no unification of the disjointed stories, squat. Just some kind of weak acknowledgement that he has to stop this trainwreck at some point. It might be some kind of foundation for the next book... not really to be enjoyed itself. Only time will tell I suppose. Is it worth the price and a good read? Yes. Will it satisfy your appetite for more Name of the Wind? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Should you just put it in your queue for two years till the next one comes out? I would.

B003UTUQ3E|5.0|Stationtostation stands alone as Bowie's remarkable coke-frenzied masterpiece.  Finally it has been given the remastering treatment.  The Nassau Coliseum concert from the time period has been widely bootlegged, but its inclusion here is a welcome surprise.  I'm probably in the minority in not thinking The Tower Philadelphia show documented in David Live is David Dead (love it) but Nassau will make you believe in live Bowie.  Great package and booklet, too.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|i've always loved the Rock. we watched him constantly during his days in the ring and enjoyed him so much. and couldn't have enjoyed this movie more. one of the things about this movie that was wonderful was it had a clean spare look to it without feeling stripped down, like a cheap budget movie would.     the driving scenes were incredible and the rock always looks great. love him, keep em coming.   and yes, he is b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l.     makes them little whoosie hollywood boys look real bad and like the pansies they are.

B0034G4ORC|3.0|Movie opens with a platoon of marines out of Camp Pendleton flying into the heat of battle over LA as the alien invasion takes shape.  A flashback of twenty-four hours gives you the backstories on most of the featured characters right up until the action starts.  The aliens quickly take the coastlines and move inland quickly.  The decision is made to draw a line inland and use fighter planes to bomb out the alien ground troops, believing they lack airpower.  Staff Sgt. Nantz (Aaron Eckhardt) leads his unit into the bombed out streets of the city to rescue civilians holed up in a police station before the strafing begins.  But the aliens soon reveal their aerial strength, negating the military's advantage and hastening the takeover of the city.  Their numbers down, Nantz must both protect the civilians and reach a safe point before they're overcome by the invaders.  In the midst of a last ditch evacuation, Nantz discovers the location of the alien's command center and leads his team in a desperate strike to cripple their forces.<br /><br />As far as the action goes- Note to Hollywood: get rid of that 'Shaky-Cam' garbage!  What's the point of a battle when you can't even tell what the hell's happening?  (Ok, they're shooting- wait, what was that?  Who got hit?  Where'd those come from... and how did he get killed?)  It's not edgy, it's not gritty and it's not dramatic- it's a stupid gimmick to fudge a fight scene... and it doesn't even do that anymore.  Xbox has clearer shootouts than this.  There's lots of bodies, bullets and things that get blowed up good- everything you want in an alien invasion/war movie.  Problem is they also drown out the dialog- half the time you can't even hear what they're saying over the gunfire and whatnot.  But the images of LA burning look pretty good, especially at night, and give a great sense of the grimness of the situation.<br /><br />The script gets pretty silly at times, even for an action flick.  Much was made of the whole 'aliens have been spying upon us for decades' plot, but it never materializes.  They land and they kill, with barely a handwave as to why (we got water, lots of water).  The bulk of the movie centers upon the platoon's street engagements with the aliens as they struggle to reach the safe haven of the base. But whether you've served in the military or just seen a whole bunch of movies, there's some things that don't require both hands and a map to figure out: Why would you think the aliens don't have airpower when they just landed from outer space?  Hey guys- where would you put a command center to protect it if you were invading- underground, you say?  Wow.  Dude- how do we take out the Enemy Command Ship?  By firing only one missile at a time instead of unloading everything we got on that sucker so we can milk this a little longer?  Riiight.<br /><br />Characters are straight out of the cereal box, with only a few brief deviations.  You'd think for all the time spent building them up at the beginning you might get some- nope.  The moments that are supposed to tug at your heart strings and inspire you a little, don't.  With a nearly full house there were no cheers, jeers or anything.  Plus you can pretty much tell which ones have the red-shirts on.<br /><br />'Battle: LA' is nothing if not earnest, but you won't be too impressed by any of it.  But it's good for tossing down some popcorn and jujubees.spying upon us for decades' plot, but it never materializes.

B000784WMW|4.0|Who'da thunk it?  Timothy Dalton is an absolutely superb Rochester!<br /><br />I've seen about five different versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\" and except for Orson Welles (nobody will ever surpass him in that role, and the Welles-Fontaine movie positively butchered the book), Dalton is far and away the best Rochester I have seen to date.  Brooding, sensitive, temperamental, passionate -- he brought the whole role to life.  When I re-read \\"Jane Eyre\\" (and I've only re-read it umpteen-zillion times and counting), I see Dalton as Rochester.  He and Welles share ownership of this part.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke makes a very effective Jane, and the rest of the cast does a creditable job, but this movie belongs to Timothy Dalton.  It's also, for Bronte purists, one of the versions that sticks closest to the original story.  The one jarring note for this reviewer was the young actress who played Jane in childhood.  Young Jane was supposed to be small and thin but this young lady, although she is a fairly good actress, looked like she could go up against Mia Hamm in a soccer match and give her a run for her money.<br /><br />However, this is a minor cavil.  The movie is a fine adaptation of Bronte's best-loved book.  Even if you're not into Bronte, see it for Dalton.<br /><br />Judy Lind
B004C4IKCU|5.0|Like \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" \\"Onstage,\\" \\"Elvis Country\\" and a handful of others, this is, indeed, one the King's best.  Which is merely restating what has already been said by dozens of others.  The only important thing to add is that Bill Holdship (who actually worked as a music critic, for \\"Creem\\", for a short while), dropped the ball in summing up the album.  No hits?  \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\" was a number one hit for Elvis -- it stayed in that postion on \\"Billboard\\" for six weeks!  Not to mention, \\"Stuck on You,\\" \\"It's Now or Never,\\" and \\"Surrender,\\" all number one hits.  And while \\"Reconsider Baby\\" is, indeed, one of the King's bluesiest (although \\"Mess of Blues\\" ain't bad either), he actually managed to return to blues form with an extended version of \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" (not on this album) that has to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />The second disc in this extended version of the classic \\"Elvis is Back!\\" reissue, includes tracks that were either included on a couple of so-so releases after this album or merely released as singles or EPs (they used to do that waaay back when).<br />\\"Good Luck Charm\\" is the only number one hit on this disc, but that doesn't dampen the thrill of numbers like \\"Little Sister\\", (\\"Marie's the Name of)His Latest Flame\\", \\"I Slipped, I Stumbled I Fell\\", and \\"Feel So Bad\\" (yet another jamming, bluesy piece of music that proves Elvis himselvis had it in his blood).  Too bad whoever put the disc together didn't think to include tracks like \\"Return to Sender\\" (which was relegated to movie album status back in the day) and a cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Memphis, Tennesse\\" that reveals Presley's genius at musical arrangement (Johnny Rivers liked the demo tape of \\"Memphis...\\" that Elvis shared with him so much that he stole the arrangment -- with it's absolutely rocking N rollicking, double drum intro -- and had a top ten hit before Presley could release his cut). All-in-all: a five Star classic, and a must for any true music lover!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I'm not going to make this a complicated, detailed review in the interest of time. Suffice it to say, the pen does exactly what I was told it would do. Also, it impresses the heck out of fellow nerds, and causes nerd-envy. You've been warned.
0312370830|1.0|I was unfortunately stuck on a six hour flight with nothing but this book for entertainment. It was a special kind of purgatory.     First of all, the prose was terrible. This writer. Seems to. Think. That everything should be either a fragment or a simple sentence. For. Emphasis and effect.    ..and she also feels the need to inform the (no doubt dense) reader very explicitly when important moments in the book happen. Such as the following: \\"It was a beautiful, magical moment.\\"     The terrible prose aside, the characters are one dimensional and the plot relies on overstated melodrama to try to achieve an emotional effect.     WORST book I've read in a long time - awful waste of time!
B004I2K4E8|4.0|I love this musical. I have waited for years after wearing down my VHS tape of the 10th anniversary for a better release and when I saw this Blu-ray I didn't think twice and bought it. What an unpleasent surprise was to realize a Jonas Brother was singing the role of Marius. Sorry but this singer doesn't belong here. His voice was simply too weak, forced and the poor guy sticks out like a sore thumb. Having said that, Valjean and Javert were absolutely dreamlike. Lea Salonga did a great Fantine proving was more that she has a gifted, marvellous voice. Still miss her Eponine though.

B000002U6E|5.0|I seem to see a pattern in my life. Whenever I overlook musicians, I become one of their fans later on. Several years ago, I've only heard a few songs from bands such as Deep Purple, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Monster Magnet, and Led Zeppelin. Now, I've grown to love their music. The same thing has happened with me and the music of Enigma. Back then, I only heard \\"Return to Innocence,\\" \\"Silence Must Be Heard,\\" and \\"Beyond the Invisible.\\" Now, in 2011, their music has become much more addicting. I've ignored the musical project for far too long. The Cross of Changes has become the first album from Enigma that I've completely enjoyed listening to straight through. I admire the mix of traditional/folk and electronic instruments. It's New Age music at its finest. The songs (particularly \\"The Eyes of Truth,\\" \\"Silent Warrior,\\" and \\"Out from the Deep\\") are ethereally brilliant, the music sometimes seductive.<br /><br />Enigma could very well turn into one of my all-time favorite musicians (or project, or whatever). But that probably won't happen until I've explored the other albums as well. Le Roi Est Mort is up next...<br /><br />Grade: 9.9/10

The end of the book took about 5 seconds(I listened to this on audio book).  I was floored.  There wasn't enough detail about what happened to the characters.  I had hoped the book would have went into it more, but it was like wham and it was over.  I think ending could have been better.

HOWEVER, after looking through and reading the book, I found that I'd underated this book. The author writes in a conversation style and is amusing and very informative - almost like having a grandmother or mother to talk knitting with. It's a joy to read.
1439102724|4.0|Sing You Home was an intriguing read.  I loved the issues of the church, homosexuality and IVF that were explored.  As someone who was once won over into a church myself, I found myself understanding Max, though he struck me as a not the brightest bulb.  Zoe's music therapy sessions were, perhaps, the most moving parts of the book for me.  And Vanessa was my favorite.  I loved her fierceness, and her depth as compared to the rest.    I would have liked a few more perspectives in the novel.  Lucy's or the pastor's, for example.  It would have been so interesting to see what they were thinking or why they did what they did, from their own perspective.  The deeper understanding of them would have been great.  Zoe's character was a little bland, too.    I've read most of Picoult's books and the subjects she chooses to tackle in this are timely, and seem well-researched.  While I would have liked more depth to many of the characters, I do think it was a great read, and would reccommend it!

0545140323|5.0|This is one of those books that I saw everywhere and everyone seemed to love it.  Unfortunately I never managed to get my hands on it until now~ and boy, was I missing out!  This book was just as great as I'd heard!<br />Penny is an amazing character.  She has flaws, so she felt real.  But she has a heart of gold.  I just loved her!  And they way she got so many girls to bond together and really realize how much girls could have each others backs was awesome.  Of course there are still those petty girls that try to mess it up, and boys who pick on them, but they always had each others backs, even when things were changing.  I really loved that.<br />I loved that all of the characters were important.  Not just Penny, but her friends, Tracy and Diane, her parents, her sister, the list goes on.  They all had an important role no matter how short it was, they shaped the story quite a lot.<br />I love the romance in the book and how they were friends and realized the importance of their friendship before they ever considered a relationship.  I think that was an important lesson to teenage girls.  Heck, the whole book is great for teenage girls.  Just to remind them that their life doesn't have to evolve around boys.  And that your friends are the most important thing.<br /><br />This review was first published on my blog at [...]
B003LL3NOK|4.0|First, I'm just thankful that Romero decided to go back to unadorned filmmaking 101.  I was so grateful in fact that I didn't even mind that this wasn't the best movie he's ever made (or the worse...that would be Diary of the Dense).<br />This installment is told like a bizarre western: meanwhile, back at the ranch...two old geezers fight over an island and a theory about the undead and what they could eat given half the chance.  Laced with humor, the usual allotment of gore, and plenty of unsavory people willing to do anything NOT to end up a zombie snack (could have subtitled this, survival of the fittest.  Ever notice that \\"nice\\" people never seem to last long, leaving only the dregs to fight themselves and the zombies).<br />I've seen plenty of zombie movies and this one works as well as the next.  It's a keeper!<br /><br />(Loved the image of the zombie riding a horse.)

1439102724|4.0|I have been a Jodi Picoult fan for a long time and she did not disappoint with Sing You Home.  In this book Jodi takes on issues such as gay rights and reproductive dilemmas, but most importantly this is a story about love and what it means to be a family.  Jodi's commitment to thorough research is evident in this book and I admire how she can write characters that you empathize with even when you don't agree with their views and actions. I also think the idea to include a CD of original music to go along with the book was genius.  I wasn't sure what to expect of the songs, but they were surprisingly good.  If you have read Jodi's books before I think you will love Sing You Home and if you haven't, what are you waiting for?
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Adele is a fine fresh artist with a powerful voice and the songs on this album are musically wonderful.  Unfortunately it has apparently been mixed for listening on an mp3 player, i.e. highly compressed.  The sound quality on a good stereo is abysmal.  Everything, every instrument, every frequency is the same volume, loud and harsh.  Unlistenable.  It even sounds terrible in a car.

Have been looking forward to seeing this on bluray for a long time, it's worth getting.<br /><br />John Boorman's voice commentary was especially insightful; I've watched this movie dozens of times over the years, and hearing what John was thinking for each scene added a LOT of insight and depth to the experience; thanks John for doing this for us true Excalibur fans.<br /><br />With lush scenery, beautiful cinematography and intensely compelling visuals, \\"Excalibur\\" is the best Arthur movie ever made; holding up to and handily being much better than any that have been produced in the 20 years since Excalibur first made it to the big screen.  This movie is one of my alltime favorites of all the thousands of movies I've watched during my life, and is absolutely stunning.  A++++<br /><br />Excalibur in blu-ray is a visual feast -- wonderfully filmed and written with care and craftsmanship, very highly recommended.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I ordered this to supplement the VHS copy I have had for years. The extras one gets with a DVD over VHS is worth the investment.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I felt that this must be the closest imagination of the future. The music, space, city, clothes, entertainment, lighting, vehicles are so striking that I watched the movie a couple of times and want to watch it on dvd a hundred times more.  What can I say, thank you Disney :)
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I've listened to it several times (while working) and I am really enjoying it.  Especially, hearing parts I never heard before because the only live performance I've seen was at a High school years ago.  I haven't watched my VHS of the 10th anniversary in ages so I can't compare.  These characters left the biggest impression on me  Javert - loved him.  Wonderful voice  Gavroche - adorable - his cheekyness was perfect.  Marius - UGH.  Ok, not ugh.  The Jonas Brother simply doesn't have the vocal strength for this. I've thought many times, \\"why couldn't they have let one of actors who have a smaller part play Marius and stunt cast a smaller part.\\"  His voice is Ok I guess, but it is ordinary and the rest of the cast was extraordinary.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Since the beginning of her career in 2002, Avril has shown the amazing artist she is. Over the years, Avril has proven how much you can get when you do it with love and hard work.    Every album of Avril has its own mark, its own personality. And I really like all of them. But, I have to admit that after The Best Damn Thing I was afraid of never being able to see a truly improvement in Avril's music. So, when I first heard about Goodbye Lullaby I held in Avril's promise that the album would be sincere, honest and that the main point would be her voice.     The Best Damn Thing was fun, but we barely can see Avril's incredible vocal capacity, lost in the middle of crazy drums and loud guitars. Avril needed to move on, and that's what she did on Goodbye Lullaby.    I see people saying that it's boring ballads' album - and it's not true. Not at all. This record is showing Avril as herself, not the dark Avril or the bratty Avril or the rebel from Let Go. It's just Avril, stripped down, finally talking about her deepest feelings, about her flaws, showing her softer side and showing that she cares about everyone she loves.    Goodbye Lullaby is the proof that Avril is a true artist, not only because she's a singer or a designer, but because she has the gift of turn emotions into music. I really recommend this album if you want to know what's inside the heart of the icon of a generation, the girl that came from a small town in Canada and did and still does the music that gives the support and strenght to move on to thousands of people around the world.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|The acting and dancing is exceptional, but there were several unnecessarily graphic sex scenes that I would have preferred not to see.

0316067938|1.0|I read the first book. Put it down and said well that was like a crappy version of the first 3 seasons of Buffy. Seriously there is 0 character development at any point. The first 100 pages of Twilight is a giant pointless list of all the things Bella hates about the place she's chosen to live. This includes her dad, who does nothing but try to be nice to her and is the bad guy for no reason. Her normal friends whose only real crime is not being good enough for her. Ironically they end up being the only ones I still liked by the end of this crap fest. After this the entire series revolves around her trying to keep her abusive boyfriend (and I use that in the emotional sense but anyone with half a brain could see that in real life he'd hit her by now) from leaving her. This all ends with a book that even some of the more die hard fans hate. She gives birth to a child that by all rights should be the demonic hell spawn to end all demonic hell spawns. Instead it turns the one somewhat sympathetic character into a pedophile and gives the dumber portion of the teenagers who read this the impression that babies are easy to care for. Save yourself the poor writing and stupid plot (for lack of a more appropriate word). Watch Buffy instead to see how a good writer like Joss Whedon does vampire romance.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|My son(8)asked me to give this toy 5 stars because he \\"loves\\" it. He says he likes the missile launcher thing so you can battle other Legos with it. I'm happy he's happy.
B000000WHC|5.0|The title says it all.  Still Got the Blues is my very favorite Gary Moore CD.  He definitely mastered the guitar!  Any blues and/or guitar lover will appreciate this CD!
038572179X|4.0|This is a hard one for me because I absolutely loved the book until the end, which actually left me MAD.  I loved the author's writing style, his beautiful metaphors, the way he goes into such detail, explores the mundane, and investigates the metaphysics.  The part where Briony stares at her finger, making it move, wondering about the intersection of human conscience and physical reality and existence, is one of my favorites.  This book also has this quality I like so much in good books - it forces you to think differently, look at life from different angles, and it just works the magic that great writing can do.  I like how we're led to feel so much anger and hatred at Breony - and then we're thrown into Robbie's war stories, all the killing, selfishness and baseness of mankind that war brings out, and then he has the realization, aren't we all guilty?  I thought some parts of the plot were cheesy and undeveloped, but the writing style was so engaging and the overall plot was so suspenseful that I just read past them and still enjoyed the book tremendously.      And then I got to the end, the last chapter, and was literally like, WTF.  I guess it's sort of like, going to a great restaurant and eating great food, but the dessert left you with food poisoning.  You think about your experience at the restaurant and you think what a great appetizer and entree but then you get sick again thinking about the food poisoning the dessert gave you.  Loved the food but just can't get past the dessert.  Don't know if I would go back again.  Still mad that the dessert ruined what could've been a really exceptional experience.      (***spoiler***) We read about how Robbie comes back from the war alive and well.  We're told that Cecilia and Robbie's love was so deep that it survived through the war and the injustice of the rape mis-conviction.  We're told that Breony built up the courage to finally confront her sister.  And then we're told, SIKE!! that was all a LIE!!  I (Breony)JUST MADE IT UP!!  I just put that in to make myself feel better.  I never made it to see Cecelia, I was walking on my way but didn't have the guts to go the whole way.  I turned around.  Robbie and Cecilia never fulfilled their love.  But somehow, making up this story, telling her publishers to publish the story only after she dies, and by the way the version that's published isn't even the truth (so we're told in her 1999 diary entry) - somehow that is the atonement?  So, this is atonement... Breony finally decides to publish a story revealing part of the truth but again she lies and makes up the \\"happy ending.\\"  I was left with an impression of Breony that aggrandizes her sins even more.  Once again Breony's immature cowardice preferring her fantasy made up stories prevails.  What a stupid ending.  Still a good appetizer and entree though.
B004132HZS|4.0|I enjoy the new Sherlock Holmes.  The dialogue was bit hard to hear completely since the actor seemed to mumble somewhat.  Pretty far out, but enjoyable none the less.  Hope they keep on trying.  It's a great idea.
B003ZVJFFM|4.0|Charles Dickens' beloved story \\"Christmas Carol\\" has been filmed at least five times.  I really like the motion capture Disney's CHRISTMAS CAROL directed by Robert Zemeckis.  Jim Carrey plays at least five roles.  Terrific production design  infuses every scene and the movie sticks to the story that Dickens wrote.  Originally intended for Imax 3D, the Blu-ray 2D looks great on a hi-def flat-screen TV.
1594202842|4.0|Many Westerners would probably express horror at Amy Chua's parenting style. But that's why one has to admire her book at least a little. She doesn't invent a rosy picture for the reader, and she deliberately describes herself doing things that she surely knew would be condemned by readers. She describes many occasions when her children succeed, but the book mostly focuses on the agonizing day-to-day struggle, her perpetual confrontation with her children, her endless organizational work, and the ultimate emotional toll that her determination takes on everyone. In her defense, it doesn't seem like she had much fun, either.    I myself was frequently horrified. For example, I do not believe that one should ever refer to one's children as \\"garbage,\\" even if this does motivate them to succeed (and I do believe that it could). This has nothing to do with believing in \\"self-esteem.\\" I just think that words mean things -- if I ever did call somebody \\"garbage,\\" I would do so expecting to become their sworn enemy for life. If your children regard you in that manner, I imagine it would be small consolation to have them do so while reciting at Carnegie Hall.    At the same time, parts of this book were bizarrely liberating. There is a horrific scene where the family goes to a restaurant to celebrate Chua's birthday, the children present her with homemade cards, and Chua demonstratively \\"rejects\\" them because they didn't put enough effort into the task. I never thought anyone would actually do this. If I had read this scene in a work of fiction, I would have thought that it was a brilliant literary invention, a daring dramatic device. Chua did it for real. Before you rush to condemn her, think: all ye tired, overworked parents, haven't you ever felt disappointed when your child spends less than thirty seconds on a token gesture of appreciation? Why, you think, can't they care about you just for one day out of the year? Haven't you ever wanted to reproach them for it? Well, thanks to Amy Chua, you can! And, if her account is to be believed, it even works!    Yet, at other times, it gets to be too much. Chua says, in this book and in her original Wall Street Journal essay: \\"And when Chinese kids do excel, there is plenty of ego-inflating parental praise lavished in the privacy of the home.\\" The funny thing is, this statement is made as an aside, in parentheses. The book does not give a single specific example of such praise, as opposed to the many specific examples it gives of insults and demands. It does mention that Chua used to cuddle with her younger daughter, laughing and talking about music, but that's not quite the same thing, and anyway, even this is only mentioned vaguely, with no specifics. I see the stick, but where's the carrot? Where's the positive reinforcement? Maybe the editors removed it, thinking that conflict and confrontation would sell better.    Even more perplexing is Chua's apparent lack of any over-arching goal or purpose. She gets lost in the minutiae of each daily practice session, and thinks about as far ahead as next week's recital. But when you make your kids practice the violin for FIVE HOURS every day, you've got to have some idea as to why. Maybe you really want them to become famous professional violinists. Maybe you view this as a way for them to attract and get married to billionaires. Maybe you genuinely want them to develop a deep love and understanding of music, or maybe you just want them to feel indebted to you so they take care of you when you get old. Some of these reasons might be better than others, but each one is a plan. Chua seems to have none; her main reason for doing all these things is because doing so is \\"Chinese,\\" as if that were enough to explain everything. There's also the need to show up all the other parents, but really now, going to Carnegie Hall in order to be the top student at your school is like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. There are also plenty of other ways to getinto Ivy League schools, if that's the goal.    When I first heard about this book, I thought it might be some kind of proud paean to Chinese nationalism. It is nothing like that. In fact, it seems oddly confused on matters of identity. Both daughters are forced to study Mandarin on a daily basis, but they both have trouble viewing themselves as \\"Chinese.\\" There is little connecting them to Chinese culture or history. They only have their grandparents. In fact, Chua herself seems to have no connection to her family history other than her own parents, and her praise for their parenting style. Considering how much she dreaded the influence of Western culture on her children, I would have thought that she'd tell them more about their illustrious ancestors. Instead, she uses herself as an example, and tells them about how she struggled to get a job at Yale. That's a bit less...epic.    So, I'm glad that the book was written, and I think it offers a lot of food for thought. But it didn't answer my question of \\"Why?\\" It seems to me that, if you want somebody to perform amazing feats, you should inspire them with an equally transcendent goal.
B002ZG981E|3.0|Movies are dreams and dreams are movies.  Both seem real while they're happening - just like life.  Christopher Nolan's layered journey into the lucid dreamscape challenges the mind and delights the eye.  What more can you ask?  Provocative extras explore the dreaming mind and the ideas and design behind the movie.  Almost a great film.  Does it really ask: How do we know we're alive?  Or:  All is mind?
0670021652|3.0|Wow, I just can't get past the first two chapters. I was blown away by Eat, Pray, Love, but find this is just a lot of waffle on the same thing. Sure, I have only read the first two chapters - but they're what's supposed to hook you in and make you finish the book, which I just can't right now. Maybe I am just so disappointed because her other book was so good, I will leave it for a few months and pick it up again later. If you are expecting the same book as Eat, Pray, Love - then you'll be sorely disappointed.
B0045NXMJE|4.0|Master of whimsy and fantasy, Jean-Pierre Jeunot concocts a delectable absurdist dramady about an unusual underground (literally) salvaging and recycling community that attempts to bring down two of France's biggest weapons dealers.  An inventive visual style infuses every frame of this always surprising, sometimes thoughtful, escapist fare.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I have watched this movie every way offered.  I watched the extra clips.  I too wonder why the jails do not have some new guests living with them for a long time.  Our banks that were supposed to serve the public abused the trust granted to them by the public and private sectors.  It seems to always be about greed.  I just watched waiting for superman and seems like the same thing.  Greed.  New laws will not fix this.  The problems we face are far more fundamental and in the core of who we in the US we have become.  Heaven help us with what judement is coming from all of this and what we have done to ourselves.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|For a long time my private mantra was: \\"Vouloir c'est pouvoir.\\"  For me, this meant: \\"If you can think it, you can do it.\\"  Ratatouille is a wonderful expression of this idea.  The audacious conceit is about a rural French rat who dreams of going to Paris and becoming a world-renowned chef.<br /><br />For a multitude of reasons, many aficionados of animation and great cinema still consider this the best film of the last decade.  The inspired direction is by Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava.  There are few perfect films; this is one of them.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|Kris Kristofferson must have found it so easy to basically play himself.  Sure, this movie may seem quintessential of the 70's genre, but the fact that Streisand managed to finish it after firing her boyfriend and taking on the task herself is quite simply amazing.  Oh yes, the concert scenes at the beginning could have been from just about any open-air stadium event, but the one at the end is the very best that any singer could aspire to achieve.  I have watched the solo that Barbra performs, and am glued to the screen as she hits every note whilst shedding tears.  How many artists - never mind so-called superstars - could have done this as well as she does.  Buy it, even for just the last scene!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Ridley Scott's initial film in what became a four-picture franchise (with no further input from Scott) is still the best and scariest.  A mission of mercy becomes a trap of evil.  Actually, it looks like the devil him -- or her - who materializes in the confines of a spacecraft to wreak havoc on a terrified crew.  Finally it comes down to Sigourney Weaver to dispatch the demon bastard - or bitch.  Great production design and directing still generate delicious visceral thrills on a hi-def TV in a dark room.  Scott is allegedly working on a prequel of sorts.  The discs look absolute superb in hi-def, buit it's only ALIEN that's the true classic.
6304712936|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, enjoyed it, and had forgotten about it..... until I went to the Musical Instrument Museum and saw a clip from the movie in one of the displays.  I was pleased to find a new copy of Amadeus through Amazon.    I watched it immediately and was not disappointed - Great film!
B003EYVXUU|4.0|It's rare when a Hollywood remake of a widely acclaimed foreign film is as good as the original.  (Just look at what happened to THE VANISHING!)  Matt Reeves, whose previous film CLOVERFIELD was a hit, adapted the Danish coming of age vampire thriller LET THE RIGHT ONE IN and made a nearly perfect Americanized film that has a heart of pure horror.  I usually hate vampire films for a lot of reasons but I love this moody, atmospheric dream that treats desire and alienation with a delicacy that makes real the sacrifices we choose to make for even fleeting intimacy.  Set in Los Alamos, Colorado -- a community with the highest IQ per capita -- the story has a bullied, frail 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) befriending his strange next-door neighbor, Abby (a terrific Chloe Moretz from KICK ASS).  Their outcast bond fortifies Owen to stand up to the bullies.  But when Owen confirms his suspicions that Chloe has a big secret, it's too late; his fate is sealed.  This beautifully acted, visually rich, stunning and tragic love story is perfect in almost every way.  Sadly, it was little seen in theaters and deserves to be rediscovered for home video.  The always fine Richard Jenkins co-stars.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|As an avid reader of Anne Rice, Stephanie Meyer-- and any  other paranormal author-- I was enthralled by A Discovery of Witches. I didn't realize how much I'd missed reading about vampires and witches from a historical standpoint, like early works by Anne Rice, and this novel weaves the history into the present effortlessly. Imagine, laying your hands on  a handwritten tome by the likes of Darwin, which someone just has lying around on a bookshelf. Imaging meeting a contemporary of the great minds, and hearing him speak of them like one would of boy's night playing poker.<br /><br />The author has a fresh take on the reality of modern day supernatural beings, and she manages to bring a little science and literary clues to illumination as well. The scenery is set well, and I found myself feeling transported to the stacks, to the ancient fortified castles, and to the house with a mind of it's own (really,  a house that hides items and adds rooms on at will-- how original!) at the authors whimsy. The only disappointment I had with this book is that it ended. I have to wait to find out how \\"it\\" went. (I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone!) Overall a great, original book and I can't wait to read the sequel.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Is Deckard a replicant?  Ridley Scott at the helm again, this time directing from a screenplay inspired by a Philip K. Dick story that asks: \\"What does it mean to be alive?\\"  This extraordinarily prescient film did poor business and did not connect with an audience when it was first released.  Now it has a huge fan base who recognize it as the visionary and philosophical masterpiece it is.  The 5-disc Collector's Edition showcases Scott's sublime final cut along with various earlier versions (it went through various mutations) including a rarely seen preview print.  A new bonus feature is a terrific full-length making-of documentary that is perhaps the best of its kind.
0066620996|5.0|Loved this book!!!  Had research to back up conclusions.  It was well written and organized.  Author was able to take lots of factual info and turn it into readable conclusions.

B0017OB12O|4.0|David Lean loved to create, populate and inhabit worlds that no longer exist.  He once famously said, \\"I only feel alive when I'm making a movie.\\"  In The Bridge on the River Kwai Lean imprisons us in a lush landscape and forces us an to put our minds to a task that will give us some relief from the harsh reality of being a POW constructing the Burma Railway.  Controversial to many as a condemnation of a British character flaw of \\"doing one's duty and being happy in your work.\\"  The same notion was also reflected in the Nuremburg Trials.  This taut story by Pierre Boulle also offered a final moment of redemption - however posthumous. But that's the hell of war.  See William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa are at their best.
B003F3NEBG|3.0|Because this is my favorite version of the film, I've wanted to buy it since first seeing it on PBS. I held off in the hopes that one day it would be available on blu-ray. When that day came, I waited for a reasonable price, then made my purchase.     I'm a bit disappointed with the blu-ray version. I'm sure if I were to compare it side by side with the regular dvd, that I'd see significant improvement, however, in viewing it on its own....     Close up shots are extremely crisp and focused, but long range shots have a graininess to them (for instance, the opening sequence where we see the estate in the background). Many other scenes throughout have that same graininess. I've become accustomed to crystal clear imagery with blu-ray discs, and due to the medium, minor imperfections become obvious. As with some other reviewers, I have no issue with the colors.     I had been waiting to buy Emma (2009 version) on blu-ray, but now I think I'll purchase it on regular dvd. Not everything is meant to be viewed on blu-ray.
1439102724|5.0|I loved this latest book by Jodi Picoult, just as I've loved all her books!  This book gets to the heart of what makes a family, and challenges the reader to examine their own prejudices and open their mind to another point of view.  Picoult effectively presents both points of view on the issue, and her research is thorough as usual.  I believe that in the end she portrays with great humanity the story of a couple who are truly in love and who want to start a family.  I hope this story opens some eyes and some hearts to all the patriotic Americans who at this time are not allowed to marry and are not afforded the same rights as their heterosexual neighbours.  No one should be made to feel like a second-class citizen because they wish to marry another adult with whom they are in love.
0316776963|1.0|Based on the reviews of this book, and reviews I have read on other books recommending this particular book, I was really expecting it to be incredibly funny.  There wasn't a single thing I found funny in this book.  Not even a chuckle.  I kept reading expecting for it to possibly pick up, after 100+ pages I realized no such luck.  I began to just skim the book, because after all I paid for it.  This book had NO point at all.  It just sort of rambled on about nothing. Sedaris is SO not funny.  The writing is flat.  I would not recommend this book to anyone and if I could give it 0 stars, I would.  Its not worth the paper its printed on.  I am still annoyed I spent money on this, everyone that bought it deserves a refund.
1151097764|3.0|The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe is an entertaining book that earns the label of a \\"page-turner\\" through Wolfe's quality prose and ability to showcase the quirky parts of his characters. It's a good story with big implications, seen from the eyes of a handful of different New Yorkers. The best I can give this novel is good, but not great. It has good scenes and good subject matter, but never quite hits what it set out to.     Wolfe gives you a taste of a lot of interesting things and characters that never get expanded on. When you read the two scenes with Bacon (Al Sharpton-lite) you're captivated by him, but he hardly appears otherwise except for somebody mentioning how terrible he is. We meet the judge Kovitsky early on and he's equally interesting, and he goes unheard of until the climax in which he's supposed to be the crux of the finale. We don't find out that Sherman was once an idealist who wasn't consumed by money and social status until it's way too late to care. Sherman's turn from a wimpy yuppie into an \\"animal\\" at the end came off really lame. So now he isn't afraid to lie...wait, hasn't he already lied to everybody he's encountered up to this point?      Wolfe can craft a line with the best of them though, and his humor and descriptive ability usually keeps his stuff afloat when he lacks in other departments. One of the best parts of the book was the dichotomy between Kramer and the women he lusted after. When he was staring down Maria as they interviewed her and his inner dialogue hinted that she might want him, and then we find out that she thought he was a creep was a beautiful notion about how a lot of men think and women's reaction to that. Also when he's rambling to The Girl With the Brown Lipstick about the trial and he thinks she's enthralled with every aspect of it, come to find out at the end of the scene she thinks he's a typical New York male that only talks about themselves. Subtle nuances like this made the book worthwhile despitebeing bashed over the head with the fact that Jews, Italians, Blacks, Irish, rich people and poor people are different. Wolfe also made it a point to note that everybody who worked for the justice system was bald or balding.     I would have liked to have seen the story go to trial and seen Killian and Kramer going at it with Kovitsky playing mediator. I wanted to see Sherman watch Maria testify under oath and I wanted resolution. I guess I can't fault Wolfe for his ending though, because it's his story and that's how he chose to write it. I can say though that the ending felt like a cop-out and a let down. The book was worth reading and a good addition to the Tom Wolfe canon, but not his best work.

B004Q5ZP5K|5.0|With \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\", Avril Lavigne has proved that she's still relevant.  The explicit version of this album drops the language in unusual places--it's not gratuitous, but it definitely puts her on the other side of that 'kid-friendly' line that defined her early career.  This album isn't an extension of 'Under My Skin', it's more a celebration of her musical capabilities--while she doesn't stray into experimental territory or do anything really unlike her, she does do well to stretch herself.  I compare Avril Lavigne's work on 'Goodbye Lullaby' to The Offspring, who sounded much the same across three albums and then suddenly dropped 'Americana' on the world and surprised everybody.<br /><br />Lavigne still has that sassiness about her:  What the Hell is the obvious song, but she also does a good job of laying down the law in \\"Push\\", a song about relationships.  She uses \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to hearken back to her 'Alanis Morissette soundalike' days, then \\"Stop Standing There\\" seems more Radio Disney friendly.  I'm expecting my pre-teen daughter will love this one:  it's an excellent showcase of her vocals, where the instrumentation drops to the background.<br /><br />\\"I Love You\\" should have been released in February - it's a sweet love song and it comes from her young heart. \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is the kind of 'It's okay--we all have that happen' song that makes me think this is the direction Miley Cyrus should have gone in.  As the album winds to a close, you have some softer musical tunes:  \\"4 Real\\" is acoustic with an easy percussion beat, \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Remember When\\" are heavily piano-driven, and Goodbye ends the album in a lovely way with just strings and her voice.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" is a four-star album--what gives it that last kick into 5-star territory is the production.  Guitar and drum parts are really well balanced, passages with string instruments or piano mesh evenly with Avril Lavigne's voice, and everything really just comes across as well mixed.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Avril Lavigne's earlier work, see this as her next step forward, a good step with confident stride to it.  If you're new to Lavigne and like pop music and female vocalists, you're guaranteed to find something you like.<br /><br />This review is for the explicit MP3 version of the album (and yes, you may be reading this in another flavor of \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" - Amazon does that sometimes).  A nice thing about the downloadable version is that the explicit tracks are tagged with '[Explicit]'--this makes it easier to know which ones I can share with my daughter and which ones probably shouldn't be dropped onto her iPod.  The collector's edition of the album adds acoustic versions of her vocally-challenging song 'Alice' (from the recent Alice in Wonderland film), 'What the Hell', 'Push', and 'Wish You Were Here'.  These are good picks for the acoustic treatment, if only because most of the remaining tracks are laid-back piano and string pieces already.If you're familiar with Avril Lavigne's earlier work, see this as her next step forward, a good step with confident stride to it.

0670022411|5.0|I was captivated by this novel and story from the very first page- it is so involved and moves so very quickly. It delves into history and alchemy and makes both, despite my apprehensions, very intriguing! The romance is predictable but is breathtaking at the same time. I had to read it twice to catch all the info I missed the first time around, because I was speeding through to find out what happened next! I definitely recommend this one! A more interesting and grown up novel along the ideas of Twilight... only a lot exciting!
B001FB55I0|3.0|The Good:   Special effects are in general excellent. Sound design is great if you have a home theatre set-up. I liked the performances of Sam Worthington's and Anton Yelchin and there were a couple of nice little homage's to the first two films - the \\"come with me if you want to live\\" line and the nod to Guns and Roses.    The Bad:   Christian Bale - now I know his performance has split the Amazon critics, for me it didn't really work. I found his performance very wooden and he exhibits none of the charisma that I would expect a leader of a resistance movement to have.  The Plot - in a nutshell there's too many holes.  We never really find out what motivates the Sam Worthington character. He emerges from the ground and starts walking - he tells Kyle Reese that he's heading north - for what? - it's never explained.  And why for example does Skynet need to lure John Connor to its base - surely, if it just killed Kyle Reese then Connor would not exist anymore -the film is a bit sketchy on the whole time travel, cause and effect thing anyway. And given that Skynet is using Reese to lure Conor, the whole premise behind Sam Worthingtons character becomes a bit redundant.  I know that at its heart it's just a big dumb action movie but I like my dumb action movies make some kind of sense - at least in the context of their own universe.  Oh, and John Connor's wife must be one of the most underwritten characters I've ever seen - she literally adds nothing to the movie.    In summary, it's not a bad movie - it's certainly better than T3, but it really doesn't stand up to comparison with the first two movies in the franchise.
B002KREVE2|5.0|I am in my 70's and had never heard of Leonard Cohen until my PBS channel showed this a few weeks ago.  What a revelation!  I watched it only because I once met a lady who was born on the Isle of Wight, and was immediately enthralled!  Where was my head when this unique event happened?  Why haven't I met Leonard Cohen before? His performances are mesmerizing, his backup band and singers of the highest quality.  His lyrics are amazing poetry. and his songs unforgettable.  His music fits no common  category.  It's not really country or rock, or folk.  It's purely unique.<br /><br />What a great experience for a senior citizen to find a \\"new\\" artist that captures the heart and soul.  I've since bought several CD's,another video,( of his 2008-2009 world tour at the age of 75!) and two biographies, one of which I have completed.  Start with this Isle of Wight event and follow him through his life.  I asked my savvy grandson who broadcasts (as in DJ) alternative rock, if he knew Leonard Cohen.  He replied, \\"Of course I do.  He's really cool!\\"  'Nuf said.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We ALL want to play this game. It's so simple to play, yet it's still really challenging for the adults. It's such a change from having to sit through kids games and trying to stay interested. Our 6 year old loves it, our 10 year old changes her tactics every game, and my husband and I have not been able to get all our pieces down yet, we're still working on it!
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Like most others, I bought this for their two singles \\"If I Die Young\\" and \\"Hip to My Heart\\" and had hopes that the rest of the album would be just as good or better.  Well I'm not going to say it's better because I think \\"If I Die Young\\" is by far their best song, but I genuinely didn't dislike the rest.  I don't mean that to sound negative at all.  The rest of the songs are fairly catchy and show a lot of promise for future material.  Overall I'd say that it's definitely worth purchasing so that this band can move forward with new material and future releases.
1402210086|5.0|I just love Freddy. It is so fun to be a part of his transformation/discovery of what he is capable of. He is hilarious.
B003UESJFG|5.0|My 6 year old son really wanted to watch this movie and I was so so about it.    I am glad my son convinced me to buy the DVD because we missed it while in theaters.  I absolutely loved it! It was so funny and really sweet.  Even my 3.5 year old daughter liked it.  I would highly recommend.    Up there with Despicable Me and Tangled, but less scary believe it or not!
0691142165|4.0|This Time is Different is not quite what I expected when I picked it up.  First, it has a bare minimum of qualitative information and really focuses on the quantitative history of debt defaults, banking crises, and inflation crises.  As one friend told me, it is really a book of really interesting tables.  Second, the \\"this time\\" of the title does not refer to recessions or crises but actually the events leading up to them.  The book does not argue that the \\"Great Recession,\\" or what it calls the second great contraction, is not one of the larger, farther reaching recessions of modern history just that the events leading up to it are wholly predictable.    Those surprises are not necessarily drawbacks, but others picking the book up should realize that.  I still learned a lot from the book including about the depth and breadth of historical crises throughout the world, the similarities among crises, and some more details such as the different treatment of domestic and external debt.  Debt is also what makes the book continue to hold great relevance as the financial crisis fades from view but the U.S. still grapples with large annual deficits and continued long term debt.
0385341008|5.0|I generally shy away from any war based book, but this offered the rare blend of reality tempered by characters so unique and interesting that you had to learn their stories.  The writing is crisp.  The story tragic but still optimistic. Though the story is certainly set in the past, it seemed contemporary.  It is not a romance in the typical sence, but it is the romance that keeps the charcters alive and the story moving forward. This is a story you'll recommend to others.
159102594X|2.0|I got this book from the library and started reading expecting to get wrapped up in the story but it never happened. Granted, I read less than a hundred pages, but I was not interested in 3 of the four main characters. I got tired of reading through three uninteresting chapters to get to the I actually did want to read. When you have four stories to tell, make sure at least three of them are characters that people can relate to.
1574216988|4.0|This book is REALLY SMALL. To give you an idea of how small, it's only got 52 pages, and that includes both covers and inside covers. And it's not taller to make up for the size. I would have given it 5 stars if the cost/size ratio was better.<br /><br />The contents deserve 5 stars, though, and I would still recommend it to anyone who loves Zentangles. There are some great patterns, and a wealth of ideas for using them in everyday life, enhancing them with shading and color, and developing your own patterns from real life. She also talks about printing tangles from foam plates and using transfers.<br /><br />Deserves to be in the library of any Zentangle aficionado.
B000NY17J6|5.0|This is an amazing CD!!  I did not even know she had so many hits.  This brought back so many great memories.  Her voice is spectacular and her songs are so great.  She is truly a star then, now & forever.  She is a legend!!  I love Linda Ronstadt - she is a truly amazing artist.  This is such a great CD and I highly recommend it.  You will get everything you need in this one and more!!

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've researched a lot before taking the decision of buying the Forerunner 405cx, which is my first GPS (I am long time Polar user) and to be completely honest, I still had some doubts when I placed the order, specially after review the comments of previous buyers.  Clearly the main potential problem is the bezel, that in fact is difficult to manage in the very beginning but at least for me it was not the nightmare that some people reported in this space, but after a few days, you get used to the sensibility it's no longer a problem.   A very good tip, that I got in these reviews (apologies, I can't remember wo wrote it but thanks anyway!) is to lock the bezel when you are not using it.  GPS is really great. I've already used it in three different cities in Brazil and it never took me more than a couple minutes to get satellite signal. In some cases only a few seconds after turning it on it was ready.  HR measurement is not really Garmin's \\"thing\\", but the monitor is OK, not the most confortable I've ever used, but it doesn't annoy me, even in long sessions, over 1,5 hours.  The ANT is also really good, just getting the close to a computer you can transfer all the info from the device, and the software is very intuitive, you can get all the information you want very easily.  Battery duration could be better, but once you check it periodically, you will not get in trouble without battery during your exercise.   To sum up, I think it really delivers what it promisse, and stongly recommend it
0061726826|5.0|I was absolutely and utterly blown away by this book.  It begins with a super interesting and unique premise, where Lena lives in a world where love is amor deliria nervosa, a deadly disease.  People are utterly convinced of this, as it has been woven in among their history and their religion and their general knowledge about life.  This, on its own, sets the stage for a wonderfully interesting book.  But Lauren Oliver takes it beyond this.  She crafts a beautiful, poetic, and captivating tale that about love and relationships.  It is not your typical love story though; it is more a story about the concept of love - what it's like to feel it, how it works, what it means, and what it is like to live without it.  Lauren Oliver's words melted off the paper for me - I can't think of another book where I found myself finding passages that I wanted to remember and quote because they were beautifully written and also very thought-provoking.  My absolute favorite part of the book was the ending.  The action final ten or so pages had me absolutely breathless and on the edge of my seat.  The big event after that... well, all I can say was that it was not what I was expecting at all, and yet I wasn't disappointed or angry, which I easily could have been.  I thought it was absolutely beautiful and poetic, and perfect.  After that, the final paragraphs gave me the chills.  I finished the book was an exuberant \\"Wow!\\" and I think I will be thinking about this for days to come.  I am thrilled to hear this is the first book in a trilogy, and I am anxiously awaiting being able to continue Lena's story.<br /><br />Source: E-Galley from publisher
1439102813|5.0|Ever know someone with Alzheimer's and wonder what they are thinking?  Still Alice by Lisa Genova is a brilliant novel that shares what it is like to have Alzheimer's from the point of view of one who actually has it!  Most stories about people with Alzheimer's are told from the caretaker's point of view.  Still Alice lets the reader inside the mind of the person afflicted with this degenerative disease which has no cure.  Alice is only 50 and already has some symptoms of dementia.  She is a college professor at Harvard, the wife of a scientist and mother of three grown children.  This is a story about a family and how the mother with Alzheimer's feels as she discovers she is losing her memory, becoming confused and is sometimes disoriented.<br /><br />Reading this is a great way to learn about Alzheimer's and become aware of the symptoms.  It was a bit scary for me to read this and find that my \\"senior moments\\" of forgetting words and names happened to Alice who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 50!  The author actually interviewed people who had early onset of Alzheimer's.  Questions for discussion are included in the back along with an interview by the author.<br /><br />This is a good read and did not drag at all.  Some parts were even humorous.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about families, relationships or wants to know more about Alzheimer's.  I think it would be a good book for a book club to discuss.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|This is no doubt this band's best work - a true masterpiece. Paul and Billy, God and Jesus, for you Christian people. Personally, I didn't know Pat Turpey was this flawless and smooth on drums - but he proved me wrong.  And Eric Martin? This guy's voice has got to be one of the most least-credited ones around, yet one of the best.    I could say so many things about this album, but in short? If you love guitar or bass, or a great singer, or a great drummer? Or a masterpiece collaboration between all four of them? GET THIS RECORD
0316098337|4.0|I like to read books with different perspectives, so this was very interesting. Hard topic to read about, but so well written from a child's perspective. I couldn't put it down.
1597801585|1.0|It was hard to become engaged with this novel because of the implausible dystopian setting.  It's future where androids can be engineered and extinct species revived and reconfigured.  However, humankind has not replaced fossil fuels as an energy source; apparently no one has figured out carbon sequestration; and food sources need to be discovered rather than created.  I rarely give up on books, but I just couldn't finish this one. I really didn't care where the author took the story.

B003UERZ88|4.0|Halfords latest offering Made of Metal 1V should have been released after Resurrection Halford 1.It calls on his metal roots and its very catchy with great guitar licks.Anybody that likes the Judas priest sound of the early eighties would like this ( British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance)it also touches on Painkiller with a few of the tracks as well. I like it alot and the more you hear it the better it sounds.My favourite tracks are The Mower ( best song ) Undisputed Heartless and hellrazor. I would have liked to give it 5 stars however i feel that Rob should have had more songs in the same level as the Mower, more high pitch screams. However a great effort

0307272702|5.0|This is basically the quick-read version of \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories.\\" It just demolishes everything we've been taught about food and nutrition all our lives. There is quite a bit of overlap but I've enjoyed reading both Taubes books.    Some of the conclusions are hard to believe, running counter to conventional wisdom and also to our own intuition. But Taubes' survey of the research is exhaustive and his arguments are very tightly woven. Taubes is anything but a quack; he's a highly reputable science writer who has approached this topic as an investigative reporter, not only with exhaustive research of the literature back 200 years, but with hundreds of interviews with experts from all different points of view.     If Taubes is right, and I find it very hard to find fault with this, then the public health establishment from the NIH to the American Heart Association have done just a monumental disservice to Americans by jumping to the scientifically unsupported conclusion that fat in the diet, particularly animal fat, was the source of obesity and heart disease, when the opposite was the case. The research up until the 60s clearly indicated that sugars, starches and cereal grains are what actually causes obesity, NOT animal fat, and the latest research is nailing this conclusively.    Anybody who has experimented with Atkins, South Beach or any low-carb regimen and found it worked for them (and just try to find somebody for whom it didn't work!) will find reassurance in this book as well as \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories.\\"  Many of us quit Atkins simply because we were afraid it was dangerous, and then promptly gained back the weight that we'd lost. This book can make you very confident that you can eat a low carb, high fat diet for the rest of your life without fear and with a high degree of confidence that you will be healthier for it. In fact, a the closest we can get to zero carbs might be the best way to go.    Even Dr. Atkins, perhaps bending to intense pressure, modified his diet over the years to lessen the fat and red meat and emphasize fruits and vegetables more. For most people a heavy dose of vegetables won't do any harm, but Taubes argues persuasively that even the first stage of Atkins -- heavy on meat, eggs and fat, keeping carbs to 10-20 grams a day -- might be just fine as a permanent diet. In fact, it is fruits and vegetables -- particularly sugary fruits and starchy vegetables -- for whom the scientific support is lacking.    I used to tell my daughter that the orange juice, banana and whole wheat waffles breakfast was probably about the same thing chemically as having a candy bar and a soda to start the day. I still believe that after reading Taubes. What I'm surprised about, after reading the book, is how strong the scientific support is for sausage and eggs for breakfast -- as long as you leave out the toast and juice.
B004INNRFK|5.0|You can never go wrong with a David Foster production,he is a special kind of guy, but come to think of it, it is mainly because Jackie Evancho was included that I bought several copies. Both the DVD and CD are well done. I am now waiting for the Jackie Evancho CD(and hopefuly DVD also) produced by David Foster, to be available this spring. It will most probably be a great hit and sell millions.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|the great thing about reading a series like this is the characters.  They get better and better and the collective whole is better than any single novel.  I am grateful that I was pushed to read Michael Connelly and cannot wait to embark on #7.....
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Extremely enjoyable!!! What a fantastic band!!! Thank you Stevie & Motown!!! This is perfect for people like me who are physically unable to make the concerts in person due to others standing during most of the concert and blocking the view from those of us who are unable to stand. I wish other R&B/soul artist would consider doing this.    This dvd gives you shots from all angles! Close ups you wouldn't see at the actual concert. I'm thankful that I did see Stevie at least 3 times when I was younger and physically able. Stevie is an artist who gives you your moneys worth! Being from the old school, THERE'S NO LIP-SYNCHING and REAL music!!! Now, with this dvd, I can see and hear him in concert mode as often as I wish! How sweet is that???
B0045K97DW|5.0|kinda got boring but it does eventually grow onto you. I've yet to hear take a little walk with me, I bought the amazon exclusive version with midnight hour blues on it, and all in all I can say that I'm mad he didn't play any of these songs at summerfest in 2010. I am still however very glad I was in the presence a of true guitar genius.
0446677450|1.0|This whole series is a scam. Just google rich dad poor dad scam and see the video interview of Kiyosaki and how he gets upset about the whole thing.<br />Do your self a favor, do not buy into this. Everything you buy from them is a way to make you buy more from them. Their seminars are BS too. Thats how they make money for themselves.<br />Please do thorough research before wasting your money into this scam.<br />If this books does anything, it gives you motivation to try to get rich, does NOT give you any game plan HOW to get rich.  Very vague and generalized talks. At the back inner cover, when you are done reading and all pepped up, you are enticed to shell 100-300$ or more to buy their business board game, or attend their sham seminars etc.<br />Do your self a huge favor, dump the book.<br />If you do want to learn about making money start with some classics like:Benjamin Graham, Napolean Hill, John Murphy, William O'Neil etc.<br /><br />Also before you jump into stocks make sure you do not have debts, its wise to get rid of credit card loans ( ofcourse home mortage is not counted: )  ) etc. first, before you jump into investing.<br />Good luck!
0451457994|2.0|2001 has been called the \\"definitive science fiction book of all time.\\" I have read a fair amount of science fiction. I plan to read a lot more. I found 2001 merely average. The three sections of the book are almost stand-alone tales; the transition between is mildly confusing. It took me quite some time to read this, as I was not terribly engaged with the tale except during Hal's defection. Even that, though, was a little telegraphed. The alternate creation myth was thought-provoking, but not terribly engaging. I do; however, want to know what happens next, so I will be picking up 2010 shortly.

The second book is in every way equal to the first, the characters are completely believable and thoroughly engaging, and the swift pacing has you sitting up at 3am.....ignoring everything else while you read 'just one more chapter'!<br /><br />It was so good that I promise to wait patiently for the next book (sigh)!!!
1416550550|2.0|We are currently reading this book for our book club. It came highly recommended and we were all anxious to read it. I ordered it on my new Kindle. It is not very enjoyable to read this way. Every chapter goes back and forth to 3 different times and lots of different places. If I had a regular book I would flip back and see where and why it changed places form chapter to chapter. In the Kindle you can flip back but it is not as easy to go back and forth as a regular book. That said the 3 Kindle readers in my book club are struggling with the book a lot. The non Kindle readers are not loving the book either but they are plodding through it. Maybe it will get better. I am 1/2 way through it and will percervere.
B0000028VT|4.0|Mariah's third album came on the heels of two highly successful albums, and a recording of her singing live on MTV's Unplugged in 1992.  Music Box, released in 1993, remains her best-selling album of all time.  I'm not sure that status is all that well-deserved, considering she has done better work since, but it capitalizes on the ballad formula she and Walter Afansieff perfected throughout her first couple of CDs, and she and he execute it very well. Additionally, Civilles and Cole work with Mariah to create two catchy up-tempo numbers.  This being a Mariah album, the vocals are top-notch and there are some beautiful melodies and lyrics on here.  In fact, the more I listen to it, the more I catch the vocal layering that Mariah included as she produced the songs, gorgeous harmonies hidden beneath catchy melodies.        The highlights of this album include the very inspirational Gospel-tinged \\"Anytime You Need a Friend,\\" and \\"Now That I Know.\\" The lyrics are pretty banal, but the melody is very catchy and the beat is classic early 90s uptempo perfection due to her collaboration with Civilles and Cole. Another highlight, with its interesting background is \\"Thinking of You.\\"       As for the love ballads, Mariah has some very beautiful melodies on here, including \\"Music Box,\\" sung very softly (it may be one of the first times she exhibits her \\"whispery\\" vocals), and \\"Just to Hold You Once Again.\\"  Her cover of \\"Without You\\" is breathtaking, and remains the best cover she has ever done.    Aside from the songs I mentioned already, the other couple of tracks on the album are constituted of love ballads, which aren't very remarkable compared to some of Mariah's other ballads.  If you love classic Mariah Carey music, then you will love this album (in the highly unlikely event that you don't already own it).  If you like her newer songs better, then you may or may not like this, as it's pretty heavy on the ballads, and I'd suggest listening to the samples first...
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Its The Godfather come on  of course its gonna be great  Gift for someone who loves the films. even watches them on tv with the comercials, thats like 4.5 hours just for the second one. she is a fan,  She loved it  Had all three parts on three disks  and a extra disk for commentary and extras of behind the scenes,  The case looks really legit too,
B000002AVF|5.0|A full decade prior to Mimi's emancipation, there was this album.  Daydream contains some of the defining songs of my generation, whether some members of my age group want to admit it or not. Fantasy, Always Be My Baby and One Sweet Day were unavoidable radio staples. (Along with other Carey hits Hero and Dreamlover from her Music Box days).  This was the epitome pop/soft rock radio in the mid-90s, and it was great.    Fantasy, in particular, was my personal favorite single release from the album, and not just because of the genius way she reworked the 1982 Tom Tom Club \\"Genius of Love\\" hook.  The original version is a song I can still listen to and never tire of, but the remix of this particular song, which is not included on this album but is on her #1s album, introduced us to a Mariah we were going to be seeing a lot more of (literally and figuratively, for better or worse) for years to come.  This version of Mariah collaborated with a totally unexpected (gasp!) rap artist (ODB).  A huge fan of hip-hop and rap herself, this was a move she would increasingly make in her songs in every subsequent album, especially once she got around to making the likes of Rainbow and Charmbracelet.  Also, this was a move which other artists would adopt, to create a much more predicted and commonplace pop singer-rap artist collaboration style throughout the late 90s and early 2000s.    Of course, the album has its low point. \\"When I Saw You\\" has so much melisma, I have to skip over it each time. All I can think about when I hear it is that Mariah should pick a note and stick to it, instead of dancing around her notes.  Usually, I love her way of ornamenting her singing, but this song is the one instance where it's too much, even for me, a certified huge MC fan.  It's unfortunate, because if she had just sung it a little differently, it would have been a particularly beautiful song.     Fortunately, though, this is the only song I don't particularly like.  The rest of them are either good or great.  Here is my review of the great ones:    \\"Fantasy\\" such a catchy and upbeat melody, and is sung perfectly and gorgeously.  This is a prime example of the music completely fitting the lyrics, and the execution via the production, vocals, and instrumentation is perfection. \\"Image is a rapture,\\" indeed.      \\"Underneath the Stars\\" is a great sample of Mariah's vocal talent and ability to create gorgeous harmonies with herself as one or more of the backup singers.     \\"Melt Away\\" is classic Mariah and Babyface.  It has the typical '90s synthesized ballad background, but the beat is nice, and the singing is smooth and soothing.  Plus, Mariah dips into her lowest register on this one, which is something she should do a little more often than she does.      \\"I am Free\\" and \\"Looking In\\" I am grouping these together since they represent truly introspective and personal lyrics, and are a nice addition to the collection on the album, between the pop and love ballads.  Mariah did not have a great personal life at the time of this album, and these songs may or may not be a reflection of that.  Whether or not they were written about Mariah's real life, the themes in the songs can be generalized to others' lives so her listener can relate, and in the case of \\"Looking In,\\" sung in a very understated and accessible way.    This album represented only the beginning of a turning point in Mariah's musical styles and her career.  It is a definite must-have for anyone who enjoys pop music and '90s balladry.

B003E8P9G0|2.0|When I opened this book, I had expected more of Mr. Riordan.  The beginning is quite the same with someone close turning out to be a god/godess.  Then came the attack of a monster. Also, a parent dies while the other parent was missing.  Honestly, this was the same beginning as Percy Jackson, except with egypt myths.  He flaked out on the readers this time.

B004DWKO8Y|4.0|Much to my (incredibly happy) surprise I happened to notice this title and, yes, Mr Big is (surprisingly) back, after disbanding several years ago, and with the original line up of Martin, Gilbert, Sheehan & Torpey.      Is it a good surprise?  Well, (mostly) yes and no.    Anyone who knows the band knows that they are arguably the most talented rock act currently producing albums (there is no need to bore you with their individual technical prowess) and, on average, they probably get to flex their considerable musical muscle more on this release than any other....but this does not mean it's their best work to date.  In terms of recent releases I would rate this as a significant improvement over the last Paul Gilbert album (Hey Man) but, regrettably, not as good as either of the Ritchie Kotzen albums.    Thankfully, although a Frontiers production, the (sound) quality appears to be above average albeit still shy of previous titles.  In terms of song selection, there is not a (complete) dud on display, and as always for me, I'll like it the more times its played; top tracks are 3, 9, 10 and in particular, 1 & 7.    Glad to see the boys back together, and on this showing hope that it sells enough units to get them doing more; nice to see Paul Gilbert back and, comparatively, he does shred a little more here than usual (perhaps the reason he left in the first place?) but my favourite Mr Big guitar solo is still 'The whole world's gonna know' (from Bump Ahead).    If you like their previous albums then this should have something you'll enjoy.....and when the talent/ability is this good then it should have some merit for anyone with an interest in rock; executed by 4 guys who really know how to play.    Happy listening!
B003Y5H542|3.0|My 9 year old nephew asked me to take him to see Rango, because he bought the Rango video game. Rango is entertaining, but for adults only. In the theater, almost every child was under 6 years old, my nephew was one of the few older children movie viewers, and he didn't understand most of the jokes and believe me, he is very bright. Some words mentioned in the film are; metaphor, epiphany, and Putanesca. What kid knows what these words mean?  I bet some adults don't even know the meaning of these words. Every time I laughed (which wasn't many times) at one of the adult jokes, my nephew would ask what the joke meant. How do you explain what epiphany and metaphor means to a 9 year old in a movie theater?  To top it off, every time I laughed, other kids around me were asking their Mom's, \\"what does that mean?\\"  Even though this film is mildly entertaining for adults, I just don't get what Nickelodeon had in mind for this film. Did they expect the kids only to enjoy the animation but not understand the dialogue? In retrospect, this film really can't be enjoyed by the adults who brought children to the theater OR the children, because the adults were being bombarded with questions from kids not understanding the dialogue. Nickelodeon showed a total disrespect for the young movie viewers of Rango by inserting dialogue they would never understand, I felt that Nickelodeon thought the kids would be satisfied enough with the animation only, and wouldn't care if the lesson of the story was never understood by the kids, young American children are very smart and curious in this day and age and should be shown more respect by Hollywood.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Albert King had a well-earned reputation as a mean, cantankerous old cuss. Watching the smile dance across his face throughout this incredible session is nothing short of remarkable. As is the music. Watch Albert teach himself \\"Pride and Joy\\" by watching Stevie play it, and then watch him make it his own.  Stevie is clearly holding back, toning down his licks out of deference for one of his true mentors. But he sines like only SRV could nonetheless. You can see just how deeply King influenced him, and where he took those licks from there.  (Stevie is also so wasted he can't even remember the words to his own songs. Once or twice the camera catches him sucking air through his nose in a manner that anyone who worked with him would recognize as his post-coke check. That he could play as well as he did during his drug-fueled years made many people thing that drugs were what made him play so fast. What a a blessing we all got when he sobered up and everyone could seethe drugs had been holding him back.)  Note: I have seen some critics who complain that Albert was out of tune for much of this session. Not true. I even ran it through an oscilloscope to check the frequency levels, and Albert was well within harmonic match with Stevie. Must just be some critics who didn't see where the old master was headed from moment to moment.  I miss these guys. I love this DVD/CD set. Buy it.

These characters say things guys wouldn't say to themselves let alone out loud. Okay, never mind the cartoon dialog ---- this is a cool ride.<br /><br />The movie is broken up into 3 segments and wrapped in the introduction amounting to 5 minutes in the beginning. The movie starts with one character and ends with him.<br /><br />So, sit back, have a couple of bruskies and a shot of whiskey and strap in. It's going to be a bumpy ride.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I was going to start off this review with a quote of the lyrics from my favorite song on the album, but I couldn't choose one. My favorite depends on the mood I'm in when I listen.    The Wandering Kind - instrumental, and very lovely. Upbeat and hopeful-sounding.  Bells of New York City - beautifully haunting. I can feel myself there, seeing and hearing what his words describe.  Galileo - I have to admit, I'm not hugely thrilled with this one. I think the concept is great, and his singing is wonderful. The end of the song is lovely. It just feels choppy and disjointed to me, and I find the lyrics in parts hard to take seriously. That said, it's hard not to sing along with it, and the end of the song makes up for any awkwardness in the rest of it.  L'Ora Dell'Addio - gentle and almost operatic, the perfect showcase for his perfect voice.  Hidden Away - very different. I love the chorus and the way his voice almost seems to be at play. A heartwarming message to the lyrics.  Au Jardin des Sans-Pourquoi - again, just lovely. I feel like I'm soaring when I listen to this one.  Higher Window - Touching and sad, almost desperate.  If I Walk Away -  Catchy music to go with lyrics I can really relate to. It feels very... Human.  Love Only Knows - beautiful. This song just pulls me in, with the hopefulness and uncertainty of love clear in every word and note.  Voce Existe Em Mim - this has to be one of the coolest songs on any of his albums. The beat is amazing, and the music sets off the sound of his voice in absolutely fascinating ways. I like to turn the volume up high and let this one take me on its journey.  War at Home - deeply moving. It makes me want to take someone's hand and hold on tight.  London Hymn - absolutely gorgeous! His voice blends with the chorus in an almost classical-sounding piece. Far too short. I could listen to a whole album of just this kind of song.  Straight to You - I'm not even sure how to describe this one except to say that it gives me the chills. The harmonies of the singers in the background, the gentle yet almost fierce feel of it, all second to the chilling lyrics and the images and feelings they provoke.    This is easily his best album yet. His voice has amazing warmth and depth to it, quite literally awe-inspiring in places. The music is breathtaking in its beauty, especially some of the harmonies both vocal and instrumental. The imagery in the lyrics is just stunning. I've been a fan of Josh Groban since the first time I heard his first album, but Illuminations is seriously something special.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Product: Playstation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller, by Sony.<br />Rating: 4 1/2 stars<br /><br />LIKES:<br /><br />* QUALITY:  In my experience, when it comes to controllers for the PS3, you pretty much get what you pay for.  Over the years, I've owned a PS1, a PS2, and a PS3, and at various times I've tried 3rd party controllers in an attempt to add multiplayer capability at a more reasonable price ... and unfortunately, I've rarely been happy.  As long as you can afford it, this seems to be the best controller you can get for the PS3 ... it has the best balance of heft, solid construction, good tactile resistance in the buttons and thumbsticks, excellent durability, good vibration feel, good communication range, reasonably fast charge time (2.5 hrs or less), and a long-lived battery.<br /><br />NITS:<br /><br />* Price: Authentic Sony controllers are expensive ... but as mentioned above, you generally get what you pay for.<br /><br />* Charging Cord not included: You'd think that in purchasing a spare/replacement controller that it would come with a charging cord, right ?  Nope.  Sony deliberately omits it, and instead instructs customers to \\"use the one that comes with your PS3\\".  I recently purchased a charging station to eliminate that bottleneck ... which was probably Sony's goal in witholding charging cords from their spare controllers.<br /><br />* Minor design issues:<br />(a) when putting the controller down during active play, there's an occasional tendency for one of the L2/R2 buttons to activate if you're not gentle.  A pair of small support feet on the front of the controller, placed just behind and below those 2 buttons, would solve that.<br />(b) I wish the charging cord connector port was indented slightly, to be self-guiding, to make connections faster and more eyes-free.<br />(c) L3 & R3 are too easily unintentionally activated while using the sticks for movement in many games ... case in point is Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, where you FREQUENTLY end up squatting in mid-combat, while maneuvering during a melee, which is very frustrating.  They need to increase the activation pressure for L3/R3 slightly in order to solve that.<br /><br />Bottom line: I've tried several other brands, and even though the Sony controller is the most expensive among them, it's also the best.  Highly Recommended.a melee, which is very frustrating.  They need to increase the activation pressure for L3/R3 slightly in order to solve that.

030745455X|5.0|This book is a lot more interesting than the first one. In hindsight The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo looks like a prequel, an introduction to the story.<br />I like Salander a lot. She deserves respect. A person who follows her own rules of morality (humane ones), regardless of what society is trying to impose on her and her surroundings. She is a very likeable young lady.<br />Hats off to her.
B003W5C0VW|3.0|The Stones in concert is always a stimulating event, this one don't miss.  We return to 1972, the \\"Exile On Main Street\\" tour, it's one of the hottest Rolling Stones concert.  To the fan: buy it and enjoy it.
0061726826|5.0|This is a book that could easily be worth reading only for the premise. The dystopian concept that Lauren Oliver came up with is beyond fascinating. Every single time she describes the disease I felt my mind was blown a bit. I kept wondering if one can really miss love if you've never known it? Would you really live a dull-full life for fear of pain? As much as I think I couldn't, I think people who've been really hurt would say yes. Anyway, my point is that the world-building in Delirium was fantastic.     The writing, oh, the writing. Lauren Oliver has a gift with words. Such beautiful prose that this might be one of the most quotable books I've read. It's like a story made of poetry, absolutely stunning.
0670022411|5.0|Bought on Audible<br /><br />What I Loved: I am going to warn you that this may be a rambling review.  I adored this book!  I thought it was well written, thought out, and presented.  I think the author (or whoever wrote the blurb) did themselves a HUGE disservice comparing it to Twilight because it is nothing like that angsty series.  This is not full of love triangles, weak leading ladies, or teenagers.  This book is full of action, adventure, history, love (both of the main characters and their family/friends), intrigue, and mystery.  The leading lady Diana is a wonderful example of someone who has spent most of her life hiding from who she is and developing a life outside of it.  She is Harvard educated, a brilliant scholar, and leading a relatively normal life till her magic makes her understand that she can't just turn her back on being witch.  This unfolds slowly through most the book and what I liked was watching the stages.  Yes, they unfolded over a short amount of time (3 weeks or so) but each one was deliberate.  Much like her falling in love with Matthew, a fellow scholar but also a Vampire.  In the world in which Ms. Harkness created, the 3 non-human species are not supposed to mix.  This book, which is the first in the trilogy, introduces you to this world, gives you a starting glimpse into the troubles to come, and does an excellent job of drawing you in and keeping you interested.<br /><br />What I Liked:  Attention to detail both large and small.  The landscape, people, and world were brilliantly described and introduced.<br /><br />Complaints:  The \\"I Love You\\" does get bit repetitive between Matthew and Diana but that is just a personal preference that I know they are going to say before parting.  I don't actually have to read it.<br /><br />Audio Specific Review:  EXCELLENT Narration by Jennifer Ikeda.  She managed to capture the essence of every character (and there quite a few) very well.  My favorite was Izabo, her presentation of that character was spot on and fun!<br /><br />Why I Gave it a 5  (and kind of why you would not necessarily): I really enjoy long, sweeping tales when they are done right with lots of detail, strong story, and likable characters.  I grew up reading books like The North and The South, The Westward Ho Series,  and later they were joined by The Stand and Outlander.  These type of books require time, commitment, and an understanding the action will not always be fast and furious.  This book was excellent in the pacing, storytelling, and character building.  I was never bored and always wanted to know what happened next.  I was sad when the book ended and I didn't have the 2nd one there ready to go.<br /><br />Who I would recommend it too:  This is tough!  This isn't a PNR (though it does have a love story) and it isn't a Thriller/Mystery (though it does have both elements in it).  This is however a very well written book that I think fans of books like The Outlander series may enjoy.  This isn't going to be for everyone (aka the reason I have seen reviews from 2 to 5) but those that love it are going to be passionate about it!<br /><br />Author Website: [...]I Gave it a 5  (and kind of why you would not necessarily): I really enjoy long, sweeping tales when they are done right with lots of detail, strong story, and likable characters.

0439023521|1.0|How does the experience of reading Hunger Games compare with an equivalent number of hours at the joystick playing Mortal Kombat?  Well in Mortal Konbat, the plot twists are likely more probable, the internal logic more consistent, and the underlying moral value somewhat more lofty.  At least the online gamer slaughters relentless hoards of mutants or beefy professional mercenaries.  He is not asked to participate in the killing of unarmed innocents that he has come to like, and then fault them for their deaths.  At least one among the \\"career tributes\\" (game-victims) is a psychopath.  This is Cato.  He says of our heroine \\"When we find her, I get to kill her in my own way, and no one interferes.\\"  We are invited to hate Cato and to celebrate his death.  This is a most unfair device it seems to me for it shifts blame for the game's atrocities to one of its victims.  Cato by the way is killed finally by a pack of zombie dogs that are the reincarnated children who have been murdered earlier in the game.         Let me say it differently.  If killing Cato by calling up murdered children from the dead and reincarnating them as a pack of zombie dogs is a satisfactory resolution to the novel's central conflicts and themes, then what are the novel's central conflicts and themes?  What is the crime that justifies--in moral terms--such terrible retribution?  There is none because the dogs have no judgment.  The dog pack is not an arrow aimed with some clear intent; it is a bomb set off in a crowd.  The dogs would have killed Katniss just as quickly as they did Kato.  It's simply random and mindless murder without purpose.         Among the other dead, one is a young girl who's been nicknamed Foxface.  Any girl called Foxface by other girls deserves to die, does she not?  No one need cry for her.  Or so Collins would have it.  Here's the female tribute from District 1 before the slaughter: \\"With that flowing blonde hair, emerald green eyes, her body tall and lush, she'ssexy all the way.\\"  Oh, she's wearing a see-though gown by the way.  We have several of these titillating beauty-contest moments in the book that are presented without any sense of irony or cynicism.         So let's be clear.  Suppose you are presented with two works of imaginative art--both artists being adults.  The first is a pen and ink drawing of two children engaged in a pornographic act.  The second is a passage from a novel that graphically describes one child killing another.  Sensing where I'm headed with this, you might stop me with the complaint, \\"But that's unfair.  The passage is taken out of context.  The killing takes place in a work of fiction with overall artistic value.\\"  But does it?  The charge I'm so clumsily making is that the tone of meritorious futuristic or fantasy fiction is a masquerade that makes the pornography of death palatable.         The troublesome question is then, is Collins herself the faceless Gamemaker of the novel?  It seems so.  It is she and she alone who designs and inflicts the injustices and the abuses and the deaths of children simply for the entertainment those grim outcomes provide.  Collins seems a statistic bully.
0375804013|5.0|I remember this book well.<br /><br />I remember Grover's initial shock at the discovery that there is, indeed, a monster lurking at the end of the book in my hands.<br /><br />I remember the whispered entreaty to please, please not turn the page - adorable, fuzzy Grover does not want to see the monster!<br /><br />I remember the increasingly desperate attempts Grover makes to stop me from turning the pages: tying the book together with rope, building brick walls between pages, nailing the book shut, each one rendered perfectly with light-hearted illustrations, each time Grover's panic growing as the end of the book grows ever nearer.<br /><br />I remember the feeling of delight and the sense of power as I turned the pages despite Grover's warnings, overcoming his obstacles again and again, heart racing as the monster at the end of the book grows closer...closer...<br /><br />(It's no wonder I'm such a fan of horror fiction as an adult. This book set me up for life.)<br /><br />I remember turning the final page, past Grover's final adorable plea, to discover...<br /><br />What, you think I'm going to TELL you?! Think again - read this book to your kids or better yet, let them read it for themselves. Let them discover the nature of fear and the strength in conquering it, the fun of having a character in a book interact with them directly.<br /><br />They'll remember it for the rest of their lives.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|What i use these headphones for is mostly Black Ops, and i can tell you personally it REALLY helps! a few things, they are a little uncomfortable after a while-- just take them off for 5mins and you'll be fine. another thing is, i read alot of reviews saying their sensitive and can break easy so im realllllll afraid of that >.> haven't noticed, and i hope i never do. I will put a photo later on today, for now this is my Review.   I rate them 4.5 Stars!     but yes, i do recommend these headphones for anyone thats serious about gaming, or someone that wants to step up their game, or would like good sound to get the best of their money worth from the ps3.     Happy Gaming guys :)
B002NOAF9W|4.0|It's a good collector's item, with original stock, for the 40th anniversary. A little bit too expensive, but the real fan must have it.  In the musical part, the sound is very good, it's like a time machine to return to the greatest concert in the rock'n roll history. A supplement disc leave the performance of B.B. King and Ike & Tina Turner. A bonus DVD leave a 5 songs live prestation of the Stones in this historical concert.  I also bought the Guitar Tab Edition of the album, good complement of the kit, and a lot of pleasant hours.  For the real fans...

B002ZG976U|5.0|If the critics hate something, that usually means I would love it. This movie follows that rule nicely. It is 2 hours of pure escapism with wonderful songs, marvelous dance numbers and a reasonable plot.    Cher comes through like the trooper she is. It's hard to believe she's 65 years old! The real surprise for me though was Christina Aquilera--such a big voice in such a small package. I hope to see her in other movies.    To the critics who hate this movie let me say this, remember the old adage about opinions. It certainly applies to you.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|While the book was a little slow in the beginning the story was so well thought out and developed that the shortcuts taken in the movie were very noticeable.  While it was still a good story the book was full of details even to the dialect spoken in the North.  The liberties that were taken for the movie somewhat diminshed the story for me, I hate when that happens.
1594202842|4.0|Having grown up with my own Tiger Mother, I thought this book was really interesting...I never thought about the work my mom put into me growing up and this book opened my eyes to that.  Having said that, my mom was nowhere near the degree of Tiger Mother as described here.  In the end I appreciated the effort and perspective.  I was however disappointed in the ending...I was hoping for some more introspective thoughts on the pros and cons rather than the quick conclusion reached.  In fact, I didn't walk away thinking she'd really learned anything...instead she was as stubborn about the supposed lesson as she was in making her daughters stick to such a disciplined regimen of activities.     It's worth the read.  Definitely gives insight into an Asian household.  And might even inspire you to push your children to be a little more than what they want to be at age 8.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Hi, I just wanted to say that I totally thought that splitting the movie into two parts was the best idea the writers and producers could have had. this book was so detailed that it would have been a tragedy to keep it in one movie. The movie left me excited for the second part. There were some intense parts and funny parts. I find a movie with all this exciting and the detail and feelings went in well.  The acting by all was very good showing frustration and love and admiration, this movie is different from the others as it doesn't make you scream because they added too much that wasn't there and not enough of what was. Harry in the cupboard at the beginning showed just how big he's grown and how small he was when he started.  I simply cannot wait for this movie to come out on dvd and to see the part 2 in the theaters
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great work out! The first day I couldn't do everything but tried to keep up. The next day EVERYTHING was sore! But I did it anyway, pushing myself to work thru the soreness. A couple of days later the soreness was gone and I was doing all the moves along with the dvd. Each level gets harder as Jillian promises but not too hard that it's impossible. I love that it's only 20 minutes! That times FLYS by so fast. A 20 min a day workout is easy to commit to!! I'm on day 26 and I'm already shopping for a new dvd to do next. I don't want to lose this momentum!
0670022411|1.0|This book is a waste of paper. No pay off, and very little happens. When something epic should take place it is diffused easily, and nothing comes of the slow build up. Protagonists appear with little introduction, and the only scary thing they do is talk.....do not take my short review lightly, because I have read this book and my words match the situation perfectly.

The book is fantastic - even more so because as I was reading it, I could remember parts of his thoroughly enjoyable presentation. Buy this book. If you ever have the opportunity to hear him speak in person, take it. It will change your outlook on life. After hearing him speak a 2nd time, I went out and bought additional copies of the book to give away as gifts. I love this book.

0439023521|5.0|Alright so starting out this is a very good Sci-Fi book. It is centered in North America, old USA. I predict the book is about 100 years after present time. The Hunger Games is an event done yearly to punish rebels and remind them that the Capitol is stronger. What they do is have each District send forth one boy and one girl decided upon by draw. The Tributes are then sent into an arena to fight to the death. The reason they do this is because 75 years ago the Districts had a rebellion against the Capitol. The Hunger Games is basically the Capitol's way of saying \\"We're still bigger and stronger than you\\".      What does Katniss do in the book? Good question. I will answer this after I tell you SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!! Katniss's sister gets her name drawn and she instantly volunteers to go up instead. Everyone is so stunned at the thought of it that no-one says a word. Anyone from District 12 basically knows that going into the Games is a certain death sentence. Katniss doesn't care though,  she wants to save her sister. I won't go deeper into the plot because I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading this.      Conclusion- EPIC BOOK. The author's purpose is to entertain, and boy was I entertained! I didn't find any moral but then again I have trouble finding morals in anything. I recommend it because it's a great read and can get a bit emotional, but not too much. If you read this book be prepared for chills down your spine and you will frequently block out the world around you.
0670022411|4.0|Vampires, Demons, and of course Witches. Many of my favorite things. Don't read into the statement that the book has a resemblance to Twilight, there is way too much history in this book to be compared to Twilight. The romance isn't as immediate either, it is a bit more realistic in that sense.<br /><br />I like books that have a historical basis entwined with the fictional world, but this one was a bit heavy on the historical bits for me. Instead of learning about their history through being there (as in Anne Rice's Interview With A Vampire), we learn their history simply by being told about it. That relates to being bored by those details when nothing is happening but story time.<br /><br />The characters of Diana and Matthew are so very well written that this pulls the novel back up to being very readable. Diana is at times annoying with her reasoning for behaving the way she does and you are never quite sure about Matthew's intention's, which keeps it intriguing. Some of the other characters within the novel make smaller appearances and I hope to see more of them in the rest of the trilogy. If you love historical fiction with a bit of paranormal thrown in, this is the book for you.
B004132I4S|1.0|Honestly, I cannot imagine a fan of, say, \\"Illinois\\" who would find this even listenable.  Truly one of the hugest \\"WTF?\\" moments in modern music.  There is very little here that sounds like the Sufjan Stevens we have come to love, and contrary to what some folks will tell you, being \\"different\\" and confounding your listeners' expectations is not ALWAYS a good thing.  I'd like to refer those who claim that Sufjan is just trying to get us out of our limited idea of what he should do with this half-baked, underwritten, over-effected, largely-electronic mish-mash to listen to, I don't know, Neil Young's \\"Trans\\" for proof that \\"different\\" or \\"shaking things up\\" is not an automatic pass for an established artist.  I have a very hard time with this record, I'll admit.  Listened to it twice so far. Felt like I owed him that, at least, considering how much I like most of his previous output (especially \\"Illinois\\").  Not getting it, not feeling it, and honestly, not really able to listen any more.  I don't think I can suffer through another attempt to like it.  I could feel my finger ACHING to hit the fast-forward button the very first time I listened to this.      Really a disappointment.
0070511136|2.0|SPIN Selling was the first book I read on sales where I didn't feel like I had to take a shower afterwards. Neil Rackham is the grandfather of making sales a respectable profession.    He helped a lot of salespeople out of the presentation ppt trap.    The problem was that he did this through questions. Although questions can work, I just feel stories are better. Here's why:    Buyers hate feeling manipulated and asking questions can feel like an interrogation painting the Buyer into a corner.    Also, salespeople can get lost in a sea of questions and lose sight of the story they are trying to sell.    Isn't it just easier to provide the Salesperson with the right message delivered through mini-stories to help the Buyer discover that the status quo is no longer acceptable. These stories work because they present a scenario that allows Buyers to develop awareness through their own sense of discovery. Buyers trust this discovery because they made it and they begin to trust the Story Seller for telling it. When the Buyer can picture the issues  in the real world scenario, it helps them see how the results may apply to them and they start to make sense- they gain insight. Stories transport the Buyer from the role of critic into the role of participant.    In short, Stories allow the Buyer to take your offering for a virtual mental test drive: Could you ask for more?    I feel that it's easier to help the Buyer decide to change through the use of use 5-20 mini-stories followed by a few basic qualification questions instead of 50-250 discovery questions.    Indeed, stories are easier to remember, faster to execute and more natural to deliver. This is nothing new, just look at the Bible, it's all about stories. Stories are how we make sense of the world. We know how to tell stories; we just have to make sure we tell the right ones. at InsightDemand

1439102724|2.0|I want to start by saying that to my mind Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Piccoult is one of the finest books I've ever read in my life. When an author writes a book like that you want to read everything else they do, so I have. And mostly they are pretty good, well written, sympathetic interesting characters and sure a little formulaic but not in a bad way, and besides how many ways can a story be told. Anyone is going to stick with what works. I didnt like My Sisters Keeper much but I did really like The Ninth Circle and House Rules so I kept buying and reading. But this one is frankly a dud. I totally appreciate the subject matter and kudo's to Ms. Piccoult for bravely choosing to take it on. The subject is timely and its an important one. That said, while it started well it fell quickly. Its not believable, the heroine remarries a month later?  The husband who is a total loser betrays the only person who was ever good to him his own brother?  The book is no page turner, it goes for the easy sentimentality while trying to justify behavior in its main characters that can never be justified and no I'm not talking about the comically awful so called church. That last one she hit dead on, and it may make the book worthwhile. I'm particularly offended by the ending, its just badly unrealistic. I wont write a spoiler alert I'll just ask how the woman who wrote the dark but brilliant ending to Nineteen Minutes could have sold out so badly?

B004I2K4DY|5.0|If you have or have not seen any of the Les Miserables productions,you must see and hear this production.  I viewed it on PBS twice and simply had to add it to my collection of this musical.  The lighting, symphony orchestra, choir, are fabulous!!!!!!  Then come the vocalists...and they are marvelous...all of them.  Pay attentioon to the reception by the audience reciprocating back across the footlights.  I was torn between pleasure and tears of appreciation.  Buy it!!!!!  You'll love it!!!!!
B004L3AR0K|2.0|I had seen previews of this movie and was excited when it came out on DVD. However, I was so disappointed when I watched it. I did watch it all the way through hoping it would get better. To be honest it just aggravated me. I think that it had the potential to be a great movie but fail short.
1933492910|5.0|This is one of the finest books on the art of animal anatomy to reach the shelves, in years. Terryl Whitlatch is a master of animal anatomy, and takes that very linear descriptive work into the realm of the fantastic. These are animals that have lived on this world, do live on this world, and those that may have developed on alternate planets, somewhere outside of out galaxy. The spread sheets are keen to details, and leads the reader to speculative wonder where these animals may have lived, and the conditions under which they may have developed. She is a member of Gnomon, masters of creation in the digital domain, and has worked on creature design for George Lucas on several of the Star Wars films. These works are not digitally created, rather by her fine tuned hands and extensive study in Zoology. We had considered her to be an artist so rare, we had her commissioned to create two pieces for our home; one of which appears in the book, our little Pugopus. There is little text to bog down the viewer with a distraction from the visuals. Grab a copy soon, you'll be pleasantly rewarded.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I LOVE this movie. Rented it at the redbox with low expectations because I love Christina Aguilera. Watched it and fell in love. The music makes you dance, the actors are splendid, and the story line keeps you watching to see how things unfold. I bought it less than 24 hrs after viewing it from the redbox and have watched it twice already since.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|It's hard to believe that this series was produced by the same people who made the splendid Band of Brothers. Where Band shows the Americans as heroes and liberators, Pacific portrays the U.S. Marines as victims and dupes.    Both programs led early on with a signature bit of heroism: the destruction of an artillery battery by a patrol led by Dick Winters and a night battle with some sort of vague heroics by John Basilone. While skillfully portraying the fog of war, Band of Brothers makes Winters' heroism very clear. It is never clear just what happens in Pacific. There is a night battle, tracers go flying back and forth and the next morning Basilone is declared a hero. This isn't a fluke. There is a deliberate attempt to downgrade the heroics of the the Americans. Of the three central characters in The Pacific, one is wounded, one is killed and one spends time in the looney bin.     War is hell, of course, but World War II was a necessary war. Why treat the  two theaters of war so differently?    The answer, I think, has to do with the psthology of modern culture. Until the early eighties, except for the reasonable debate over the use of nuclear weapons, the war in the Pacific. like the war against the Nazis, managed to avoid the general disenchantment with war, no matter how necessary and virtuous.    Then a few college professors who had spend far too long in the ivory tower and not enough time in the real world wrote books revealing their discovery that there was a racial element to the Pacific War and that the Americans treated the Japanese brutally (somehow the good professors missed the cause of that brutality, such minor items like the Rape of Nanking and the Bataan Death March).    There matters stood until 1999, when President Clinton awarded 22 Medals of Honor to the Japanese American 442nd Regiment to redress what he called the racism of the US military against the Japanese. The award of these medals was absurd. The 442nd won two legitmate Medals of Honor during the war, a great record for a regiment which fought on a secondary front against third rate troops, was in action for less than a year and did not face any of the desperate actions that make generals hand out high honors. By contrrast, the entire Marine Corps, almost 100 times larger than an army regiment, which was in action virtually every day of the war, and fought crack troops in opposed landings and furious counterattacks, won only 84 Medals of Honor. At least some of the Medals which Clinton handed out didn't even pretend that they were awarded for anything above and beyond the call of duty.    No matter. Clinton's point was to accuse the US military of racism against Japanese and he succeeded there.    In the last decade, this effort to denigrate the Pacific War spread into popular culture with Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Father and Letters from Iwo Jima. Flags turned the heroism of Iwo Jima on its head and focused on the efforts of financiers to take advantage of the heroism of the Marines to sell war bonds. It was heroism as a capitalist tool. By contrast, Letters showed the battle from the Japanese viewpoint: men dying to protect their wives and families, dying for duty and honor.    The Pacific extends this trend, including not just war as a way to sell bonds but showing the rest of the American effort as made up of victims.    The reason for this is that the Baby Boomers are quite proud of their anti-war efforts, beginning in Vietnam (at least so long as they were still subject to the draft) and so on up to the present day. But this has resulted in horrible genocide around the world. More people of color have died in acts of genocide - in China, in Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Iraq, in Rwanda, in Darfur and now in North Africa - than died in the Shoah. Since the Baby Boomers like to think of themselves as virtuous, they need to denigrate the efforts of their forefathers to fight dictators. Hence programs like The Pacific. If you keep telling yourself that only fools and victims try to stop tyranny, you might be able to convince yourself that, contrary to Edmund Burke, all that is necessary for the triumph of liberalism is for good men to do nothing. Bunk, of course, but comforting bunk.    But a curious side effect has occurred. You keep reading a lot of writers whose fathers or grandfathers won't talk to them about World War II. These writers conclude that these old heroes are too traumatized to talk about it. This is rubbish of course. If you are over fifty, you may have vivid memories of your pal's dads telling you about hand to hand combat with a Japanese soldier, about being a Jewish GI in a Nazi POW camp, about getting wounded, driving one of Patton's tanks, about Dunkirk and D-Day. And you get two old guys together and they immediately ask each other what they did in the war.    Best of all, those of us who have come back from Iraq or Afghanistan know how these wonderful old men want to swap war stories with you. Suddenly, they aren't 90 any more. They are young and vital and the barriers of race, age, religion or ethnicity all fall away.    So if you find these old vets clamming up, it has nothing to do with them and everything to do with you. They have found that you don't measure up and you don't deserve their memories. It means that they have determined that you have no sense of concepts like duty, honor, patriotism, standing up for the weak and willingness to fight evil no matter how strong. And if you wonder why these old heroes have determined that you're inadequate, The Pacific is as good an explanation as any.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This third book in the series was a bit disappointing. The first two were so very good. This one was good, but it dragged on a bit. Was glad when it finally came to the end.
B0009VRHLK|3.0|very different type of film.if you are a fan of vincent gallo,this movie is very much like his other films.intropspective and offbeat.the controversial scene that made this film to me was not all that shocking,maybe due to the fact that the context in which the scene took place was not at all sexually charged,but more sad.a good film if you like gallo.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I'll gladly stipulate to the objections expressed in many of these reviews that are based on a knowledge of either Jane Austen or the historical period about which she wrote.  I possess neither.  But I have to take exception to the scorn heaped on the scene where Anne runs through Bath.  All of the criticism seems to stem from the same notion - that no \\"proper lady\\" of the time would do such a thing.  But that's exactly why it has such power.  To suddenly find yourself presented with the fleeting opportunity to undo the single most wrong-headed mistake you've ever made would make most \\"unthinkable\\" behavior not just plausible but dramatically logical.  Played out against a perfect musical passage and Rupert Penry-Jones's caress of a voice, her abandoning of what's proper makes perfect sense and is my favorite scene in the film.  Along with The Long Kiss, it struck me as completely right in light of what came before.  Also, no one hates giggly camera work more than I do, but here it's limited mostly to the opening sequence where it serves well the storyline of a household being torn apart by financial ruin.  All in all, I really enjoyed this film.  Fine performances all around and an unobtrusively solid musical score were the highlights for me.
B0049P1ZZQ|1.0|Well after a long week at work etc and very excited to sit down and watch our very newly opened package of The Walking Dead season 1, our player suddenly shows in MASSIVE words saying that the region of the disc does not match the region of the player!  WTF!!! We checked to our absolute astonishment and have realised that our BD is locked to a country. Now Amazon has clearly stated that it is region locked to 1 BUT does not state in ANY WAY that its BD is locked to region A which is VERY different to regions 1,2,3,4,5,6. BD are completely different kettle of fish as we have discovered........SO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN PURCHASING AN OVERSEAS BD PRODUCT THAT YOU CHECK OUT IF REGION A,B, OR C!!!  Bitterly and extremely disappointed and waste of money for us :(
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|Another Great Movie by Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia. A must Get Action Movie.  If you Like Action Movies????????
B003Y5H53S|4.0|I don't know how to define Rango. I went to the movie theater with my 6 year old daughter expecting to see a funny movie about a chameleon and was served something completely unexpected. The trailer showing an eagle hunting our poor chameleon must be the most misleading trailer ever.  This movie is not for kids. At least not for the ones younger than 10 years old or so. It is mature and it has very adult concepts (the dream sequence, for example) dispersed throughout.  First the technical merits: Rango is beautiful to behold. The animated characters are all great. Quirky and lovable. This is one animation you will love watching.  When it comes to the story, it must be said that things start pretty slowly. That's where you start seeing younger children starting to lose interest. The pace picks up in the middle; then slows a little once again before the finale. It is about a a lonely, delusional misfit who tries to find his place in the world. Much like any one of us. Except that he is a chameleon surrounded by evil moles and snakes and turtles and what not.  If I had gone to the movie alone it would have been a great experience. With my daughter, I was a bit uneasy knowing she wasn't getting all of the story. Mind you, my daughter is quite perceptive but I do not expect her to understand the backstory of Rango.  Nevertheless, this is a serious movie which is animated. Don't regard it as a children's movie and you will like it just fine.
0439023513|5.0|I've read other reviews of this book:  Mockingjay.  I've seen the anger at how the book ended, I've seen the regret that not every loose end was seemingly tied up.  The happiness, that in the end, Katniss chose Peeta, finally realizing that it was him she needed the enter time, that it would have always been him.    Reading the reviews...it makes me angry, it makes me sad, it makes me...it makes me...    I understand that this is a book, published, advertized and sold as YA Fiction:  for young adults coming up in the world.  It is a YA Fiction novel, but it deals with very adult themes.  Violence, death...the realization that the world isn't a fairytale, that people die, that sometimes, regardless of what you want, things happen that are out of your control.  It deals with war, it deals with the effects war can have on the individual, on a country.  There is no neat and tidy ending, where everyone you have come to care about makes it to the end.  It deals with all of this.    Just as we do; everyday of our lives.    For those frustrated over the ending, I say, What else could have happened?  This was not, despite its YA designation, a light read.  This wasn't a book that was going to have a perfect happily ever-after.  This wasn't a series filled with laughter and boy problems made complicated by silly girls seeing too much into things, or desperate girls in need of help around every corner.    This was a book of survival, of a heroine who sacrificed not only herself, but those she loved and cared about, for what she had to do in order to survive.  Because in the world she lived, a world not that far a cry from our own, survival was the best you could hope for.  We got our clean cut ending at the end of book one.  The characters you were rooting for survived.  Again, we got an ending in book two, though looser, not as clean cut, where the characters of the story survived.  And in book three, lastly, we got our characters that survived.  But not everyone survives inwar.  And with each progressive book, we lost someone else, were pulled in a little deeper, forced to care about the characters more.    For those angry about the amount of death in the third book, I say, why?  Yes, they are characters we cared about.  But again, war is messy.  People die.  Good guys and bad guys, the rebels and the Capitol.  PEOPLE DIE!  It is the basis of life that no one will live forever.  Especially in war.  Am I angry?  Yes.  Why?  Because these deaths were pointless.  Not pointless.  They served a purpose.  Physically, if not metaphorically, if not symbolically.  They died for what they believed in, who they believed in, fighting a cause worth fighting for, because Katniss had it right.  There is something significantly wrong with people who kill their own children.  And wasn't that what they were fighting to prevent?  Isn't that how it started?  Because Katniss, the girl who was on fire, stepped up for her little sister in the Hunger Games when Prim was reaped?  Showed a nation at the end of that Hunger Games that caring about one another is the only way to even hope to survive?  They were all fighting to prevent the needless death, the dictatorship of the Capitol and the mindless, wasteless death of children forced into the arena.  Finnick, Peeta, Katniss, Gale, Johanna, Haymitch...all of them.  I won't deny there were those fighting for power, but underlying it all, the characters you cared for, the characters who most identified and suffered from their participation in the Hunger Games, weren't they fighting to free their world of the iron grip held by the Capitol?  Even Katniss, despite her voting for a last Hunger Games at the end?  Didn't she, in turn, make up for her intial vote of yes by killing Coin?  Yes.    Lastly, for those who believed Katniss didn't make a single decision on her own, was pulled and prodded and following the flow of events, I remind you, she was a seventeen year old girl.  What power, really, did she have as theMockingjay, outside of being a symbol of the rebelion?  She said it herself.  No one, not even her, expected her to become the leader of Panem once Snow was gone.  She had no power within Coin's council, no voice in Snow's Capitol.  She was a rallying point, an image.  A soldier, yes, but she wasn't a leader.  How many times had she herself said that very thing throughout the whole series?  She was a girl.  A girl trying to survive in the world and in the circumstances of that world.  What could she have done?  Only so much.  And she did everything she could.    The point...I don't know the point of this book.  I can only say what I took away from it:  that the issues and adult themes present in Collins' writing are issues of the world we live in today.  Maybe not so extremem, so dramatisized.  But they are issues we all deal with.  The point, I believe, is what this world could possibly come to if we don't change our ways.  The point...is what could happen if we forget that we are human, and as such, should not be governed by our greed and pride and hatred, but by the very souls that make us human.

0385335997|5.0|Great books. You hate to finish them and look forward to the next one. She's a great romance writer.  The couples interaction with each other is strong and honest. A great great love.  I have read many many  books..romance and otherwise, I just adore this series of books. You will too.   I must warn you tho, if you have no tolerance for homo-erotica you will not like these books as Jamie has   a few men that love him too. It is not a reciprocated love but it can be a bit rough to take for a gentle   soul.  As I said, I love all of Diana Gabaldon's books.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I re-read this book, at least once a year! i just love how Jane Austin gave true strength and a mind to women in an era where we believed to only be good to have children, she made us so much more. I truly enjoy Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy go in circles about each other, as well as the the girls mother uncanny view on life. A great classic to read over and over.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|I do not want to reveal any spoilers here, but I just wished that the props team could have used fake blood that looked real.    On the other possibly severed hand, it seemed that the production team has deliberately left a few questions unanswered, perhaps in hope for a prequel. I suspect that the comic book, Saw: Rebirth, may shed some light.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Avril Lavigne built a strong fanbase and then caught herself in something of a conundrum: her first album was a pop/rock fusion with catchy radio tunes such as \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and \\"Complicated\\" mixed in with darker fare like \\"Unwanted\\" and \\"I'm with You\\"; her second album was a raw, darker rock sound with excellent hooks and still one or two pop sounds (\\"He Wasn't\\", anyone?). Then, something changed -- literally, everything. \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" was Lavigne's third album and saw her with blonde hair streaked with pink, and every song on the album drenched in goopy bubblegum pop. With this move, Lavigne's fanbase seemed to split itself in two: those who were perfectly fine with the 'new Avril' and those who desperately wanted to see her 'return to herself.'<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Lullaby\\", the oft-delayed, much-anticipated fourth album from the challenging singer-songwriter, is both a rich return to roots, a powerful maturation of what we've already seen, and also a simple look at life.<br /><br />There's been some genuine criticism of \\"Lullaby\\" from critics who decry the simplicity of the songs, but one of the complete charms of the album is that it genuinely feels like Lavigne invited listeners into her living room while she sat at her piano or strummed her guitar. There's no grand procession of chords because Lavigne cannily realised, she didn't need them. \\"Lullaby\\" is not just a song detailing her failed marriage, it's a firm introspection on how far she's come from the teenage mall-punk she started out as. The singer stated herself that most of the songs were written in her bed or whatever hotel room she was staying in, and it truly, truly shows.<br /><br />But there's still so much of the Avril that we all have come to know and love over the years as well. \\"What the Hell\\", written with Max Martin, could have jumped right off of \\"The Best Damn Thing\\", while the Alanis-like kiss-off \\"Smile\\" reaches back to the feel of \\"Under My Skin\\", and for those thirsting for the innocence of \\"Let Go\\" tracks such as \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" is echoed in \\"Darlin'\\", a song written by Lavigne when she was still fifteen years old. Opening up with the oddly eerie piano tinkle \\"Black Star\\" written for Lavigne's new fragrance line before moving into the rest of the album, \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" has proven itself to be perhaps Lavigne's best album yet.<br /><br />Intimate, beautiful, and above all simple, \\"Lullaby\\" lets go of all of the old tricks while still echoing everything that made Lavigne likable in the first place. Sad and introspective yet never whiny, gorgeous tracks like \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"4 Real\\" are longing ballads, while \\"Not Enough\\" is perhaps one of the best musings of the album as Lavigne comes to grips with the fact that some relationships fail, despite love still being there, through no real fault of the participants. Her ex-husband Derrick Whibly is a member of Sum 41 and his presence was overpowering in the music of \\"The Best Damn Thing\\"; on \\"Lullaby\\" he is a gentle guider and also a phantom hovering over the most longing ballads while still allowing Lavigne to poke a bit of fun with \\"Smile\\" and \\"What the Hell\\".<br /><br />\\"Goodbye\\" is the true lullaby of the album and the sweeping piano ballad that provided the album's name, bringing everything to a close as Lavigne stretches her vocals beyond what we've really heard before. An extremely good decision was to provide a bonus track of sorts and close the album with the power ballad \\"Alice\\" that Lavigne wrote for the 2010 film \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". The song puts Lavigne in the point-of-view of Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole to Wonderland and making the decision to control her own fate and take charge of her life. It's a powerful song and the extended version with a whole new verse provides an uplifting, beautiful end to the album as she assures the world that she is, indeed, alright.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" is far from a perfect album - the chords aren't too terribly original and the lyrics aren't going to be winning any awards for poetry anytime soon. But the simplicity of the album is its true strength, as Lavigne wrote every song herself (or at least had a heavy hand in them). She invited her listeners in on the most intimate record she's yet produced, and while critics may not have been impressed it was everything that her fans have been waiting for, perhaps joining the fans of the split-personality-Avrils together again and proving that this is one artist with true staying power. If anything, \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" is a powerful break-up album with quite a few standouts, and a marvellous entry into Lavigne's discography.<br /><br />I eagerly await her fifth album and I, for one, feel justly rewarded in waiting for the release of \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" after skipping out on \\"The Best Damn Thing\\".<br /><br />Five out of five stars.any awards for poetry anytime soon.

B000AYEL6U|2.0|This miniseries let me down. My friend recommended \\"Wives and Daughters\\" to me, which I watched and LOVED, and then she told me about this one, claiming it was even better. I highly disagree with that. Maybe if I had gone into it unprejudiced and with a more open mind, it would have been better. I haven't read the book yet. Also, I watched the whole thing in one sitting; not saying that's a better or worse way to watch a miniseries, but I'm sure it contributed to my frustrations which are [spoiler alert!!!!!!]:<br /><br />1. While I definitely think Ms. Denby-Ashe is a beautiful woman, I must say that it felt like at least half the shots in the film were closeups of her being pensive and mystical. I don't know whether I should critique the character, the cinematography, the directing, or the acting - because honestly it could have been a combination of all those factors. All I know is that I got sick of looking at her looking melancholy.<br /><br />2. I don't \\"get\\" why Thornton is so dreamy. He's almost literally scowling the entire time until the very last scene! Not to mention he totally beats a man! It was hard to get over that for me, and start liking him as a person. I \\"get\\" that he did it for the good of the mill, but still.<br /><br />3. I don't \\"get\\" WHEN Thornton falls in love with her. I really couldn't tell that he was interested in her, until suddenly poof, he's smitten. I thought he was being honest when he tells his sister and mom that he's totally indifferent to her. And then he wants to marry her? WHEN did this happen? She didn't lead him on AT ALL. In fact, it makes it seem like she really dislikes him almost until the last scene!!<br /><br />4. Anachronisms ruin period dramas. What is up with her getting in trouble for being seen at the train with her brother, and then going ahead and kissing - and then returning home with, and unchaperoned at that! - Thornton in the final train scene? Would this really have happened? It seemed highly inconsistent, a scene clearly tailor-made for 21st century viewers to swoon. But all I could think was, \\"yeaaaaaah...suuuuuure...\\"<br /><br />5. I don't \\"get\\" the redeeming qualities of the North. The way it is portrayed in the series, it is a damp, gloomy, lonely place. The only friends Margaret has there are either extremely cold, or secret mill worker friends. I actually found it interesting how she grows to like the Thorntons, but the series was way, way, way one-sided in its portrayal of the places. The South was a sunny, green paradise, while the North was all gloom, doom, and poverty. And suddenly at the end, she likes it? Tell me Margaret, WHAT did you like? WHAT are you defending? Because the series didn't leave much to like about the North at all.<br /><br />6. The series tried to show multiple viewpoints, from mill owner, to pro-union mill workers, and one anti-union mill worker. This was the interesting part of the film. I think I get what they were trying to say: that labor and unions and class divisions are not black and white. But when my husband walked in and asked me, \\"So, why are the workers striking?\\" and I couldn't answer beyond, \\"well, I think they want more money.\\" - that's when I realized the miniseries left some gaping holes in the plot. WHY did the strike happen? I still can't say for sure. If it's not in the scope of the film to explain WHY, then why include it at all? Anyway, it was a major part of the plot, not just a secondary thing they included!<br /><br />7. I agree with what another reviewer wrote about the director seeming to want to kill everybody off in one section. I really didn't feel anything when the anti-union mill worker dies, to be honest. And his death was supposed to be a climax??<br /><br />8. Talk about a deus ex machina ending! By this point in the series, it just made me laugh to find out that [OKAY SERIOUSLY SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!] the only way things were going to end up working out happily ever after was that her dad hada wealthy AND dying best friend. How convenient. And so the moral of the story is: \\"If you're rich, you can afford to be happy.\\" Great moral, not.<br /><br />9. So many reviewers, and people I've talked to, have said they enjoy it when he professes his love to her in the end because it's so romantic. Well, apparently they were watching a different version than me, because there is no lover's profession! I watched the end again to make sure! \\"Proposal Scene\\"? WHAT proposal? He says, \\"You're coming home with me!?\\" and that's the entiiiiiire extent of it. Okay, sure, that's romantic, but a proposal? Wow. Maybe you all know something I don't know from the book, but standing alone, the miniseries' ending was a huge let down because nothing really gets explicitly resolved! She holds his hand, okay, but do they get married? Do they live in Milton? Is she happy?<br /><br />10. This will be an unfair criticism, and I'll get angry comments by die-hard North and South fans, I'm sure. But it was one of the main reasons the film was not as fun for me. One of my favorite things about watching period dramas is enjoying the pretty clothes and hair. There were some pretty clothes, Margaret does have pretty hair, but for me, the costumes did not get even close to the amount of attention that they do in \\"Wives and Daughters\\" (okay, so maybe that's a bad comparison because I'm sure that at least half of THAT series was about the clothing!). I get that this was not an important aspect to this film's theme. But it was a let down for me nonetheless.<br /><br />I will say that I found it entertaining, interesting, and fun to watch, and I would recommend period drama lovers see it.

B004AYCWY4|1.0|Given that there is plenty of evidence about the reality of evolution, why is it necessary to (boringly) assert, about 12 times in the first chapter, that \\"evolution is a fact\\".  Restating it doesn't make it more true.  Also, Dawkins evidently doesn't know about reproduction in bees (male bees wanting to be attractive to female bees?) or why peahens might find peacocks with resplendent tails attractive (other than visually), about statistics, or about many other details of biology, math, and animal behavior.  Lots of junk here in what could have been an otherwise solid argument if written with more care.  Where was an editor?  A fact checker?  Did this get published while the publisher's science expert was on holiday?    The only proof actually presented is that there is plenty of evidence that evolution COULD have occurred.  I would never expect that deduction to  convince creationists that it did occur.  The logic is missing an important link.       I was eager to find in this book a solid work of scientific evidence to provide substance for conversations with friends who hold the opposing views, and instead I find a piece of sloppy writing and error-filled, sometimes obsolete scientific thought that would convince few intelligent people.  Dawkins could have been a science contender, but does not even come close with this book.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|I LOVE this movie. Out of all the Step Up movies this is by far the best. Channing Tatum is a great actor and I love to watch him dance in this movie. He is also great looking as well so that is a bonus.
B004M6BQ9W|5.0|I really liked this movie. The music is superb. The plot is predictable, but it's still very entertaining. It leaves you with a good feeling, and that's what I like about movies. I would recommend this movie to anyone, even guys. There are hot girls in provocative clothing, yet romance for women.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I loved this movie. The story wasn't what you call gripping, but that didn't bother me. I loved the action and the characters even though I felt most of them weren't used to their full potential. The one thing I absolutely positively hated was the lead female character Sandra Garza portrayed by Gisele Itié. I have nothing against Gisele Itié, but her character was annoying, worthless, and served no actual purpose except for the illusion of sex appeal. Illusion being the key word because she also failed miserably in this aspect. If it were at all possible I would have walked into the movie and shot her in the head myself just to shut her up.
185984054X|5.0|Hitchens's investigative and analytical abilities are on display in this short book. His objectivity is to be praised, although not so that of the institutions which push the Mother Teresa bandwagon with myopic sycophancy. The media, religious and political institutions drawn up in this analysis are powerful, and they use their power. One feels a little sorry for the central character - she certainly sold out at a number of levels, but maybe the institutions in question are just very adept at building heroes for their own purposes. Then again, the problem here is that so many people get hurt or die because of the hypocrisy.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Not being a previous Cohen fan enabled my listening to be impartial and I found the music gradually growing on me each time I played the two discs. The lilting voice and the fabulous backing soon gets you in. A very professional performance from an obviously very talented man who the audience couldn't seem to get enough of.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I'm not going to get caught up in the debate on whether or not this is a good version of the Dickens classic.  I think the movie is fine and it is impossible to please everyone. Others may have a particular version that they like better.  I've liked the story since I was a child.  What I REALLY like about this version is the 3D which I think is excellent!  The characters are so life like and it is truly a joy to watch this version.  Zemeckis does not dissappoint! I'm sure I'll probably watch this Blu Ray every year during the holidays if not more often.
0316044695|5.0|This is a great book.  I found it tough to put it down and wanted to keep reading.  It's patriotic, heroic, inspiring and touching.  You will not be dissapointed!  Loved it.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I read the book first and was wondering if they would stay true to it at all and they didn't do too bad. It is a different but then again the book does get pretty graphic and guess they probably shouldn't put some of it in a movie. I haven't seen the original movie Let The Right One In but plan on it for sure.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|**Spoilers**<br />I really wanted to like this movie but I found myself giggling at the 'love' story between Eisenheim (Norton) and Sophie (Biel). Edward Norton and Jessica Biel have no chemistry whatsoever due to Jessica's lack of talent, which in turn, makes Edward look hammy and over-doing it.<br /><br />And really, was no one expecting the end? Did anyone really believe Jessica's character was really dead? I also don't think writers really allowed the childhood friendship-crush pan out so the rest of the movie is rather forced and predictable. I have great respect for Edward Norton and would watch anything he's in but sometimes, even his accent was questionable. The romance is painfully, and sadly comical but the technical point in which the film was shot is beautiful. If not for Biel's ability to ruin every movie she's in, and if the plot was panned out more evenly, I think this film would have been better. But for the most, I was disappointed.
0439023513|1.0|I loved The Hunger Games.  I really enjoyed Catching Fire.  And I really DISLIKED Mockingjay.  In this last book, I had no interest in Katniss... she could have been killed off and I wouldn't have cared.  I wanted to hear more about Peeta (but not the hijacking).  I got the impression that Collins was sick of writing... she rushed, was not inventive,  and then just dumped off the end.  There was nothing about this book that made you care more about the main characters from the first two (except Peeta). Disappointing.

B0045XY1FS|5.0|Awesome episode. The actors and writers continue to amaze us every week. The chemistry is electric between Nathan and Stana. This is one amazing show. Stana deserves a Emmy for her role as Detective Kate Beckett. She owns this character and pulls you in with every touching moment. You feel every single emotion that Kate is feeling. Awesome job Stana. Nathan is just adorable and charming as Rick Castle. Awesome job Nathan. What a combination these two are. The entire cast is the BEST on tv. Check out CASTLE.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie for over a year,I wasn't disapointed.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|The author and her publishing house need to recognize that this book is a romance and advertise it as such. It was mispromoted.  Not particularly a fan of romance novels, I felt duped.      Think Dragonfly in Amber with magic, demons, and vampires.  I'm all for a little romance in any book, but the only real tension driving this novel for so many, many, many pages was the romance between the witch and the vampire. But even if you're a romance buff, think again about getting satisfaction from this novel; the romance never gets fully consummated.     Almost everything else in the story's action (or nonaction) is lackluster and often ridiculous, too.  There are too many scenes about eating and drinking or thinking about eating and drinking; the heroine should weigh about 300 pounds by the end of the book.  Also, the heroine is often sleeping, on the verge of sleep, tired, or in shock. Some of the scenes are just downright corny--couldn't think of a better word to describe it. It's simply laughable to think that the \\"brilliant\\" minds in this book would sit in a big farmhouse, watching old movies and playing board games for days and nights on end.  (I'm thinking about my own university colleagues.  We'd be \\"eating\\" each other alive.  And we aren't vampires, witches, or daemons, or are we?)      This book could have easily been 1/2 the length of what it is.  The ending resolves absolutely nothing, instead promising another book. Because of this, the author broke my trust.    The author's knowledge of history is wonderful; unsurprising because she is a history scholar.  I felt, though, too much got in the way of the story, slowing down the pace. I hold an advance degree and have taught for years at the university, so I appreciated her historical and literary references for what they were.  Yet, I don't want too much knowledge to get in the way of the real story.  Likely the author will do better on the second book when the characters go back in time, because then the history can arise more naturally in the context of scene and real action.  (Let's hope there isn't too much talk of food and drink, and the heroine isn't always in a state of fatigue or shock.)    By the way, let them have sex, please; Gabaldon's characters had a lot of sex and this only added to the tension, the reader's affection for the characters, and the telling of the tale.  I ask this for the sake of your future readers, though I won't be one of them.  Sorry, Deborah, you only get one chance with me.  I don't have any more time to waste here.
0790729407|1.0|The people who have written reviews of Michael Collins are as ignorant of Irish history as is Neil Jordan.  I am inclined to think of Jordan as a graduate of the Oliver Stone school of history.  Michael Collins is as much a stew of lies and fairytales as is any movie made by Stone.  the story of the origins of the Irish Civil War is a complete fantasy.  Collins did not head the irish delegation to the talks that led to the Treaty of 1922.  Most reviewers have correctly identified Julia Roberts' laughable performance as the weakest part of the movie. I am no great admirer of Dev, but the sinister caricature presented in this movie is grotesque.  Some reviewers seem to have fallen for the lie that a British armoured car entered Croke Park during a football game and began firing on the crowd.
B003WTE886|5.0|My daughter and I are both huge fans of Taylor Swift and her music. This is a great cd. One thing I love about her cds is that when you buy it all the songs are great not just 1 or 2 so you don't feel ripped off for buying the whole cd for just a song or two.

B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth is by far the best band I have discovered in a long time... and just listening to the mind-blowing amazing intro of `Slaves Shall Serve' was enough to start my obsession. Slaves Shall Serve wasn't a one off, either. Indeed, the whole of `Demigod' was incredible. The atmosphere established by the music was awesome, and the energy of the three band members radiated. The skill and precision required for this genre (Blackened Death Metal) demands years of dedication, and serves as a tribute to the musicians. By fusing the most desirable extreme elements of Black Metal with Death Metal, Behemoth, and other bands of the genre, has founded a crushing `chunkiness' to their music. The ten tracks each add to the `feeling' of the album, following the same general formula of thickness, heaviness and speed whilst never appearing as repetitive. Personal highlights are the title track, Demigod, Sculpting the Throne ov Seth, and Slaves Shall Serve. Listen to it on YouTube, order the album, buy the album, illegally download it for all I care, but if you are a fan of fast, heavy, brutal music, you can't afford not to hear this masterpiece.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Everything about this movie is polarizing: Wes Anderson as director, it's stop-motion format, the dialogue, soundtrack and humor - you'll either love it or hate it. I, for one, fell in love within 20 minutes. The humor is dry, subtle and sarcastic. The stop-motion was well executed, the colors enchanting from the start.
0618871713|3.0|I will say right now that my rating is in between because I do enjoy the art work.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by who I can't remember.  Although I like graphic novels I probably would not have read it but only did because of the recommendation.<br /><br />I respect very much the art work and the story she is trying to tell but for it was not that interesting.  Maybe not that it wasn't interesting but the view point and the literature  references were just over my head or not the way I would have gone.  It is not my story to tell though.<br /><br />Although Miss Bechdel may have found some therapeutic instrument in telling her story.  Too many books mentions that I didn't know or in parts the story seemed so dark I did not enjoy. So while I think the art is great  but the moments told in this memoir are only okay.

I put a hyper 212 plus heat sink in, I might over clock later, but this thing is so blazing fast there is no need to.  With my sata 6gb WD 1tb hard drive for data, ocz vertex 2 60 gb for os, this thing really flies.  With verizon fios, I barely want to get off my computer now between internet surfing and gaming!

B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is very funny. My hubby and I were laughing throughout the movie. It's fun seeing the animation in Blu-ray. I would definitely purchase this movie in Blu-ray again. It's a great value because it comes with the Blu-ray copy, regular DVD and a digital copy. Plus, it comes with the mini-movies, which are hilarious! The story is great, and there are lots of laughs along the way. Highly recommended!
030726999X|5.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\", Steig Larsson's final book in the Millennium trilogy, is more of a sequel to its predecessor, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", than a stand-alone novel in its own right. If you have not read the second book in the series, stop right now and read it. This one will make no sense whatsoever if you do not have the background as to what happened in that story. If you have read it, however, read on.<br /><br />The third novel takes place about five minutes after the conclusion of the second and continues the story. In \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", we learned about unlikely heroine Lisbeth Salander's horrible past, how the Swedish state put the welfare of her gangster father above her well-being, and how several higher-ups in the government conspired to have her arrested for murders that she didn't commit. This book is about what happens after the bad guys are caught. There is, as there must be, a trial, and Lisbeth is facing several counts of aggravated assault, breaking and entering, and attempted murder.<br /><br />Shortly after being admitted to the hospital, Lisbeth's father is murdered by a man who seemingly had no reason to want him dead. However, the police have secluded her from all outside activity. Mikael Blomkvist, her journalist friend, is left to try to piece together the events of what happened when she and her father met - and try to prove to Sweden that she is the victim in the story. With the help of her former boss, a few investigators, and a doctor who is on her side, she is able to help herself in a way she never wanted to.<br /><br />I was debating whether or not to give this book four or five stars, and have settled on the higher rating because I did love the novel and I am sad to see the series end (though I must admit that things tied up nicely, given the fact that Larsson was planning on continuing the series). However, there is an over-abundance of characters, many of whom are not introduced in this novel; it is assumed that you will remember them from its predecessor. It had been a few weeks in between my reading the two books, and as I had checked them out from the library, I didn't have \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" handy to check up on who everyone was. In addition, there is, as many reviewers have pointed out, a lot of detail. Larsson is a detailed writer, and his first two novels reflect that. This one is slightly less-polished (for obvious reasons) and unfortunately the story does suffer.<br /><br />That being said, I did love this series of books. The Millennium Trilogy is a breath of fresh air in the world of crime fiction, and it is unfortunate that Larsson did not live long enough to continue his wonderful story. However, these books offer a glimpse of what the future of this genre holds - and I'm excited.ou will remember them from its predecessor.

B004DK5CW4|4.0|In the 60's there were two types of families: Those that had avocado kitchens and those pretentious families that had sunflower yellow kitchens. These were sunflower yellow families whose kids wanted to run away and join Allende's Chile and stole their school project idea from Simon and Garfunkel and pretended to pass it off on their own. The avocado kids were up to their knees in rice patties getting their limbs shot off by Charlie.<br /><br />Since we already know the horse wins the triple crown, the movie attempts to create drama where none exists. John Malkovich plays a trainer whose clothes sometimes appear to be made from discarded table cloths. The husband is stereotypically non-supportive, until the end. When dad dies the poor family has a 6 million dollar estate tax and only 11 million dollars worth of horses. My heart just bled for poor little rich Penny who wanted to keep her prize horse. Around this point she becomes a Republican, who attends all white parties while the black horse groomer sleeps on hay.<br /><br />While the acting was good, I found the script to be a bit pretentious.
0786166835|5.0|I always enjoy books that have as a theme someone overcoming great adversity.  This book is a \\"classic\\" in that<br />regards.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about these prisoners escaping from a Siberian labor camp back World War II.  It certainly kept my interest throughout the whole long saga.  In this book a number of prisoners of war walked south from northern Siberia all the way to India crossing Siberia from north to south, the Gobi desert and the Himalayas along the way.  A distance of 4000 miles!!!  An amazing journey to say the least!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a stimulating adventure read.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|[[ASIN:B002KSPKRS Ear Force X41 (XBOX LIVE Chat + Wireless Digital RF Game Audio with Dolby Headphone 7.1 Surround Sound)]]  Great product. The cost may be a bit high, but the improvement to my enjoyment of my games was worth it.  I'm not sure I buy the 7.1 so much, as it sounded pretty good even in stereo, but the headset is solid.  The \\"chat boost\\" feature is worth its weight. I primarily play FPS, and with explosions and gunfire, the chat sometimes gets lost. Not any more!  If you can swing it, top recommendation.    It is a little disappointing that the mic isn't ambidexterous, as I prefer to wear a mic on my right side, but that's a minor consideration.    None of the pop and crackle I've read so much about, until I'm more than 25 ft. or so away from the sending unit. Within range however, nothing.   There is a slight hiss in the speakers, but I find it barely noticeable, and once in gameplay, it gets entirely lost.    That's my two cents.
1439102724|5.0|I have read all of the comments about this book and to those of you who think she made all that stuff up about Pastor Clive & his Church, you're wrong.  Do your research.  The only thing she made up is the characters names.  How they acted & what they said are the thoughts of real people who belong to a church just like the one in Sing You Home.  This is a great story to read & it's about a subject that many won't talk about.  This book will open your eyes & hopefully change peoples opinions about homosexuality.  I suggest that if you have read the book & didn't like it or understand, drop Jodi an email before you start posting negative comments on this book.  I've heard from a lot of people that she responds even though it might take her a few days.

The copy I had came with Glamour Magazine - it was pre-release because apparently the publishers were just 'so excited to share it with the world'. They would have done better to control their eagerness - the book was absolutely rife with typos and misspellings; at one point the author even decided to change the main love interest's name half through and hadn't gone bothered to go back and edit it. Sure, I didn't pay for the book, but there are basic standards of quality even in free fiction.   Even aside from that, the story was unbelievable and totally balked at dealing with any of the protagonist's real problems; her relationship with her ex-husband and the magnitude of moving to a foreign country could have been explored a little bit more. Instead, the author chose to rip of the plot line of How to Lose A Guy in Ten Days.   Disappointing.
142314189X|5.0|This series is absolutely BRILLIANT! Updating the Greek gods of 3000 years ago and making them seem like people in our modern time. The author takes the time to talk about the original myths when an ancient character appears, so the reader (and possibly scholar) does not get too confused about who they are. If a detail from a myth is changed, the characters talk about the original detail beforehand. Some of the gods seem to be big jerks, but some (like Dionysus) have legitimate reasons. The attire of some gods came as a surprise, Ares, the god of war, is now a biker, Poseidon, god of the seas, dresses like he should be out fishing on the beach somewhere. Some of the demigods have ADHD, which comes to their advantage in battle. I hardly knew anything about the Titan War and this series cleared up a lot of it.<br /><br />Overall, a series that is educational, funny and marvelous!

B0000C3I6U|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a close friend -who knew how he would react.<br /><br />He recently had surgery and lost close to 30lbs but not in a good way.  He felt so \\"ugly\\".  While he was healing, he mentioned this movie \\"Pumping Iron\\".  He would use this as a motivation to work out when he was young.  He used to train as a body builder and if he could \\"find\\" this DVD, he would get back into training.  So I searched it here in Amazon and got it for a great price - WOW - when I told him, not only was he touched but very emotionally excited.  I was shocked.  He told me he use to be in body building and he listen to Arnold/Lou's words as motivation.  He is pumped (no pun intended) to watch it and get motivated on working out.<br /><br />I have never seen the movie but I am intrigued by it - we have scheduled an Arnold/Lou party to watch it with his friends - Funny Huh!<br />cc

B000063DHL|4.0|Another very good album by Maiden (not excellent ). It has Heaven and Hell + Alexander the great , which are excellent songs and the other songs are good and average.The strange thing is that Maiden that time always had an excellent album , so many people tell some not so good words about this (and they have there rights). Nowadays Maiden come with a bad album after a more bad album , and most people say good things about them. After Fear of the dark they come with bad (not even average ) albums.
1582701709|4.0|Almost everything that is written within this book, were written almost a hundred years previously in a book by Napoleon Hill, The Laws of Success.  From requesting what you want, believing that you will attain it, and then work to receive it and be willing to accept it when it comes.  These were really secrets, but not as some mystical cabal, or some massive cover-up, but rather, the most successful people in the world figured it out for themselves what worked, and did it.  Like so many great minds, many probably didn't even realize that they were doing it, it just seemed right.  Men and women whose success seemed an extraordinary act of will, could be seen as a following through of The Secret.<br /><br />I am not a huge follower of the Secret as a rule, I believe that work must go in to attaining what you want.  But knowing what you want, what you're willing to do for what you want, you'll change your behaviors, and you'll start achieving what you want.  It says  that where you are now is not who you are, it's who you were.  This, I believe is a brilliant statement.  I am a fan of The Chaos Theory, and Newton's Law, that every action has an equal or greater reaction.  In this, I believe that every decision we make has repercussions.  Now, imagine if you decided not to live in the negative, to focus on the positives, to be grateful for what you have in the world, believe that what you want you can get, to put your focus each morning and each night and every downtime on those goals that you always wanted.  Do you want that raise at work?  You decide that you're going to go for a raise at work.  Well, that decision should cause you to start to work better, maybe even quicker, be more social with your co-workers during break-time, include the boss in discussions, and start to really stand out.  That one decision changes the course of your actions, or, what I perceive the law of attraction to be.<br /><br />W. Clement Stone said that What the Mind of Man Can Concieve He Can Achieve, this I believe to be true, and something we should all remember.<br /><br />I don't like the negative reviews of this book, because they maintain that life is either completely random which goes against all rationality, or that one does not have control of his or her own life, and if that's the case, then what's the point of living it, simply to play out a scenario.  If we have control of our own lives and our own minds then we can guide these things to accomplish what we want.  One person commented on the statement that the Universe Will Restructure Itself For You, that they didn't think the universe would care that much about them.  What they missed is the statement that we create our own universe, our own realities.  If you believe that you're a pathetic loser whose unattractive to the opposite sex, you'll miss the opportunities to get with those people that you really connect with and who really connect with you, because you will not believe it to be possible.  Why, because your universe cannot perceive of such things.  If you believe that you'll never be successful, then every time you come up for that raise, every time something starts to get good, you'll act to self-destruct.  Why, because in your universe, your mind feels its foreign.  You create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And really, that's the secret.  The law of opposites.  If you can destroy yourself through negative thoughts, then you can build yourself with positive thoughts.<br /><br />Miserable people have miserable friends, happy people have happy friends, drunks have drunks for friends, sober people have sober people for friends, we attract those who are most like us.  If you're in a good mood and you're smiling at everyone, you'll get smiles back.  If you're in a crappy mood and you're avoiding looking at people, you'll bump into people, you'll get hateful things spat at you, you won't notice that car coming close to that puddle, and everything will seem as if it's going wrong.  We create our own universes and our own realities and we bring people whose realities and universes are similar to ours.<br /><br />This is a good book, not a great book, I would suggest the much better, much larger, much more based in reality book The Laws of Success By Napoleon Hill and if you don't want to read that huge book then the much smaller Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill is also available.and our own realities and we bring people whose realities and universes are similar to ours.

If you are new to Maiden , here is a good start.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|I have to admit I was REALLY excited for this movie and it fell way short of my expectations.  Quick caviet on me, I'm a climber, I've read Aron's book and met him a couple times.  So my review is a bit jaded.  First off I didn't like the portrayal these sports in a  \\"go big, radical brah\\" type of light, which is how the movie represents what happened during the first portion.  99% of climbers don't act like it's Point Break, and that is a tragic misrepresentation although it is a movie.    Ok once past the intro, the movie stuck very closely to the book.  Kudos to the directors for really keeping with the story line.  The cinemetography was fantastic, and James Franco is inded worthy of the accolades he recieved.  Not easy to do an entire movie by yourself that is taking place almost in your own head.    Overall a really good movie, although perhaps didn't live totally up to the hype.

B002ZG99A4|3.0|There's great action and big explosions and it was great to see so many action heroes in one film, but the dialogue was so poorly written and distracting that it really bummed me out. To be clear, I didn't have high hopes at all and my expectations are very low in terms of story, acting, and dialog in films like these, but I found the dialog so poor that it was difficult for me to concentrate on the cool visuals in the film. This is a blu-ray that I really regret purchasing for my collection; I should have rented it first.
0765326353|5.0|This is one of the best things I've read in the fantasy genre. Sanderson's epic contains no elves, dwarves, or dragons, but plenty of action and highly memorable characters. The thing which surprised me the most was how good the dialogue was. I've read plenty of fantasy \\"epics\\" where villains lapsed into clicked exposition, and I was happy to find that absent here. Looking forward to the next one.
0375826726|3.0|The \\"Publisher's Weekly\\" review above pretty much gets it right.  I'm only adding my rating and a warning to those, like me, who thought they were reading a Trilogy (Eragon, Eldest, Brisinr).  This is NOT the concluding book of a (as originally planned, I believe) trilogy.  Instead, it is the penultimate book, and we'll all have to wait for the concluding volume to finish up our journey into familiar, but fairly well-executed, fantasy storytelling.
0756404738|5.0|This is the first review I've written - despite the fact that I start several books a week and finish two or three. I'm doing it because we need to praise the appearance of a masterpiece, a book so much better than most of what we read now, that it needs all lovers of the magic of fiction to stand up and salute. This book has everything that the reader needs to enter the 'fictive dream'  --to travel to a new place that engages our minds, our emotions, our life experiences, our sense of humour and most of all our love of a good story. Rothfuss has mastered the technical challenges that most fantasy writers cannot surmount; his names, language and place names don't sludge up the story; his world is new, strange and believable -- rich and dense. We love being in the company of his characters; the arcs of suspense for anecdote, story, subplot and plot never flags. His book works on many levels. His prose is limpid, lucid and disappears, the mark of a master.    As a writer, editor, and most of all reader, I thank Mr Rothfuss from the bottom of my heart for the great gift he has given us. Finally good writing in a fantasy book!    Our young hero began his life's journey in the most terrible of circumstances, surmounted them and appears on his way to triumph. But how did he go from being a famous hero, sung about in story and song, to a pedestrian inn-keeper in a small town, seemingly cowering in fear of enemies he cannot face, and simply waiting to die? I can hardly wait for the last volume in the trilogy to find out.

0689878451|3.0|And Tango Makes Three - Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell    On the top ten list of most frequently challenged books (2009) from ALA: homosexuality    We live in a world with all types of families: two parents, one parent, grandparents, two moms, two dads, aunts, uncles, etc. It is the status quo today for life to be that way. It is not as taboo for two women to raise a child together (or two men, for that matter). There are all sorts of books available on the subject, for kids and adults. And Tango Makes Three by Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell is just one example.     I did a Wikipedia search for the book and found an interesting quote from Mr. Richardson: We wrote the book to help parents teach children about same-sex parent families. It's no more an argument in favor of human gay relationships than it is a call for children to swallow their fish whole or sleep on rocks. I don't feel the book should have been banned, but rather it should be used as a teaching tool for parents. I certainly would have no problem reading it to my children. I can't speak for my friends, but in my experience, they are open-minded and would give it a chance before making a decision.    The story is simple and talks about different types of families in the beginning. From there it goes into Roy and Silo (the penguins) meeting and falling in penguin love. As time goes on, they watch their penguin friends pairing off and laying eggs. They are unable to lay eggs, so they find a rock and take turns sitting on it in hopes that it will hatch. Eventually, their caretaker, Mr. Gramzay finds them an egg to care for. It hatches and Tango is born (named because it takes two to Tango). Tango, Roy, and Silo go on to live happily ever after.    Honestly, I really enjoyed this book. It's been on the challenged list for several years and banned nearly everywhere in 2009. It makes me sad that we aren't able to be more open-minded about homosexuality and the different kinds of families that exist in today's world.
B001QA4TFK|4.0|I think it's amusing, in a horrible sort of way, that some would quibble about the \\"details\\" of what happened in Nanking.  Somehow, this misses the entire point-doesn't it?  If Chang and many others completed fabricated the whole massacre, that would be one thing.  However, if she didn't, it really doesn't matter to me one wit just how many victims there were.  Quibbling about the numbers is so completely wrong-minded that it blows me away.  Personally, I think she put together enough evidence to prove that something very, very wrong happened in Nanking.<br /><br />Why do I read books like this?  I think it's because the horrible, inhumane behavior of \\"human\\" beings never ceases to fascinate me.  I truly believe that ALL war is wrong.  Have we, as Americans, become so numb to the many atrocities that our own country has committed over its history-start with what we did to Native populations and then just work your way through to what we're doing today around the world in general, and in the Middle East, specifically.  We killed 9 young men over there recently with an \\"accidental\\" shooting by one of our helicopters.  Sure, apologies were dutifully issued, but the endless war continues.  To me, killing 9 innocent young men is really no different than raping and murdering 300,000 innocent people.  It's all just math, isn't it?<br /><br />Too bad every Japanese student isn't required to read this book.  Maybe every American student should be required to read War Is Lie.  Maybe, just maybe, if he masses around he world ever become truly educated about the horrors that our political leaders and military forces unleash on the world, we will someday stop the madness before it's too late...
0385341008|5.0|Okay, that's definitely a long title. It's also a perfect title for a perfectly entertaining, intriguing and informative love story, world war II drama, and mystery with a twist. The twist is that the story's told entirely in letters between the characters. The wonder is it works so perfectly.<br />A writer looking for a book idea after wartime success finds herself accidentally corresponding with people who've lived through the German occupation of Guernsey. A shared interest in reading and books brings them together, though it's actually a roast pig that inspired the Guernsey farmers to take up reading. And so the mysteries begin.<br /><br />Meanwhile a rich American uses flowers to tax the writers' heart, hence romance. But beauty is deeper than flowers, and love is more than beauty. The writer finds many different loves to touch her heart, and the author reveals many sides of love to her readers in the telling.<br /><br />Potato peel pie may sound unappetizing, but these thoughts on books and classics, interspersed with life, history, cruelty, mercy and love, are a true delight, and the reader, following the trail of letters, almost feels like a fellow traveler seeking to unravel mysteries. Mary Ann Shaffer's masterpiece truly is just that, and those, such as Annie Barrows, who knew her as a storyteller before her story was picked up by publishers, are truly lucky. They're kind as well, to have shared this novel with readers.<br /><br />Disclosure: I've been planning to read this for ages, and was lucky enough to be given it as a Christmas present.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Avril Lavigne releases her best album yet!  The world of female dance artists in popular culture is a touched market that's for sure.  With Lady Gaga, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, it's very easy to not be able to tell them all apart, especially if you're not a follower of the genre.<br /><br />Then you get Avril Lavigne, an artist among the bunch who does stand out.  And with her new album release \\"Goodbye Lullabye\\" she does just that tenfold.  She stands out and not with marketing, dancers, lights and sex.  No she does something else, she focuses on the music. This didn't come without a fight from her record company of course.  They pushed her to make a dance record since that's where the money is. Avril decided to instead let it sit on a shelf for a year not releasing it at all until they gave in.<br /><br />Having just recently ended a relationship Avril cracks herself open and raw to reveal a greater more mature album to date.  Every track is better than the last.  This is saying a lot since her weakest track is the bubbly poppy single release, \\"What the Hell\\".  I hoped the rest of the album wouldn't be that way and luckily it's not!  It's more rock and more Avril back to her roots.  It's emotional.  It's melodic.  It's forceful and strong.<br /><br />She took a nosedive with her last release four years ago with \\"The Best Damn Thing\\".  An album which I put up there as not one of her best.  I felt she sold out to the teen queen pop machines the music industry has been force feeding us for ten years.  Now she comes back with what I consider to be her best work to date.

1591843790|5.0|I just finished reading an advanced copy of Guy Kawasaki's latest book \\"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds and Actions\\". It was a fantastic read as it was filled with practical advice on how to thrive in both the corporate and non-corporate worlds by influencing and enchanting others. This book is a valuable resource for students, employees, management, entrepreneurs, and non-employed people alike.<br /><br />\\"Enchantment\\" addresses all aspects on how to conduct one's personal and professional endeavors so that they can capture the hearts and minds of others, and to create win-win situations for all parties. From reviewing simple but important issues on how to dress and greet people, to using the latest in push/pull social media technology, Guy explains how to use many techniques and tools to help sell oneself and to enchant others. As the owner of a small web-based business I found myself taking copious notes while reading \\"Enchantment\\" and implementing many of his social media technology suggestions after completing the book.<br /><br />Via multiple examples throughout the book Guy explains how extremely successful companies achieved their successes by not only producing quality products but by also going a step further and enchanting its customers and supporting its customer communities. \\"Enchantment\\" also goes beyond just teaching skills on how to influence others. It explains that at the core of any product, business, or goal there should be a fundamental objective to make the world a better place for all.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book if you have a vision or goal that you want others to buy into, be it obtaining a promotion, starting a business, or simply getting your kids to do what you ask.<br /><br />Mark Donovan<br />CEO of [...]

Now that I'm diving into more 70's and 80's forgotten stuff, I wanted to check this one out.  Nobody told me this was a freaking musical! Folk music at every turn, songs about men springing their trees and weird stuff like that! Now I'm not saying I didn't find it entertaining,I did. but WOA this thing is a whole different kind of ballgame. This is NOT a horror movie at all. Yeah Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt are in it, but don't buy this thinking it's Hammer . Just keep an open mind...Way open...and it helps if like John Denver music.
0380002930|5.0|I read this in middle school, and no, it was not required.  I am a tad biased, as I love stories about animals, but have also converted quite a few people who do not.  To say this book is captivating and exciting would be an understatement.  No matter how many times I read it, I still cannot put it down when Thlayli gets stopped by Woundwort just before he was to give the signal for their daring escape out of Efrafa.  My heart still pounds in anxiety for him.    I love how Adams keeps the reader guessing.  There is nothing repetitive about the story line and he charges on from one adventure to the next, the climactic Efrafa being the most intense.      Each rabbit has his own personality and gifts.  It is very difficult to choose who is my favorite.  Their clashes with one another are followed by the trials they must undergo which finally transforms them from a disorganized band of stragglers to a real team.  They will need this cooperation for the biggest trial of all; Efrafa.    I could not put it down, and even after committing so much of it to heart, I still have a tough time closing it when Bigwig finds himself dashing for the iron road, Woundowrt in hot pursuit.  There is depth to it, which I discovered after reading it as an adult, but the adventure and thrills still draw me the most.  The depth lies in the human nature that is pointed out through these rabbits when they encounter the warren that is willing to \\"Accept their fate\\" in exchange for good food and nothing to fear, expect for one thing...  The tyranny of Woundwort and not making him a completely evil being helps bring depth to it as well.  Woundwort is ambitious, to be sure, but he genuinely thinks he is doing right by his warren.  His back story also makes it difficult to completely hate him, giving the story even more depth.  He is a worthy opponent.      The bittersweet epilogue is the perfect ending to my favorite novel.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

B004ISVH7U|3.0|The album is great. Probably one of the 10 best albums of the sixties.  So I expected the \\"definitive\\" version of this gem. Do I feel my expectations fulfilled? Well, yes and no.  Yes, because the documentary on the DVD about the making of Bridge Over Troubled Water is priceless. Quite informative and interesting.  No, because the sound on the CD doesn't seems to be mastered from original sources.  I remember Paul Simon telling in an interview years ago that Columbia didn't found the original masters of his CBS works to send to Warner Bros in occasion of a retrospective the label did at that time.   It seems that Sony hasn't found the original masters yet.   The sound is dated and congested, and in the title track the string section seems to be a group of musicians playing 15 dollars' supermarket buyed violins.  In some songs the sound is sightly better, but when you think about the magnificent job EMI did with The Beatles or Universal did with The Bee Gees or Queen, the comparison is pathetic.  In conclusion, this album still is one of the best despite the poor remastering job.
0307592839|4.0|Jennifer Egan's acclaimed A Visit From the Goon Squad releases in paperback on the 22nd of this month. It's a \\"Must Read\\" for any generation--but Boomers will especially be nostalgic.<br /><br />Summary: Egan takes us on a thrill ride--not only back in time and forward into the future--from California to Africa to New York--but also inside our own hearts and minds. Do you remember the first time you heard edgy raw talent? Do remember how fresh it sounded and how alive it made you feel? Egan brings us back to that place and time of innocence and naivet&eacute;--yet, at the same time she treats us as smart, sophisticated readers. Through 16 loosely linked stories, we follow \\"friends of friends\\" (sort-of like FaceBook) and family of Bennie, a record producer, and his one-time assistant, Sasha, through their world of the music business, back to high-school and college, forward to families and kids. Although there is no traditional story arc, we accompany these unique and flawed characters through vignettes of their lives--with a speculative ending that is not too far removed from today's technology and social connections.<br /><br />Characters: In addition to Bennie and Sasha, we meet Alex, Alison, Bosco, Dolly, Jocelyn, Jules, Lou, Rhea, Rob, Scotty, Stephanie, Ted and others. But rather than a harmonic blending of voices as some ensemble novels employ--they each take their individual turn as the solo star at the mic.<br /><br />Structure: These imperfect and complicated characters not only have unique voices, but each tells his or her own story of angst and humor in a unique way--first, second (yes--that was not a typo) and third person--as a narrative, a celebrity interview, and even as a PowerPoint slide show. This latter is one of my favorites--written by Alison, Sasha's daughter, who tells her family story, \\"Great Rock and Roll Pauses.\\" The staccato feeling that Allison describes in these musical pauses mirrors the energy and vibrancy that the author brings to her novel through the structure of these seemingly random stops and stops of the individual stories. But don't get me wrong--even with the sporadic rhythm--the stories hang together as a whole to result in a witty, sarcastic, and at times poignant novel that will haunt you long after you've read it.<br /><br />Themes: Although her stories are distinctly post-modern, Egan's themes are decidedly timeless and universal: Ageing, Life Changes, Hopes and Fears, Identity and Belonging; Balancing Success with your Moral Values--but the strongest theme throughout is Relationships.<br /><br />Why Book Clubs Will Love it: There is much fodder for book club conversation: the characters, the structure, the themes...If your club doesn't mind a book that doesn't tie everything up in a neat little bow at the end--you will be glad you went along for the ride!<br /><br />Pick up `Goon Squad' on the 22nd in paperback!<br /><br />Cheers!<br />BCCf these seemingly random stops and stops of the individual stories.

B0048LPRD2|5.0|This movie you don't just see and hear it, you feel it.  Gaspar Noe added this new dimension to movie making.  You feel Oscar's high, you feel the car crash, you feel the floating in between death and reincarnation.  A whole new experience.  The acting of the main characters could have been better.  The little girl was great though.  Her screaming fits were so real I am kind of worried they were real.  Never seen a movie like this.
0393338827|5.0|As someone who used to work at a bank, I can believe every word of how these places function. The dominant players are of two kinds: the greedy and the stupid. The rest are either apathetic or silenced.    Lewis tells a story well, and he narrates it so that a layperson can get a rough picture of what it was all about -- and that's good enough a picture, considering how complicated and unintelligible the whole deal was even to the 'experts'. It is shameful that approvers at several levels had no clue what they were blessing -- and were too embarrassed to say \\"I don't understand\\".    I highly recommend this book.

Chronicling the well-known story of Aron Ralston, a climber and canyoneer who was forced to sever his arm to survive being trapped in a canyon after five days, the story runs the gamut from the highs of his adventure prior to the mishap to the lows where he has accepted death and is recording goodbyes to his family on his video camera, asking anyone who finds it to keep the camera but deliver the tape to his family. There are too few films about what it means to be a man, persevering when things are at their worst, doing whatever must be done to solve a problem, fighting to overcome odds, dealing with one's own mistakes, and making the hardest decisions and following through on them. From the hallucinations the dehydrated Ralston was experiencing to the sheer joy at finally breaking the bones in his arm so that he might amputate it with his dull knife, the emotional journey of the movie is remarkable. I cried as the film neared its end, and I can fully understand the reports of people passing out in the film festivals when he finally managed to break his arm and sever it, despite the near-certainty that he still would not survive. In the special features is an extended and alternate ending, which caused me to cry again while watching it, as it shows different scenes such as when he woke in the hospital to see his mother again, whom he had thought never to see again. Please, buy this movie and experience what manhood is all about. It's not about the ideals women would assign as seen in romantic comedies and dramas, its about what you find inside yourself at the end of your rope.     Truly, this movie should have rated better in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories at the Oscars, as Franco's performance is exceptionally good and the film's tale of a boy becoming a man and learning from his mistakes (at great cost, no doubt), is something everyone should see.
B004132HZS|5.0|I admit to initially having no interest in watching an updated version of Sherlock Holmes. I have loved the original stories since I first read them as a teenager many years ago, and I could not imagine Sherlock without all of the well known Victorian trappings. After watching this show online for five minutes, I realized I was wrong. This is an exciting and faithful update of the Sherlock Holmes canon with great performances from Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson. This Holmes is true to the original stories in extremely clever and imaginative ways, with enough references to the original stories--everything from Dr. Watson's service in Afghanistan to tell-tale scratches on cellphones and cryptic dying messages in German--to satisfy the most finicky Sherlock Holmes purists. If you're looking for few hours of fast-paced fun and good character development, you can't go wrong with this. Its only flaw is that you'll wish there were more than just three ninety minute episodes! The conclusion of the final episode will have you jumping up and down in a combined state of horror and delight, knowing there won't be any more episodes until fall of 2011! I can't remember the last time I had this much fun watching a series on dvd.
B000K97RHU|5.0|I got this to test a 5.1 system. This is NOT a 5.1 disk like one reviewer implied.. You need to get the DVD audio for 5.1. Otherwise, awesome- it's a beatles CD. Kept it anyway.
0670022411|5.0|Wow, what a reading experience.  The writing is so descriptive that you can almost feel the textures and smell the scents present in the story.  A mix of witches, daemons, and vampires that is explosive and yet a love story that is not at all \\"mushy\\".  I loved every minute of this book and cannot wait for the author to publish the next book.

0439023521|5.0|I'm a 25 year old male, who seldom reads, but absolutely enjoys a good video game (Call of Duty, sports games, etc.) and this book actually pulled me away from the TV for a few hours and was a great book (I can honestly say I don't run across books I call great often). I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series, Michael Crichton and Chuck Palahniuk's books, but few others have been able to keep my interest. I can't stand the vampire series books most teens/people my age & beyond are interested in and that's all that appears to have come out in the last year that's gotten solid reviews. Pick up this book if you feel the same or have a kid/teen/young adult in the same mind frame as me because it's an easy read, keeps you involved. Don't just take my word for it, there's how many 5 star review for this book & it's only $10-$12. I've already ordered the second book. There's a reason this book is hitting every high school English class in America lol.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|Having seen the original Poseidon Adventure back in its initial release in 1972, I was disappointed in this remake. The Special effects are great and intensify the experience for the viewer but, it lacks in depth of its characters.     It is not explained why the \\"rogue wave \\" (todays definition of a tidal wave)occurred and the characters themselves have far less depth than that of the original therefore,it is hard to connect with them. This lack of depth mirrors todays society as there is little, if any delay of gratification. Its more like lets get right to the point so we can get it over with.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a pretty good science fiction book.  The premise was interesting--that people entering old age have the option to join the military; they then discover that they become young again, but will probably die in combat anyway.  The book follows the military career of the protagonist, which takes some strange turns.      Enjoy the book.
B00068C7WA|5.0|I notice other reviews of this CD complaining about \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\" being omitted from the track list. Guess we are lucky in New Zealand as the version of the CD in our part of the world drops \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\" (which I already have on greatest hits CD) and \\"Scandanavian Skies\\" (can't say I know that track) for the full just over 7 minute version of that track (let's face it - that song could not be edited!!).    There are always going to be songs we think are missing on a single disc collection for artists who have been around forever e.g. in my case I love \\"Pressure\\" but that's again on the greatest hits. This collection also has \\"Honesty\\" which was missing from our version of greatest hits and that track is fantastic alone. So, in summary although I already have Greatest Hits 1, 2 and 3 this is a nice little overview and as others have said gives us the rare edits of some tracks.    As a bonus our version also comes with a DVD which has clips for:  Tell Her About It  Uptown Girl  Piano Man (live) - so that gives us the full version  New York State Of Mind (live)  The River Of Dreams  It's Still Rock And Roll To Me  We Didn't Start The Fire  Goodnight Saigon (live)  My Life  All About Soul (live)    And finally, having just found this for $8.99 NZD at one of our local CD stores makes this a bargain indeed!!!

B002JVWRAO|5.0|First off, let me say that Supernatural is my most favorite show of all time! I loved it ever since it first debuted on tv! I loved all of the seasons, but season 5 I think is the best season so far! I own all the seasons of Supernatural on DVD, but season 5 was the best! Can't wait until season 6 comes out on DVD!
1594202842|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because it is a great, great read. Controversy aside, you'll notice that most reviewers couldn't put this book down (even if they disagree with the author and gave it a 1 star) and it is certainly spawning a lot of healthy discussion about parenting, which I think is a phenomenal thing. We always should be seeking to improve & understand ourselves.<br /><br />The RISKS...Chua takes a big risk by laying it all out on the line, her successes & failures as a mother. Yes, she tends to speak with a bit of arrogance but, lets face it, she is successful. Her daughters are successful. Her methods - in large part - have worked. (Let's hope the daughters write their perspective in the future.) Most of us parents wouldn't dare divulge our inner-most parenting methods, especially when they won't be well-received by the audience. So I commend Chua for taking the risk to speak candidly.<br /><br />The POLARIZATION...As a Western parent who probably coddles her children too much, I don't identify with the Chinese method of parenting personally (and I wouldn't want Amy as my mother!) but I have to confess, this book polarizes my own thinking about parenting. There's something to be said for the fact that so many Asians have been raised this way, are successful, and when it come time to parent their own children, repeat the method. I know there are exceptions. But there is weight in the fact that people raised this way are grateful their parents saw they had the potential to succeed. Which brings me to my last point...<br /><br />The ENLIGHTENMENT...What I take away from this book is the fact that if I expect mediocrity from my children, they will probably be mediocre. If I expect then to be successful at something, they probably will rise to the occasion. Take preschool; I know so many parents that say they want a play-based preschool, they want their kid to \\"socialize\\" and just get used to going somewhere.  But most kids are fascinated with learning at a young age. Most kids pick up second languages easier before 6 years old, and love it. Most kids, given the chance to dissect a frog or make snow, are fascinated with it!  We cut our children short often because we \\"want them to just have fun.\\" Learning IS fun! And it can be fun. And it doesn't have to be about practicing the violin six hours a day. Having expectations for your child is believing in them, believing they can do it.ck up second languages easier before 6 years old, and love it.

I bought the book used, and it arrived promptly and in great condition.

0446679089|4.0|Nelson DeMille has written a delightful detective novel for those of us who need a quick escape and satisfying thriller. John Corey is an off duty detective whose beer and hamburger sensibilities provide him a wry critical eye towards the tony residents of Long Island as he solves the mystery of Plum Island. The story moves along with quick sketches of people and places true or typical to the area. DeMille lets the reader in on what's really afoot by the middle of the book, but it's still fun to follow as Corey must be find a way to expose the truth. Anyone who reads this book and looks at the real Plum Island on a map will never quite be able to shake this fictional account of what goes on out there.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|Should we just be thankfull that R.E.M. is still at it after 30 years and 15 albums? As a big fan, I sure am! And \\"Collapse Into Now\\" just reminds me why.     The album - and it deserves to be listened as such, even though each song stands on its own, and the loop back to  \\"Discoverer\\" at the end reminds you of that - is filled with what R.E.M. does best: propulsive, head-nodding straight up rockers (\\"Discoverer\\" with its sinewy ringing guitars, \\"All The Best\\" with its rushing tempo, \\"AAAA\\" with a great lusty vocal from Peaches), power pop (\\"Mine Smells like Honey\\", \\"That Someone Is You\\"), beautiful folky ballads (the melancholic but hopeful \\"Uberlin\\", \\"Oh My Heart\\" pulling at your hearstrings, the fire-camp worthy \\"It happened Today\\" with its waterfall of harmonies aided by Eddie Vedder and Joel Gibb).     \\"Walk It Back\\" and \\"Everyday Is Yours To Win\\" are definitely pretty, but I've never really like my R.E.M. pretty; I prefer it rougher on the edges (think \\"NAIHF\\"). \\"Me, Marlon Bando, Marlon Brando And I\\" fares better, as well as \\"Blue\\" thanks to Patti Smith - although it falls somewhat short of its template, the darkly beautiful \\"E-Bow The Letter\\" on \\"NAIHF\\".     It's an album I know I will go back to, more so than (don't go back to)\\"Reveal\\", \\"Around The sun\\" (although I liked it, but I understand I am in the minority on this one) - even \\"Accelerate\\", which was too one-tone for me.    My problem with after-\\"Up\\" releases has been on the production side. The albums tend to be super-polished, too polished for my tastes. My favorite R.E.M. albums have been the ones produced by Scott Litt. Thus I wish they'd partner again. Or with someone like Rick Rubin? One can dream...
1439102724|5.0|I waited with such anticipation for this book after learning about the subject matter, and Picoult did not disappoint! I've read all of her novels, and must say that this is her best one yet. The story is so engaging, and relevant. I worried before it was released that some of her fans would be negative because this book is about gay rights- and reading some of the reviews here, it's evident that some readers just aren't ready to face the truth that this book so beautifully shows: that no matter who you are, gay or straight or Christian or atheist or young or old, you deserve love and respect. Thank you for tackling this issue, Ms. Picoult, and I eagerly await your next!

0316098337|5.0|Very intense, especially the first third of the book. Woman/girl kidnapped at age 19, held captive, raped, gave birth to a boy who is now held captive with her in an 11x11 room.  The mother dreams of life as it was but to the boy this is all he has ever known.  Mostly very believable.  However, the boy is age five. His mother, who was in college when she was kidnapped, speaks very good English.  So why is his syntax and vocabulary so primitive?  I believe the author was trying to show his lack of development in relation to the outside world but doing it through language is just annoying.  Otherwise good book.
0385738757|4.0|Excellent book!  As the series is based on nature's fury and the extreme possibility of it's results, this story really fuels your curiosity of where our world is going.  My 12-year old brought home the 1st book from school and we were quickly hooked.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If your looking for another Twilight, this isn't it. What it is, is a well written love story between a witch and vampire and the perils that befall their relationship. I was hooked from the beginning. Yes, it has a lot of detail and description, but it is still an excellent read. Somewhat sluggish in the middle, it picks up towards the end and hurtles you through danger, emotion, and passion. I did not want it to end. I will be buying the next book in the series too.
0451197879|3.0|I'm a diehard King fan. I love his early work and recent work but this book didn't do it for me. Some parts were interesting but overrall the pace was way too slow and the characters didn't have that special element that King always give his characters to make them come alive. Dawes is a disgruntled and very depressing character that I had a tough time following. Takes too long to get to the good part of the story. I realize King's novels often time have a slow build as he develops the character(s) but something was missing here.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|First of all the movie is great and the quality holds up well for it's age.  The movie it self is a 5 out of 5 and the reviews here on the film express it well, this review is really more about the special features for the bluray.<br /><br />These are the Bluray special features:<br /><br />* Behind The Studio: Discover the film's fantastic origins in this fascinating documentary, including an interview with Hayao Miyazaki!<br /><br />This is a cool featurette about 20 minutes long about the movie and a little with Miyazaki on his inspiration for the film.

Overall great and worth owning but if you all ready own the two disc dvd than i would just keep it and not bother upgrading to bluray.  the movie looks clear on bluray but since it is over 25 years old even in high def it doesn't look any better than the bluray does quality wise.  the new bluray features are cool but not worth rebuying if you all ready own it.  if you don't have a copy of this movie all ready definitely but this bluray since the dvd version will run you roughly the same price.han the bluray does quality wise.  the new bluray features are cool but not worth rebuying if you all ready own it.  if you don't have a copy of this movie all ready definitely but this bluray since the dvd version will run you roughly the same price.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|After reading a lot of reviews for this album, I was very excited about getting this disc. Most reviews read about it sounding a lot like ...And Justice For All and the Black Album. ...And Justice For All was a very technical album and it was put together very well. The Black Album, though not like the other albums it followed, is still a great album. The first thing that I noticed about this album was the poor sound quality. Next, as I listened to the album I noticed that, for the most part, the only thing that sounded like ...And Justice For All was the technicality of this album and the epic songs and solos. All Nightmare Long and Cyanide are the closest thing to anything on ...And Justice For All, and they are the only reason I am giving this album 2 stars. While this is a technical album containing epic songs, it does not come close to comparing with ...And Justice For All. Most of the material on this album sounds like it was just thrown together. If I had to compare this to any of Metallica's other music, I would say it mostly falls between what they did on the Black Album up to Reload (they just threw some thrash back into the formula). I think they were trying to make another ...And Justice For All, but fell way too short. As I said earlier, it seems as if they just threw most of the material together. Not much of the music flows together very well. Most of it is choppy and broken up. Other than St. Anger, I think this is possibly the worst album they have done. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ALBUM! That's just my opinion and you know what they say about opinions...
B002SSBD6W|4.0|Well written, well researched. The book definately makes you think about the eating choices we make everyday and how those choices are so closely linked to the practices (and shortcuts) the meat industry uses to satisfy the high demand. I recomended this book wholeheartedly.
1439102724|4.0|Jodi Picoult writes books that pair characters you care about with controversial plots. She takes on issues that can be polarizing, and makes the reader see the point of view of all sides. In this world of angry political rhetoric and screaming talking heads on cable news shows, she is refreshing and empathetic.    Her new book, Sing You Home, tackles two issues- gay rights and embryonic custody rights. Max and Zoe are married and have been trying to have a baby for nine years. When Zoe finally gets pregnant, only to miscarry, Max decides he can't go through it anymore and leaves.    Zoe is devastated. She cannot seem to function, until she becomes friends with Vanessa, a high school school guidance counselor. Vanessa is described as   \\"the person who buys the broken piece of furniture, sure I can repair it. I used to have a rescued greyhound. I am a pathological fixer, which accounts for my career as a school counselor, since God knows it's not about the  money or job satisfaction. So it's not really a surprise to me that my immediate instinct, with Zoe Baxter, is to put her back together again.\\"  Vanessa and Zoe become best friends, but both of them are surprised when it becomes more. Vanessa is gay, and she and Zoe fall in love. Vanessa has always known she was gay, and the description of her life, living in fear of others finding out and the torment she faced as a teen, is hard to read.     Zoe, however, was married to Max, and so even Zoe's quirky, New-Agey mom Dara is a little shocked by their relationship. I loved Dara; she is the mom everyone would want, but Picoult does not make her perfect, which I liked. Zoe decides that love is love, you can't help with whom you fall in love.    When Zoe and Max divorced, they still had three fertilized eggs left from their IVF treatments. Zoe and Vanessa want to use the eggs so that Vanessa can become impregnated and give birth. The clinic tells Zoe that Max must give his permission, and Zoe has no qualms about asking Max to sign the paperwork; after all, he left because he decided he didn't want to have a baby.    But Max has been living with his brother and sister-in-law who took him in after the divorce. They too have been having fertility issues. When Max talks to the pastor at their fundamentalist Christian church, he tells Max that gay people should not raise children. He convinces Max to fight for custody of the embryos, and to give them to his brother and sister-in-law.    The court battle takes up much of the novel, and it moves at a breakneck pace. This book, as most of Picoult's novels are, is a real page-turner. Set aside enough time to read it in one sitting, you won't want to put it down. Picoult tells the story in alternating first-person narrative by Zoe, Vanessa and Max, so you get to see all sides of this heartbreaking story.     There are also so many twists and turns in the novel, you could get whiplash. There is so much packed into this book, and although the pastor at first glance seems like a kind, compassionate man committed to his beliefs, by the book's end, his true colors show. It's unfortunate that was the case, it may have made for a more interesting choice if he were a truly moral man. With the recent Supreme Court decision on the right of Westboro Church to protest at soldier's funerals, this storyline is even more timely.    Zoe is a music therapist, and Picoult includes a a CD performed by Ellen Wilber, who co-wrote the songs with Picoult. The songs correspond with the chapters, and it makes for a unique way for this book to stand out. Picoult continues her winning ways, and her fans will not be disappointed.
B000003TAW|5.0|There really is nothing more to say than what others have said about this album already.

1594202842|1.0|On TV and on NPR, Amy Chua sounded pretty reasonable about the benefits of holding our kids to high standards--and talked charmingly of how she had been humbled by her parenting experiences. (See, it says \\"humbled\\" right on the cover!) In the book, however, I found her neither reasonable nor charming, but manic, obsessed, and deluding herself that her plans would have been the Very Best Thing for her daughters, if only the younger one hadn't been so rebellious and corrupted by soft Western ways.  By \\"humbled\\" she really seems to mean thwarted, and not a day goes by that she doesn't regret it.  (Paging Alice Miller: [[ASIN:0465012612 The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self]].)        It does make for a riveting read. Your jaw keeps dropping as Amy never stops pushing--rejecting what she considers a slapdash homemade birthday card from a 4-year-old; calling her daughter \\"garbage\\" (and insisting the girl will be helped by this sign of confidence that she can do better); making a kid practice even harder after a 5-hour music session so that she can impress the teacher still further; going to extreme lengths to arrange for hours of music practice every single day--even when her child has just had dental surgery or the family is traveling around the world.     Amy's energy and commitment seem either super-human or super-crazy. How does a Yale professor, who writes books and gives lectures all over the country, find the time to spend hours micro-managing every moment of her girls' music practice? And why? There's a dismaying blurring of boundaries here; Amy will often say that \\"we\\" spent hours practicing, when it was her daughter who was doing the practicing while Amy kept pushing her to do better. When the daughter makes her debut at Carnegie Hall, followed by a lavish party at a fancy hotel, one wonders if it means as much to the girl as it does to her mother.    The book is full of wild generalizations and false dichotomies: Chinese parents demand straight As and outstanding achievements in classical music, whereas American parents don't care if their kids do nothing but eat junk food and hang out at the mall (or, horrors, take a minor role in a school play). Coming in second is tantamount to failure; the only apparent alternative to fanatical striving is utter sloth. If Amy's daughter comes home tired and cranky from the one sleepover her mother ever lets her attend, that proves that sleepovers are a decadent waste of time. Is this the traditional Chinese parenting Amy declares it to be, or a bizarre caricature? Although Amy claims to be upholding the values her own parents taught her, even they sometimes fear she is going too far.    Meanwhile, Amy casually talks about \\"embellishing\\" a story about her husband's experience at Juilliard. What else, one wonders, might she have embellished? Did she really forge her father's signature on her application to Harvard (do college applications require parental signatures)? And in her beautifully crafted essay about \\"Becoming Juliet,\\" would Amy's 14-year-old daughter really have had enough experience of giving blood to turn it into a perfect analogy? As ready as Amy may seem to tell the truth about some of her faults and mistakes, that doesn't necessarily means she is telling--or seeing--the whole truth. I would love to hear her daughters' side of the story one of these days.    My kids are older now, but this book certainly didn't make me wish I'd pushed them more; indeed, I'm sorry if I ever sounded remotely like the Tiger Mom. Despite Amy's oft-repeated refrain that absolutely everything she did was for the sake of her daughters, I was struck by her own desire to produce trophy children who would bring her honor now (that's the \\"fleeting taste of glory\\" that comes before \\"humbled\\" on the cover) and give her endless devotion and deference in the future. Her children may eventually forgive her, but I doubt they will truly appreciate all the sacrifices they made right along with her.

142313494X|5.0|Ever since watching the movie(after reading the book, I can tell you that the book is so much better), I've been wanting to read the book for a while. My sister finally made that come true when she let me borrow her book, and was I in for a surprise. Ever since reading this book, I have read the whole rest of the series, and I am currently reading Rick Riordan's newest work, The Lost Hero. The thing I like most about this book is how much audience this book targets. This book was read at my elementry school, I read it in high school, and my sister is 24 and she liked the book to! It is also to be noted that this story isn't just with action, there is a lot of comedy along the road!     Rick Riordan does a good job in his work to keep the reader interested. Percy goes through so man adventures its hard to count. He fought off Medusa, he battled the God of War, Ares, confronted Hades, and even found the real thief who stole the Lightning bolt. One thing that is important to mention is the obvious similarities between this book and Harry Potter. First, there is Camp Half-Blood. Camp Half-Blood is the place where all the Half-Bloods go when they realize that they are special after going through life with a parent who is lost trying to proteect him and a mean parent. Percy's mom tried to fight the minotaur that was attacking Percy to proteect him, but failed. His stepfather is an old runt, who would only drink and play poker. He never cared for his stepson. Harry's mom died trying to protect him from Voldemort, and his stepdad is a very mean person also. They also both have kids that bully them at school; Percy has Nancy Bobofit while Harry has Dudley. Harry and Percy both go to a school where they go to learn and train, Hogwarts and Camp Half-Blood, which is both undetected by mortals. The list goes on, but the similiarties between Percy Jackson and Harry Potter are clearly evident.       Despite the Harry Potter references, I really don't care; This book was amazing anyway and is my favorite. I believe this book is a must-read to anyone who likes the fantasy/sci-fi genre. Once you start with the first book, you'll be hooked to read the rest of the series, I guarantee it.
B002ZG9760|5.0|I was a little worried when seeing the previews for this movie that they would demolish yet another good book. However I fell in love. There are enough differences to make it seem like a whole different story of it's own. Yet it's very like the book. Surprisingly Mary-Kate Olsen gives an outstanding performance as Kendra. Pettyfer and Hudges (forgive me if I spell these names wrong) are amazing and the chemistry is so strong there is almost a visible electric current between theme. But the best of all was Niel Patrick Harris, much like Will in the book he is witty and funny, no, HILARIOUS! All the characters are depicted extremely well and I was more than satisfied. I cannot wait for this Blu Ray. I may even see it again.
B0024FAR5M|2.0|This show did something I'd never have expected - had me actually rooting for the cops and the feds to take out this gang of thugs.  The main problem is the characters are all such lowlifes that by the end of the second disk, you're wishing for something like a train hauling nuclear waste to crash and take out the whole town.  There are zero sympathetic or likable characters, and the ham-handed attempts to demonstrate the \\"good qualities\\" of the bikers and their cronies are almost laughably transparent.<br /><br />Unlike you're a biker, a big fan of bikers, or someone who really likes stories about white trash thugs and losers, you should probably pass on this one.  At least catch a few reruns on cable before you waste your money.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|very interesting to see how the BOTR songs were conceived & crafted & great to hear Paul's & Art's new comments on them.  the Songs for America is good for historical viewing but not very entertaining.  it'd be nice if they later released the 69 concert in full form as a separate dvd.    i had no problems with the remastered sound.  it is slightly louder than the previous remaster but the previous one is already very good so i'd buy this set for the dvd, not much so for the re-remaster.
0812971825|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, because like many of the reviewers here, I enjoyed \\"Amy and Isabelle.\\"    I wish I could say the same for \\"Abide With Me\\". While the prose is skillful and elegant, it wasn't enough to make up for the novel's slow pace, which made for a boring read. I hate to leave books unfinished, so I had to force my way to the end, which I found unsatisfying and vague. In fact, so was the novel's message. Not that all novels need to have one, but it was clear that Strout intended to send one with this work. She just failed to make it clear. Or maybe I'm just dense. While I'm not the type of reader who requires this to be spoon-fed to me, I'd at least like to get even somewhat of a sense of the author's intentions.    Another element that had me struggling to finish this book was the constant descriptions of the weather that opened almost every scene (something which I also didn't enjoy while reading \\"Amy and Isabelle.\\") Unless it's done for pathetic fallacy - which didn't seem to be represented in this book - why is it necessary?       The problem is that literary writers seem more focused on the craft on their words than the plot, or making their story enjoyable. I'm an aspiring writer myself, so I can respect the effort in carefully crafting prose, as long as it's not at the expense of an enjoyable read.
B002ILRCTQ|5.0|This is a delightful old movie.  No color, no special effects, simply a great old movie.  I would recommend it and then perhap's also \\"The Preacher's Wife\\" with Denzel Washington, which is a wonderful modern version of the same story.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I have been a fan of Picoults for years and one of the main reasons is she does not shy away from writing about controversial topics. I felt as if the characters, Zoe, Vanessa and Max were very well developed and although I didn't agree with Max's beliefs I did find myself at times sympathizing with the struggles he was facing. This is one of those books I would have read all in one day except I didn't want it to be over and so I made myself drag it out for a few more so I would not have to be finished.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|i would like to start off by saying that this movie was pretty well filmed good actors. but this is no star wars or avatar by any means. the one mistake and the one thing i did not like about this movie was the fact that they make it a war movie. in alien invasion movies like these you have to have more back story about the aliens ( which you get a little bit of in this movie) why their are doing what thier doing and so on. I was expecting much much bigger battle scenes like a bunch of tanks, troops, miltary vechiles, agaisnt the alien troops and their tanks. you get some of that and you do get good battle scenes (by the way the stuff you hear about the film having a lot of shaky camera movement during the battle scenes that is not entirely true  but some of it is) but i was hoping for something like star wars episode II the ending battle  in that film was awesome and i was kind of hoping for something like that in this film. but their is still good battle scenes in this movie. give this movie a chance it was not what i was hoping for but it turned out a lot better and i do mean a lot better then i though it would be.
B00001QEE8|5.0|The Jungle Book is one hour and one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 18, 1967. This would be the last movie that Walt Disney personally oversaw. Basically the movie tells the story about a boy, Mowgli, who is raised by wolves in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is ten years later and the tribe of wolves feels that the man cub must be sent to the human village because Shere Khan, a tiger, has return and they feel that they cannot protect the boy. Bagheera, a black leopard, offers to take the boy cub to the man village and that where the adventure begins. Mowgli does not want to live in the man village and wants to stay in the jungle.<br /><br />Bagheera tries to explain to Mowgli, but he does not listen. Mowgli finds several different animals who would like to get closer to him for different reasons. Mowgli first meet Kaa, a giant Indian Python, and Kaa wants nothing more then to eat the child. Kaa fails in the two attempts when he is with the boy. Next he is met by Baloo, a sloth bear, and Baloo is a care free, fun loving bear who lives one day at a time. Baloo immediately takes a liking to Mowgli and wants to raise him a bear also. Later on in the movie Bagheera informs Baloo the truth as to why he can't raise him because of Shere Khan. While Mowgli and Baloo are enjoying life, Mowgli is kidnapped by a group of orangutans and is brought back to their leader - King Louie. King Louie wants the boy cub to teach on how to acquire the red flower (fire). King Louie plans are crushed when Baloo and Bagheera comes to rescue Mowgli. It is about ' into the movie that the main villain appears - Shere Khan. Shere Khan wants to kill the boy because he hates man and that includes women also. I will not go into how the story ends because of the criticism I have gotten in the past, but I will tell you that the movie had no ended and it was Walt Disney himself that came up with the ended himself.<br /><br />The movie version of the Jungle Book differs greatly from the book version. In the book version there is no King Louie no vultures and the only resemblance to the book is the names used in the movie. Walt thought the book was too dark for children and instructed his animation department not to read the book. The Jungle Book was nominate for an Academy Award in 1967 for Best Song, The Bare Necessities, but lost out to Doctor Dolittle for Talk to the Animals. Gregory Peck tried to get the movie nominated and win for the Best Picture category, but the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science felt that animation films did not belong in that category. It would not be until 1992 when Beauty and the Beast would be nominated for an Academy in the Best Picture category.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|\\"The Walking Dead\\" is the most exciting show of the new season.  While its based on a graphic novel of the same title and it adheres to that storyline with shocking fidelity, it certainly borrows freely from various genre entries.  What is surprising about all this, is how fresh it feels.  This is mainly due to the show very wisely focusing on character development, story and its philosophical contemplations on morality Vs. survival and how each character clings to hope or gives up in the face of a world gone insane.  This is truly one of the great doomsday stories and its brought to television with unflinching realism by screenwriter/director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Mist).  Darabont wisely avoided casting any major stars, but instead has gathered a superb ensemble of character actors which only adds to the show's sense of reality and gives us a depth of character we might not have otherwise had if the show revolved around the vanity of a major star.  It'a exciting, terrifying, moving, and often very funny, with terrific production values and surprisingly graphic, stomach turning gore and violence.  This first season has only six episodes, but the show packs more drama and excitement into those 6 episodes than most shows do in a 20 episode season.      The blu-ray presentation is a 1080p, widescreen picture that looks fabulous and is true to source.  Even if you watched the show in HD, this is a considerable upgrade, as it only enhances the cinematic look and feel.  Shot on 16mm film, instead of video, the show has a grimy, depressed look, with lots of swirling film grain that only adds to the reality of the story making it more immediate and intimate.  This is what Blu-ray is all about.  Fans will be overjoyed by this.  Special effects and mnake-up look fantastic, with every welt and bit of gore visible down to the smallest spots of blood.      The audio is a truly awesome Dolby TrueHD 5.1 mox which lets us know right at the outset that it means business.  Gunshots, explosions, and action are rendered with unnerving realism and power, aided by strong LFE support.  Ambient surrounds are very scary as we can hear zombies moaning and growling all around the listening area.  Dialogue and subtle ambient sound (crickets chirping, birds, sounds of silence) are rendered with pinpoint accuracy.  Dialogue is crisp and beautifully reproduced.  The haunting theme music and score pours fromn the speakers.  Imaging is terrific.  Audiophiles and fans of the show will be giddy listening to \\"The Walking Dead\\" on BD.    The supplement package is pretty good with a thorough making-of doc, interviews with cast and creators, a doc on \\"Zombie School\\" shows us how the extras were trained to move like the undead.  I would have enjoyed audio commentaries on select episodes, or even better, all of the episodes given there are only 6 in this first season.  I would have loved to hear the cast offer ruminations on the episode entitled \\"Guts\\" which required some of the cast members to wear entrails from one of the \\"Walkers\\" in order to fool them into thinking they were one of them.  But alas, the extras are fairly satisfying, but could have been better.    Overall, this set earns my highest recommendation.  The show is the real focus here and it is produced beautifully with a kickass lossless soundtrack.  This is a must-have for genre fans, and even non-fans will quickly become addicted to this gripping and exciting show.
B004PA50JM|5.0|\\"Collapse into Now\\" is the second shoe dropping, the first being \\"Accelerate\\" three years ago. Jangly guitars paired with some real Stipe attitude brings me back to the crisp, clever days of \\"Document\\", \\"Monster\\" and \\"Life's Rich Pageant.\\" It's like having your best friend wake up from a 10-year-long coma.     Far from the blurry, slow, atmospheric meld of \\"Around the Sun\\" and \\"Reveal\\", \\"Collapse\\" punches the listener with cut songs, from the yearning wonder of \\"UBerlin\\" to \\"Oh My Heart\\", the sequel to 2008's \\"Houston.\\" The album is solid from front to back. That's quite the rarity these days. These tunes are fun and have the craftsmanship and energy that we long-time listeners associate with the best days of the band.     If you liked \\"Accelerate\\" you'll like part two, \\"Collapse into Now.\\"
B003YWUTJI|5.0|A pleasure for the eardrums.  I've kept this in my car since I bought it, and pop it in very frequently.
B004FGMV0W|4.0|I wanna start off by saying I was not a fan of her last album \\"the best danm thing.\\"<br />Some of the songs were good (girlfriend, innocence, When you're gone)<br />but most of them were just loud and annoying (I don't have to try, I can do better, everything back but you).Well I'm glad to report the loud and obnoxious Avril is not present on \\"goodbye lullaby\\". She slips back into the dark, emotional feel of \\"Under my skin\\" which is my personal favorite Avril album.<br />I guess being a newly wed wasn't good creative wise but divorce sure is. Its sounds means but lets face it the best music comes from sadness or some kind of deep emotion.<br />There are some real gems on here that just suck you in on first listen (Darlin, everybody hurts) but some of them take a few listens to appreciate.<br />Its pretty much the polar opposite of TBDT which may turn some fans off so if you're looking for another \\"girlfriend\\" you won't find it here.<br />The only flaw I would say is that many of the songs sound similar because they are mostly acoustic ballads. Even so its still worth a listen, especially for \\"under my skin\\" fans.
B004QJPF2O|4.0|So I decided this evening that I was in the mood for some mindless action - not typically the genre I usually watch. But regardless, I decided to watch \\"Faster.\\" I knew very early on that this was definitely a mindless action movie and not to have very high expectations. When the movie's main characters have names such as \\"Driver,\\" \\"Cop,\\" and \\"Killer,\\" you don't really expect much. But about an hour into the movie, I was completely caught off guard.    The last thirty minutes or so of the movie are surprisingly and uncommonly powerful. I wouldn't nominate this film for any awards for its acting or its story, but for what the movie had me believing it was, the last third of the movie was quite emotional. I will admit that I was even a little choked up and almost teary during some scenes. But I have a tendency to really analyze those types of scenarios on a personal, and almost empathic level, so many of you may not have the same experience.    But regardless, it was a fairly decent revenge flick with plenty to keep you entertained.
1439102724|2.0|I love Picoult's books, but this one felt rushed to publication. The plot could have been very good, but she rushed into the situations and I never felt completely bonded to the characters. Picoult usually has a twist you can't see coming but one could see the direction this was taking pages and pages away. She always leaves some loose ends for the reader to determine the outcome, but she leaves so many here that it was very unfulfilling. She leaves one character completely out of the ending (I won't tell you who) and has one outcome that without a little more info I felt was unrealistic. I hope her next book is back up to her standards.
6305907145|1.0|I don't know why people tinker with Austen, and certainly I don't understand the changes made to \\"Mansfield Park\\" for this movie.  The characters have the same names, but sadly that's the only thing they seem to have in common with the originals.  Fannie is no longer abashed, timid, lacking in self-confidence.  She's snippy, physically attractive, and emphatic.  The depth of personality and motive of every character is completely absent, and the whole underplot of slavery is completely out of place and detracts from what should have been the point of the film.    If you're an Austen fan, and enjoy \\"Mansfield Park\\" in book form, stick with that.  This is probably the worst adaption I've ever seen, and that's saying quite a bit.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I watched it when it was originally on TV and had to have the final season.  Once we get the videos, we do a marathon and have a fun time doing it.  A great series.  Loved every heart-stopping minute even knowing there is know way they could get from point A to point B in the narrow time limits available due to traffic in LA.  But what the heck,it's not a documentary, just plain spell-binding fun.
B002SQNM9A|5.0|Great holiday CD. Product matched the description, brand new, still in the plastic. Arrived much sooner than I expected. Completely satisfied.
B000UPCEAY|4.0|Good album, Love Inside my mind-blue skies. At the river, has a hauntingly erie chill about it. Chicago opens up with opening chord from an old Prince song, and it fits. All in all, great album. Interestinly, nothing about the artist anywhere on the album.
B004CIIXC8|5.0|Fish Tank is a remarkable 2009 film that announces what could be promising careers for both writer/director Andrea Arnold and actress Katie Jarvis, whom Arnold discovered after witnessing Jarvis arguing with her boyfriend. This is not Arnold's first film, but it's the one that has thrust her into the spotlight after winning the Jury Prize at Cannes and the BAFTA for Best British Film. Due to the distribution deal between IFC Films and the Criterion Collection, the film has made its U.S. debut under the Criterion label and it richly deserves it. Following low-class characters, Fish Tank wisely diverges from the path Hollywood would take with this material and doesn't preoccupy itself with a happy ending. It introduces these characters, shows them as they are, and doesn't make excuses for their actions. It's unapologetic, but also sympathetic without being sappy.    Jarvis plays 15-year-old Mia, who resides on an Essex council estate (or public housing unit) with her party-girl mother Joanne (Kierston Wareing) and her younger sister Tyler (Rebecca Griffiths). Mia is a foul-mouthed, unrestrained girl with a bad attitude and it's no secret how she may have come to develop these personality traits. Joanne is a single woman with two children, but is personified proof of why having a kid doesn't make you a parent and her young age and appearance suggests that she may have had Mia around Mia's own age. Mia doesn't go to school, doesn't seem to have any friends, and her only outlet/escape seems to be drinking whatever alcoholic beverage she can acquire and, more importantly, her love of dancing which she practices in an empty flat alone. At home, her mother has brought in a new boyfriend named Connor (Michael Fassbender), a charming Irishman, whose presence and attitude seem to provide Mia and Tyler with the first hint of stability they may have ever seen. Mia is initially cold towards Connor, but you can feel the sizzling tension beneath the surface.    Fish Tank is a slow-build and may require patience from the viewer, although that's not to say it's a slow-moving film. Arnold establishes her characters as realistic and flawed people, then develops them as plausibly as cinema allows. She plays the story straight and avoids unnecessary, contrived theatrics but her film is not without style. I've seen some describe the camera-work as \\"documentary-style\\" and while it's true that a handheld camera is utilized frequently and the film follows Mia in close, tight shots; I don't think it's comparable to a documentary. What effect it does have is give the film a much more personal feel and place the viewer firmly in Mia's shoes. Cinematographer Robbie Ryan has an eye for capturing beautiful and atmospheric shots when the opportunity presents itself, but shoots much of the film in a familiar style...However, there are certain shots throughout the film in which the characters appear to be walking underwater; as if moving in a fish tank. Ryan is definitely hugely responsible for some of the film's impact.    The two leads Jarvis and Fassbender give stunning, powerful performances that were unjustly overlooked in the U.S. With the film being released when Jarvis was 18, it's safe to assume she filmed her role between the ages of 16-17. Here is a girl that has never acted before and whose real life may not differ much from the life of her Mia character, yet she gives an unusually strong, dynamic performance and shows remarkable talent and promise. It's a sympathetic and believable performance that is basically the heart of the film and she pulls it off with an ease that suggests a natural skill for acting. Jarvis will be an actress to watch for and her performance in Fish Tank has lead her to contracts with talent agencies and various film offers so we may be seeing more of her soon. Fassbender continues to impress as an actor that possesses immense talent and charm, as well as a significant capacity of depth. Connor is a character that many willview as morally reprehensible (among other things) and yet Fassbender makes him despicably likeable. The instant chemistry between Connor and Mia that slowly morphs into sexual tension doesn't seem like the invention of a writer, but feels like a true development between the characters. Of course it's clear where it's leading early on and yet one scene still seems shocking, although far from unexpected. There's not a bad performance here and all deserve mention, especially Griffiths (who had to be close to thirteen or so when the film was shot) as Mia's charming, foul-mouthed sister Tyler. Well, I found such a young character with such a vulgar, colorful vocabulary charming but you may disagree. It's worth nothing that you may find subtitles necessary to assist you in deciphering the thick, cockney accents in the film as they're quite heavy here.    Andrea Arnold is a writer/director I look forward to seeing more of, as she's made a film that switches gears between poignant, hopeful, heartbreaking, and (in one sequence) nail-bitingly intense with ease. The way her story flows so freely is the sign that she's a gifted screenwriter and her directing has enhanced the dramatic power of the film from what was on the page. It's not afraid to be poetic and symbolic, but Arnold keeps a firm grasp on reality throughout. Even the sex scenes are impressively directed, as they show only what is necessary and feel more personal and realistic. Her story takes some interesting turns, but there are no good or bad characters in Fish Tank. Arnold's characters are just people, good and bad in equal measure and Arnold never takes a side or voices an opinion. She just wants us to watch them as they are, like fish in a tank and it's a marvelously effective way to tell the story. This is a film that toyed with my emotions and had a deeply affecting emotional impact upon me. This is not a happy film, but it is a great one that moves with a beautiful sense of grace and pathos emphasized byArnold's elegant direction and Jarvis' mesmerizing performance. Fish Tank is well-acted, well-written, well-paced, well-made, and makes a very large impact for such a small film. I close my review with the best, most easily understandable summary of my thoughts I am capable of providing; I loved it.    GRADE: A
B002ZG974M|5.0|I first saw this movie at an artsy theater and fell in love with the photography, the common baby behaviors, and the life-lessons taught. The contrast of an African, Japanese, Mongolian, and American baby will amaze you and warm your heart.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|If they had the 10th anniversary dvd/blu-ray available, this 25th anniversary wouldn't sell at all! The 10th anniversary concert literally had a dream cast. Unfortunately, this one didn't. Lea Salonga was soooo perfect as Eponie 15 years ago. Her replacement in the 25th just couldn't hold up to part. And while I was surprised Nick Jonas had some bit of a voice talent, he just wasn't a trained operatic singer. It was disappointing that he was casted as Marius. Really? Come-on! All in all, I'd much rather listen to my CDs from the 10th than watching this 25th cuz the latter just isn't worth watching :(
B0045U9WPU|3.0|Imaging for a second living your life in a fog.  You get up, you go to work, do your duty and then come home.  You don't stop to have a drink with the girls, you don't get excited about your nephew's 1st birthday and kissing your significant other is not something you do because you love them, it's something you do because it's expected.  Bright colors are frowned upon, poetry is blasphemy and the only music you are allowed to listen to is what \\"Big Brother\\" deems worthy. Image a life without passion. Passion for books, passion for movies...passion for people. Now imagine that all of this is completely natural. That missing all of these things, that the inability to form attachments, to \\"love\\" IS your life. What would be the point?<br /><br />\\"Delirium\\"  is that world. A world where \\"love\\" is considered a disease, and what do you do with a disease? You find  a cure.<br /><br />Lena is about to turn 18 and she is ecstatic, but not for the reasons you would expect. Boys, presents and even the possibility of chocolate cake pale in comparison to the thrill of being disease free. See... in Lena's world \\"love\\" is considered the root of all evil, and in order to control this said evil, the government has developed a surgery to kill it. The problem? Not everyone believes that \\"love\\" is something to be ashamed of, and... until Lena met Alex she felt the same way. Suddenly realizing that her entire existence has been built around a mountain of lies, Lena starts to rebel; skipping curfew and party crashing.  Will Lena's sudden need to be free catch up with her? Why is Alex suddenly acting so strange, and is the government right... will love be the death of her?<br /><br />I would be remiss If I didn't say this book left me torn.  Half of me wanted to run right out and tell everyone to snatch it up; that this book is \\"horrifyingly fantastic\\" but the other half of me (that annoying 2nd voice of mine) knew that that would be a lie.  See... there came a point in this novel where everything morphed.  The story became beautiful, heartbreaking in fact and the action seemed to wrap itself around the characters like an artfully crafted shawl, but up to that point (I'm gonna say about 85% in) the novel was a bit of a mess.  The leads, (though lovable) were a tad underdeveloped as a couple. Individually they shined; we learned about their tortured pasts and their personal issues, but together all we got was a manufactured rundown of their time together. What exactly does that mean? Well... it means there was little to no conversation between Lena and Alex.  It is true that the society in which they were placed frowned upon interaction between the sexes, but at the same time we were offered up PAGES of alone time. \\"We sat in an abandoned house,\\" \\"We walked along the beach,\\" \\"We played Scrabble with half of the letters.\\" Why, with all of the given opportunities did Oliver not allow her players to talk? If the reason behind it was to build tension, then I'm sorry the attempt failed.  All in all I think the remarkable ending would have left me completely breathless if I had been give additional dialogue.<br /><br />Also (since I seem to be on the road to Bitchville) the development of Oliver's dystopian society was a little overdone causing the story to drag in places it could have otherwise thrived. For example: at the start of each chapter there was a piece of literature from her governments approved reading list, (their bible, history books, nursery rhymes) but instead of adding to the complexity of her story all it did was act as a stop sign. I appreciate the attempt to educate the reader but it is important for the author to know where to draw the line.  Teach it, but don't preach it, and NEVER stop your plot.<br /><br />So where does this leave all of you? Well, it's hard to say.  The first half of this book screamed for attention and if I had to base my review solely on it, I would encourage y'all to pass, however the second half of this novel was so well written, so shocking and unexpected, that telling you to simply \\"move on\\" would be (I feel) a tad cruel.  So instead, I'm going to recommend this: If you have other books that you just can't wait to read, that have been nipping at your heals and you find yourself constantly drawn to... read them first; then... when that is under your belt grab a copy of \\"Delirium.\\"<br /><br />Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: dogs can smell fear.pected, that telling you to simply \\"move on\\" would be (I feel) a tad cruel.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|I have been a matrix \\"fan\\" for a few years now, & i never get tired of seeing these movies. as every time i do.....i notice something new, it's just that deep. Yes, they are movies moved by meaning & powered by purpose. The music & special effects are top notch. One of my favorite scenes is when the helicopter crashes into the side of the building, that was epic. And i cant  forget the motorcycle chase scene where Trinity is being chased by agents & she rides headlong the wrong way into highway traffic, man that was tight.<br />I like this movie as it prompts you to question the reality of the illusion or is it the illusion of reality ? you decide if you dare....many are afraid to peer too deeply into their conscious construct, as I suppose they are afraid their reason might unravel. :)  But so what if it does ?.... as far as i see you have nothing to loose ....as right now you are sinking in compulsive thinking & drowning in the collective dream...you can either wake up....or enjoy the rest of your snooze.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Every girl dreams of visiting Paris. Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the inevitability of beauty, maybe we've been psychologically engineered since birth to equate \\"Love\\" with hot French dudes, (who knows,) the only thing that IS certain is that at some point, our hormone driven minds drift to this beautifully exotic place and think, \\"What if.\\"<br /><br />Most of us never get the chance to act on that subconscious need to spend hours on the steps of The Louvre writing poetry, and sipping blissfully bitter espresso. Others do, but regardless of which category we fall into, the dream of something magical happening to us while perched under the arches of the Eiffel Tower will always be there, alive and burning until we find something new to take it's place.<br /><br />\\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" IS our adolescent daydream. Personified and worded to perfection, it embodies every wistful moment we ever had as teenage girls.<br /><br />Just when Anna thought she had her senior year in Atlanta all figured out; her pseudo-famous dad threw her a curve ball. Boarding school. Not just any boarding school though, no... that would be to easy, instead Anna is sent packing all the way to Paris. With a wicked case of homesickness and French language skills that rival a toddler; Anna decides that staying out of the way is the only SAFE option. Too bad the charismatic and equally as beautiful Etienne St. Clair has different plans. Will Anna ever get over the budding relationship she had back home. Why does St. Clair's words always feel like a bullet train to the heart, and will either of them ever realize that being alone was never the problem to begin with?<br /><br />I have heard nothing but good things about this book for months. \\"It's FANATASIC!!\\" \\"A Must Read!\\"... \\"Best Contemporary debut EVER!\\" so I'm sure you can imagine that my expectations were only slightly lower than the national debt. If this book turned out to be a heaping pile of poo I was going to be one very pissed off puppy. So.. it's a good damn thing it wasn't.<br /><br />The emotional aspects of this novel are amazing. To say there is a push/pull between the characters would be a gross understatement, (think more shove/cling,) and to make matters even more excruciating, just when you think Perkins is going to throw you a bone... she yanks the whole damn rug out from under you and the cycle starts again. This novel is sweet, and bitter and defines love in ways that can make even the most stubborn heart turn to mush. The setting is exquisite, the characters are impressive, and at the end of the day we are offered up a classic love story in a not so classic way.<br /><br />So what does that mean? Well... it means that even if this books is priced at a whopping $12 I still highly recommend it to anyone who has ever felt their toes tingle when a boy walks into a room, to anyone that loves \\"love,\\" and to anyone who truly believes in soul mates.<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: Love is like heaven, but it can hurt like hell.thing it wasn't.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|Great movie, but it was a bit predictable for me as most vampire movies tend to be.  This was Chloë Moretz' first movie after being in \\"Kickass\\" and she played her role very well.  In terms of being \\"the best horror movie in 20 years\\" as the box claims, I wouldn't go that far.  This is definitely more of a thriller than a horror movie.  A collectible comic book inside was a nice bonus as well.

B000MV8AE0|5.0|Deep, touching and delicate movie, portraying Beethoven with many biographical details and information. Ed Harris is great in the role. Great movie.    Also, the performance of the music in the movie is top-class and historical informed, which portray Beethoven's character very well.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is by far the best music DVD I have seen.  I was trying to remember and I do not think I have ever written a review on any music.<br /><br />Trust me, if you have not seen this, take my advice: Get this DVD and make SURE you watch it on a really great sound system the first time you see it. Please, friend, do not waste this opportunity! Lol, it is That Good! :)<br /><br />Somehow I had not heard of Mr. Bonamassa until a few weeks ago. I happened on him on a Guitar Center special on TV. I have nothing but deep admiration for this young man. He is the real deal....<br /><br />I am just sick that I did not know he was in Dallas until it was too late and he was gone.... I would have left my best girlfriend and taken a lady that loves music like I do... Seriously.<br /><br />Ok, I am through, but I hope you can feel just how great this artist is from my review...  And Please do yourself a big favor and make sure you see it first on a really great sound system....<br /><br />Enjoy....<br /><br />Ron in Dallas
0743201140|3.0|I purchased this used and discovered about halfway through the book that the reader needs to complete a survey or profile. The code is on the book cover. However, the original ownder of the book used it and there is no alternative but purchasing another new book. Frustrating. I would even purchase a new code, but this is not available.
1400049628|4.0|The rating is 4 instead of 5 only because it is meant to be silly comedy.  The book was meant to be humoristic, male, recreational reading.  Age range appropriate for males from 14 to 50.  I have great sensibilities, am well educated, and have a well-developed sense of homor.  I loved the book, thought it was very complete, too long, and enjoyable from beginning to end. One can read part, put it down and come back 3 months to a year later then pick it back up and continue.  (I did that because I misplaced it.)  It is good late winter reading, beach reading, nothing on TV reading, can't sleep at night, and/or mental break reading.  The author (Max Brooks) is Mel Brookss son and family humor transends the generations.
1440503257|4.0|Interesting book. While there are some very basic recipes (eggs and bacon), this is a novelity cookbook that coincides with the Harry Potter series. There were many interesting recipes that I look forward to trying. All in all well worth the read...if you like HP.
B0037YOMWS|4.0|I hate that I almost like this more than the legendary 12c. The 12c was out in 1981 and it is still available largely unchanged. However, the interface of the 12c is 1981-ish. Keys which are difficult to comprehend, slow performance on what are now basic calculations, etc.     The 30b does just about all the functions of the 12c but it is faster and a bit more intuitive. Calculations are instantaneous. Statistics are easier because you can easily toggle through the various results available. The keys have a great, tactile feel. It is lighter and cheaper than classic HP calculators but seems to be ready for extended use.     One con of the 30b - the screen. While the 2 line screen is useful, its viewing angle is more critical than the 12c. I can put the 12c on the desk and see the screen well at almost any angle. The 30b gets dimmer as the angle of viewing becomes more acute. Not a huge problem.     HP has a real winner with this model. I'm so glad that HP still caters to the RPN crowd and makes good products. Now reissue the 15c!

0393061310|4.0|Why did some nations conquer others?  Why did some nations flourish, while others faltered? How did the world get to be the way it is today? These questions and more are addressed by UCLA professor Jared Diamond in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel. The book tells the truth behind these things, explaining the reasons for Eurasian dominance. According to the book, Eurasian dominance was due not to heredity, but rather due to geographic location and proximity to resources.    Diamond presents a very compelling thesis in his work. He argues that a civilization that became powerful did so essential due to luck. That is, Diamond theorized that natural resources and location were central to development. There was a chain reaction of events that led to success or failure in the world. First was environment, then agriculture, then rises in population. With more people, there was a greater chance for innovation and survival. Also, European civilizations recovered from the plague faster than others, allowing them extra years to grow economically and technologically.    Though there are many complex and intricate theses being presented in the book, Diamond still manages to produce a coherent and engaging book. It is well written, with a good structure and compelling arguments. I found the chapter \\"Necessity's Mother\\" particularly engrossing. The argument was well made, and the points were well founded. It was logical and easy to understand.    My only criticism of the book would have to be the simplicity of its overall argument. Although it presents a great number of causes and effects that lead to our modern day, I still feel that it did not cover every reason for our modern day situation. Of course, this question is incredibly broad, and I for one believe that there are far too many reasons than can be covered in one book. I think that Diamond's question is too broad. His book is very well written and presented, but it simply tries to answer a question far too expansive to answer.    I enjoyed Guns, Germs, and Steel very much. It was very intelligent, and it did a good job at attempting to answer the questions it posed. However, I felt that there was no way to answer the question in one book. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I would recommend it  to anyone looking for a smart read.
038532653X|4.0|This review is from: Skellig (Paperback)<br />This book is aimed at pre-teens and explores the feelings of Michael as his baby sister is struggling to survive in hospital. Sensitively written I liked the way Michael's character developed and he became less resentful of the time his parents spent with the new baby. The 'old man' in the garage serves as a welcome distraction for him and whilst unable to help his sister he can try and help Skellig. His relationship with Mina, the girl who lived down the lane, was particularly nice to read about. Through her character the voice of William Blake can be heard, wanting children to be free and able to enjoy nature as opposed to being stuck in the traditional schooling system. The knowledge that she naturally shares with Michael certainly shows the advantages and freedom of learning in a less restricted way. However it could be argued that this idea is more appealing to the adult reader! The traditional school system is not painted too bleakly though, with the warmth and care shown by his teachers and friends being one of the benefits of being part of a school.<br /><br />Skellig the character was certainly unusual and whilst I'm not sure I still really understand the why's and wherefores of some things about him, he was interesting. I could easily see why the children would want to help him and the concept of what he was and what made him better (kind acts) made for a hopeful and unusual look at the effect love has on us.
0385736002|5.0|The Alchemyst: The secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel started off with Sophie and Josh Newman working their summer jobs in California. Sophie, Josh's twin, worked at a coffee shop across the street from the local Book store. The book starts off with instant action as a black car pulls up to the book store, where Josh Newman Works for his summer job, and suspiciously enter the book store dressed in black.       This book is very interesting to read. This book is about 400 pages in the paperback version, and had a terrific story line. I have read many fiction books, and this series is probably one of my favorites. Michael Scott did a wonderful job adding detail and many interesting conversations to this series.  I have read all of the series except for the last two books. While this book is rated for young adults, I think anyone interested in Harry Potter would be interested in The Alchemyst: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel.  Most of the negative reviews posted here I believe to be by older adults, not younger adults. If they looked from a different perspective, I think they would enjoy this book more. I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a good fiction read. I would also recommend the other books in the series.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|The Italian title \\"Sculoa di superpoteri\\" is particularly apt for this Disney live-action outing.  In a world where superheroes (and supervillains) are apparently even more ubiquitous than in the Marvel Universe--some are second-generation and raising kids who'll become the third--Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) is facing his first day at high school.  But because his parents are super--the incredibly strong Commander (Kurt Russell), whose father was also a hero, and Jetstream (Kelly Preston), who has the gift of flight--the high school he's entering isn't your garden-variety secondary.  Sky High (so named because it floats far above the surface of Earth on a gigantic anti-grav saucer) is specifically designed for the children of superheroes, some of whose parents (including the Commander) are alumni, and is intended not only to teach them the usual academic subjects but to prepare them for a life of super-service.  Some, including Will, haven't yet come into their powers; others, like his lifelong best friend Layla (Danielle Panabaker), another heroes'-child who has power over growing things, have; and some seem to be stuck halfway between, like white-blond Ethan (Dee Jay Daniels), who can glow in the dark, or to have powers nobody sensible would want, like Little Larry (Loren Berman), who can transform himself into a puddle of liquid and ooze just about anywhere he wants to go.  This quartet soon finds itself stuck in the \\"sidekick\\" track--until Will's power abruptly manifests during a disagreement with sullen Zach (Nicholas Braun) in the cafeteria.  Before he quite understands what's happening, he and his three friends find themselves faced with the prospect of saving the world (to say nothing of their own superparents) long before they're really ready for the task.  Yet for all its fantastic aspects, the movie has a lot to say about issues ordinary high-schoool kids must face: career choices, bullies, romance (and its conflicts with friendship), betrayal, cooperation, disappointment, parent trouble.  All of which makes it not only a fun and funny adventure but a story that will speak to youngsters--perhaps more subtly than the usual teen angst-fest, but all the more enjoyably.

0316098337|4.0|Emma Donoghue's Room is a captivating novel, which had me turning the pages to the end.  It is funny, suspenseful, disturbing, and sobering.  We are told the story from the point of view of Jack, a five year old boy who has never experienced the world outside the confines of an eleven by eleven room.  It is superbly done...after all, how many of us really know how a 5 year old perceives the world, especially one who has had limited access to the world their whole life?  However, Donohue believably captures Jack's inner monologue.  After the initial encounter with Jack's manner of speaking, which at first could be a bit hard to follow, the narrative flows and is a fast read.<br />This novel would be great in a classroom since it would foster many discussions, some of which could be about language, the function of literature, human need for socialization, the notion of freedom, the impact of isolation/imprisonment, natural versus unnatural relationships, survival, human response to trauma, and perhaps the importance of nature in our lives.  Students could also analyze the narrative using critical theories, for example, reader-response, new criticism, or perhaps an analysis using a gender lens.  There are those who may question the plausibility of Jack's escape or the validity of Ma's and Jack's adjustment into society; however, Donoghue develops the narrative through the innocence of Jack which begs us to question the way we do life--on many levels.<br />The circumstance under which this story comes to life is rather disturbing, however, the heroics of both Ma and Jack lifts this novel above the understated horror story being told.

B003Y5H53S|5.0|Saw Rango at the theatre last night. What a GREAT movie!!! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD (hopefully with some extras). It was FUNNY, moving, and very clever. Fun music. My brother-in-law does NOT like comedies but he laughed and enjoyed it VERY much as well. This should definitely win an Academy Award. This is the most fun (and entertaining) movie I've seen in a long time. It is VERY entertaining!!!!! Great animation. Little ones won't get the jokes but I'm sure they will enjoy the animation.
B0013K1ALO|3.0|Led Zeppelin was my favorite band in high school. Starting with [[ASIN:B000002J03 LED ZEPPELIN II]], then back to their [[ASIN:B000002J01 first album]] and forward right to [[ASIN:B000002JSP IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR]], I was your typical Zeppelin devotee. Had all the LPs and singles and always dropped coin in jukeboxes to hear a Zep tune.<br /><br />And yet, due to radio overplay of its mediocre \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" performance, I avoided THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME (UK/USA-1976) while it was in theaters and never rented the videotape decades ago. So, \\"The Song\\" remained unseen, that is, until this afternoon.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this concert film, I mean that, but have got to be honest here. It was interesting in spots, yet disappointing as a whole. I know, sacrilege! Hang the blasphemer.<br /><br />But here's why, OK?<br /><br />Robert Plant's voice was irretrievably, undeniably SHOT. He couldn't hit those soaring high notes and seemed a parody of himself, all slender and fem and with skintight hip-huggers that only teen girls wear these days. And what was it with those constant looking-up camera shots of his groin? (Yes, it's draped to the left. We get it.)<br /><br />Everything went rapidly downhill during the John Paul Jones organ solo. This was followed by one LONG self-indulgent jam after another for nearly an hour. It was stultifying.<br /><br />John Bonham's spotlight, Moby Plant's Crotch, was spoiled during his hands-only playing by inconsiderate audience yowps and whistles. So was Robert's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" solo. He also killed it himself though with pretentious \\"ad-libbed\\" comments like, \\"Does anybody remember laughter?\\" No. Never heard of it, Bobby.<br /><br />Oh, those costume drama arsty-fartsy videos! feh<br />And why did these guys all look like [[ASIN:6305922756 Spinal Tap]] to me?<br /><br />I STILL love my Zeppelin albums. Just hate this movie, that's all. Wish it were otherwise.
B002ZG976U|4.0|On occasion you'll see a movie where you're not quite sure what to expect or perhaps think you'll see something only to be surprised. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it does offer a touch of entertainment, doesn't bore you to tears and even puts a smile on your face. BURLESQUE is one of those movies.<br /><br />Now by the name implied there are probably some who think that the movie involves non-stop strippers in various states of undress. Those folks will be disappointed. But fans of both Cher and Christina Aguilera and their singing abilities will find that the movie delivers all that they could hope for and more.<br /><br />Aguilera stars as Ali, a young girl from a small town with dreams of something more. She wants to sing and dance and so one day heads to Los Angeles. She arrives and searches for a job only to be turned down time after time. She sees the sign for a club called Burlesque and enters just to find out what's going on. Inside she sees a bevy of beauties dancing on stage in skimpy outfits lip synching some classic tunes. Desperate for a job, she's directed to the club's owner Tess (Cher) by bartender Jack (Can Gigandet).<br /><br />Ali stumbles through her request, begging for the chance to be a dancer in the show, but Tess turns her down telling her to come back when they have auditions. Returning to the bar Ali sees an opportunity when a waitress offers terrible service. Putting her past skills to use, Ali takes on the role of waitress telling Jack if she doesn't do better than his current staff, she'll walk but if she does, she gets a job. Needless to say she gets the job.<br /><br />Tess and show production co-coordinator/best friend Sean (Stanley Tucci) notice her working and let it pass. The shows star Nikki (Kristin Bell) notices her too and takes an instant disliking to Ali. Nikki is that typical bitchy star who thinks the world revolves around her and anyone who doesn't treat her as such deserves to be gone. But Ali hangs in there, waiting for her big chance.<br /><br />Months go by during which time Ali has her apartment broken into. Jack offers her a place to stay until she gets on her feet, but it's a purely platonic relationship since Jack's engaged (his girlfriend is in New York doing a play at the moment though). When audition time arrives, Ali takes to the stage but doesn't give the performance Tess is looking for. When she asks Tess what she wants Tess tells her she doesn't even know herself but that she has to take command of the stage and make it her own. Emboldened by this nugget of information, Ali gives an audition that floors Tess and Sean and is added to the line up of dancer, a move that doesn't sit well with Nikki.<br /><br />While this little drama is going on, Tess is fighting a losing battle to keep the club open. The club is and always has been her dream but her ex-husband and partner Vince (Peter Gallagher) sees it as nothing but a losing battle. Add to that a buzzard like businessman named Marcus (Eric Dane) who wants to buy the club to tear it down to build condos and you have problems. Ali suggests to Tess that they change it up and have the girls actually sing instead of lip synch but Tess won't listen.<br /><br />Nikki, always the trouble maker, always late and almost always drunk, fails to show for her set one night. Instead, Tess puts Ali in her place. As the girls begin their set, Nikki cuts the music track playing and Tess begins to bring down the curtain. All stops as soon as Ali begins to sing on her own with a voice that demands attention. The curtain rises, the band comes in and Ali takes control of the stage to a standing ovation.<br /><br />Now the centerpiece of the show, crowds begin to come into the club. A shrewd businessman, Marcus sets his eye on Ali, just as he did before on Nikki when she was the big draw. And as he begins to woo Ali, Jack sees a missed opportunity set in. The entire time he and Ali have lived together in his apartment the attraction was there, he just never acted on it.<br /><br />So the stage is set. Will Tess lose the club? Will Ali be a big enough draw to save it? Will Nikki find a way to stop it all from happening? Will Jack and Ali get together or will Marcus take her away and make her the star she always dreamed of? All answers are found before the movie ends.<br /><br />Some have said that this movie is nothing more than a retelling of COYOTE UGLY with different music. In some ways that's true but not entirely. The ing&eacute;nue trying to make it in big city after leaving a small town behind is there. Dancing and singing is there. But this movie has a different vibe to it. It's also been compared to SHOWGIRLS with a different setting and less skin. Once more, with the exception of the small town/big city story it offers something more. And is much less tacky.<br /><br />This is a feel good movie. You enjoy the musical numbers that are more along the lines of CHICAGO than they are the old Gene Kelly movies of the past. Aguilera does a pretty good job for this being her first major role in a big time film. If you just thought of her as another pretty face you'll be surprised. I've never been a big fan of her vocal styling but they fit the film perfectly. Cher is believable as the ex-dancer/singer with a dream of a place of her own. Bell does a great job as the catty star whose spotlight is taken away and Gigandet turns out to be not only a good actor but nice love interest for Aguilera to play off of.<br /><br />The movie is cotton candy for the eyes and ears. It offers some good music and some dynamite dance sequences. It's entertaining without going too deep. In essence it's a movie that makes you feel good and have a good time, something that more movies should do. I don't think this film ever intended to be an Oscar winner, but fans of musicals and of the cast will get their money's worth with this one.set. Will Tess lose the club?

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|It seems that horror films have changed drastically over the past few years. Where once there was a cycle that lasted about ten years between horror films being popular, they seem to be more mainstream now than ever.

Books like THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE, zombie movies galore and finally the comic book series that has now made its way to TV and DVD: THE WALKING DEAD.<br /><br />Based on the hit comic book series that continues to this day, this zombie outing is unlike any other in most ways. True the beginning of the series seems a bit like 28 DAY LATER, but once you get past that it's one of the most original zombie tales ever filmed. And unlike most it doesn't focus near as much on the zombies as it does on the survivors.<br /><br />The series starts with officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) being shot and put into a coma. When he wakes, he discovers no one is left on his floor of the hospital and most rooms on the floor tossed and turned. As he slowly makes his way through the white corridors, he comes across a chained double door with a warning of what lies beyond spray painted.<br /><br />Finding clothes and setting out to locate his family, Grimes sees nothing but devastation in any direction he looks. Crashed helicopters and cars are everywhere but no sign of people. Outside the hospital are row upon row of sheet covered corpses. What's happened?<br /><br />On Grimes trek to his home, he sees up close what has happened. Though unable to believe his eyes, a half rotted corpse drags itself across the grass. Grimes takes the bicycle that apparently belonged to the corpse and heads home only to be knocked unconscious by someone living there.<br /><br />A man and his son are staying in a house nearby Grimes old home, since vacated by his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and son Carl (Chandler Riggs). He explains what happened, though as with most zombie films we have no idea what caused it to happen. He shows Grimes how the zombies walk the streets, attracted by noise and searching for the living to feed off of.<br /><br />It's not long before Grimes helps the man and his son by taking them to the local police station and arming them heavily as well as providing them a place to shower. The station has its own emergency energy source giving them light and hot water. Grimes heads towards Atlanta in search of his family, sharing a walkie talkie with the man on the chance he makes it there later on.<br /><br />But this is only a part of the story. As Grimes begins his search, we see his partner Shane (Jon Bernthal) among a group of survivors banded together. In this group are Grimes wife and son. And Shane and Grimes wife are now a couple. Eventually we know their paths will meet.<br /><br />The best part of this show is that the story revolves around people, struggling to survive in a world gone mad. The depth of the show presents us with realistic scenarios of what people would do, how they might react, giving us the more human element of the story rather than focusing on the gore and zombies alone. It is this tale of emotions and the basic instinct for survival that separates this tale from most zombie movies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of zombies to be seen and enough gore to keep those fans happy. KNB effects have done another outstanding job here. And scenes like a downtown street in Atlanta filled with zombies moving towards our hero truly make your skin crawl.<br /><br />Tested with just a few episodes the show was a dynamite hit for AMC and was quickly renewed for a second season much longer than the first. Until that season airs, fans will have to be content with the DVD release of season one. Horror fans will find this a must have for their collection. Movie fans will enjoy the horror film done right. And those just curious will find more than they bargained for from a horror series. Well made, well acted, directed with style and featuring a story that unwraps slowly make this one well worth owning in your collection.ell worth owning in your collection.
B004P9GOAC|1.0|The actual list price is $120.  The use of a list price of $300 is completely misleading.  Rather than the claimed discount of >%40.  There is an actual mark up of >$40.  I have told AMAZON about this repeatedly but the false list price persists on their website.  Disappointing.  Just buy it from LEGO.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|Not many movies have been made focusing on network shows being made, even fewer still about network news. Perhaps the most well known was BROADCAST NEWS, a stand out movie that makes many best of list time and time again. While that movie focused on network news, I don't believe any film has chosen morning news programming until now. MORNING GLORY gives us a glimpse of that world in perhaps an off kilter way.<br /><br />Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) is an up and coming morning show producer in New Jersey just waiting for her big break. The day she thinks she's getting a promotion her world turns upside down. Instead her position is being condensed into another and the budget doesn't allow for two people. She's lost her job.<br /><br />With her mother recommending that she give up her dream, Becky sets out to prove her wrong. A number of ignored resumes later Becky gets a call from IBS and their morning show, Daybreak. The station is one of those small networks with no budgets and no hits. Daybreak falls behind every network competitor they have. Executive Jerry Barnes (Jeff Goldblum) gives Becky the chance to turn it all around and to make the show something different.<br /><br />What Becky first discovers is that she's inherited a complete mess. One reporter who seems a bit dim, a weatherman who wants to do a story on wind vanes, an ex-Miss Arizona past her prime named Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton), an anchor with a foot fetish and a staff that tosses questions to her in rapid fire succession. Day one finds Becky taking the reins, answering all questions and firing the anchor. Now to get things rolling she simply has to find a new anchor. With no money and no budget. Better still would be using someone already under contract to IBS.<br /><br />Becky finds her man in the form of famed news journalist Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford). Pomeroy is a prize winning reporter currently doing bits for a news program that doesn't appreciate his past. Idolized by Becky, she sees her chance when she examines his contract and discovers a loophole that will result in his joining her show. But he doesn't go willingly.<br /><br />Instead Pomeroy does everything in his power to disrupt the morning news program he's been recruited for. Pomeroy is a bit pompous and feels the morning news show is below him. While Colleen is more than willing to do any story presented her, Pomeroy snubs any and all stories lobbed his way. Instead he simply reads the news in the most monotone voice possible and ignores the fluff pieces that Colleen does with relish.<br /><br />When Becky gets the word from Jerry that she's taken the show to the lowest ratings it's ever had and the show will be canceled in 6 weeks, she tosses caution to the wind and presents a more forceful producer than she did in the past. Her first act is to take the weatherman who was simply reporting on a new roller coaster and strap him in with a camera sending out his reactions over the air. This results in one of the funniest items in the movie but also angers Pomeroy.<br /><br />As Pomeroy and Becky go head to head, battling every step of the way, she gets coaching from her new boyfriend, one of the men behind the networks weekly news program. Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson) has a past with Pomeroy and a nickname I can't repeat here. He informs her that Pomeroy is the third worst human being in the world. But through his remarks Becky just may find a way to get Pomeroy on board and save the show. She has just 6 weeks to take it from the bottom of the heap and increase the ratings by 1.5 %. Can she do it?<br /><br />The movie moves along at a frantic pace and you may find yourself clutching the remote just to take it back a moment or two when you miss something. It does offer some hilarious moments along the way and you get the sense of family that develops among the staff of Daybreak. That's one of the things that brings a certain amount of charm to the whole film.<br /><br />The one troubling piece revolves around Ford as Pomeroy. Played incredibly straight faced and with more than enough bitterness to go around, Ford's portrayal of the newsman reduced to the morning slot shows a reporter devoid of emotion, a man who's lost himself in his work and never returned. At times this seems like the perfect way to portray this character. But at other times he just seems mean and nasty, the chances of him truly changing unlikely. Either this one of Ford's best performances or one of his worst.<br /><br />The movie doesn't offer any real depth to its characters or its story, but it is an enjoyable way to spend an evening. Its one of those guilty pleasures you watch only to know that it has little new to offer and can't be taken seriously. But its still fun. Its worth watching for the laughs and performances but won't leave you seeking a sequel.and with more than enough bitterness to go around, Ford's portrayal of the newsman reduced to the morning slot shows a reporter devoid of emotion, a man who's lost himself in his work and never returned.

0143038583|5.0|Each section of this book was fascinating and helped me to better understand the biology of the food I eat, but none was more shocking-or complicated-than the section on fast food, hi-tech corn production, and the modern CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation).    The research presented in The Omnivore's Dilemma is critical to understanding the health and environmental implications of our food sources and Pollen's narrative of his visits to factory farms, large-scale organic farms, alternative farms, and finally, the wilds of northern California, is colorful and engaging. My least favorite parts of the book were Pollen's philosophical musings, which I didn't find very enlightening (except when he was discussing the consequences of the industrial food system).    One thing that I found annoying was Pollen's excessive use of various forms of the word evolution. I don't fault him at all for believing in evolution or using it as a basis for some of his arguments (although I personally do not agree with this particular aspect of his worldview), I simply found it bit obnoxious that he used some variation of the word over eighty-five times throughout the narrative. (I noticed it so many times in just the first chapter that I started counting).    These minor scruples aside, I found The Omnivore's Dilemma to be a compelling narrative. This is one book everyone should read to educate themselves about the food they eat.
B000001Y5D|5.0|Classic nineties rock; if that's what you're looking for this is it.  Of course if you're looking for this then you've probably heard it already.
0385751893|4.0|the book is quite amazing, and very easy to read, i finished reading it just a couple hours. For one thing i kinda disappointed me is that the author said Bruno's father is really handsome and stuff, but when i watched the movie, he doesn't look that handsome. and at the end, the book doesn't quite say what happened to him and his friend schmuel at all, which is very upsetting because i can not cry at all, which i didn't know what really happen, and sometime some of sentences made no connection and i even caught one grammar correction, hell no, what is this author, 5 years old, but i really enjoy btw, no complaint
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|I do not care for COLLAPSE INTO NOW.  There are some things I like about it, such as the acoustic guitar and mandolin playing.  I also appreciate the meaningful lyrics, which I feel have been absent from REM for quite some time.  And there's some songs on the album I like too, such as Discoverer, Uberlin and Oh My Heart.  But overall I find this album kind of boring.  I doubt I'll be playing it to death as I did with FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION, LIFE'S RICH PAGEANT, OUT OF TIME and AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE.  THOSE ALBUMS WERE CLASSICS!  This is the type of album that will probably be forgotten in about 6 months from now.  I think the main problem I have with most of the songs on this album is that they lack musical complexity.  There's nothing varied about the music.  I listen to songs like It Happened Today, Every Day is Yours to Win, Mine Smell Like Honey, Walk It Back, etc.--and I find the music repetitive.  Now go back and listen to a song like Good Advices from FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION.  There's no comparison.  I never get tired of Good Advices because musically--and lyrically--it is so complex.  There's nothing simple about it.  It's constantly evolving and changing--hardly repetitive.  Anyway, I don't want REM to go back and make \\"repeat\\" albums.  But why bother making an album that is clearly not up to their standards from the past?  Someone compared this album to ABBEY ROAD.  That's a joke.  The quality of this album is nowhere near ABBEY ROAD.  If anything, REM is beginning to remind me of Picasso.  Towards the end of Picasso's career, it seemed like he made works of art for financial reasons alone.  I hate to say this, but it seems like REM is doing the same thing.  During the 80s, REM was original and could care less about copying the current trends.  I would not label them as a New Wave band, such as New Order, The Smiths, B-52s, Talking Heads, Jesus and Mary Chain, Echo and the Bunnymen, etc.  But since Berry left, it seems like all REM is doing is copying the current trends.  First it was Radiohead and now it seems like Green Day.  REM should stick to what they do best--being themselves.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Excellent movie. All politics aside, as this was well narrated in, both parties were and continue to be culpable in a great heist of wealth, power and influence. Years of robbing this country will catch up and this particular movie will be referred to when we look back on history. History will do, as this movies proves, scrub it all and re-educate us into believing what was done, was done for all the right reasons. A must watch for those that believe government is leading us into the great salvation of tomorrow. Much like their promises, it will be the bottom of the wishing well.
B0013KTGAG|3.0|I was lead to believe that this movie was basically Event Horizon without the silly third act; that is, a creepy supernatural thriller in space. That is NOT the case - without spoiling anything, let me warn you that the boogieman here is entirely human. For me, that was a big letdown.    The first half is quite impressive - the idea of a ship approaching the sun from behind a huge mirror-shield is neat, and they make everything seem pretty plausible (well, except that they're going to reignite the sun with a fission bomb - that's just silly). Then they discover their sister ship was not destroyed, but has been in orbit around the sun for 7 years, and it all kinda goes downhill from there.    Don't get me wrong - the story is still engaging enough that I want to see how it ends, but it seems like it loses focus and direction, like it can't decide whether it wants to be happy or sad or what. Ridiculous plot holes appear, people contract fatal cases of writer-convenience, and it winds up as one big disappointment. This could have been a good spook show and a decent adventure movie, but it makes poor use of what it has and thus falls short.    Maybe it would be better if you don't go into it expecting either intelligent sci-fi OR spooky horror; I couldn't say. I'm gonna go watch some Event Horizon now to get the taste out of my mouth.    -HS
0718154770|5.0|I'm very happy with the prompt delivery of my Jamie Oliver cookbook. I'm now busy trying some of the menus as I've already seen the episodes on TV.  It is easy to use, with ingredients listed at the top of the menu and easy to follow instruction, nothing too complicated.  It arrived well packaged and in excellent condition, well before I expected it to arrive.  I would happily recommend this seller and of course Jamies cookbook to others.
B00005JOA0|4.0|This movie fits the vein of the typical drama of this era.  It was somewhat slow moving but I liked it.
0440246016|4.0|I've now read all but one of the Reacher books, and I'm sorry I'm so close to being caught up! So, if you'll grant me that if you like one, you'll like them all, let me air my nitpicking on this one:<br /><br />As someone else wrote, Reacher's idiot savant arithmetic (not \\"advanced mathematics, mostly just multiplication and division) is extended beyond its usefulness in the plot.<br /><br />As Reacher himself muses, he is never actually tested (as he is in so many other adventures) directly against the villain. Of course he wins, but not in the same circumstances in which so many supposedly equally good members of his team actually did lose. The explanation provided is very weak, and a one-liner at that, which doesn't satisfy. That's probably the biggest mystery in the book, and it's left unresolved.<br /><br />The way he got some spending money has a whiff of something I didn't like.<br /><br />That's it. Three nits. Enjoyed the sly humor, Reacher's moments of doubt about his lifestyle, his old crew's ability to tease him, and of course the action.
B00284G2JE|5.0|I'm going to keep this one short: these guys are masters of stoner/sludge. This album is all about the riffs --  thick on the low end and crushing. A must own for any sludge fan.
0756405890|5.0|In the beginning you meet the legend that is Kvothe The Kingkiller. Then through his own words you get to meet the man that is Kvothe. Few books can take you on such an emotional thrill ride. It is the story of a man who became a legend with all the scars thrown in. Imagine \\"Desperado/El Mariachi\\" meets \\"The Dresden Files\\" with a little of \\"Harry Potter\\" thrown in (only a little).
B003ELKNHM|3.0|The new release of 10 Bon Jovi albums is nice for the consumer who already doesn't own the 1999 Bon Jovi Remasters CD's. Some extra live tracks, new booklets and access to some bonus material on bonjovi.com aren't enough reason for me to \\"Rebuy\\" these Cd's. The 1999 Remasters sound alot better and have song lyrics included! A money- making ploy no doubt, gotta love it!
