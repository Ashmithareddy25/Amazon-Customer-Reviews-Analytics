B005UKK4Y2|2.0|With a cast like that, I expected much better.  It was not very funny and lacked a connection with the audience.
B007NESBK2|5.0|The music is wonderful and Sade is beautiful.  I really enjoyed this blu-ray.  If you watch closely, it does look to possibly be lip synced. But who cares, it's a good show.
B004UA8D1O|3.0|I just bought my 3d tv and dvd player and was looking for some movies to watch with it. this movie was ok but I was just looking for 3d movies their wasn't that many when  I got my set up so I bought this film. not one of my fav but its ok for what I bought it for
B003U0AHBO|2.0|As a die-hard Robin Hood fan I have read many books and seen many movies about the life and times of this semi-mythical hero. This movie has to be one of the worst. Although there are some excellent depictions of 12th century accouterments - it appears that many real places were filmed - the basic prequel plot is silly.<br />  From the death of King Richard (who will have to have one of Miracle Max's miracle pills to return to life and England) to the mish-mash of confusing scenes which are often meaningless, the film misses both farce and serious drama.<br />  Cate Blanchett makes a marvelously feisty \\"maid\\" Marion. But alas, she is no maid, married to Robert Loxley until his untimely death before returning to England. She does a valiant job of overcoming the more onerous aspects of a botched script.<br />  Russel Crowe shows his nearly total lack of facial expression throughout the film, making him look an overly stout, aging man with Bell's palsy. He is totally unbelievable as the leader of an outlaw band.<br />  Prince/King John can't decide if he is evil, good, or just stupid and petulant. He also looks more like an Arab than an English King.<br />  One has to wonder why such actors as William Hurt and Max Von Sydow agreed to roles in such a weak production. The only excuse is that actors need money, too. However, both give fine performances in oddly conceived roles. The same cannot be said for the Sheriff of Nottingham and Friar Tuck who both have fairly minor and very confusing roles as neither of them can decide if they are good or bad characters.<br />  If there is a savior in the film, it's Kevin Durand who makes a wonderfully believable Little John. He adds humor and a light hearted touch to the (too few) scenes in which he plays. The Merry Men aren't too merry, but do add to the action.<br />  Although admittedly difficult to make a prequel of an \\"historical\\" myth, the writers obviously had a ball destroying the accepted versions, probably over too manycocktails.<br />  It's scary to think that the producers of this monstrosity might actually be considering<br />making a sequel to the prequel. If the legend began here, it's amazing it was passed down through the centuries.<br />  I'm glad I got this film from the $5. bin at Walmart so I don't have to be mad at myself for wasting a lot of money.
0062238868|1.0|I had read reviews of this book and it seemed like something that I would enjoy reading.  Being a Viet Nam &#34;participant&#34; I had read other sniper books and was particularly impressed with Carlos Hathcock.  From page 1 all the way to the conclusion of &#34;American Sniper&#34;, this book is not about accomplishments, about incidents in war - basically not about much of anything other than the author explaining in great detail why he was in love with himself and why the reader should recognize him as an all time hero.  The entire book is a story of a man with an ego the size of the sun, practically bragging that his entire life was a me-me-me existance.  He married, he had children, he had many opportunities to take advantage of prior service and spend much more time with his family.  But, at his own admission (more than once in the book), he turned his back on his family because he wanted to return to war where he felt more comfortable and more where &#34;he&#34; wanted to be.  To read this book is a process of &#34;discovery&#34; into the mind and thinking of a selfish childish man, a narcissistic mess who comes off as being proud of it and expecting admiration.  This book made me angry and feeling deeply sorry for his family.  And his legacy is that he dusted more ragheads than anybody else.  Pretty lame reason to be remembered.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|LOVED IT - IT GAVE ME NEW INSIGHT INTO OUR HISTORY.  I DID NOT REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT POLITICS WERE IN THAT ERA.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I rarely watch movie's made from books as they rarely are as good.<br />I do recommend you read book first as it will fill in details that the movie just can't do in a 2 hour movie. I mainly watched to see how they made the scenes like the actual games etc and that did not disappoint.<br />Good movie and looking forward to part 2
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game super fun for all to enjoy. relaxing and challenging at the same time. parents and kids both like this game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Completely separate from the first season, but holds it's own with new and twisted character plots. If you love the first season, this one is highly recommended.
1451697686|5.0|Bea lives such an elegant life and has so many wonderful ideas. This book is terrific read and I encourage you to check out her blog. I follow her on facebook too, so get her latest instagram pictures. Her blog is [...]<br /><br />Here are a few of my take aways from trying her ideas.<br /><br />1. Life is so much simpler when I remember to turn down extra packaging.<br />2. I cut up a few towels to replace my use of paper towels. Easy and I just throw them in the laundry.<br />3. Love using Dr. Bonner's castile soap. It doesn't bother my very sensitive skin and I also use it to make my own eye make up remover. [[ASIN:B001G7PIJ4 Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Unscented Baby Mild, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]<br />4. Cocoa powder makes cheap and great smelling bronzer. It's also great for dry shampoo substitute if you have brunette hair.<br />5. I would love to try her wardrobe ideas. She shops for her whole wardrobe on only two days of the year.<br />6. I ordered micro fiber cloths and they are great for cleaning windows and replace paper towels. [[ASIN:B009FUF6DM AmazonBasics Microfiber Cleaning Cloth, (Pack of 24)]]
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so fun. Funniest game on earth! I play it every single day! My favorite part about it is that u get a spin coin. THIS GAME IS FUN AND AWESOME! THIS GAME IS WORTH FIVE STARS!
0785125965|5.0|Really enjoyed this novel alot, seems like they are going to be discussing this one for a long time.I could have used a little less on the Bug character, but thats just me.  It does not take away from the experience.  Buy it.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver<br /><br />What can you say with all his ways to make something work out of nothing wish I could do this to.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|We have this on TWO kindles and an ipad. This is just so much fun. It's incredibly pretty and there are infinite designs that one can make.
B000I9YWZ2|4.0|The wife rates it a five every time she sees it (at least 20 times so far), but I rate it a three.  Average: four.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This 5ft USP to Micro-USB Cable together with PowerFast Accelerated Charger are amazing. I thought my Kindle Fire needed to be hauled to the nearest garbage can, sine it couldn't be charged anymore, or so it seemed. But these two items breathed new life into my KF, and extremely fast at that! What a great solution Amazon came up with! Oh, by the way: Amazon customer service for solving my problem with Kindle Fire is t-o-p-s!
B0025KVLS8|1.0|I thought this would bring songs and it had more talking than songs it was not what I thought it was and it is not what it appears..
B002PEP4C8|5.0|A true story of the authors rape!  I think I need not say any more, other than just read it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|To see this type of Weather channel is a great way to view its great, So if you want to try for a few weeks good watching the weather;).
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Although Amazon sent this new cable assuring me it would fix the charging problem with my Kindle. It did not...Now I still cannt charge the Kindle.
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was clever and thought provoking. A truly enticing read. Looking forward of reading more by this author
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|My daughter and I laughed all the way through it.  A lot of it was the cut scenes from the game, but it was still funny to see it played out in its entirety.  The voice actors were right on, especially the Joker.  It's well worth the price of admission.  The extras were okay, the competition videos were fun.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Huge fan of Joe.  This CD is simply JOE.  Great CD. From the first to the last, every song is wonderful.  If you're a fan, you will not be disappointed.  A great buy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the continuation of Gideon and Eva's travels together.  Can't wait to find out how this ends...there better be more..:)
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It was exciting and funny at the same time. It had all of my favorite actors in it so for me it was a win win for me.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game.  I have downloded it to every device I have.  It's easy and fun to play and there are plenty of levels to keep the game going.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Really fun kept my 4 year old very entertained because you can unlock new vehicles and other items fairly quickly. This is the first review I've written I have over 100 apps, very easy to play as well as control. We both really like it a lot!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Every iTreeGamer game is a well made match three with a twist. Great graphics and music make this game addicting and fun.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Started way to slow. Got better as it went. Probable won't go to see Red 2 in the theater. Might rent it when it comes it in DVD
B0063HBPH6|5.0|Funny and out-of-this-world, yet thoroughly engrossing and somehow believable, if you love this type of fantasy :) A brillaint read.
B001QJUX24|3.0|public critic<br /><br />much over rated praise for this dated, sentimental mush. the artificial color of this 50s print is quite appropriate for the writing of the screenplay here.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is a great addition to this series, tho I can only get it to run on my phone and not my tablet. If you're reading this you either already know what it is or you are curious enough to check it out.  Make sure to run the demo before purchasing!
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Well I bought it this morning and finished all the unlocks by the end of the day.....<br />so now irs not as fun, but i think i'll keep it if I ever get bored. Just don't finish it in one day like me, and you should be okay. i like how you don't need IAPs to progress at a practical rate, and hiw the adds are few, far between and non-obtrusive. really liked the game, but some weapons are overpowered and others underpowered (like winchester: 3 rounds, minigun: 300 rounds). thanks for reading the review :)
B005AKFXZW|5.0|A page turner indeed. Loved every minute of reading this book as I just could not predict how the events would twist and turn around.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You have to check out the rooms for items in order to operate the elevators.  Clever game.  Really enjoying it.
0307887960|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It is very helpful and easy to follow. I was certainly helped by the info . There were things in it foe everyones needs
B007LB2B3K|5.0|Had no idea who was playing on the radio, heard they will be at the after shock tour so I went through all the bands I haven't heard of and BAM! found this album, had to buy it and not regretting it at all! Buy this beast!
B002ROKQJM|5.0|I am from the Indian Subcontinent and I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Witty and funny, a well written book which captures the reality of life in modern India.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|I thought it was slow going the last 3 or 4 shows.  It was much more intriguing at the beginning.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|♥ ♥ It was a more emotional season, lots of ups and downs but I'm still hooked. ☺Still Love it! Fantastic show! ♥ ♥
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Best solitaire game ever!!! I'm addicted. It's interactive and challenging. I'm obsessed with getting to the next level and getting trophies.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I love this book! I read The Da Vinci Code as well as Angels & Demons and I just love Dan Brown, his style of writing and the suspenseful reads he provides to those who love to be taken to an amazing place when reading.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Very good acting, lots of fun, lots of action. Hinted at or introduced a lot of the features of the &#34;later&#34; movies without hitting you over the head with them. NIce to see Disney being fun again.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|It's good movies for late a night if you can't sleep. Interesting to see how dads are in this movie.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Good thing it does s*** on its own or I would t of ever known what I wanted on there! ( sarcasm )
B0076HN3T0|5.0|I loved this documentary.  Very interesting about the music business in general.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Nirvana, Foo Fighters, or just good music.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|Another good read very exciting and a very readable story lots of twists and turns  just keep them coming Jack
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great game for my husband and I to figure out together.  Better than watching tv.  Love all the great escape puzzles that are being developed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved it. Not your typical puzzle game. It really made me think but not to the point where I had a brain aneurysm. Can't wait for the next one.<br />Being as this one just came out probably gonna be awhile. :(
B0096HL33G|1.0|I did not like this movie at all. It was full of pain. An abusive relationship that she mostly withered in. She hungered for this abuse and it draaaaagged on. I can't believe I actually watched the entire movie waiting for something to pick up. Two great actors in a bum line for a movie.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was definitely my favorite movie in 2012, and it's even better on blu-ray. It's a must have to any Marvel fan's movie collection.
B00C8REB8U|5.0|My Nephew said he really enjoys this dvd it is one of his favorite,he looks at it often with friends
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|During medieval Japan there is a myth that a great wall of water save them from being invaded by a unknowable black foot Indian army of the gully. This game explains how and why samurai and ninjas now walk the light up street of modern-day Japan. The End
B006S01GH2|5.0|We loved this movie. It it so worth watching again. Lots of comedy. Bits of nudity (hilarious points). The ending was peaceful.
B00BIR381W|5.0|Pretty little liars is wonderful!!! I would recommend to anyone!! So addicting! Once you start watching you can't stop! It's the only TV show I have ever been able to truly get into! I can never miss an episode! The seller had it shipped within a great time!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is awesome, bossome, awesomeness, and bossomesauce. Getting to take care of dragons is fun. You go to at least level 8 in a matter of minutes. Get THIS.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|gripping tale, beautifully told.  An affirmation of love, connectedness to the greater universe even when so alone.  In spite of devastating moments of despair, hope and faith kept him going, even though he never knew what the next day would bring.
0307895505|4.0|Prima guides always seem to be the best when it comes to complex RPG video games.  My only minor complaint is the print is so small I am going to have to get more powerful reading glasses.  But in all honesty, the guide is already so large that larger print would probably make it unmanageable to lift!  (For those of you who are younger my complaint shouldn't pertain.) That being said, this is another example of the fine quality work Prima always does.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|This is a poignant story of two young people who meet on a train and fall in love. it is mostly dialogue between the two of them, but it keeps you interested as you watch the interaction (and growing attraction) between the two. They agree to meet later...and it leaves you with a cliff hanger ending.  Will they meet again? There are two more movies in this series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|LOVE, love, love this game!  It is definitely worth the price and will keep you captivated!  Some have said they completed this in a few hours, I am glad for them but I am no where near that quick on the uptake and do not have that kind of time to dedicate to any game. It definitely keeps pulling me back to learn, discover and find more without leaving me bored, disinterested and looking for something else to do.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved the old app. Are you familiar with the old saying &quot;if it ain't. broke don't. fix it.&quot;  Tried using this new app several times.  Just hate it. Couldn't. set up all my cities couldn't. get sunrise and sunset times.  No help available to tell you how it works. Don't. know who thought this was an improvement. but they definitely need to rethink that idea--because it sucks big time.  Only thing I liked was availability of current warnings.  After I thought. I had set up everything. it changed my hometown to another location. and I couldn't. undo it.  Using Accuweather for now.  Please fix this.....
B004SIIBGU|5.0|love how convenient this app is. it makes checking on bids and items I have listed so much quicker and easier on my tablet
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great actors, drama and you always one more.........I already wathched first 3's...... and can't wait for the 4th.....that already available.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I wasn't as impressed with this book as I was with others he has writen. The idea that Masons are keeping secrets and making deadly plots turned me off. As a 32 degree Scotish rite mason I know that a lot of the so-called info presented was pure rubbish. Masons do not now and never have drank wine from human skulls. Furthermore if one wishes to know the secrets of freemasonry all one has to do is join! You can now petition a mason for membership. If you are going talk about the Masons fine, but, at least get the facts right!!
B003THHIEM|5.0|A nicely done show that is quite funny at times. A very good 43 minutes of &#34;getaway&#34; TV. Worth the price.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|The chimp loves to gather bananas and gems as it cavorts in the jungle. Falls may put you back many steps or ahead in the game.  It may take a good eye to find the small openings. Both my husband on his Kindle HD and me on my  Galaxy phone, could freeze the game by trying to move the screen too far from the chimp(a new breed with a tail) as we searched for gems or hidden paths.
B002VXGW2E|5.0|What can I say about Meryl Streep that hasn't been said?  What can't this woman do???  She should have definitely won the Oscar for this performance,... witty, determined, fiesty and surprisingly sensual.  For those who know her (Julia Child's) story know that food may have been her passion, but her husband Paul was her love.  They simply adored each other, and this is so sweetly portrayed in this movie...you would never think of this movie as a love story, but their love was so strong, it really is a large part of the movie....and should be.  I know the \\"Julie\\" story has taken a lot of criticism as being the weaker of two parts....duh!!!!!  What did you expect going against Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci?  Amy Adams was in this inenviable position and yes, while she was a bit shallow and whiny at times (no thanks to the writers), she did the best she could.  Having a (yummy!!) Chris Messina doesn't hurt though.  Final analysis:  This movie is NOT a rental....it's a movie for everyone's collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you are a fan of Despicable me and Temple run, then this is the game for you! This game is so much fun for all ages.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I really like this game as well as the Wedding and Prom versions. My favorite parts are the makeup and the beginning &quot;spa&quot;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS SHOW! MAGGIE IS THE BEST. I EVEN ENJOY THE LAB. ENJOY THAT ON SOME LEVELS ALL PEOPLE, NO MATTER THERE PLACE ON THE LADDERS DESERVE EQUAL RESPECT AND DIGNITY. A TIME WHEN PEOPLE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I really likes the amazing imagery in this book, but it was frustrating at times not knowing the rules of the game.
B00004W221|5.0|Rudy is still as relevant, if not more so, than the day it was released. Great movie for tweens and up; the lessons shouldn't be missed.
B008VBYN80|4.0|neat game energy doesn't last long though and its not  a free game if you have to spend cash to play
B0059WTMLW|4.0|This is a good game. If you like sudoku or a mind thinking game then this is it. Lots of fun. Like to do this on long car or plane rides.
B0064MGU98|5.0|It was such a treat to watch all episodes of the first three seasons without any commercials, whenever I wanted.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Addictive little solitaire game. The story line that comes between levels just adds  to the fun without being interrupting. Best of all - it's free!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the book.  Started out a little slow but all in all a good, entertaining read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the many different story lines and all the historical drama this show has. Looking forward to season 4.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|I love this product because I can now watch shows from my iPad on the TV  it really work I was amazed
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I have read all of Mitch Albom's books and have loved all of them. This one was a little weird to me but still liked it well enough to keep reading.
1582701709|2.0|Just a compilation of  other  authors.  Very disappointed.  Anyone who has been around even  a little  has read it before in  the original form by the original authors............Pass
B005544V6A|5.0|good characters<br />good acting<br />mostly believable plots<br />Amazon if you bug me for a review and require I fill up space with mandatory text, I'll do so with meaningless typing like this.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore's music has fantastic messages and meanings, unlike most rappers it is definitely not senseless rhymes and though Thrift Shop is catchy and fun, I don't think people should judge him as an artist just by that song. One of my favorite albums.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I cant even open the game to play it...I awlays get a 'force close' message. I have an android system, so I know it works with it
B001EYK52O|4.0|A sight-and-sound rich movie - but I do recommend used Amazon's closed caption feature. Sound balancing in movies seems to be an artform only perfected over the last few decades - the music is often too loud, the dialogue too soft. This especially troublesome with a film like The Thomas Crowne Affair, where sparse words are made all the more important to hear exactly.<br /><br />Amazon's closed caption options are terrific for watching older features - I can change the size and contrast/color balance to work best with each film. I prefer to watch older movies with Amazon Prime, since this feature is something cable or Netflix (I'm a multiple platform subscriber) just aren't offering. Suggestion: add a serif font option for easier reading?
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|But a little short. I finished the story in about 5 hours during a hospital stay on casual mode. Advanced mode would've taken me longer had I played it first but all in all it was very fun to play and the plot was interesting. I definetly would reccommend playing advanced level first if this isn't your first time playing.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I was never much of a Fall Out Boy fan before this album, but I decided to take a chance on their new one and was not disappointed. It has good lyrics, catchy music and is exciting and fun to sing along to.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I find it hard to see exactly what row it is where the blocks will actually land.  Maybe if there was a way to see the cubes from the top it would be better.
B0089XH38M|2.0|Reports a unsecure setting on my Kindle Fire, BUT its built in solution just freezes up the AVG app, and the setting that it refers to apparently doesn't exist on my Kindle.  The Security alert reports that &#34;USB debugging is enabled&#34;, and that it poses a hazard if one is not a developer. It instructs one to tap the &#34;Open Settings&#34; control to disable, but tapping the control just freezes the AVG application.  There is no such setting in the Kindle Settings, so I don't know what the heck it's problem is.  Finally told it to ignore the alert, but this seems contrary to the objectives of security packages.
B001CO42MU|5.0|Awesome, this movie has always been one of my favorite ones, Johnny Depp is the man! A must have, love it
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I liked the book, I thought it was well written and certainly very original. The premise is interesting and the author pulls no punches. However, in spite of a well-developed main character, the relationship to others around her felt flat. As a consequence I didn't develop a lot of connection with any of the characters and by the book's end, I firmly put it down, with not a speck of interest or curiosity about what would happen next.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Second of 10 books, just drags on the evolving story.  Author interestingly organizes chapters by major characters.  I'm not sure if I'll last all ten books to see how they all interact to a conclusion.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Really love the relationships between all the characters and the legal aspects as well.  Keep it up suits.  Nice job
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a journal of a disaster.  A series of interviews that get you into the world, the people and the momentous event.  It was a great study of humanity with zombies and generally a great read.
B00CTMA95S|4.0|Not as complex and twisting as previous titles, but to be honest, after reading Dan Brown's overloaded, over-detailed tour of Italy in Inferno, I was glad for the pace of this book. As a long time fan and reader of Rollins, you get the perennial favourites (if a bit tired, so it was good of Rollins to give them a breather), as well as old and new faces, that were very much welcome. The book's plot is split in two, inter-connected stories, and was an easy read.<br />Overall, not Rollins' (or Sigma Force's) best book, but as always entertaining, and a good mixture of history and science, truth and fiction.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|good reading, just short of excellent.  I would recommend this book to those who like the insight in the middle east people and problems.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I know this story well. It is acted expertly. The costune designs deserve recognition and award. Each character is portrayed with the perfect mix of arrogance and cunning in keeping with their audacious roles. A masterpiece.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I this app is wonderful if your mind is playing the what if game all night and you need to relax. I love it because I can really sleep deeply and soundly. Plus the timer is wonderful.
B00ALKRVTM|5.0|Great way to have all of Poirot's 51 short stories. With publishing dates and extra info, this is a very complete collection indeed.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I think this would be good for the 4 and under group. You tap one of the dots displayed and it plays the music on its own. If you don't tap one of the dotted keys, it does nothing.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|As a fan  Vonnegut`s work, I found this book interesting but not anything I`d rave about to friend. I would say it's neither great nor bad...it just \\"was\\"
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. One of the first things I loaded on my tablet. Simple to use, easy to read. I use it all the time.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Ozzy and Sabbath fans will really appreciate the hard rocking songs included on this cd.  The songs are true to the rock and roll moniker.
B0002XMKYE|4.0|This seems a faithful copy of the movie as I remember it, except for one difference in the dialog: as I recall, in his speech just before the push to the Rhine Patton spoke of &#34;no poor dumb s-- of a b----&#34; rather than &#34;no poor dumb bastard&#34; but I may be wrong; it's been a while since I saw the movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|The kids love it. It keeps them occupied for as long as you need. Just be sure hey don't fight over it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The description of this movie as published on Amazon does not sound that interesting, but the movie is terriffic. Perfect casting and wonderful script. Really memorable. Much better than Argo. Should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I heard that this was a good series but def had to watch with all the hype around JJ Abrams lately.  I am not disappointed.  Really interesting layers of plots to keep you engaged and wanting more
B00008YLV2|5.0|This is superbly done: detailed, credible, giving the impression that everyone involved in its production really respects and appreciates those who gave themselves to this mission.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|The kids love it. It keeps them occupied for as long as you need. Just be sure hey don't fight over it.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Morgan brings out credible stories from a harsh post-stellar colonialized humanity where people can swap bodies and use clones to &#34;live forever&#34;. This bodes for interresting moral dilemmas in a world where noone dies unless their cortical stack (a mind harddrive copy) is destroyed. Fast paced action and a surreal whodunnit with quite the sinister twist. The pages fly by while the story unfolds, and once the last page was turned, I just wanted to read more. :-)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a really great game to play. I can't wait for them to make another one of these games
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite war movies, but because of Alec Guinness' performance, not William Holden's. I think almost any reputable actor could have given a performance more credible and moving than Holden's.
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|I watched this on the weekend what a stinker i thought Sam Raimi had more brains than to bring out a bit of rubbish like this, The three original Evil Dead movies are far superior with Bruce Campbell. What a wasted opportunity.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so much better than the last one and a lot harder than it to.  I like the charachters and the ability to change the power that they use.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very much enjoyed the read. Creates a perspective and adds depth to the historical environment in which the Christianity has taken root.
B000VMBXNA|3.0|I'm afraid this story moved along too slowly for me. An interesting premise, but it couldn't hold my interest. I read it as a bookclub selection and it received three stars overall from the entire group.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The Facebook works very good just like on my computer. I can do everything that i can do on my computer.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best drama to date and I'm over 60 years old with a BA in Communications. This will go down in history as one of the best. The historical plot is intriguing and the actors are superb! Believable. One can watch this without &#34;participating,&#34; but it is very difficult. The thing that amazes me is that each individual can be loved and hated at the same time. Each has good and bad qualities and it's hard to maintain the same opinion of their unique character. This is true of even the bit actors. Wow! Free with Prime, but I will probably buy the series. My wife and I just can't stop watching and want season 4 NOW!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My 7 y/o and I can't get enough of this game. VERY D DIFFICULT to put down! Love playing and hanging out with my child. :-)
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|As a child, I loved the movie and thought of myself quite Oz knowledgeable.  I am 48 and had never read the book until now.  I have to tell you that I completely smitten with this book and cannot wait to read the entire series!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Excellent app! The only reason it doesnt get a 5 is the layout could be slightly better. The most accurate service available. My goto service.
B00CBVRGIK|5.0|i have to say, i wasn't really as aware of Visage \\"back in the day\\" as i was of my favorites like Dead or Alive, (god,,, i wish Pete Burns could \\"get it back together\\"... its sad really), Culture club, Pet Shop, etc....Anyway, i had listened to Fade to Grey and some of the other songs<br />this cd is GREAT... its like i said in my review of the new OMD album... its VERY \\"THEN\\", BUT VERY \\"NOW\\"  as well.... it has that incredible electronic, new age, new romantic, punk.... feeling of the music i love; but with a totally modern application<br />i NEVER thought of Steve Strange as any real kind of singer/vocalist; like so many of the acts back then, they were just thrown into the pop business for the sake of fashion, a strange look, whatever.... it was more about the visual than the audio aspect ( example cited... Marilyn.... for his association with Boy George, the Blitz, etc. ... and he had \\"that look\\") but i have to say.. WOW.... he actually can deliver a good vocal. i had seen a program not too long ago about his struggles with addiction (again, like SO MANY from that  time as their lives and career progressed and receeded); and they were trying to \\"revive\\" his career, had him performing Fade to Grey in any little dive or venue that would have him... it looked very sad and bleak; but....<br />here we are now and it appears they \\"did it\\"..<br />THIS ALBUM IS WORTH BUYING... i listen to it over and over... its smooth, its electronic, its new wave, its Blitz, its.... VISAGE....<br />BUY IT
B009GX7IRA|5.0|It's the only show I'll pay extra for on my Amazon Prime. Not happy about it but the alternative is taking John Denver's advice and &#34;blowing up my TeeVee&#34;.
630469654X|5.0|I love this movie.  I've seen it a bunch of times and finally decided that I have to own it.  The only real violence comes at the end, the rest is, for me, a great story.  I love it.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|A fun field game. You play for hours on end.<br />Fun way to play solitaire. Fun for all ages.<br />Love the gopher!
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|At the end of a busy or hectic day I find that a little while playing Candy Crush relaxes me even though I feel my brain reacting in a good way.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Sounds very much like old school Black Sabbath. All most like a flashback to the 70's Worth buying if you like old sound of Sabbath
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Every chapter is a different character with a different story. Some were revisited in later chapters. This made it hard to care about what happens to then. I like more character development.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I rented this because of it being a suspensful movie and who was in it.  The story line was a good idea but for me it kinda dragged, if you can handle a little of a slow pace hear and there it is worth watching at least once.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|In a world of ever declining quality television programming, Hannibal presents itself as a show of rare quality. If you are tired of your television programming appealing to the lowest common denominator in viewership, you will enjoy Hannibal.
B00821OX98|4.0|I went into watching the show with no expectations, neither good nor bad.  After watching season 1, I feel the same way - I have nothing great nor terrible to say.  As my rating indicates, I like the show but I don't quite love it like I do The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.  Still this show is very entertaining and the acting is on point most of the time.  Yes, sometimes it is cheesy but I am fine with that.<br /><br />Noah Wyle as the lead works and Will Patton (a great actor) as Captain Weaver is really what brings the show together.  Not a &#34;must-watch&#34; for me but definitely a show I would recommend to the right audience.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Blake Snyder takes the reader step by step through the screenplay writing process.  He discusses great movies and what made them work.  He covers one lines, storyboards, and genres.  There is so much material here!  I would not even try to write a screenplay without this book by my side.<br /><br />Snyder is honest--writing a screenplay is hard work and he doesn't minimize that.  He does, however, offer a logical process that can help a writer identify problems and include all the essential elements of a good movie/play in their script.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show, I love the stories of rumplestilskin and snow white and of course the evil queen. It is a fun ride.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I love that you can't take your eyes off the program or you will miss something important.  Love the intrigue.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|I  enjoy Maggie Smith.<br /><br />From a philosophical point of view the way the elderly are depicted is not in keeping with my values. I found it tasteless to a large degree....its humorous elements crossed the line.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I was expecting a big ending with a war, since most totalitarian governments don't give up their power without a fight.  I know this is a teen novel, but I was expecting something a bit more realistic.  Victory was too easy, although certainly many characters did pay a price.<br /><br />That said, as a reviewer I must consider the audience for this book.  Teen girls will find the romantic conclusions satisfying for the most part.  Mysteries, such as they were, get resolved and relationships are left in a position to move forward in a non-dystopian future.
B007LGPSX0|4.0|These brought back memories of when I first started watching the show. I always loved getting to know these characters.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|One of the best novels i have read....recommend to one and all....truly a thrilling tale....eye opener and page turner. Cant put it down unless i finished it
B003NWS5AO|5.0|If you like Robert Plant's voice and can adjust to something different from his Led Zep days, this is a great album. We have really enjoyed it.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love season four as much as the first three seasons. We laughed through every episode. Didn't want the DVD to end. If you want to laugh, get the DVD.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|i love this show since it started.  The stories are good and I love how they mix humor and serious side to all the episodes!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new update to this app just made it useless. Unessecary information,ads and a new pointless rewards section make it unuseable.I will be uninstalling this!
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|But interesting concept. Fun to see Christian Bale be a badass. Good in the old style of things. Reminiscent of 90s
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I'm a long way from Afghanistan, but I really identified with the characters in his story.  I can hardly wait to read &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; -  he's now one of my favorite authors.
0399157565|3.0|Hoping for more than I got. There is too much medical jargon inthe book that was hard to know exactly what she was writing about. Next book will probably be much better.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It was fun in the beginning---until I had to start paying when I thought it would be free---to play.  Ok.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was very happy with this game - was easy yet challenging at the same time. I only wish it had more levels to play.
B00371XIP8|4.0|Perhaps Duffy only has one good idea in him, expressed so well in Boondock Saints. B.S. II reimagines the same idea and achieves 80% of the first.<br /><br />Problems: Eunice mimics Smecker (there's really no point to repeating Smecker, why not give her new and unique quirks?), Sean Patrick Flanery either kept up his loading dose of creatine too long or is owed compensation for bad plastic surgery, and the beards and hair are horrendously phony.<br /><br />Apart from that, Rocco's replacement, Romeo, is excellent. The penultimate scene with the Old Man sitting coolly while destruction rains around him is iconic. The humor is unique to the director, apropos, and timely.<br /><br />Having watched the documentary about the director's life during and after Boondock Saints' release, I feared he had not only no more ideas in him but that the original Boondock Saints was so well done despite his apparent issues. Glad that wasn't the case. f<br /><br />Since they dug into the past to fuel this film's characters' motivations, it would be interesting to go forward with middle-aged brothers now perhaps with twins of their own. This movie lacked the drama the first had built of sibling love and loyalty. A third might bring it back with their own familial devotion as motivation.<br /><br />Buy it, rent it, let's see if #3 is in the offing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Almost every character seems true to the times, the history is excellent.....everything is great. I was ssad when it was over and want more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the first book in this series of three ( The Hunger Games) so natural to read the following two stories<br />The series is for &#34; young adults&#34; but I am now 60 and loved it.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|That appears to be its only function.  If you're used to the hotmail app this one just seems ridiculous and somewhat insulting to the user.  I already know I can get my email using a web browser.  Don't pay 99 cents to be insulted - learn from my mistake and don't buy this.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app keeps telling me there is an update available. It takes me to the android site were I get my phone apps, therefore it tells me the app is already installed and only gives me the option to put it on my phone. Also on the news feed it will not let me choose top stories or most recent. It always gives me what it thinks are top stories so I have stuff going from being posted minutes ago to hours then back to minutes, sometimes there are even other days in there. I have deleted the app from my kindle and cloud, went to the app store and reinstalled it. It still does the same thing.
B003E88TKS|1.0|I bought instant video, but did not receive . I try to resolve this thru the help menu but no luck
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Part of the trilogy.... GreT read, hard topi down when started. Fell in love with the characters and enjoyed seeing their growth throughout the series. Couldn't help but get drawn in and want to know what appens next
B0054R6BFM|2.0|The pros first.  I very much like the message that the author was trying to convey in this book - that small things matter, and that we all need to work more compassion into our lives.  I agree 100%, and if the book inspires some kindness, it has served its purpose.  I also applaud the author for trying to deal with a subject as difficult as suicide.<br /><br />But as a book, that message didn't outweigh the disdain I had for Hannah, who sounded more spiteful and whiny than depressed and suicidal.  What person on the verge of suicide has the energy to do such a complex project with tapes, but can't summon the courage to call an anonymous hotline?  She herself acknowledged that she was looking for help, and complains incessantly that no one tried hard enough to reach her, but she didn't try that hard herself.  She didn't even go to her parents, who are noted to be good and loving individuals.  The author handles that by noting that they were distracted with their business.  Come on.  I just didn't buy that Hannah was that depressed, much less suicidal.<br /><br />I was severely depressed in high school, as I think a lot of teen-agers are, and had far far more serious problems than being listed as \\"best ass\\" in a slam book or getting too much unwanted male attention.  I was tortured by low self-esteem, and didn't have the energy to go to school, much less to do some project blaming everyone else on my issues.  Nor, no matter how depressed I was, would I have stood silently by a date rape in progress.  Nor would I have put myself in a situation to intentionally \\"lose myself\\" in the appalling way that Hannah did.  Hannah disgusted me, and I felt like the author had no clue what depression really feels like.<br /><br />I understand that this book isn't really about Hannah - it's about how others can help the Hannahs of the world.  But then why portray Hannah as such an unsympathetic person?  Regardless, if you are a happy-go-lucky, well-adjusted kid or adult, I think you'll enjoy this book, act a little nicer to people, and then pat yourself on the back.  But for those of us who are closer to the Hannah side of things, you will want to throw this book out of a moving car.  If you want a realistic portrayal of a depressed teen-ager, and of one who's been through a lot more than Hannah, read Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson instead.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|We decided to buy this after our kids got us tickets to a Huey Lewis concert. We love the CD!
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I love this game i have been waiting until it was going to come out and now it did thanks.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great read, the entire series.... Didn't want to put them down once started. Easy thread as characters draw you in. Not a slow mover which helps keep you interested.
B003Q97D48|5.0|I take my Kindle when I'm visiting and I spend some time watching movies and tv shows...After going through most of my must sees, I stumbled upon this show. I was hooked and couldn't put it down. Good clean entertainment with a hint of intrigue. I'd recommend for young teens thru adulthood.
B001OFJPIS|5.0|I like the supernatural feel of the movie plus Prince Nuada is an amazing character. He may be the so called villain of the story, but he's not exactly an evil person. He just wants to help his people and It's driven him to his desperate state.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was late to the Downton Abbey bandwagon but quickly feel in love with the storyline, rich characters development, breathtaking scenery and flawless acting.  It is my new addiction and I can't wait until Season 4.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I decided to watch this series because it was free from my Amazon Prime and on my Kindle HD....Loved it !!!  Stayed very true to the story
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I really love LES MISERABLES.<br />I realy liked the idea of  recording live at shooting site.<br />I am sorry to say, but I don't like Hugh Jackman's kinky voice,<br />He ruined  &#34;bring him home&#34; by his over the top vocal without delicasy.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I just turned 54 on the 16th. Haven't had this much fun on a game in a long time. Love it when it feels like my Kindle is going to shake out of my hand.Thanks Amazon!<br /> Tigsadone13@gmail.com
B0092S4WLY|1.0|this game REALLY hard!!! I haven't even gotten past the first level. and its not fun either because there's no hints or anything! the level just pops up and u guess what to do?! I don't know, I hated it, but it might just be me...  :(
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Legendary movie. One of the best animated movies out there. Must watch... would recommend it again and again GRU rocks
B008HK3XYK|5.0|It is a lot easier to handle the Kindle.It is great to protect the Kindle.I just it would stand up when in the vertical position.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Loves this series. I am hoping that amazon makes season 4free soon because I really want to watch it but can't afford to by the season. It would be worth it but just can't pay for something that is not a necessity at the moment.
B005SHTXN0|4.0|Good character play and story - nice to see the development of the interaction of the two main characters and how they finish
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I don't know if it's the best gateway game ever, but it was my gateway game and I still play it often.<br /><br />The interface is intuitive and easy to use.  It plays well.  Again, as I've written elsewhere, I'd rather play with people across a table and fiddle with the bits with my hands but this is a very good piece of software and worthwhile for those times you can't find a table full of real people.<br /><br />It has some slick &#34;goals&#34; to achieve too.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Not his best.  I was a little confused as to who was who.  Not a very satisfying read for me.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|This was a gift to my nephew - Have heard he enjoyed it but have little additional information since he is a resident of another state .
B0015AARJI|4.0|I choose this product because I like sports game and I can play with my friends.<br />I recommend to everyone
030746363X|4.0|Lots of good info and many different subjects to read about. It was very nice. Good tips for food  and for life.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Everything expected and advertised. Quick delivery and just an over good experience. The movie can be confusing the first time so you'll catch things you missed the first time. I say this as a good thing because you'll find yourself watching the movie several times. Great replay value.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicted to this game . I love it so muchhhhhhh.  I recommend everyone to get it . tu wont regret it
B00364K6YW|5.0|I can't wait to start up that 5 hour and 23 minute saga again. Totally blows away any other version of P & P. Thanks Jane
0547884591|5.0|Lots of good info and many different subjects to read about. It was very nice. Good tips for cooking and for life.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|This is a very specific biography of a very specific time in NYC. Interesting to learn about that Max's Kansas City scene and how easy it was to slide into drugs and its lifestyle. Amazing that the &#34;Kids&#34; were still able to create art. Not always an easy read.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I started watching this show. Because its a police drama. I am hooked. Great show. Good cop Bad cop st yle of show.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We all loved this movie.  It is mesmerizingly beautiful and had a great story.  It's definitely one of those the kids won't mind sitting down to watch more than once.  Very much worth putting in your DVD library.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This review is for the movie; not the blu ray. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It reminded me of all the Japanese tv shows (anyone remember Ultraman?) and monster movies (Godzilla, Rodan) I watched as a kid.  It is just plain dumb fun to watch the big robots square off against the giant monsters. There's no logic, great plot, or character development. Nor should there be. It's not meant to be....just as when you were a child, you have to willingly suspend your disbelief and accept what happens as is. This movie isn't meant to be critiqued and analyzed to death. It's just meant to be enjoyed....watching the heroes square off against the monsters. Loved every minute of it.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I bought this book for my 77 year old aunt on her birthday (the day it came out) and she loved it! This is someone who directs a church choir, is a music teacher, you know a type A personality. I asked to borrow it and she said NO! She wasn't letting it out of her sight! She got such a kick out of it, so I had to buy my own digital copy just so I could read it and experience the hilarity of it all for myself! AWESOME BOOK, AWESOME WEBSITE!!
B009ZFPQOQ|1.0|I'm not at all interested in a social networking on the roads, so maybe it's unfair for me to write this.  But I have also found it inaccurate with navigation, starting right at my home!  I can't follow the visual.  It's designed differently from other navigation systems.  I rely to a significant degree on viewing the icon on the screen, and waze has the road shifting and moving, instead of it being stationary and my vehicle's icon moving along the road as it appears to me in real life.  SO CONFUSING!!! I kept making wrong turns!  I think it must  work better for more sophisticated users, or people whose brains function differently than mine.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|will not download will not uninstall even from amazon.com i have tried deleting it and yet its still here in que...nothing else is downloading yet stays in que. fix please so i can either get on to play or delete.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I liked the first one better but I still found this one interesting I am glad I was able read this series it is a great love story nothing else like it
B004UID2LC|5.0|Fairly easy to use.  Took a few minutes for me to figure it out, but once I did it was &#34;off to the races&#34;!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great writing, great acting. All around awesome show. You start to think about going to law school after watching this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got the game for entertainment on a car trip for three young adults. It did it's job of helping to pass the time as we flung the birds to squash those annoying pigs. We liked that we could jump around to the different themes themes and could go back to levels already played.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is great reminds me a lot of Diablo I wish it was a little easier to earn gold and gems I understand they wAnt to make money but it's a little ridiculous how all the good games on here you basically have to pay to win other then that good game
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a little hard for my 9 year old but she loves the challenge.  We have had no problems with it at all
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved the way Sean framed this book in the context of how Tesla's thinking enabled so much of what we take for granted in the 21st Century to be established in the first place. An excellent read.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I get panic attacks sometimes in the morning when I start to wake up and this is a simple thing to turn to, to ease my way into the day.  It's also awesome for focusing on work in my frequently distracting environment. The great thing about the premium version is that it will play in the background if I need to use my Kindle for other things at the same time. The sounds loop seamlessly and if you set the timer, it fades out at the end instead of just shutting off suddenly.<br /><br />The only disappointing thing is the &#34;lullaby&#34; sound.  I wanted it to be so soothing, but the person doing it sounds like they're trying to be discovered for their AWESOME VOICE rather than singing a child to sleep. ;)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is fun but sometimes it blacks out sometimes when you are playing.  But it is still a fun game to play!
B00003CXIP|4.0|I've wanted to review this film since I was 15(32 years old now, but worth the wait!) This movie made laugh, think and at times, even want to cry. I read the novella long after seeing/and owning the movie. I happen to enjoy both though, despite some differences, some small others, larger. This was my first Stephen King movie I watched that didn't have a negative effect on me. But like every movie, there are parts I don't like. Kiefer Sutherland's first apperance indicates almost instantly that you're going to hate him, and he doesn't disappoint, you hate him more as the movie continues, but in the end, he gets a subtle taste of his own medicine. Now, I know in the 50s-70s, and in some ways, even now, we tolerate a lot more than we should have to, but when it comes to bullying, how many more suicides and Columbine massacres have to happen before everyone puts their foot down? As you can hopefully see, my compassion for bullies, rapists, and child molesters is rather slim, esp. when they show no remorse or mercy for their victims. I like this film because of several things, one: the young and somewhat unknown cast. 2: it has many fairly amusing scenes, 3: the music is so much better than some of the modern junk we hear now. 4: the scene where Wil Wheaton as Gordie stands up to Kiefer near the end, made me laugh and applaud. He does this scene with such determination, not to mention, intensity and the look on his face, gave me chills, almost wanting to look away, but couldn't.<br />Then he says something to Kiefer, that I won't repeat due to being too vulgar, but it cracked me up to no end, and still does today. One of Gordie's stories, in the book, was something I wouldn't have expected from the mind of a 12 year old boy, at least in that time frame, these days, it wouldn't shock many.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun to play because you get to unlock characters and go to different world tours and surfing on the subway
0767803434|4.0|I saw this film for the first time in theaters with my aunt and a friend, at the time, bad move!(long story) I'm much more analytical now with movies, most of the time. Harrison Ford does a very good president who has a no-nonsense approach to terrorism, led by a cold and merciless terrorist Gary Oldman. The plot is fairly easy to follow, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, who I'd swear Saw composer Charlie Clouser took some tips from) once again has an excellent musical score. Even though I do enjoy this film, I do have a couple issues with it: first, I know Gary Oldman is the primary villian in this film, and the script makes him very easy to hate, more with actions and facial expressions. However, he isn't the only character I couldn't stand, Dean Stockwell as the Defense Secretary, how pathetic, in this case. Aside from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close, the wife played by Wendy Crewson from Good Son and daughter, some characters don't last long enough to even care about. And in movies like this, you have to know the villian has back-up, unfortunately, that cliche has gotten very old for me, along with the \\"kill the witness formula\\". All that aside, this also set the stage for two other similiar movies recently released in theaters, both that I watched and overall liked-Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down) This film however, seemed like a blueprint for those films, even though, obviously, the new ones, seemed a lot more intense. In those films, however, at least with White House Down, the media was as bad as the terrorists! When it comes to news reporters and tabloid reporters, whatever celebrities want to dish out at them, including violence, dare I say it? Bravo! Esp. when they are so relentless and don't care who they hurt to get their story, remember Princess Dianna? Don't even get me started!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a typical fantasy novel by Neil Gaiman. Very descriptive characters and fun story, but fairly short as a novel. It was fun, but not my favorite of Neil Gaiman books.
B000059TFO|3.0|I'm glad to have finally seen this film, but honestly, I'm glad to have rented it. Racism, bigotry, homophobia, predjudice. No matter what you call it, it always goes back to the same thing-intolerance. Now, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not predjudice towards anything, except intolerance. When personal bias comes before the law, and justice fails-and this movie, it kind of does) that infuriates me! Now, some may say this is all in the past and doesn't happen anymore, ha! Those who think that are living in a dream world! You can pass civil rights laws until you're bleeding, it won't erase the issue. There are still people who think they're above the law, which is far from the truth. The KKK maybe no longer be as big an issue, but the Westboro Baptist Church has essentially replaced them! They hide behind the Bible, their version of God, and worst of all, they have the law siding with them, most of the time. Why? Because of freedom of speech! They don't care who they're hurting, and they think no one can touch them, but apparently, that has been challenged, because they have been attacked, along with their children, but they still won't shut up! Some say, love your enemies, it's the Christian way to be. But with people like this, I find that difficult, if not impossible! Same thing with eye for an eye, and turn the other cheek. Does that mean let yourself be attacked? Gosh, I hope not! I'm not an advocate for revenge, unless justice fails, and it has, many times, when do we say enough is enough?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and entertaining and you can play it without internet. Once you start playing it you can't stop.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was an easy and fast read. Very enjoyable. Much different than most books you will read about zombies but in a good way
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is amazing! It is funny and emotional at the same time. Each episode surprises me and I really love and root for all the characters.
B007N8RULO|5.0|A great game for all who love to play any card game, it is a challenge to for all ages!!
B004RL9T50|5.0|Anytime you can get Will Ferrell in a non-idiot role (see &#34;Old School,&#34; &#34;Step Brothers,&#34;) you're in for a treat. This is fun, clever, and heart-warming. :)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Had a difficult time remembering who all the characters were and what was happening. I did like the storyline and plan on rereading it. I enjoyed  his other two novels, &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; better. Khaled Hosseni is a great writer.It's hard to put these books down once you start reading .
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is a great go-to Bond movie. Not quite as good as Casino Royale (and for those who love the classics, the original Bond is hard to beat) but this movie is visually gorgeous, full of action, and takes Bond on a pretty compelling character journey.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|This was one of the very, very best shows that I have seen!!!! I was so dsappointed when the series ended. I am so looking forward to seeing Jack Bauer again next year!!!! Love Jack! Each and every episode was terrific!
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I hadn't listened to a JT album in a while, but this dude is talented.  Has some great dance tunes on here with JT's smooth skills on display behind the mic.  Ladies sure to love it, and fellas keep an open mind and just groove with it!  Pusha Love Girl is my favorite track...Timbaland on all the beats, so you already know what to expect there.  Try it out....might be surprised.
081297381X|5.0|The books was referenced often in Kahneman's &#34;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#34; and so I got it. it is full of the same great thinking. Important for anyone to read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is one of the best games I have played on my kindle and the second one is even better. And free so how much better could it get
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great trilogy!  Loved it!<br />Stayed up a lot of nights to read! And I'm actually sad I've finished-<br />A must read!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book!  It gave me peace knowing we will continue on after death and it is not the doom and gloom preached to us.  It gave me hope, re assurance, and although I am not eager to &#34;go&#34;, I am not in fear of going, only the manner in which.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Diassapointing. Very dissapointing. The Crossfire series was the only series I could get into of all Ms Days novels. This one was too much fluff, and too much about characters that really have no role in the books. I thought trilogy meant three.... I'll finish the series, just because that's how I am, but I'll wait for my sister to buy them, and just borrow from her. I won't be wasting my money on these books anymore.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Do not get me wrong the game is great. It is just not long enough. I paid $5 for this game do not think it was worth the money.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The writing is mediocre, burg the suspense is exciting. E. L. James has an uncanny way of using big words for the sake of using big words and doesn't take into account that people don't talk the way his characters do. It's hard to connect with the characters, but who doesn't love some good ole S&M?
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This is a documentary about how and why people lie on the social internet sites.  It also shows how and why some people are gullible enough to have a romantic relationship with someone they have never seen in person.  It is sad more times than not.<br /><br />We heard the term &#34;catfish&#34; but wasn't sure what it meant.  We found this documentary to be interesting and well-paced.  In a way, it was entertaining because of the young men who were making the film.  They were kind and funny and didn't have a mean bone in their bodies.<br /><br />Be prepared for the emotional ups and downs as you follow the film makers on their journey to find out who is actually on the other side of the texts, phone calls, and emails.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|this is the first Neil Gaiman work I have read and I thought it was okay, but not a great read. Not something I would highly recommend.
B0076XDGZ0|4.0|Others reviews here have good descriptions of the music so I'll offer my general impressions.<br /><br />I imagine a lot of people like me came to this album thinking of the band as the two Dixie Dreggs guys plus the two Transatlantic guys plus someone else. What surprised me was how much this album feels like it's built around that someone else, Casey McPherson. The first track is a great, uptempo song that I wish had been on the last Transatlantic album and, while McPherson does a lot of the singing, he could easily be mistaken for Morse (Neal) if you aren't paying close attention.<br /><br />After that the rest of the album feels more like McPherson with the prog backup. He is a talented singer, often jumping into falsetto and an almost buzzing vibrato. His lyrics generally strike me as heart-on-the-sleeve, without spending much effort trying to be clever. The tunes can also come off as cliched, sometimes feeling like something you might hear in a chick flick during a poignant moment. This is only on a handful of tracks, and after 7 - 10 listens there is only one song I always skip (\\"The Storm\\"), because it's so annoyingly corny, and one I usually skip (\\"Better than Walking Away\\") because it feels like there's also nothing original about the tune. Both of those strike me as blatant top 40 attempts that would be rejected by top 40 radio as having too much crass commercialism. I get a \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" vibe from them.<br /><br />Most of the songs hit a good variety of rock and prog styles and it makes for an enjoyable listen as an album, with styles changing throughout. The worst I can say about the album is that I can only remember and hum the first song when I'm away from the music. I like the variety of styles and, when listening while doing nothing else, I really appreciate the musicianship. Drums and keyboards are like Transatlantic. Guitar is expressive and non-repetitive without moving too much to the front or exhibiting too much personality. It does a great job of supporting the songs, but fans of Steve Morse may be disappointed to hear less of his personality coming through. Bass is active and interesting while always feeling appropriate. The band comes together well to \\"dress up\\" and add to the songs, almost always without meandering.<br /><br />Other web sites promoting this music boast about the length of some of the songs. The longer songs have more of a Transatlantic-y evolving feel, rather than a grand epic feel.<br /><br />Overall I enjoy this album a lot without loving it.
B000069KIZ|5.0|When I bought Bohm's Beethoven 2-disc set with the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Symphonies, I was looking for the Sixth, but was amazed at the passion and energy he brought to the Seventh and the graceful directness of the Eighth, and all this in the mid-to late 1970's, when Bohm was over 80.  So when I saw this Brahms box from the same period for under $3.00 a disc at my local indie store, I picked it up.  It is very fine.  It's not a question of it being better than or as good as Klemperer, Jochum, Haitink, Abbado, Szell, or whoever.  It's just good -- great analogue sound (not as refined the best digital) with plenty of warmth, and a bit less highlighting of the winds than one gets from Walter Legge for Klemperer, but still it's not a boring homogenized texture.  Also, all choirs in the orchestra get their due, and the low strings and brass are always there, chugging along.  There's nothing showy or spectacular about it, but you feel that you're getting Brahms \\"straight\\" -- weighty, rich sound, but because of the energetic pulse and the rhythmic steadiness never descending into heaviness.  The energy of that Beethoven Seventh is manifest here too.  I have a lot of Brahms sets -- and I'm glad to have them all, and to add this to it.<br /><br />Follow-up (08/09/13):  I Just played the Second again.  What great sound, and I can't imagine a more cogent interpretation,  The build-up to the final climax is just masterly, and the way that the sound keeps the textures clear in even the most loud passages is remarkable.  Many digital recordings don't do this well.  And the Alto Rhapsody -- just stunningly done.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Lots of action and laughs in this movie. Great characters make the movie! Can't wait to catch the sequel in the theater.
B007R9MFPU|3.0|Once again, living in the states, we never get to here when an iconic band from the 80's puts out a new record for reasons I don't understand. The 80's are alive and well, and I wish record companies would take note. Hey guys, OMD just played another sold out night at Terminal 5. Ka-ching ka-ching! But I digress. I only found out the Ultravox had released a brand new album because Simple Minds is on tour in Europe (and coming to play the states for the first time in over a decade) and the supporting act for them was Ultravox in support of the new album, \\"Brilliant\\". So of course I had to give it a go. I don't think there's a perfect Ultravox I can listen all the way through and this one's no different. I didn't know what I was in for especially given all the single word titles, maybe a concept album, who knows. One is immediately pulled into the opening track, \\"Live\\", with the classic cinematic keyboards and backing guitar arrangements and like an old friend, you hear Midge Ure's iconic vocals. I drew a comparison to David Lee Roth's vocals on Van Halen's latest album, \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" in that maybe he doesn't have the full range as 20 years ago which you sympathize, but there's no doubt both make the absolute most of what they got. The album has it's share of upbeat songs and many have some semi-religious undertones in the way Hymn had like in \\"Rise\\" which is actually overt and \\"Live\\". Then they have quick turnarounds with songs of melancholy and deep sadness with \\"Remembering\\" and \\"Fall\\". It's an album with a mix of multiple personality and attention deficit disorders. It's really good in spots but you never quite get the feeling what exactly they were shooting for as an end product. It's not a bad reunion album but it's not essential to the Ultravox catalog.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have heard of this book seris for over a year and finially started reading. I love the books. I started the first one and couldn't put it down. I hope she writes more.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This kept crashing both my kindle and my smartphone. Ended up un-installing due to this. Would not download again. poor app
B007IV1E2W|5.0|Dr Who is an amazing series.  While this season isnt as good as some of the previous seasons, it is still great!
B007XC9BSK|4.0|It was exactly as described. I didn't realize that it was the micro drifters - was looking at the photo only.
031236198X|3.0|This is an easy read that makes particle sense. It's good for understanding why people react differently in times of change.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|It seemed as if it was a little updated but basically the same movie as the classic. The dancing was good but it just couldn't eclipse the original. It was fun to watch.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Although it is similar to many other games, this one is fun to play.  Each board presents a different challenge, but 3 stars are able to be reached with a little practice and luck.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This movie was non-stop with every action hero who ever lived and is still living! The only one missing was Jackie Chan! For excitement from start to finish, this is the movie.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I am in enthralled with Vaelin Al Sorna.  This book is the best fantasy I have read in years.  The characters come alive with such force that they seamlessly become part of your daily concerns.  Vaelin is the most commanding character I have ever read.  A true masterpiece!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Unfortunately, I saw the movie before I read the book.  The book allows you to invest more in the characters emotions than the movie did.  I can't wait to read the next book.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have been a long time fan of these books but the last installment was lacking the excitement I used to find irresistible.  The ending was not what I would have preferred but Sookie has given me hours of entertainment over the years and for that I am thankful.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|What more can I say, Groovy says it all! Awesome movie, really fun, super bloody, funny, scary, fantastic!! Loved it!!
B0037BB00I|4.0|I bought this unheard after falling in love with &#34;21&#34;. Not as much as 21 but right up there. What a voice!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I chose 5 stars because they book is so amazing and passionate . I was so into the book it felt real. There was nothing I didn't like about the book. I would share this book with any romantic book lover. I will continue to read more of Nicholas Sparks books. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book didn't start out bad, but then I found myself skipping entire pages to get to some content that was meaningful. This author seems to have a lack of vocabulary and obsessed with sex. I am happy I did not pay too much for this Kindle version. It is a little too coincidental to pass for believable.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Couldn't wait to get the 2nd installment.  Definitely worth every penny.  Just as good as the first installment.  Don't miss it.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I enjoyed all six seasons of this show. It will keep you hooked from beginning to end!  I would definitely recommend watching this show!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a story that went all the places you could never imagine, so inspired I will definitely be reading more from her, loved this book!!!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story is riveting, the characters are well developed.  You can actually picture the house and its surroundings.  Very poignant period in history.  Great read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Because other people telling me about this show I decided to take a look and became hooked and can't wait for the new season to begin
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Characters, visual descriptions of the location, etc. were all excellent.  Beautifully written as usual.  A really excellent read.  Highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a story of the future here on Earth. Many generations from now, the air on Earth will be unbreathable. But alas, man still survives in underground silos. Many of them. And they live their lives not knowing about the others exsistance. Commit a bad enough crime in this community and you could be sent 'outside' in an environmental suit to clean the camera lenses. It is a one way trip, nobody has returned from outside.<br /><br />There is much more to this story that you'll enjoy. Well-written with in-depth characters. Well worth reading!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Absolutely love it!  So does my granddaughter.  This game gets gets addicting and I play it all the time now.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Many can appreciate this story.  None however as much as those who have experienced combat.  Only honor, integrity, and respect for your comrades in arms, regardless of the uniform worn, enable you to maintain your humanity.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Almost 20 years ago I interviewed a successful Canadian entrepreneur for the documentary \\"In Search of Happiness\\". When I asked what the main reason for his business success was, he replied: \\"I have never in my mind how much money I'll make, but how to give the best service to my clients, how to satisfy what they want. Then money comes naturally as a result of serving my clients well, not because I had making money in my mind as the main goal. \\"<br />Derek Silver is very open about that principle. This is a great book of Derek's personal experiences for innovative entrepreneurs. Reading it you will learn how to persevere and learn from mistakes (one of them cost him several million dollars). This is one of the best business books I've read, although there may be a couple of recommendations that I find hard to put in practice.
141970642X|5.0|My grandson opened it and read it before the day was done...loved it. He loves to<br />read and I am glad there are so many books available in his age group
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Pretty easy for us beginners and I would say hard enough for begonner.  I like the graphic and hope to complete the puzzle someday in the near future.  Easy does it.
0670018651|5.0|This book is a great reference work, and was very enlightening. Very glad I bought it, if you are a perfumista you will find it to be very useful. I didn't agree with all of the reviews but they have definitely encouraged me to try perfumes that are outside my usual comfort zone. I would highly recommend picking up this volume.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Cant we take our time to look over these apps before we run into the darn rates.  I don't find this to be any good for the world in general do you?  Why cant all th e psople please u terrible and fun.
0345803493|3.0|It's kind of predictible, the story is OK and it reads well, but kind of the same repeating it's self.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Red not play the app. We don't always get to just set and do this all day long and we don't really care to play this game all day long and then you have other times when the problem of time is cinstant darn it.  I wish that the time would stop for just one second don't you.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|One of the best books in the series. A great story of redemption and forgiveness and unswerving loyalty. Great love story.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|LIke playing this game, it doesn't keep my busy for hours but a level or two is about right, then move on.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was extremely disappointed with how the author ended this book.  I was disappointed at the closing chapter and expected so much more as a conclusion to this novel.  The beginning and middle of the novel were great - really held my interest.  But what a letdown at the end.  I am reviewing the entire book again to see if I missed anything.  Such a waste of my time!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like the game, love the no adds better, I can't play it for hours on end, but it's fun playing
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Love that Amazon offers CHEAPER and easier ways to get GOOD movies.  Netflix is cheap but doesn't have good selection. Red Box is hit or miss and you have to deal with returning it.  Vudu is $8+ tax<br /><br />If you have an XBox, this is the way to go!<br /><br />Cute movie.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|While a whole lot of critics do not like movies based off of books by Dr Suess , Everyone should be pleased with Horton Hears a Who because it stays true to the Source Material its based on with the animation being very colorful and the story being told in the style of a cartoon and the characters having a lot of jokes to make you laugh . Horton Hears a Who is made by Blue Sky Studios which have only made 3 good movies which are this movie , Ice Age 3 and Epic . But mostly Blue Sky Studios picks lazy story after lazy story to make some bad movies . So go see this movie and expect a whole lot of fantastic things brought on to the screen with this great movie.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I absolutely loved this Movie, I have Been waiting for the longest time for someone to pick up where paranormal activity left off.Only in a much more realistic manner than Paranormal activity. And not only that, Its a true story about 2 things in one movie,the warrens, Ed and Loraine warren and the home that was haunted in Rhode Island.This was a realistic account of what Ed and Loraine Had ton Go Through In a Lot of their cases. Cant Wait for this Movie to come out on Dvd/Blueray.I hope they Make More Movies about the warrens case files, or a sequal to the conjuring.
B008133MDK|4.0|My favorite episode in Season 2 is the first.  It's hugely entertaining!  Some of the best lines in the series.
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|I enjoyed finding this book on Amazon and actually being impressed by it! I love the meshwork of past and present and trying to figure out where you come from. Very interesting

044654759X|5.0|I LOVE Nicholas Sparks books as much as I love the movie remakes but this book is definitely one that should be read instead of watched.  I highly enjoyed the intimate details of the book that just don't come through in the movie.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The 40th Anniversary is really something special and I am so happy to have purchased it. It is well worth it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book and the experiments affirm we live in a wonderful world.  We can have joy in our life everyday.  We are loved and powerful.  This is a wonderful fantastic book.  Thank you
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loved the book!!! Pam Grout writes in an intelligent and humorous manner.  Her insight is extremely broad, and, she says what she has to say in precise sentences. There are no long meaningless essays, or repetition. I have recommended her book to many friends.  I will read more of her books.  She is a new author to me.  This is the first of her books that I have read.  I intend to read many more!!
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Even Maggie Smith couldn't save this movie for me.  It's cliché and boring, without direction, and no story to speak of.  And a little depressing.  We're meant to believe that the residents of a home for elderly are down on their luck, but the residence is sumptuous as are the grounds.  The thin plot is not very skillfully developed nor are the characters.  And against the premise of being in various stages of dementia, the movie is one long sing-along as the residents happily and skillfully perform throughout.  Typical side show of staff shagging in the bushes, procuring the naughty old folks their hootch and smilingly enduring tedious repartee filled with sexual innuendo from the \\"residents\\" scattered liberally throughout, but not executed as well as Benny Hill.  Everyone is engaged in producing or avoiding the big \\"gala\\" that will \\"save\\" the home.  Not sure they had it...I gave up 1 hour into the movie.  Don't waste your money renting or buying this.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a very good book.  Will be passing this one on to my 12 yr old daughter to read next.
B0011ZYR6G|5.0|Jerry is such an accomplished songwriter. Not just that, there's few that can phrase guitar solos better than he always seems to. He's not flashy but it's always melodic and song-serving. Without being disrespectful to the late Layne Staley who himself was an amazing musician, there's little doubt that Jerry is - at the very least - half of the reason why AIC were and remain so compelling and relevant. As such, this is must- have for all fans of heavy/atmospheric rock music ( I hate to use the dreaded 'grunge\\" tag). Just buy it - you will not regret it. ( 'Boggy Depot' is good too but this is superior)
1878424319|5.0|I find this book to be a bit corny but uplifting. A good read for anyone wanting a positive spin on life.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|This movie is good because it shows both sides of the conflict and also what the families went through back home. I watched it with a Viet Nam veteran who told me that it was realistic on being overrun and the professionalism of the soldiers on both sides. I got this movie learn about what our vets went through over there.
B001L4I43O|5.0|Suggest this for everyone, one of spike lees best movies. Now I wish amazon would have the Huey p newton story available on instant..another must see
B004QL7K6G|1.0|HATED IT!  This makes a bad movie look good -- even with the hilarious, talented Ken Marino helping to pen this sad attempt at comedy.  The plot was cute enough, but even Jennifer Aniston & Paul Rudd couldn't make this tale tellable -- we never laughed, only looked at each other with wonder.  My wanderlust kicked in and we walked away.  Steer clear since this movie simply uses up valuable time.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I thought it was funny but not as funny as other shows. I still liked it. It is still better than any thing else on TV.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My Wife loves this show.  thank you so much for getting this show on the list. it is very much liked.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved Abbey  was so happy to watch all the seasons  to be able to get up to date with the seasons. I am excited and ready to watch the new season.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I am happy with the app. I think that the app is really great. It's easy to use, has lots of wake up sounds, and works in sleep mode! Plus, in sleep mode, it won't drain my battery! Basically, the app is great. I may get the full version! Get it!
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|A great introduction to world cinema, I would definitely recommend this film to opening the minds of people who didn't know that there could be film outside of the unfortunately narrow limitations of the kinds of movies Hollywood makes.<br /><br />That being said, there are some issues with the documentary, one of omission (which is understandable given the breath of film Mr. Cousins wants to cover) and the other of not dealing with some important definitions of film which are threatening to be changed.<br /><br />The documentary is not as much \\"The Story of Film\\" as much as it is \\"The Story of Film Directors.\\" A film is noted as important in the documentary when it is one that pushed the boundaries of film to a new level. Mr. Cousins generally engages in the oversimplification of attributing the final result of the film to the director and not nearly as much attention is paid to the cinematographers, actors, designers, or music composers.<br />With the exception of Walt Disney's \\"Snow White,\\" animation is almost entirely absent from the Story. More importantly, art and avant garde film is nearly completely left out, whose advances and radical ideas trickled their way down to mainstream directors and are the source of many iconic and groundbreaking images in mainstream film. Even important inventions, like the Steadicam, which for the first time in film history allowed cameramen to remove their cameras from the dolly track and gave them freedom to compose new and stunning images, like the iconic stair sequence in \\"Rocky\\" or the camera that tracks Danny in \\"The Shining,\\" were not mentioned.<br /><br />As \\"The Story of Film\\" enters the 1990s, little or no screen time is given to the transitions into digital, and how some filmmakers see that as a destructive trend that is attacking the core definitions of what film is. Some examples:<br />*While Mr. Cousins defines Film as a medium that records successive images of light from the external world, he never addresses whether Computer Generated Imagery should be considered in the same category of Film or as Animation. In many major movies for the past two decades, entire sequences are created where there is no actual camera. Should movies with what are essentially long animated sequences be put on the same level as movies that capture light from the outside world?<br />*The use of Film vs Digital recording methods: there are some filmmakers who believe that film has inherently better qualities that are presently available using digital video cameras (image and color fidelity on digital still cannot match film), and that it is not an appropriate time for the industry to be transferring over to digital capture.<br />*Similarly, there is a debate whether there is an important difference over screening a movie using an actual film reel passing through light versus digital projection.<br /><br />The documentary is worth your time, but you should try and keep in mind that there are definitely some major elements being left out. Hopefully Mr. Cousins will make additional features that go into these subjects in greater depth.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A gripping tale of how lives are interwoven in the most unexpected ways. It gives one a reason to venture out of their own comfort zone and opens their eyes to the many injustices that prevail in this world. The story of two women and the sorrows and joys that are their lives is unforgettable. Khalid Hosseini has proven once again what a talented writer he is.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|While some of the song lyrics make me go &#34;huh?&#34;, there is no denying that this group knows a catchy hook and employs it well. The &#34;uptempo&#34; songs fare the best.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|Great songs and especially love Steve Martin's part. Memorable songs and fun to watch. Don't know what it was like on stage, but this version is fun.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|Unexpectedly worthy to be called scary. Nothing like the new and non-suspenseful Paranormal Activity. Watch if you are looking for a thrill ride through the haunted hospital!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It was ok. Kept waiting and hoping it was going somewhere, but I didn't think it ever really did. I was looking for \\"closure\\"! It was supposed to be a trilogy and its not going to be!!! The author states at the end that its not. Was disappointed that if wasn't.  It was a quick easy read, but very monotonous!!!  I'd like more substance in the next and hopefully last book in this \\"trilogy\\".
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love period pieces because it gives a glance into what it might have been like living in a place/period like that<br />I love the class wars between the well to do land owners and the servants<br />I love the differences that start to show up from the old grandmother type to her daughter and then on to her daughters and how the vote and the war changed things
B004US4K2C|5.0|Launcher EX is by far my favorite launcher. Before settling on this I tried several but was never quite satisfied. This one does a great job of doing what I need and is very customizable.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|The movie PAUL is perhaps the most realistic characterization of those pesky little \\"GRAY-ALIENS\\" who have become entrenched in American and perhaps even global folklore. Since the alledged Rosewell crash in 1947 to the Betty & Barnie Hill abduction event in the late 50s . . . small GRAY ALIENS have been part of our lexicon. This film personifies them into a character called \\"PAUL\\" who is seeking his freedom from his \\"keepers\\" after decades of revealing all his secrets. The story is well crafted with great characters, and a plot that totally engages the viewer. But, best of all . . . it is FUNNY! Hope there will be a sequel someday soon! I am the author of:  [[ASIN:1432771361 When I Was a Child: Based on a true story of love, death, and survival on the Kansas prairie]]
B0063IH60K|4.0|Keeps me busy without having to put too much effort in it. Would like to see the &quot;ads&quot; disappear bit overall I've enjoyed playing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have seen a couple of shows related the lawyers, but this one is the best. The actors do a great job.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I got to 6/8 pages then he killed me<br />Someone said that he didn't show up in Easy mode<br />But he does<br />LIAR still awesome game BUY IT<br />he grows tentacles on the 5/8pages<br />It is not that scary in daytime<br />I recommend this game<br />like I said BUY IT!!!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the suspense that is built up over the two seasons. Great cliff hangers as well. I can't wait to watch season 3.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I like the choice to write a full book about half the characters.  As always the story is well written though not the strongest of the series.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Love the suspense that is built up over the two seasons. Great cliff hangers as well. I wish there was more.
B008OOYALE|5.0|wow so good it is so realistic but u spend a lot of cha ching and coins<br /> n stuff it is so much better than dragonvale
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Stop trying to be trendy fixing an app to with the now.  This app was not 5 stars in the beginning and now it is most certainly a zero...0....zeeeeerrrrrrrooooooo star app.  TWC has been trying to be clever, cool, hipster wannabees on tv with that crap they do and now they are making unfriendly, battery hog appa that take forever to load and stay current.....even the webpage it out of control.  Just stop updating looks of stuff to stay trendy because its irritating to learn a new unfriendly app and fuss with lagging radar when the severe weather has already passed by the time it loads.  This is now a low rate, sub-par app that you certainly dont want to depend on in the event of severe weather.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is another great game. I can spend hours playing. I just love it :) why do they make u put so many words.
0062255657|5.0|A short but enjoyable read. Full of Gaiman's typical flourish and recommended reading for any fan of his other work.
B000065KH4|5.0|My friend told me she loved this movie, so I wanted to see it.  My favorite part, was at the beginning, when the lady took the candy home, and called her husband, but he didn't come, so she threw the candy into the trash, but missed.  He came into the room and found it, and ate it, and went to look for her and saw her bending over the bathtub, with a LOOK in his eyes.....  That was so cute!  Small part for Johnny Depp, but he was good.  I loved seeing a cross on the wall and them talking about lent! I loved the movie!
B009DT424Y|4.0|Having searched all over for a Bluetooth mic that would initiate the connection with no success, I finally took a chance on this one.  The two different sync modes is very helpful.  I'm using this with a Bose Mini speaker to amplify my voice in groups or when my voice is too weak due to ALS.  My only issue is with the small switch you hold down to initiate the sync.  I don't have full use of my hands and the small switch is a bit of a challenge
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|Absolute worst adaptation of a book to a movie I've ever encountered. Completely disappointed in how badly this was done. Key plot points were ignored and main characters left out. Some of the casting was questionable as well...
034580404X|4.0|Enjoying the reading and can't put the book down.  I plan to pass it on to a friend when I am done
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I can't find a user's guide to it anywhere on the web. Useless. I haven't been able to import books already on my tablet into the Kindle app. I'll be un-installing it.
B005544V6A|5.0|Good quality tv show. Hard to come by these nowadays. I enjoy the story lines, the actors are professional (it irks me when I have to watch B-rated actors) and so I look forward to the episodes.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|What's weird: This movie makes boot camp look scarier then combat.<br />It's almost like two movies in one. The Paris Island first half and the Vietnam second half. If you liked Kubrick's other films, particularly,  &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; and &#34;The Shining&#34; you will like this one.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Wonderful wonderful series.  Deeply disappointed that I couldn't watch Season 4.  Can we do something about that?  Really love the series.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I started reading this book as a sample before buying. At first when I started reading this book I thought Drew was a self-centered man whore & I wasn't sure if I liked his smart assed attitude \\"talking to me\\" from his 1st person POV.  I honestly didn't know if I could finish reading this let alone buy it. However where the sample left off before you \\"buy the book\\" left me curious.  I think at that point I still wasn't hooked but I just wanted to know more information.  Since it was only $4.99 I decided what the heck, I've wasted more than that on useless stuff in the past so why not?  I am glad I did.  I really ended up LOVING this book.  Through out the book I had several LOL moments, especially from Drews niece.  I enjoyed all of the characters, they were all really well developed.  The sex scenes were pretty hot but not over the top kinky, I really enjoyed those from Drews POV.  Most all books are from the womans POV so it was refreshing to read from the mans POV.  I think the best thing for me was that this book didn't leave me hanging at the end. It was tied up very nicely just enough to make me happy but just enough to make me want to read the next book when it comes out.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini opens up a whole new world--a world that is seldom explored. Fascinating story line that makes you just want to keep on reading.
B009R659L8|4.0|Story was a bit drawn out, but still very good.  Mary put together an ending that I didn't see coming.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I loved this app ever since I first started playing minecraft it keeps you busy all day long ,even though it don't have minecarts and mine rails it is definitely worth the money
B006M4F67A|5.0|this game has an easy touch in a great variety. I recommend it to all my players.I've played many miles on games in this is one of the easiest and best.
B000FCK65W|5.0|A tree grows in Brooklyn is a story your whole family will love.and it is written by an amazing author
B0015GF4FO|5.0|This is very smartly written, with multiple layers and superb acting. I'm a counselor and often times feel myself being pulled into the scene rather than watching it on TV. Good study on the human condition indeed
B008133MDK|4.0|The second season as good as the first. Great acting, compelling characters, and very good writing. The last episode of the second season seemed a little predictable, never-the-less this is a very good series and one that I will continue to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awsome<br />And cool and addicting I can't stop playing it...<br />It is just to cool I rated five stars
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Amazing new creatures and scenes, as well as new methods of getting the launched birds at their targets (wonderful new targets- and new birds as well). Great graphics, colors, just a really fun version of this classic game.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|When I first downloaded the app it worked perfectly fine but then when tablet turned off when not in use. I turned it back on and click impasse and then it said app stop unexpectedly I click stop and reopen app type in video the video won't even load. I tried uninstalling it there was still a problem. But everything else is ok.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is an awesome book with loads of action. I<br />Recommend reading Percy Jackson books first. Great for the whole<br />family. The pace is awesome if you get I hope you like it
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Very addictive first person shooter!!  Lots of fun for all players, well balanced engagements, everyone has a chance to contribute to the team effort!!  Outstanding and highly recommended!!

B00CH26TL8|1.0|Earn a spell.  Use it once.  Now you pay 2.99 to use it again.  You can't earn lives.  But you can purchase them!  You can't earn extra bubbles but guess what....you can purchase them!  Why earn stars and coins when it's the charge card that is king????  Fun game.  Very very bad use of money
B000VXJYFI|5.0|Hearing this trio live- you wish you could have<br />been there.Hendrix moves in and out of the<br />songs with no ego.
B006GX3ONK|5.0|Delighted ... despite owning the originals as LPs and later as CDs ... re-masters are crisp ... extra songs ... well worth the money ... buy the live box set too ... you'll enjoy
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is dah best. I play mobile and Pc and played since minecraft alpha on the Pc. I just love it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|the new version is absolutely horrific.  the old version was so much better and easier to read and use.  it really is that bad.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|The despicable moon-stealing super-villain Gru and his army of little minions make their hilarious return in 2013's \\"Despicable Me 2.\\"  Gru has gone straight and is busy single-parenting his three adorable adopted little girls Margo, Agnes, and Edith while dodging the neighborhood matchmaker.  He and Dr. Nefario, another former super villain, are partners in a not-very-successful jam and jelly enterprise.  But life has some surprises in store for Gru, beginning with his kidnapping from Agnes' birthday party by the secret agent Lucy Wilde, in a sequence that would have done credit to any recent James Bond movie.<br /><br />The Anti-Villain League or AVL wants Gru's help in locating another super villain, the one who made off with an entire Arctic research station and a secret formula that turns people into monsters.  AVL suspects the villain may be hiding out in a large mall.  The mismatched Gru and Agent Lucy are assigned to the case, which has them checking out suspects, including a salsa restaurant owner and a wig seller.  To go further would be to impose order on a plot that is intentionally chaotic and over the top.  Suffice it to say that in the end, the world will be saved, Gru will conquer his fears about dating women, and the girls will have a new mother.<br /><br />The animation is even better than last time. Much more screen time is given to the antics of the minions, who have developed distinct personalities.  There is plenty of cartoon action, more than enough to keep the kids entertained in their seats.  There are also lots of sight gags and jokes about growing up, parenting and relationships to keep the adults in the audience amused.  \\"Despicable Me 2\\" is easy entertainment, and recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|man this app minecraft is amazing and u get to play online and is very crative and is worth every penny and if u hats this app there is somthing wrong with u its on xbox Pc now my kidelfire man its amazing
B00B2166BS|5.0|I'm satisfied with my purchase. This was an easy no frills buy. Shipped quickly and arrived in my mailbox in small packaging. No instructions as its use is self explanatory. This does charge the Nexus 10 quicker but it still takes around 5 hours or so to get a full charge (with no use, just charging). If you own a Nexus 10 you should buy one of these.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|I can't believe I did it again. Got about half way through this one before I couldn't take it anymore.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Good entertainment with good performances from Streissand and Rogen. It has it's moments but it is definitely not Oscar material.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is wan awake game the keys revive you and all the mysory boxes :) please please try subway surfur
B001EBWING|5.0|Enough has been said about this motion picture. If you have not seen it yet, sit down and watch it now.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|Like the watch, but the hands are hard to read in certain light because the silver hands blend into the face of the watch and they seem to disappear. Otherwise, I like it.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Was and still is one of the best movies made.  A movie that is worth re-watching.  Enjoy it every time I see it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every book in this series is great, and this one is no exception.  I highly recommend them to anyone who wants a different and intriguing reading experience.  I held back from reading the Hunger Games for quite a while as they seemed they would be too juvenile for me since I am a Senior.  However, I found them to be universally appealing, gripping, and very inventive and creative.  Highly recommend.
B005USZML4|5.0|John Grisham took me back to a time where goodness prevailed...in most of life.  The entire Theodore Boone series is an inspiration for all to read about the good, the bad and best of all, about human consideration.  If I had children, I would want them to read these books.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This journey of compassion was taken by Harold Fry to a friend from way back in his past.  The novel is a novel of healing, of hope, of comfort for the reader.  I almost pulled my walking shoes on and embarked on a trek of my own.  We all want to know that we can change our lives, heal the past, forge a new future for ourselves in which we feel whole and good about ourselves, in which we feel alive.  This is what Harold Fry''s pilgrimage meant to me.
B005USZYDU|5.0|John Grisham took me back to a time where goodness prevailed...in most of life.  The entire Theodore Boone series is an inspiration for all to read about the good, the bad and best of all, about human consideration.  If I had children, I would want them to read these books.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|I'm still trying to figure this one out; I found the timeline very disjointed.  It was not my favorite in the Terminator series. And &#34;Arnie&#34;? Really?!

0525953728|5.0|Loved, loved, loved, this book, what a great read and gave me so much more understanding of how much our military does for our freedom.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|My grandson played this for several hours and actually laughed as he played.  Lots of fun and some skill required as you progress.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Heat is no longer an issue with my Phenom x 4 975. Installation was tricky as this was my first aftermarket HSF. My solution? Watch YouTube videos and sift out the bad ones.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|To much repetition and really not a lot of fun.  I think our grandson played it once and I tried it, but as I said, not a lot of fun.
B00AB7IA1S|2.0|This was a very boring game... I downloaded this game for my son and even he was bored with it. A waste of hard drive space.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keep me from beginning to end. Great book a must read. So glad someone told me about it.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Boring to me now, but for those new or child-like, still a money maker for the greedy family that owns the Bond idea
B008476HBM|5.0|I read this Austen book after having read a couple of amusing parodies. I have since seen a couple of versions of the book on video. I'm most amazed that such a young woman, with virtually no world experience, could have written such a complicated book, with such twists and turns of plot. She was extremely talented in other ways and I recommend all the books I have read, &#34;Sense, etc&#34; and &#34;Persuasion&#34;. &#34;Persuasion&#34; is the favorite of one of my daughters. I need to see that video and read it again since the movies tend to iron out some of the confusion of these complicated plots. These may be considered books for women but I'm a romanticist having been raised by a mother along side two sisters, having married and raised three daughters and managing banks with mostly women employees. Sorry, but I cry with great emotion (even with commercials on TV, if they are moving to me) So there!.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|This is a great song by Daft Punk. It's very catchy and has a disco feel to it. Definitely recommended!
B00AXOPK6W|4.0|My wife and daughters like Jane Austen books and have encouraged me to read them. I have found them to be of interest and it is fascinating to me to hear the language used. I read &#34;John Adams&#34; by David McCullough, who would have been almost  contemporary. That is the way those folks talked, very flowery and almost not understandable. They also used words with which I was not familiar. So I got somewhat of an education besides being entertained. I just read a brief biography of Miss Austen and found that her death was after the live's of my parents began. Sometimes it is difficult for us to think in those terms. The only negative I can note is that some of her words were not even in the dictionary that accompanies my Kindle.I have also read &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; and &#34;Persuasion&#34; by Miss Austen. I have read two parodies of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; which were amusing and have seen two videos of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; and one of &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34;. The movies ending of &#34;Sense, etc&#34; was actually more dramatic, especially where Elinor breaks into tears upon learning from Edward was not married as she had thought.
B0098460O4|4.0|I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loves it, and so does my grandchildren! It's worth every penny.
B008LA7RMK|5.0|This to me and pet sounds are their best albums. Being mixed in stereo adds all the depth and enjoyment to this timeless music.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's very hard to say anything bad about this game. First of all it's free. This is a very in depth rpg for any tablet, as far as upgrading weapons, leveling up, special moves etc. No complaints here.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I had five original Kindles.  The device would freeze,  I would call Amazon and they'd send a new one. I had to send the broken one back, at my expense for shipping.  And I would pay that all was well, WRONG!  I still don't have a working original after five.  I just have up and my son bought me a Kindle Fire, he bought the original too and I never told him about the problems.  I am now on my third Kindle Fire and am keeping my fingers crossed. It's too bad,  I bought the Amazon Prime membership and at least $100.00 a month on books not to mention music and games for my 10 year old. MY ADVICE,  SAVE UP FOR AN IPAD!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like Mahjong, but this one has only one set of tiles.  Would like to see other tile sets.  There are enough puzzle sets that are pretty interesting.  Shuffle penalty on timer seems excessive.  Overall, not bad for playing on the go.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just got it and I am already in love. Once you start, you cannot seem to stop. It is a major addiction.
B005VPRETE|5.0|This was a gift for my six year old granddaughter. It's a fun project when we spend time together.  Directions are easy for both of us to follow!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it(: I have read it many many times! I plan on continuing reading it over and over. So good!!!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Awesome tunes, best part bout buying Random Access Memories from Amazon is you don't even have to download MP3s from Amazon site or wait for CD in mail instead you have access to your music instantly on Amazon Cloud Player! Cool classic funky beat and great guitar work on Get Lucky and Lose yourself to Dance. Daft Punk at their Best...
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|The 'Boys' have done an excellent job maturing with their fans while still maintain their distinct sound.  The evolution from teen-pop to adult contemporary and dance is smooth and understandable.  Their trademark harmonization makes 'Trouble Is' a personal favorite on the album.<br />Overall, Unbreakable proves that The Backstreet Boys are not just a teeny-bopper sensation and have an official place among modern contemporary musicians.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|This 2013 horror remake of Sam Raimi's low-budget classic stars Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez.<br />A girl and her friends head to a cabin and find an ancient book causing demonic possession.<br />This is pretty good and some parts are really creepy. This Blu-ray set has nice picture<br />and sound plus neat extras. The film has a few nods to the original and is produced by<br />it's director, Sam Raimi, star, Bruce Campbell and producer, Rob Tapert. I recommend<br />this.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game. easy download. easy to follow but challenging. good storyline. I will definetly play a ghost II. I liked how you were given an object piece from each hidden picture you came across.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another wonderful read by the author who takes the reader inside a culture we know little about. Sweeping character development, history, sorrow and joy. But the lesson that we are all the same and family love is the paramount ties that bind is the crux of this sweeping novel. Best book on my Kindle so far!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So entertaining,  I can spent a while playing this app without getting the slightest bored. The best app I own.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Character is better than Tom Cruise. Well written movie and directed. I think they should do more Jack Reacher movies.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Unfortunately, that about sums it up.  The plot was pretty predictable however still fun to watch it play out.  The fight scenes were pretty impressive and I definitely enjoyed the creativity in the weapons.  Wish there was more to the plot and story line.  Overall, I thought the rental was over priced for the quality of movie but it wasn't a total loss.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it needs better instructions at the beginning. otherwise its great!!! I'm addicted and refusing to fall asleep because I like playing it.
B003K16P50|4.0|This is an interesting read, in that it is executed through interrogations, emails, journal entries, etc. for this reader, the common thread was faith and determination against all odds.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|At this point, I can say that, unlike kindle for windows 8, the android version is about as full as the actual kindle itself. It does not lack any features that make the kindle useful, or simply enhance the experience. It is a solid piece of software that is a joy to use.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|My grand daughter is 3 years old and she enjoyed the movie.  For the longest she would want to touch fingers,
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Easy to use, barely any ads, I love it when I have to use a calculator and  so I downloaded this one and its big on my Kindle fire hd and it works perfectly!
B005544TRQ|5.0|After watching the pilot, I basically spent the next 24 hours streaming the remainder of the series. I love the banter between the various characters and it almost makes me want to go to law school myself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book. I am a fan of the Hunger Games series, and this was an exciting conclusion to the trilogy. The narration style follows the format of the first two books, but the plot contains much more action than the others, and it is interesting to see how far Katniss has come in her experiences. The conclusion is open-ended enough to allow more books, but climactic enough to leave it at that. I loved it.
0316247545|4.0|My daughter is at the age of reading  and my little ponies . She loves books with alot of pictures and i think this nice big book has just  enough to keep her looking at it . Perfect for little kids
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I have not been able to stop watching. Glad I can watch it with amazon prime.  I'm able to watch many shows I didn't originally get to see.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am not one to cry very often, for any reason, but the end of this book reduced me to a sniveling, snotty mess. I was just that taken by Lou and Will. \\"Me Before You\\" is a sweet, touching and inspirational story that has several key concepts at its heart: love, choices, selflessness, joie de vivre. There is no way you can read this book without examining your own life - what is important to you, who you love, what you want out of this life and how far you will go to get it, what you are taking for granted, and how you might handle the loss of any of those things. Any story that can make me ponder so many of the essential elements of living at once has accomplished something amazing and rare. I accompanied the characters on their journey, fully immersed in their world and enjoying the entire experience.<br /><br />And most of all, I appreciate the ending. I gain little to no satisfaction from contrived books that underestimate the reader's ability to handle an unconventional conclusion. This author was bold, and I think she must have told the story SHE wanted to tell despite it not following the standard formula. I have a great deal of respect for her in doing that. She stayed true to her characters throughout and the conclusion of the novel felt so real. To me, it was beautiful, still.<br /><br />Some people hand out 5-Star reviews like penny candy, but not me. I reserve 5-Stars for only those precious few novels that I consider perfect - the rare mix of lyrical prose combined with a compelling story and unforgettable characters. The kind of novel that makes me experience a full range of true emotions, making me literally laugh out loud at some points and cry real, salty tears at others.<br /><br />This is one of the most moving books I've read in a very long time. The author's writing style simply adds to the pleasure I experienced while devouring this novel. And to think, I surpassed it several times over because of the dissonant, unattractive cover. Missing outon this book would have been a grave error, indeed. Highly recommended for anyone who just wants to read an excellent book and be transported to another world during the journey, while having reason to examine your own life at the end.
0812974611|5.0|I read this book years ago, and recently bought it for my grandsons, in preparation for a visit to the amazing  'Life & death in Pompeii' exhibition at the British Museum.  It really brings to life the life of Romans, and also shows the brilliance of their technology. I would recommend it to anyone between 16 and 90.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app crashes and won't even open. Fix it please. Crashes. I never had a problem before and now it sucks.
0316228532|3.0|My husband bought the book for me.  I have read all of the HP books and have a ton of collection of novels from the same author.  If I like something someone has written, I'm fairly likely to pick up his/her next book.  So it wasn't a stretch to read a 'different' book from Rowling.  I certainly wasn't expecting it to be anything like Harry Potter in the sense that there would be magic, fantasy or separate worlds.  I did however expect magic - as in being transported into an enchanting town and mesmerized by the interweaving of the character's lives.  I was therefore disappointed because there were far too many characters and they were rather flat.  Krystal Weedon was someone I was truly pulling for because her life was so truly depressing.  She was the underdog and unfortunately, stayed that way.  Simon Price? Omgoodness I wanted so badly to see his true demise and his family get even with him.  Since I'd been very pleased with the majority of the Harry Potter books, the content, the growth of characters and their emotional register, I was disappointed by this book and the writing in general.  I was expecting a little Steinbeck or Carson McCullers but ended up getting far, far less.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I enjoy watching this show, it's an old fashioned soap opera with a bit of history intertwined into the story.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|Totally teenage reading<br />The main character (who committed suicide ) was portraited by the author as someone who was treated unfairly by all people and seemed to be saying that others are responsible for her stupid suicide without having the character reflecting on her own problem and stupidity to suicide

B001ANSSDC|3.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but considering the rave reviews it's getting, I would almost bet this is one of those rare cases the movie is better than the book.  I'll keep it short.<br /><br />It feels like this guy wrote this book a bit dumbed down, for the character's voice, because the character is mentally ill.  That irritated the crap out of me because mentally ill is not the same as mentally handicapped, which is what it felt like was trying to go for.  Either that, or the writer is just not very good.  The writing was stilted and kind of slow, and sometimes to wordy.  Not eloquent and descriptive wordy, but more like that friend of yours who just won't stop talking and they keep repeating the same thing like four times.<br /><br />I also feel like the author wrote this book to be a movie.  It was as if, he wasn't writing a good novel, but just something that producers could read, option, and turn into a movie.  I can't explain it any better than that.  The narrator kept saying, &#34;This is the movie of my life&#34; and things like that, and it made it feel as though he only wrote this book in the hopes of getting it made into film.<br /><br />How I felt about this book can best be summed up by this: I read it on my Kindle, and I got to 90% and put it down to go to sleep, just prior to the big climax (which wasn't all that impressive, and was pretty predictable, since this was basically a rom-com).  I didn't pick it back up for three days.<br /><br />I didn't hate this book.  It wasn't terrible.  It was, well, just okay.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|Jane Austin does another superb job of skewering the class-conscious upper class of British society of her time. \\"A baronette must be seen to live as a baronette\\" even if he's broke!

B0034DGPEU|4.0|Kathleen Grissolm's research made this wonderful novel a believable work of historical fiction. Indentured servitude is rarely discussed as slavery is the primary focus in many Southern historical novels. This book combines the two in a story line that will leave you wanting more every time you put the book down. Looking forward to reading her next book!

B002BWP4A6|2.0|The White Ribbon, 2009.  In that eventful year 1913, a year before the outbreak of World War I, strange and brutal incidents threaten to shatter a rural northern German town's orderly existence. Celebrated Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, who has said this film was in development for more than ten years,  wrote and helms this German language, Golden Globe-winning,  black-and-white mystery/drama.  He originally shot the film, nominated for two Oscars, in color, then altered to black and white in postproduction to create a distancing effect, and resemble photographs of the era.  Even before filmmaking started, cinematographer Christian Berger was apparently studying the black and white films made by near-legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman with Sven Nykvist as cinematographer.<br /><br />According to the Internet Movie Database, Haneke interviewed more than 7000 children during his six-month long casting period, while relying on adult actors with whom he had worked before to play the village's adults. He did not give names to most of the adults, calling them simply Pastor, as played by Burghart Klaussner;  Baron, as played by Ulrich Tukur; Steward, as played by Josef Bierbichler; his narrator is  simply School Teacher, played as a young man by Christian Friedel.  The acting is uniformly to a high standard.<br /><br />In wandering around the Internet on Father's Day, I came upon an article naming the pastor of this picture as one of the ten worst fathers in filmdom.  It remarked, \\"White Ribbon. BAD DAD: Austere, unsmiling and brutally severe, Burghart Klaussner's character rules his household with an iron rod. His children are caned, tied to the bed to prevent masturbation and forced to wear humiliating reminders of their lapsed purity. These are not techniques recommended by most modern parenting manuals.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, if you look for parenting styles anywhere around the world in 1913, let's say in Canada, Argentina, Italy, Kenya, China, India and Australia, I doubt you would find many parents raising their children in the permissive manner favored today by many modern Western parents.  And many people, not necessarily parents, might prefer a world inhabited by less permissively raised young people.<br /><br />Haneke has stated, according to IMDb, that while he intentionally made the children of the village, whom he portrays as abused and repressed,  the generation of Germans who became Nazis, the ideas explored in the film are intended to illuminate more than what might have led to the rise of Nazism.  Furthermore, although the village he has created is fictional, many of the incidents depicted in the film are based on actual incidents in German and Austrian villages during the 1920s-1940s.<br /><br />The director's filmmaking style is not one to which American viewers are accustomed.  His script can be confusing, and he leaves things unexplained, hanging; viewers must draw their own conclusions in many instances.  It may be called a more intellectually rigorous style than most.  Still, for better or worse, I didn't like it.and Australia, I doubt you would find many parents raising their children in the permissive manner favored today by many modern Western parents.

B002JODUI4|5.0|This is my favorite Deadmau5 album! It has one of my favorite songs of all time, Strobe. I can safely say I've listened to this song well over 122 times and I still always want to hear more of it!<br /><br />Besides Strobe there are also some really well crafted tracks to be heard. A few more that stand out to me are Ghosts n Stuff Feat. Rob Swire, Bot, Soma, and The 16th Hour.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have noticed a glitch, when I click like on a post it will sometimes bounce down the wall, when I scroll back up my &#34;like&#34; isn't highlighted and I must click again. This happens randomly and I am not sure how it's triggered, possibly going offsite to read an article??? Update: I had refused to update the app for a long time because I didn't like it on my newer phone. But I finally did about 2 months ago (May 2015). Ever since I cannot play videos on the fb newsfeed and even when the open up into the new window to keep you in fb (you just x out to go back to newsfeed) it crashes 99% of the time. Often it closes and goes back to my kindle carousel and the audio begins playing even though I am no longer in any app at all. I have tried opening the videos by going to the 3 dots in upper right corner to open in silk or in youtube but it won't play. Anything that routes through fb gets messed up. Really frustrated so I changed my original 4 star rating to a 1 star. Get facebook to fix this issue!

0670014893|3.0|A secret operation in Gibraltar seemingly goes off without a hitch. But when the British Foreign Office minister freezes out his private secretary, Toby Bell, Toby gets suspicious. It's not until three years later that secrets about Operation Wildfire start to be whispered about, drawing in Toby who's determined to unravel this \\"Delicate Truth.\\"<br />As John le Carre's 22nd novel, you may think he has run out of espionage tales to tell, but \\"Truth\\" is just as captivating (and just about as confusing) as \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\". With three main characters who tally about 7 different aliases total, keeping track of the characters can be a task--but it's a rewarding one. Le Carre's purposefully obfuscated storytelling in the first half is structured to make the second half more thrilling and engaging. For espionage thrillers like his, every book is a little puzzle and reading it can feel like a game.<br />Of course, for those not interested in games, his books also have a unique prose style that's enjoyable to read all on its own. He writes with a sparse, fragmented voice that conveys so much more with so much less. It also lends an urgency to the more thrilling parts of the novel that gets lost with wordier thrillers.<br />If you're looking to dive into John le Carre's impressive oeuvre, then \\"A Delicate Truth\\" is not the best jumping off point. \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" or \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" are more natural starting points; the Cold War being his specialty. But he can handle contemporary tales with equal finesse. So if you're itching for a le Carre novel, then \\"Truth\\" will easily satisfy that.<br />([...]

B0041KBWM0|5.0|Johnny lee miller gives a dashing performance as knightley in this much more extensive version of Emma that blew the Gwen Paltrow version away. The settings are wonderful and vast in a small corner of the world where Emma exists. In all it gave a sense of what it was like to grow up in with too much time on your hands and not enough real life to focus excess energy on. Emma was so busy trying to fill her boring free time up with romantic whims that she almost missed out on the true love of her life.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun action thriller. Watched it so I could watch RED 2 at the theater. Thought the sequel was actually better. Red has some cheesey laughs that the actors didn't seem to own.  It was good to see this movie prior to RED 2 as some plot is carried forward.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|The look on our 5 month old's face when she discovered she could JUMP was great!  She really loves this jumperoo and has easily figured out how to turn the seat to play with all the toys.  We thought we'd get pretty annoyed with the elephant noise and sure enough, there was a point when we decided that we did, but now it's just background noise.  At first it was hard for just one person to get her in it because she wasn't keeping her legs straight enough but now she has it figured out that when it's jump time, the legs must go in straight.  Today we adjusted the height for the first time and it was pretty easy--just a quick check of the manual.  Overall, we're very happy with this purchase.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|Love the old app but dislike the app since its most recent update. Everything takes forever to load and times out all the time. I also don't like the icon in my notification bar without the option ( at the very least) to remove it.  After reading other reviews about battery life I'm going to check into that and remove the app altogether if that is what's sucking up mine.

B00A6KGDDM|5.0|The music by Bacewicz is interesting in that way that it brings new visions in what music should do to listeners : the approach is fresh and accessible. Her violin-concertos are of a more important level that the concertos for cello. The music for string orchestra does confirm me that she is a great composer with surprising sounds and colours.<br />The music by the family Mendelssohn is however from a different quality : I already knew the string-quartets by Felix (which are astonishing and brilliant) but the work on the CD that struck me the most was the wonderful quartet by his sister Fanny : this was really a revelation of a very high level : music that sounds so adult and convincing, with beautiful moments of lyricism and explosive timbres. This work - which I consider a masterpiece - is in my eyes (and ears) a quartet that can easily constitute a valuable addition<br />to the other great quartets of \\"more influential\\" masters as Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann and other geniuses.<br />It is obvious that the quartets of Felix show a more mature writing and that those he wrote after the death of Fanny belong to his greatest achievements (comparable to his majestic \\"Octet\\" which I consider as his most sublime masterpiece). Nevertheless this CD (and the performance of the exquisite \\"Ebène\\" quartet) represent an important adding to my collection of CD's.

160309007X|1.0|Like many who have submitted reviews of this book, both positive and negative, I absolutely adored the first two volumes of the League. \\"Black Dossier\\" proved challenge at first, but was ultimately rewarding. And while the first book of \\"Century\\" was a little incoherent, the second installment came on strong, with an ending that pleaded for a third chapter to wrap everything up in grand style, befitting an Alan Moore tale.<br /><br />Instead, readers are treated to an appalling, amateurish screed that a teenager who didn't like the Harry Potter books could have written. The book, coupled with its two predecessors, is almost enough to forever ruin the magic that crackled off the pages of the initial three collections.<br /><br />As a fan of Mr. Moore's work, I am insulted, and as a reader, I am offended.<br /><br />I will not read any more of his works from this day forward.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I love this movie because it shows how even superheroes make mistakes and own up to them. Even they aren't perfect. I also like how this show has actual plots and characters you care about. Marvel seems to be in it for the money, but DC Comics seems to care about the relation between the viewer and the characters on the show; making sure you can connect to some of the characters in a personal way.

B00422LESO|5.0|Wonderful Pride & Prejudice spin-off which I wanted to read before the movie with Keri Russell releases.  Entertaining and amusing, Austenland is the contemporary tale of misbegotten Jane Hayes who can't find lasting love because no one matches up to Austen's Darcy in her life.  A windfall allows Hayes to attend an exclusive English resort where everyone dresses and acts in 1800's garb and manners. Her goal is to vanquish her Darcy complex for good.  It's delightful and leaves me anticipating the movie greatly -

B0083GQKQG|2.0|I so wanted to like this film but it was all over the place. Very weird and strange. Tilda is always excellent but it's hard to appreciate the actors with the film so chopped up-jumping from different points in their lives literally every 2 minutes. Depressing film and long. I would pass on it.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|This is a great CD and I am proud to have it. I love the Coor's music and thankful to finally have my own copy of this fantastic CD<br />from Amazon,  which I could not find in any local music/stores.  Thanks
B0091VYKKA|5.0|Already a classic favorite, this movie delivers everything a vampire slayer movie should. Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristoferson are awesome together, as Snipes deals with his complicated life......must see for vampire fans
B00899F0G8|5.0|Exactly what I expected! Loved every minute of it and could not wait to see more. Can't wait for next season.
0312588887|5.0|A lot of details, giving more meaning to the other books in the series.  This starts with Emma Harte from the very beginning and  I would recommend reading the series in order.  I did not do that and I would have missed a lot if I had not gone back and read A Woman of Substance.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It's a light read with a monumental impact. Really opens your eyes to one of the greatest minds in history, but in a way that's simple to understand. I highly recommend!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Great read. Moves very quickly just like the Harry potter series. I didn't want to put it down and couldn't read it fast enough
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a fantastic app to play but we need some updates on it. We should have some new animals, saddles, and be able to go to the aether and the nether.
B004V73FGE|5.0|This movie was all eye candy to watch,a beautiful well made movie,and you're going to love the soundtrack to this movie,it really sets the tone of a darker Tron world,totally worth seeing
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|it is a total rip off.  I can not believe they don't tell you how much the full game really costs and that they don't let you play after a couple of turns its redicieles.
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|You're basic,action movie,with explosions and all that good stuff that we like,it was actually entertaining,i watched this so I can watch part 2
B000HAEK86|5.0|I finally got around to watching this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am saddened and shocked that it was not renewed, as I would love to watch many more seasons!  Thanks Amazon for having this free on Prime!
B006RZZ7HS|4.0|I know this movie came out about 30 years ago but Ive seen it for the first time just recently,i can only imagine how it was like to see this on the big screen with popcorn during the the early 80's,great movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I ordered this out of curiosity and have really enjoyed it. My 10 year old son loves to play it too!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love the movie because my kids wanted to see it and kids wanted to see it again without me having to leave the house to go and get.  Convenient and affordable for Saturday night in with the family.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|'Hitchcock' is a fascinating little feature film. Not much use to those not interested in the movies. For me I was enchanted by the mosaic of making a motion picture.<br /><br />Not just any motion picture but a movie which has so much spin attached to it has a life of its own. The complexity of the book called 'Psycho' is intensified by the personal tensions of Mr and Mrs Hitchcock. Loved the petty politics of the actors of the time. And having the serial killer psychoanalyse the director is a twist I think even the master would appreciate. Whilst dead.<br /><br />Much better than many of the reviews I've come across. Certainly not just about the making of Psycho. It's deeper than deep should go. All the way to blondes in towers.
B0009P42S2|5.0|The art work in this anime is just stunning! Too dark for young children, but a good story and worth the see if you like anime and alternate history science fiction!
B004N6369Y|5.0|Always love Danielle Steel. She keeps my interest, and I can never put her books down. Her characters are always interesting.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I just like the Harry Potter series! I have the books and this finished the collection of the movies! Would recommend to anyone who likes fantasy!
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|This is a great show.  One of the things that I like most about SG-1 is how the writers let things change.  I.e., at first it was all about the Stargate.  But as time passed they introduced new elements like space ships and the melding of human and alien technology as illustrated in the building of the jet fighters later used in the show.
6304493681|5.0|Very strange precept going on in this anime! But very interesting to those who like anime and science fiction! It would be interesting to see this reworked using the software to date, but it's still arrestingly done for the time!
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Really bad acting by bruce willis.  you can tell he just doesn't care other than getting paid.  terrible plot.  lazy graphics. avoid this slop.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting this game can not get  any better  people who are thinking to get this gadget it it is totally worth it trust me you should get this game.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|My son (age 30) loves player does everything and more. After purchase he pulled out old amp and hooked it up the old fashioned way. He went to the local record shop and purchased some new old albums.
B00821OX98|5.0|When my husband first told me about this series I didn't think I would like it. Boy was I wrong. I was hooked after the first episode!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Every time I tried to load it on my kindle fire, it would just bring me back to the carousel. I  have WiFi, I don't know if you need it..  But it didn't work.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I think we should get reimbursted for this purchase. We could not watch it. It kept buffereing over and over. Not Happpy
B000HL2J0G|5.0|A little strange seeing a young Anderson after so many years of watching him in Stargate.  Mcgyver is a great series. Really liked watching from the first one.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  As a woman recently re-entering the workforce after 8 years at home with kids, while not a high level leader, I aspire to grow my career in a pretty male-dominated field now and this book give great insight.  If only I could go back in time and not leave before I left!
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I enjoy his books, but this one was really out there!  It was almost too unbelievable!  It wasn't as good to me as some of his others.
B000NY12LO|5.0|A story that grabs you and unravels you at your core.  This book allows the reader to relive there action when they were 17 and what side of the line they were on.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|I'm a 20 year old guy and have always loved the first monsters movie because of the whole idea of monsters interacting with the human world in that way. Mike and Sully are my favorite Disney characters.<br />This prequel was really great, did not disappoint but exceeded my expectations. They attacked every aspect of the story in relation to the first movie. You get to see how the characters developed, how relationships between them developed and what made them the way they are in the future. This to me is what made this movie so great.<br />Disney did a good job with this one. I was waiting for a 2nd monsters movie for soo longg! Can't wait to own and view the 3D copy! Also, can't wait for another monsters movie, but I rather Disney doesn't rush the next one so it will be as great or even better than this one. It's been over 10 years since the first movie so I don't see how anyone can say this feels like it was rushed.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Great book! I read the whole thing in two days! This has inspired me to be true to who I am and not to conform to what society expects of me.<br />Thanks James
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I loved it. I wanted to see what would happen next. The characters are unique. However, I do not like having a set amount of words to be submitted. I would just prefer just a few words.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been waiting for a magic app on my kindle for so long. This is a great app it is really responsive and the graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I thought it was great. Each episode had surprises. It reminded me of The X Files. Can't wait to see the next season
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The cast is absolutely great....it reminds me of &#34;Boston Legal&#34; which I also loved. I still haven't figured out whether I dislike or not Luis. Sometimes he's a prick and yet other times he's funny.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|For a freebie this is a great app. Really simple to use and really useful. I would highly recommend. Excellent.
1451695195|1.0|this picked for us by a book club member. reminded me why I don't read non-fiction! I want to read literature, written by real writers!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The American dream goes sour<br /><br />Amy & Nick are two cool New Yorkers, working in dream jobs, being paid to write. Amy is a Cool Girl and the heroine for a succession of best selling books written by her parents. Who wouldn't envy them? And then the economy falls apart and \\"the once plentiful herds of magazine writers would continue to be culled - by the Internet, by the recession, by the American public\\". So sadly for Nick and Amy they both get made redundant and soon they can no longer afford to pay the mortgage on their trendy Brooklyn townhouse. Life can be cruel for losers in the City That Never Sleeps and the couple are forced to sell up, and retreat to somewhere affordable - in this case, back to Nick's Midwest home town, in nowheresville, Missouri.<br /><br />Despite their money worries, Nick has to find a way of making a living so borrows off Amy's inheritance to open a bar, as playing barkeep is something that he's always dreamed of doing.  But pretty soon Nick and Amy are arguing over money and once couples start doing that, it's a sign that love don't live there any more and all that's left then is the division of the spoils. Hardly the stuff of young love's dream, is it?<br /><br />Told from the point of view of both Nick and Amy, Gone Girl, is a psychological thriller, a War of the Roses for the 21st century. It is the tale of love gone toxic in a world where even the malls have closed down.  The big question at the heart of this book though is just who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist as by the end of the novel you may be none the wiser.<br /><br />This is writer Gillian Flynn's third novel. An experienced journalist, she is an assured writer and has done a particularly fine job with the characterisations of both Nick and Amy.  Nobody in Gone Girl is let off the hook, even Amy's parasitic parents who have made a living out of creating a perfect Amy for public consumption. It's no wonder that the film rights were snapped up so quicklyas one this is for sure, Gone Girl is a book for its time, a cynical take on the reality of shattered hopes and dreams for one particular Generation X couple.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  I thought it moved at a fairly decent pace with good action.  It wasn't fully predictable and I really enjoyed that part.  Overall a good movie
1423165691|5.0|my 8 year daughter loves drawing and with this sketchbook she learns to draw her faivorit characters. warmly recommended. it's a fun and easy way to learn to draw.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Only had to be restarted after installation. Unable to  use flash for embedded vidios. I have not tried since then.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Don't want to ruin it for anyone but I really wanted this to end SO much differently!  Think of The Notebook meets Message in a Bottle.....
B00AEFYKSO|4.0|A good oldie, but fully up to date with many new sports movies. Fun to see old stars! Many good moments!<br />Picture quality is very good<br />Nice sound quality
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I felt I was there with them ,loved the location. A good who done it book kept me guessing..Well written  by a great Author !
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Minecraft on my kindle fire. But there are problem, One: iOS and Google Play stores have lightning fast updates, but Amazon Appstore has slower updates. What do you guys think?
B005PK553C|5.0|This series has an excellent cast and is well written. Lots of twist and turns. Great to see Jessica Lange in her role as neighbor. It can be compared to Steven King's The Shining, except here you care more about the characters. .
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I wouldn't trade my app for another, as I prefer the Weather Channel radars.  That being said, mine recently updated and looks totally different, and I don't care for the new version at all. It's slow and you have to deal with My Points until you figure out how to turn it off.  I prefer the satellite view for radar, but now there is no choice.  There's no more 36-hour forecast available, just 10-day and hourly.  I wish they thought things through thoroughly before creating such drastic updates/changes.  I wish I could get the previous version back, I liked it so much better.
B00BUP0IRO|5.0|With all the movies that have come out lately, this movie was by far one of my favorites that it seems like nobody had really acknowledged as anything other than average.  It had great acting, great suspense, intrigue, and twists that never let down through the entire movie.  It gave you enough information to know what was going on but not be confusing.  The movie wasn't always predictable and when it was, it still seemed new and exciting to me.  Just pure entertaining.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Bought it for my two year old and he loved it. Then my 8 year old started doing the challenges and he got hooked building the reef.  Then I took a look to see what it was about and I got addicted to building my own reef on my kindle fire. If you like building games and reefs this is a great game.
0060833459|5.0|A very practical book - mentioned by Mark and Mike at manager-tools.com<br />Really did live up to their high praise.<br />Strongly recommended for new and experienced managers.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|a well told little story about the power of love to change a person dedicated to being a super villain The animation is bright and fun, the minions are a delightful addition, and the little girls are sweetly rendered. We don't have any children at home but we watched this and enjoyed it very much
B001HM1PFO|2.0|This movie was comical, but it was very odd. There was no purpose or moral of the movie. The songs will probably get stuck in your head. It is a good movie to joke about with your friends though. There is nudity and it contains sexual humor.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Thids movie stays exciting after all these years.  Grand kids loved it.<br />Constant excitement and fun and tension and surprizes.
6304712936|2.0|I didn't get what I paid for. I got 1/2 movie in my CD. I was so sad . Parcel was delivered very quick but the quality of CD was unacceptable. Sorry I'm very disappointed.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|*** SPOILER WARNING ***<br /><br />This was the first disappointment in the Avengers series. The acting was great and I even liked the plot about Tony Stark struggling with his PTSD, but the moment the Mandarin turned into a joke, they killed this movie. Iron Man's greatest nemesis didn't even show up. What a waste of a film and a great character. I wish people making movies about comic characters would remain true to the source material as much as possible (changing a few things is fine with me. The Mandarin didn't have to be Chinese in my book and I get the need to get away from stereotypes that are racist). Sony and Fox screw up every Marvel movie they touch but I wasn't expecting Marvel to do the same with Iron Man 3.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great plane read. Short book with concise chapters but got to the heart of the love between and dog and his family immediately. A must for any dog owner or animal lover!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|AFTER VIEWING 5 EPISODES.  This unique, NETFLICKS, produced series is full of the cliff hanging, fast-paced, can't wait to see the next episode drama that is typical of the multi-episode miniseries being produced today like &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; &#34;Scandal,&#34; and &#34;Mad Men.&#34;  The acting is suprerb, led by Kevin Spacey and supported by a very professional supporting cast.  The writing and directing are first class.  An interesting plot tool is having Spacey, Congressman Underwood, turn his head to the viewers to let us know what he really feels about a situation while he is simultaneously performing his insidious deeds.  This is reminiscent of the same tactic used in some of the old Woody Allen movies, and makes us feel a part of the action taking place.  And, it is very effective.  Warning, you will become addicted to this series and crave the next episode.<br /><br />In this age of congressional wheeling and dealing and &#34;do nothing,&#34; this series is probably more truth than fiction as to how our elected leaders on Captiol Hill manage (or mismanage)  our country's destiny.  For those tired of the boring multiplicity of network TV's CSI's, reality shows, and ignominious, contrived sitcoms, House of Cards is a welcome relief.  I can not wait to complete season one.  I guess that I will be up late again tonight, absorbing three episodes at a time.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Simple and clear, left me really  enthusiastic about starting my own business.<br />Makes it seem possible and exciting,but above all very attainable.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|For the price, it's great.  It protects the screen of my Kindle Fire, but also acts as pretty good stand for it.  Tends to slip a bit, but in general works fairly well.
0345803485|5.0|dont know why but my mom really liked the book so i guess i'll be buying more of them for her. lol
B0058W74UY|1.0|I got it so I could play Pogo games, but it doesn't work with them.  They need Adobe Flash and it doesn't look like Kindle Fire can get it.  So I'm quite disappointed.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Would recommend to everyone. I enjoyed this film very  much and I will be watching over several times. good job
B004HWYTP4|1.0|bang bang, shoot em up...zero plot..lots of noise.  high budget for actors.....low budget for writers not recommended for anyone with a brain
0312330537|5.0|Absolutely powerfully written. Hard to put the book down. This novel is great for cruising. I have recommended to my friends

B003G4W49C|1.0|To believe that someone chose to make a motion picture from this propaganda amazes me.  I have other more imaginative books to read.  No one should waste their time with this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is a great game! I been playing for so long and I can't stop playing! I really like almost everything about this game!
B009GX69RK|5.0|Well-written and well acted. It's so much fun to watch the show! The actors, every single one of them, are amazing; it's easy to see the chemistry at work in this amazing ensemble cast. I look forward to each new episode!
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead is a surprisingly crafted horror film, and one definitely worth watching. I always rate horror movies at a different curve than films in general. I.e., Evil Dead is not City of God. However, within the horror genre, this flick absolutely stands up to both its outstanding contemporaries, such as The Descent, 28 Days Later, and The Cabin in the Woods, as well as the classic masterpieces, such as The Thing, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, and, yes - even the original The Evil Dead.<br /><br />One of Evil Dead's better qualities? The complete absence of CGI, and the emphasis on practical effects, makeup, and illusions. This one is a throwback to the classics, and it shows that real practical effects will almost always be more fascinating and terrifying to watch than digital effects.<br /><br />Oh. And the human body mutilation is, well... something else. Mr. Alvarez certainly did not hold back.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent characters, and positive story line, even though tragedy happens, so it does with real life. I like every personality in it, even if I'm not suppose to!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have been using the weather channel for a while it is has very good for your area it tells you updated weather I use it very day thanks Thomas a

B0091REZMW|5.0|It is slightly confusing to play I like the layout of it could be a little brighter for use of small screens
B004J4WKTW|5.0|You have to be continually aware of the changes happening. It kept me enthralled the whole time. I Loved it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another wonderful, compelling novel by Vince Flynn.  It is very well written and is spellbinding.<br /><br />I was fortunate to know Vince when he was a member of the Board of Directors at a K-12 school in Minneapolis for kids with learning disabilities.  He was a wonderful role model and mentor for the kids and a wonderful business partner for management and the Board.  We will miss Vince, his smile and his dedication and determination.  Rest in peace, Vince.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|...with the Dark Knight! Great double disc set with extra interviews, deleted scenes, etc. if you still use DVDs and love this movie, buy this!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Not quite his best effort but still a great read.  Fun to visit with familiar characters but they didn't seem to be any further developed
B000A0GYD2|4.0|I love the stories of all the Apollo missions; however instead of true documentaries, each mission is acted out as a mini-movie. They were all pretty good except I didn't like the Apollo 13 one - instead of focusing on the mission, they focus on the journalists' point of view! Not exactly what I wanted to see, especially for that specific mission. All in all though the set is pretty good.
B005MLOKXA|2.0|Was enjoying the show until the main actors started sleeping around. Why mess up a good show with sexual immorality?
B000FBJG04|4.0|Good narrative of a special group operating in Europe during World War II.  Emphasis on the human side, including the relationships built among these men.

B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Nothing is explained, the story just &#34;is&#34;. A great read. I really like the dilemma he was in when his father told him to come inside - read the book and you will understand. A refreshing take on the &#34;goblins down the garden&#34; story.
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is the 10th best R&B Album from 2012.Element of Freedom blows this out the box but this is still a good album,Just not her best work,but it's still good,the best song's are \\"When It's All Over!!!,that tracc is insane.Also Listen To Your Heart,New Day!!!{yall saw the half time show from the 2012 all star game?,She killed it with that banger},Fire We Make is good{this song ain't got nothing on the best duets like Candle Lights and You,Fire and Desire & Saturday Love},Tear Always Win,That's When I Knew,Limitedless!!! is another banger,One Thing, & 101{She got her Frank Ocean on but I will have to say \\"Pyramid\\" & Rihanna' \\"Love without Tragedy/Mother Mary\\" came harder}.I wish the Element of Freedom album had this front cover.This album is still a must have for 2012 r&b heads like me.

0470876417|4.0|---Summary---<br />\\"Business model\\" has always been an obscure thing for me. Of course, I knew that a business model is the \\"how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value\\", but this remained quite obscure to me. The book of Osterwalder and Pigneur makes a great step in putting some light on the \\"business model\\" concept. This is firstly done by defining a canvas, which describes the components of a business model, then giving a set of interesting patterns (templates), which are complemented by very clear and interesting market examples.<br /><br />---Model / Concepts---<br />The main model is the \\"business model canvas\\":<br />---Infrastructure<br />- Key Activities: The most important activities in executing a company's value proposition.<br />- Key Resources: The resources necessary to create value for the customer.<br />- Key Partners: Buyer-supplier relationships permitting focusing on their core activity.<br />---Offering<br />- Value Proposition: The collection of products and services a business offers to meet the needs of its customers. Characterized by newness, performance, customization, design, brand, price, status, risk reduction, convenience/usability.<br />---Customers<br />- Customer Segments: Mass, niche, segmented, diversified, multi-sided<br />- Channels: Direct/ indirect. Phases: awareness, evaluation, purchase, delivery, after sales.<br />- Customer Relationship: Personal, dedicated personal, self-service, automated services, communities.<br />---Finances<br />- Cost Structure: Cost-driven, value-driven, fixed-cost, variable costs, economy of scale/scope.<br />- Revenue Streams: Asset sales, usage fee, subscription fee, lending/renting/leasing, licensing, brokerage fee, advertising. Fixed pricing vs. dynamic pricing.<br /><br />---Impact---<br />This is the weak point: It's not easy to generate a direct impact for a company. In my case, it has been very helpful to better structure the business plan and also to better communicate it, butthen it's over. Probably the impact is more important in larger companies, where there are a lot of people in charge of the business model.<br /><br />---Rating---<br />- rating Amazon - 4.5/5.0 (268 reviews)<br />- my rating - 4.0/5.0<br />- fun factor - 4.0/5.0<br />- simplicity - 5.0/5.0<br />- impact - 3.0/5.0

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I started watching Fringe near the end of the second season and now I can't stop but re-watching ALL of seasons.<br /> I love season 1 because it didn't get to involved in the other place....and of course episode 15 is just awesome.  I love how everything in that episode, the colors, the walls, the clothing...it was all a big Batman salute.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|This movie is better than the second Transformers movie.  That doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot.  It was just ok to me.  Worth a rent if you want an action movie and there's not much else to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addictive! Love it! Can't stop playing it! Great for all ages but I'm no good at it lol! Keep crashing into objects! Maybe I'll be pro one day with the amount I've seem to of played it!
B004ADF7RO|4.0|This one brought back the memories.  I remember seeing this movie when I was younger.  For an older movie, it's worth re-watching especially if you have kids now.  It is rated PG so it may not be something you want your younger kids to watch (minor cussing, some  adult humor).  I watched this with my son and he thought it was a good movie.  He laughed at various parts, watched with wide eyes at the suspenseful parts, looked away just slightly during scenes he thought might be scary (which fortunately turned out not to be), and was happy with the ending.  What more can you ask for?
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|the material is cheap & pet hair sticks to it. it also feels really weird on your hands. I recommend you dig deeper than this product.
B009WUBERW|3.0|The Expendables was a pretty good movie.  Expendables 2 is like most sequels in that it's not as good as the original.  Fortunately, it's not a horrible follow-up, either.  It's worth a watch if you liked the original.  It appears in this movie they tried too much to focus on blood when people were getting shot.  I'm not saying it's a gore-fest.  I'm just not sure it was worth doing slow motion (or even normal speed) shots of a guy getting shot and blood spurting everywhere from where the bullet(s) presumably exited.  Besides that, the action is pretty good and the movie moves along pretty well.  It's neat to see the &#34;old&#34; action actors all in one movie.

B0093FNZT6|4.0|While this book is an account of Dr Eben Alexander surviving a serious life-threatening illness, it is also a revelation of human consciousness. In the book, we find an account of a neurosurgeon's experience of the kind of disease he himself has treated during his career. This places him in a most advantageous position to explore why he survived such a fatal illness.<br />Chapter by chapter the book swings between the family's account of their experience, and what the doctor was experiencing (as far as he can remember). His account of seeing things and knowing things while out of his body is extraordinary. Whether the things he saw and heard have meaning for us is another matter. Experiencing God or heaven, is a very personal matter. Therefore, Dr Alexander's experience may fall into the category of phenomena for us. This need not detract from the valuable information contained in this book.<br />What interests me most is the way this scientist was able to understand consciousness. We would expect a specialist brain doctor to understand the brain. Dr Alexander's experience showed him that he had little understanding of the brain in relation to consciousness prior to his illness.<br />He says, \\"The brain itself doesn't produce consciousness.\\" Dr Alexander explains that the brain actually filters our perceptions so that we can manage them. Then he says something that in my experience is a fact, \\"True thought is pre-physical.\\" In my own book, which examines human consciousness, (published in 2007) I say, \\"Our consciousness is expressed using our physical body, primarily our brain. Hippocrates observed that the brain was the messenger of consciousness, not the consciousness itself. So our brain is a tool through which we express our consciousness. The livelier our consciousness is the better its vehicle.\\" Kristina Kaine, \\"I Connecting: The Soul's Quest\\"[[ASIN:097798253X I Connecting: The Soul's Quest]] These ideas about consciousness come some way towards helping us to experience ourselves as beings of body, soul and spirit.<br />Dr Alexander's experience of the will is also extremely interesting. \\"We are free beings hemmed all around by an environment conspiring to make us feel that we're not free.\\" In my understanding, we are at a point in the evolution of humanity where we must work on our will with conscious awareness. Understanding freewill and individuation has reached a critical point in the world today. We hear cries for freedom everywhere. In fact, sometimes it seems that people who are already free are crying for even more freedom. To my way of thinking they are crying for something more and it could be the freedom that Dr Alexander experienced when we was in a coma and near death.<br />So Dr Alexander's experience recorded in his book is timely. His conclusions in Chapter Fifteen are inspiring. For a neurosurgeon to write the words, \\"The brain itself doesn't produce consciousness.\\" is quite breathtaking. Dr Alexander explains that the brain actually filters our perceptions so that we can manage them. If we think about this it really makes sense. In this multi-tasking world, we are continually filtering the information that comes towards us so that can manage our daily life. The same could easily be true of information about the spiritual worlds.<br />This book left me with one hope. Why can't we be open to ideas that challenge our knowledge instead of dismissing them? Being open to possibilities is the only way to come to the truth. The truth always hides from limited minds. As Dr Alexander says of people who think that they know, \\"They believe they know the truth without needing to look at the facts.\\"<br />It is clear to me that Dr Alexander experienced the human spirit as something different from the human physical body. This is an awareness that I continually strive for. He observes that, \\"Much of what people have had to say about God and a higher spiritual world has involved bringing them down to our level, rather than elevating our perceptions up theirs.\\" I applaud Dr Alexander for producing this book; it has given me hope that as a human race we will increasingly experience the truth that we are spiritual beings inhabiting a physical body.han elevating our perceptions up theirs.\\" I applaud Dr Alexander for producing this book; it has given me hope that as a human race we will increasingly experience the truth that we are spiritual beings inhabiting a physical body.

0143123173|4.0|Walt Longmire has served his time as sheriff of Wyoming's Absaroka County and is looking forward to retiring. Those plans are dashed when Cody Pritchard is found dead near the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.<br /><br />Several years back, Cody and three other high school boys raped a local Cheyenne girl. They were only given suspended sentences for their crime. When a second boy turns up dead, it seems someone is seeking their own brand of justice for their actions. It's up to Longmire to see that the cold dish of revenge isn't served to the remaining boys. Helping him in his fight to save the boys is his deputy, Victoria Moretti, and his lifelong friend, Henry Standing Bear.<br /><br />In THE COLD DISH, Johnson creates a realistic story that is filled with a cast of zany and likable characters. He balances a blend of humor, suspense, tragedy and hope for a well-developed story.<br /><br />Johnson's vivid eye for detail enhances his descriptions as told from a law enforcement point of view. The back stories on each character adds to the overall plot as readers get to know them through Longmire. The interaction among the characters is plausible and draws the reader in. Their quick and witty dialogue will have you laughing at times.<br /><br />The story flows smoothly and at a steady pace holding the readers attention from beginning to surprising end. THE COLD DISH is an appealing start to a series mystery fans have quickly followed.<br /><br />FTC Full Disclosure - This book was sent to me by the publisher in hopes I would review it. However, receiving the complimentary copy did not influence my review.

B005HEPN06|5.0|A classic in the Star Trek world and must see for science fiction fans.  A series that is optimistic and bright compared to today's darker series.
1250012570|5.0|I had read so many positive reviews of Eleanor & Park that I decided to take a chance and buy this one. I normally do not enjoy love stories... at all. I tend to find them boring, and I cringe at the clich&eacute;s that seem to be inevitable. But these two characters! I just loved them.<br /><br />I didn't expect Eleanor to be such a tragic figure. I didn't expect Park to be this quiet, sweet boy who found clever ways to be kind without inciting ridicule from others. Everything about their relationship is so sweet and honest and anything but contrived, I didn't roll my eyes - not even once.<br /><br />And talk about flashing back to being a kid in the 1980's. Comic books. Skinny Puppy. \\"Gene Wilder in the chocolate factory.\\" Walkmans. Mix tapes.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is a great story. Rainbow Rowell has perfectly captured the thrill (and the awkwardness) of first love. Thoroughly enjoyed this!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Loads of fun. Very addictive. I played on my wife's kindle, but never knew the objective of the arcade mode. Now that I've got my own, I read the instructions. Lol. I love it.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This book reminded me very much of, &#34;Bonfire of the Vanities,&#34; by Tom Wolfe. McCann catches the diversity of a big city and the cultural and ethnic characteristics of the people living there. It's all tied together by the extraordinary daring of a Frenchman who walked on a tight wire between the twin towers in 1975. McCann has a fine ear for speech and is as comfortable speaking as a Park Avenue socialite as he is as a prostitute working the streets of the Bronx. It's a compelling story crafted by one of the better living authors.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I chose to read \\"The Crossfire Series\\" (& especially since this particular package included Books 1-3 @ a very reasonably set price!) Mainly because I thoroughly enjoyed the 50 Shades Trilogy. Yes there are similarities and not a huge difference in the characters, BUT so far the Crossfire Series has had me hooked from the very start! In my opinion, the Crossfire Series is much more seductive and intriguing. Each book so far absolutely deserves the praise received! I don't wish to throw any spoilers out here in Ratings & Review; but will say this much - it reaches a much more diverse demographic AND lastly but not the least - the characters are much more easy to understand and form an attachment for despite some of the more superficial backgrounds. It's the personalities and the world they themselves create that makes this a more enjoyable read! 5 STAR RATING from me, an avid reader of practically ALL genres is NOT given lightly. Ms. Sylvia Day is amazing in this genre and currently reigns supreme. I'm purchasing the rest of the series as soon as enter my review of these 3 books that started it all! PURCHASE THIS BUNDLE or at the very least give the 1st book in this series a chance - so far, they've become increasingly addictive! And it's a wonderful, healthy addiction, as well!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun to play.  If you are a minion fan, it is pretty funny too.  It plays a bit like the temple run style, but with more options and bonuses.  Great video UN the beginning too.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I was fascinated by the author's previous book Girl Gone.  The plot was so devious and yet I believed in the characters.  This book followed the pattern of Girl Gone.  Flynn didn't try to glamorizes a dire thread that slowly unravelled to reveal a sorted tale of desperation woven through out the book.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I chose 5 stars because of the CCs  actually appeared on screen as indicated.<br /><br />But not on every episode as advertised. What's up with that??????????????????????????

B00DGABUIC|5.0|I found this by chance in TRU last week for 7.99. The toothless in this 'mini' line is about 2 inches tall and close to 3 inches long from nose to the tip of his tail. The head turns but there is no other articulation. The bottom half of the tail has a seam but mine doesn't budge, so I'm pretty sure it's just where it's solidly attached. No paint outside of the eyes. All this said, the figure is really nicely detailed and the likeness is perfect. The expression is adorable and I love having it on my desk. It's a nice little figure if you want something small and cute. I also have a Spike the dragon figure that's a bit smaller and they go well together.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|Like many other users, mine just past away after 2 years.<br /><br />It seams that even with the other products (ie Forerunner 610 etc...) the problem is still there.<br /><br />I won't buy Garmin anymore, not reliable.<br /><br />Fortunately, I bough mine at Costco, and I manage to return it with full refund, even after 2 years.<br /><br />Cheap expensive product.<br /><br />I will try Suunto this time.<br /><br />Update 14-8-2013<br />I have my Suunto for a month, and wow, so much fun!  More options than Garmin, easier to use, more graph with the software.  You can use the same watch to swim, run and cycle.  Manual auto-lap, compas, can be useful to use for a walk in the forest (because it tells your way back).  Good for outdoor, hunters, triathlons... I just need to see if it is reliable even after a couple of years.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Fun movie to watch even when I was never a Star Trek fan. Made me much more interested in the series as whole. As usual Amazon has a few moments where the streaming will pause and then continue but only occasionally.

B006T5C5PS|4.0|I watched the video before I purchased the book.  I found the video, particularly interesting.  I haven't gotten very far in the book yet.  It seems that if we keep our bodies healthy with nutritious foods, free of pesticides and toxins, our cells will be healthy, with lots of oxygen, and can fight/kill the cancerous cells, which apparently, lie dormant in nearly everyone, waiting for the bodies health to decline to a point where it can no longer fight off the cancer cells.  It seems that cancer cells are similar to terrorist cells.  They can be dormant in the body for years, before they take action.  The best therapy seems to be eating live, healthy, nutritious, foods, along with plenty of sleep and exercise.  The Gerson Therapy is documented to have cured cancer and many other degenerative diseases, but it isn't easy to follow.  Still, I think it is the preferred alternative to chemotherapy.

B004R6JG7G|4.0|Since everyone else has already provided their summaries of the storyline, their opinions on the acting and everything else, I will, as I always do, only focus upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.  Never the less, the movie still has legs and remains an intriguing and exciting film, all except the dated background sound track that is.<br /><br />VIDEO....They obviously put some effort into the remastering of the film's transcode to Blu Ray.  The colors remain brilliant though not poppy like you'd see in a Transformers movie.  Contrast is excellent and I saw no artifacting or aliasing at any time.  I should say that when I bought this film and reached about the 42 minute mark that the Blu Ray stalled out completely.  I had to return the disc and get a new one which I then watched from beginning to end.  This second Blu Ray played just fine for me.  It does appear that the producers might have crushed the blacks a touch.  While there is a goodly amount of small details evident throughout the film, because of the deeper blacks, some details are lost.  You're really not missing anything but I do not recall from my Standard Def version such deep blacks.  Bit rate ranged from the high 20's to low 30's.  Either way, the video is a very clean transfer in the blu ray format.<br /><br />AUDIO...The audio provides a choice of lossless 5.1 or 6.1 audio.  Lossless is always better than lossy compression as the audio will be more transparent and more detailed.  Dialogue is easy to understand and I didn't have to adjust the volume control, however, there were times when I thought the 80's disco like soundtrack felt too loud when backing behind the dialogue.  There is a fine amount of panning of the audio between the front and rear stages as well as from left to right.  The jet noise will definitely wake your LFE channel and earn its position in your home theater.  All in all, the audio is very enveloping which I always like, but one star off for the dated soundtrack.  Did it seem dated when the film first came out?  Probably not so don't let this part of my opinion sway you.<br /><br />Extras...These included a Digital 2nd disc which can be downloaded to iTunes on a Mac as well as a PC and is much easier to ingest than VUDU and UltraViolet.  Also included are the typical commentaries, a making of Top Gun, an old doc on the real Top Gun schools and the movie trailer.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.dtrack.

0811879542|5.0|I love this book.  It is an interactive book asking the child to press here, touch 5 times, shake gently, etc. After each direction, the page following shows a result of the direction. For example shaking gently moves all the dots to one side of the page. It teaches colors, numbers, following directions. Really a neat book.  I bought it for my three year old granddaughter.

But WWZ is the exception.<br /><br />The voice cast is phenomenal! Any fanboy will delight hearin Simon Pegg, Nathan Fillion, Henry Rollins, and Mark Hamill (to name my personal favorites) take on the role of the survivors of the war.<br /><br />If you're thinking about it, buy it. You won't regret it!

0316216453|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. I read this book once a year because even though it is a fairly melancholy story, I get so lost and enraptured with it and its beautiful language. Seeing the movie first prompted me to read it, the book is so much better! As an Anglophile I love a good story about English aristocrats and per-war Britain. This story is so rich and beautifully written by Waugh that every time I read it I find myself underlining new quotes and and passages. A must read!
B00136JQMI|5.0|things rise and fall among the building blocks of public culture, and along the flow of time in each individual's grasp of it.  funny how jazz, the one truly american music, has come and gone several times in a lifetime:  there it was and here it is again.  within that parameter, miles davis remains a constant  --  like coltrane, bird, mingus  -- and leaps immediately to mind when the word is spoken.  &#34;kind of blue&#34;  is one of the reasons, and you can get lost in it for the first time, or for the first time again.

0345525558|5.0|I'm not talking much about the subject matter but more about how this book made me feel.  I felt drawn to this girl who was protective and guarded.  I felt hopeful when she had something good happening to her.  I was crushed when she lashed out in a misguided attempt to force things to work our for her.  I was amazed that she could allow anyone to show her any affection.  I cried and felt my heart break for her many times and appreciated the care the author took with the delicate ending.  I feel very sad that I've finished reading this book, if you know what I mean.  I needed it to go on forever.  I love when I love a book that much.  Not everyone will be able to immerse themselves in Victoria's world but if you do you will be glad you did.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|4.25 stars<br /><br />HOPELESS is the first installment in Colleen Hoover's YA/NA contemporary series focusing on Sky Davis and Dean Holder. I am not sure where to classify this particular series as the main characters are 17 and 18 but must deal with many adult situations.  And in doing so, so too, does the reader. But it is probably a storyline that crosses between YA and NA as there is the typical mean girl club in school who all but destroy Sky's reputation and the ultimate bad boy hero type who falls immediately for the new girl as well as the sexual aspect of the main characters relationship. Although not sexually graphic, it is sensual and leaves nothing to the imagination.<br /><br />The novel is a story told in present day and flashbacks from Sky's POV. Sky is a homeschooled seventeen year old young woman about to embark on her first taste of public school. But her life long BFF  `Six' is moving to Europe and with that there is no one that Sky considers a friend.  And her friendship with Six has tainted Sky's reputation (by association) before she has ever had a chance to build one of her own.<br /><br />Hopeless is a story of one young woman's journey to discover or uncover the secrets she has buried in her mind.  Her dreams-whether awake or asleep-are filled with a little girl who wants nothing more than to be loved but discovers that the monsters are the people who profess to love and care for you.<br /><br />As the storyline develops, we discover that Sky and Holder have a history but a history that Sky can no longer remember.  And it is not Holder she is trying to forget but a childhood of pain and betrayal. As the memories slowly reveal the truth about Sky's family, the relationship between Sky and Holder becomes closer as the pain increases.  And in the end, Sky and Holder have more in common than ever thought possible.<br /><br />The storyline is simple.  There is the usual YA fair of mean girls, jocks, harassment and name calling, which to me is always over the top and unnecessary in most storylines and in this case, to me, felt out of place.  The world building and character development are smooth and build over the story.<br /><br />The likeability of Sky and Holder is immediate.  Both have unnecessary or exaggerated reputations but in Holder's case what happened becomes fodder for the gossip mongers and school big mouths.  The big surprise is not unexpected but Colleen does a wonderful job building the tension for the reveal and in doing so holds the reader's attention.<br /><br />The overall flow of the story is well paced and even.  There are not too many issues of the storyline getting caught up in flash backs.  There are several flash backs that help push the storyline along and in each case adds to the tension and plot building so that the reader is not unprepared for the heartbreak of the truth.<br /><br />HOPELESS is a fascinating storyline that will break your heart, but it is also a story of second chances, falling in love with your soul mate and finding forgiveness in a world of pain and betrayal.  Losing Hope is the second installment (July 2013) and it is basically the re-telling of Hopeless from Holder's POV.  I am not necessarily a fan of flipping storylines over from various POV, because there is always too much overlap if the main characters are omnipresent in both stories.<br /><br />see all of my reviews at ; thereadingcafe(dot)comways over the top and unnecessary in most storylines and in this case, to me, felt out of place.

B008K6HN8I|2.0|I got this app for the dolphin browser.  I have no idea how it works. It did not come with any instructions.  I am feeling very frustrated.  I am sure it is a good app if only I knew how to make it work.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I will never have to buy lighter fluid again. I have all my friends using chimney starters for their charcoal grills the proper way.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I read it like a series of cliffhanger scenes in history. Not being primarily a student of history, it was a fine multi-dimensional view-set of the personal, interpersonal, political, economic, and public aspects of any 'historical event' fading into the unknowable circle of knowledge and experience uniquely shared within the club. We discuss it as the 450th book in our BookClub's history.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! Not too hard and interesting. I wish it would of been a little longer, especially since I did purchase it. Looking forward to the sequels though.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My standard for good fantasy is based on Lord of the Rings and the Narnia series, so I rarely read this genre these days. It's not enough to have action and dragons and castles. I'm looking for epic vision, great storytelling and some depth of meaning. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" offers all of this. It does get off to a slow start, so keep at it for a few chapters until Kvothe actually begins to tell his story. Even then, it's a slow reveal - but so richly described that they journey is itself a reward.<br /><br />Based on the long gap between this volume and the second in the trilogy, plus some of the reviews of that second book about how its tone shifts, I'm not yet sure whether I will keep reading the series. But even if I don't, this first book is worthwhile on its own merits.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|GREAT GAME GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME A LOT OF BLOWING UP THINGS. IT A MIX OF TEMPLE RUN AND A SECOND PERSON SHOOTER. I WOULD RATE IT BETTER IF I WAS ABLE.
B004J4WN0I|1.0|It saves one from buying a lot of cute, self-regarding crap by authors like Kevin Hearne.  And thanks, too, to the one-star reviewers, who are usually so ticked at themselves for buying stuff like this that they explain at length what is wrong with it, so that others don't have to.  It is in their honor that I award the Single Star.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I came to this series via Showtime and then was left trying to find the rest of the series.  So happy Amazon had it.  Check it out if you like scifi.
B002XXPNXG|4.0|Not much of a Woody Allen fan & the 1st in the set was too much of that. But Before Sunset was better.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book was recommend to me, not something I typically would choose. I couldn't put it down and ordered the next one.
157421327X|3.0|Why in the world did I jump the gun and order this book before doing more online research? I guess I'm just impulsive.  I wasted my money. This little booklet is worth about $4 in the real world.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|The best way to rate this game is to put it into a category like the first Diablo or Warcraft game when it came out but with less lag. So I feel that this is an actual game not a 10 min time killer.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I was unfortunately one of those who attempted to download Magic 2014 on an original Kindle Fire.<br />The download completed successfully, but the game would never initiate.  I tried again and got<br />the same results.  I then noticed that these attempts to download consumed 2.4 GB of storage space<br />on the Kindle!  I checked out the other review comments, and found other original Fire users had<br />the same complaints.  I hooked my Kindle up to my computer, and found that there were two 1.2 GB<br />files in directory Android/data/com.amazon.venezia/cache.  Once I removed those 2 files with the<br />computer, the space on the Kindle was reclaimed.  Based on the comments by the others who have<br />something more advanced than the original Fire, I would like to try this app at some point, but<br />it looks like I'll have to wait until WotC makes an update that consumes less disk space or I<br />get a more current device.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|When you click on a certain level it brings it up but does not give any help as promised.  Waste of time.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|It's good entertainment with the right amount of difficulty. That is until you get to a level that pops up a demon right as you are going to win and it takes all your remaining lives. I had 17. That was an unpleasant surprise. I will keep trying t o win the level a few more times before I give up.
B00CL6GAD2|5.0|Mark is getting better and better in his craft as the years go by. Great movie and would recommend it to any mark wahlberg and russel Crowe fan
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This story was advertised as a trilogy.  Sylvia Day should have stuck to that format instead of trying to manufacture more plot twists to extend the series.  Eva and Gideon should have been gotten their HEA in book 3 instead of loading on more mysteries, scandals and obsessive exes.  This story seems to be developing into a franchise which doesn't work for me.  I won't be spending any more money on it.  And since my library doesn't carry Sylvia Day, I guess I won't ever find out what happens.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was totally absorbing. Love the graphics, really well done. I couldn't stop playing until I got to the end.
B000UX6TRK|5.0|a very well done full concert showing the hard work Lionel puts into his shows. all his hit songs are shown with great visuals
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book so much. It was so intriguing I will never forget it at all. I loved it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The best puzzler game for the Kindle Fire.  A compelling storyline unfolds as you solve the puzzles.  Can't wait for the Sequel !
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love this show.  I love the set and costume design.  This show is really well done.  It's also a show I can watch with my five year old in the room.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|This is one of those movies that you keep watching, hoping it will get better. It does - at the last scene. Just skip ahead to that. Trust me, you won't miss anything. If nothing else, bad camera work kills this film. B movie quality. I feel sorry for the actors. They deserved better.
0547569653|5.0|Love to hear Scott's story in his own words.  Since I am a new vegan, enjoyed the fact that he emphasized his diet...
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This movie has it all - action, comedy, romance, suspense... it's worth watching again and again. The puns on the different characters are well placed ('I'll be back', 'Yippie Kay Yay',...). Being in the Army, I can relate to Billy's story. There's a lot to be fixed in the Army. Can't decide which type of movie to watch tonight? Pick this one. It's got your bases covered (pun intended).
B0094KF4WG|5.0|A friend was talking about the book so I thought I'd check it out. It's one of those that once you start reading it you just can't stop. Great insight into the background and daily routines of Seals. Definately a book that I'd recommend for a great days reading.
B000002VMD|5.0|The great Whitney Houston, will there be another like her? A great talent sadly destroyed by the curse of drugs. Well worth listening to as it was made during her heyday
B00AEFZ6V4|4.0|I myself am not one for fantasies, but a couple of friends of mine love this movie, so I gave it a try and love it.<br /><br />The plot was easy to follow and keeps you interested: a boy longs to become a man, so he sets off to bring back a fallen star to his beloved only to discover that the star is a young woman. He now has to protect her from people who are after her to make themselves immortal. It was a seamless story that all intertwined into one conclusion. The characters are quite colorful and the music was just right to add to the action. Plus, plenty of comedy.<br /><br />The only reason I give this movie four stars instead of five is that I didn't care for the casting of the two main characters and love interests, Tristian and Yvaine (Charlie Cox and Claire Danes). Of course, people like Robert De Nero and Michelle Pheifer with Ian McKellan made the movie, but I felt like Cox and Danes' performances were a little lackluster at times (I mean, I guess Danes is pretty enough, but she's just not one of my favorite people). I also felt like their chemistry was a little weird.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was a great movie and would recommend it to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. Just started playing and I'm already addicted. It's a great test of memorization and sleuthing kills. Great for all ages. Start playing now!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. I didn't like the ending thought, but every thing else was the great. I would recommend all my friends this book.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I loved the atypical writing style. Things bouncing back and forth almost makes you feel as manic as the characters. It's hard to get your own feel for the characters if you've already seen the movie, but I would recommend it to those who haven't and those who have alike.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook allows me to communicate with family & friends.  It also enables me to tell my point of view on various subjects.  In addition I am able to add my voice to various causes of interest to me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. its great to do when facebook or twitter gets boring! I can go and pin things I like and still see it later instead of using my memory to save it! its great I think this is a great thing to use when you want to see things you.like instead of.drama!!!! its great I.love it!!!
B00123MCGE|5.0|This live album has become my favorite of Dream Theater's for a few reasons. The power and energy put into every song makes them standout compared to the original album versions. The inclusion of the Octavarium Orchestra made the latter half of the album amazing. I also liked the songs that were previously unreleased, including Raise the Knife, Another Won, and Innocence Faded. This album also includes the best version of The Spirit Carries On, and the opening solo for the song is incredible.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I've enjoyed You Tube for years but bought my husband a new Kindle Fire for Father's Day and downloaded it onto his Kindle so he could enjoy it too.  He's got a kick out of watching the videos.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read, engrossing characters<br />Hard to believe all that happens but truth and justice prevail making it worth the read
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Bought this for my husband's fire, but I'm the one who is hooked on it.  My only complaint is that once I start playing, I have a hard time putting it down.  I really feel like there are more worthy activities, but I do enjoy it.
B008CUVOKK|3.0|i am lookin for a box set with all 5 books of asoiaf but i just cant find the right one. my problem is not the number of the books ,i know that 5 of them are published. i am looking for a box set that contains 4 or all 5 books in  normal size like those we buy from our book stores . not the pocket sise not the hardcover. just normal books with normal dimensions .can anyone please tell me if this box set is what i am looking for or suggest something else??? thank you!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read- ready for the next book! Action drama and love story all in one. Go ahead and get the trilogy
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, do so now!  It's a really good TRUE story and the book is also an amazing read.  RIP Chris McCandless (AKA Alexander Supertramp)
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great characters and photography. The level of violence is just enough. I would recommend it to anybody. I like the series Spartacus, without the gore.
B004GYY714|5.0|Finally a  Places  to hear my good old .....<br />OLDIES BUT GOODIES....<br /> that are just about lost in this modern world of lyrics that I'm sorry but don't understand, and being of old school, think the world was a better place!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This album is fantastic. I've always been a fan of Daft Pubk and was a bit worried when I heard that they had a brand new sound on this album. My fears were absolutely crushed into the dust by this album. Each song is catchy and unique, and the musicality is apparent in each note. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Good size and really handy for those every day calculations. Bright easy to see! And the price is definitely right!
1401307450|5.0|An enthralling book. Mind boggling how crazy is life is/was... I would highly recommend for anyone to read, not just fans.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so fun to play.I really like that you can revisit games that you have already completed. such a cool game.plus I cant wait to unlock the new levels.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game os good if you like playing alone but when rf is 0.7.2 coming out amazon like really its freaking safe you let the other updates come but not realms wtf!!!!!!!!!!
B00D3XAA4M|1.0|Googling will provide you more info (sans the advertisements to real lonely planets). The book only provides some 20 sentences per destination. And I doubt the amazing-ness of tips like &#34;go swimming in Greece&#34;...
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|This is a useless piece of $#%# I should have bought wireless and spent the money. This doesn't broadcast any better then my camera mic. does. Don't buy it!!!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I must agree with those reviewers who say that the Netflix series is superior to the book. It's all about the \\"back stories\\" -- the TV series takes us into the lives of the other prisoners.<br /><br />It's depressing to read all the reviews here by self-righteous persons who seem to feel that imprisoning millions of people for drugs is acceptable. A certain percentage of people have addictive personalities. We could probably treat these people for a tenth of what it costs to lock them in prison.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|This book helped me understand the difference between having a high income and having wealth. It shows that having a high income is not the only factor that goes into accumulating wealth. In fact, the most important factor is frugality.
B0097C8XL0|1.0|I really did enjoy this game it was fun but then my virus decided to tell me it was not a safe program had to remove it
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|I will never get tire of watching this movie and my kids love it.  Its a great fall back when you can't think of what to watch.
B00DM0UTPQ|4.0|It's been too long since we had a good submarine movie. Shouldn't have cast Duchoveney though. Great storytelling, fun movie.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is a funny movie with a great cast, I could watch it over and over. Bruce and John seen to have fun making this movie
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Maybe one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not quite sure who they let write this thing, but its horrible from top to bottom. Wasn't even really fun to watch.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|Drill instructor Hartman is their man, his introduction in this movie is awesome. It is a must see movie. Thanks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed the game!  Yes it is kind of like 100 floors but but better. Didn't get frustrated even though it was challenging!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can not wait for more rooms to open up. I love to play these kind of games. So hurry up I need my game fix.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love the cool features and gimmicks of the app! First app I've really liked in a lllooong time :)
B000000OPU|4.0|Every song on this album is terrific.  Like US better.  If you buy just one, get the compilation, Shaking the Tree.  For sound quality you should get the Virgin import label.  There are remastered versions, but haven't heard them.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|this book is fantastic for people of all ages and yes that is including kids i am 12 and it is my favorate book
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Superb special effects and a fantastic story make this movie well worth seeing. Being carried along with the epic nature of the story and the twists and turns it takes is a real treat.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Better than sleeping pulls! I fall asleep every night with this app playing.  So many soothing sounds to choose from. Highly recommend.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Ultramarathon runners are a very rare breed. I knew nothing about them or their sport until I read this book. They are fascinating, unconventional, intense, and fiercely dedicated. Runners will especially find this book a great read. It describes everything that the human body goes through during this grueling sport. Even if one runs solely for exercise and the thrill of it, this book lifts everyone. The back story is especially well told, with unique characters and enough personalities to generate real interest. I would have rated it a Five, but there is one biographical part that goes on too long and doesn't seem to contribute much to all of the other excellent pieces of this great puzzle.
0425263924|5.0|Ms. Day is a very entertaining writer. You just never know what she is going to put in these books.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|After having started and stopped in an attempt to finish this book it was well worth the effort.<br />Reading it on my kindle fire was an added treat.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|A role reversal with lots of twists along the way and an unexpected ending. The Lincoln Lawyer at his best and  with a partnership between his half brother and his ex wife it was never going to go smoothly.<br /><br />For fans of Harry Bosch and Micky Haller this is a must.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Love the sound of the group - unique.  Would buy as a gift for others.  Can't wait for future CD's.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This is a book that should be required reading for all Americans. Even though I lived through much of it, at the time, news accounts were distorted and, working did not allow time for the kind of inquiry that today is possible through alternate press journals. When my father told me, we don't have a free press, I did not believe him. After all, I had read the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post or Chicago Tribune. Little did I know then that he was right and I believed was I was supposed to believe. I highly recommend this book. It really took the blinders off my eyes.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This was a great buy . It was in perfect condition . Really quick shipping as well . Really recommend that anyone who enjoys smallville to purchase this box set .
B009AMAJPA|3.0|Victor (Colin Farrell) is a mole in Alphonse's (Terrence Howard) crime organization. His criminal activity has been seen by Beatrice (Noomi Rapace) who lives in an apartment across from his. Her face has been disfigured from an automobile accident and for some reason she doesn't cover it with make-up. Beatrice blackmails Victor into killing the drunk driver who hit her car. She gets involved in his life.<br /><br />The film has all the elements of a crime thriller, but moves at a slower pace with less action scenes. The film tries to build relationships and character, but Colin Farrell really wasn't up for the gig while the support cast did fine. Colin Farrell has done better.<br /><br />Recommend as a rental only.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.
B002O6FBW0|5.0|The restored film is gorgeous and the sound track takes this classic to a new stratosphere.<br />An audio visual delight !
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|The film opens with a narration. It explains that a portal has opened connecting us to another universe in the Pacific Rim. Through this hole emerges destructive creatures from 60's Japanese films, updated of course. In a missed plot point, conventional means of fighting them seem to be useless, so we construct 100-150 foot tall robots called Jaegers to combat them. Missiles fired from Jaegers are effective, but...okay I tried not to think too hard about it.<br /><br />The Jaegesr are controlled by 2 people, dressed in \\"Star Wars\\" storm trooper gear, that are in a mind meld that would make Spock green with envy. They are called pilots because Jaeger masters might be a copyright infringement.<br /><br />The film combines elements of \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Starship Troopes,\\" \\"Transformers\\" and \\"Ironman\\" and sets them into a stolen Japanese plot. Of course the rule is if you steal a plot from Japan you have to hire someone from Japan to be in the film, hence we have Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori. She will eventually team up with John Rico, eh ah Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam because Casper Van Dien is too old) to fight against the monsters coming at an increasing rate. There is a subplot that includes Ron Perlman and Charlie Day.<br /><br />There are two schools of thought. One is to use the Jaegers to kill the creatures, the other is to build a war to keep out the illegal aliens. When the wall fails to keep out the illegal aliens, the Jaegers can defend the world thanks to \\"stand your ground\\" principles. Pardon my attempt at political humor.<br /><br />The supporting characters were better written than the main ones.<br /><br />This is an over dramatic, action packed popcorn film. The language is designed to appeal to a teen/young adult audience. Looks good on the big screen.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity.
0920236162|5.0|I love this book as does my daughter. I recommend it to all who have girls and want to empower them.  It is always requested, and it makes both of us laugh.  A must have in every girls library.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was only familiar with Neil Gaiman's work through television episodes he wrote and the movie \\"Star Dust\\". After reading \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\", I can honestly say I'm a fan. This book has the ability to carry you away to those magical childhood hiding places where magic was real and only you had the ability to interact with it. It appealed to the child in me, reminding me of how magical the world could be when I was younger.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I liked the Harry Bosh character in Michael Connelly's novels  and now his half or is it a step brother Mickey Haller is a good read also.  This book had an ending that the I did not expect.  Michael Connelly's writings are comparable to John Grisham's.
B0055S348W|4.0|Overall very helpful. Sometimes a pain when trying to print copies of invoices and stuff that is on pages under an account name. If logged in on a page then try to print often brings up the log in page and not the page you were on.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I am very satisfied with this product. No complaints. I would buy it again. You will not be disappointed. A+
B007Z9QWVK|4.0|Don't buy this if you think you're gonna get the PBS version of Edward and Wallis... This is a much more personal account centered around Mrs. Simpson and tied into the present time. It draws a beautiful parallel between Wallis a woman of today. As a full blown Anglophile and Moncharist married to a Brit I have to say I never considered Mrs. Simpson side of the story... Her sacrifices, her pressures being the most hated woman in England possibly the world at the time, and being persecuted for bein a progressive independent woman of the age. I also never considered why she actually got divorced from her previous 2 husbands...which will pull at the heart strings of any woman. Buy it. You won't regret it.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Reminds me of my husband I. This what love is. How we can change and continue to live. We grow and help others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it I love it because it makes my cousins think I have a real horse and she loves horses. I wish I could see my face when I got it because I thought the game was going to he stupid since I got it for my cousin. but its not stupid at all
B005K17RU0|5.0|allows for multiple cities and it is very detailed. loads fast and has alerted. daily features and hourly schedule make the difference for me.

B000LXQVA4|3.0|We considered other jumpers but bought this one because of it's relatively unique capability of folding down to a more compact footprint for storage and ease of moving. The unit does in fact collapse down at the base, however, attempting to move the unit while it is collapsed is nigh impossible without two people. Even then, the space savings is marginal. Without collapsing it, the unit is too large to move through standard door frames which makes it even more fun. Otherwise, the jumper is nice and has a lot of toys on it. Only problem on the activity side is the dragonfly with the flexible base that stands straight up in the pictures is completely flopped over and hanging over the side of the unit where baby can't even get to it. Not very stimulating in that regard. I would not purchase again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although this is far from the reality of British servitude, I just the humanity they show in both social classes. I think they did a great job in Season 3.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love business games and this is the best one I've played by far. Graphics are really good and it is very realistic.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn was without question my favorite author. I am going to miss the Mitch Rapp novels very much. Have read and re-read<br />all of his novels and they are all page turners. Extremely difficult to put down. I've stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to finish most Vince Flynn novels, &#34;The Last Man&#34; was no exception.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I have this game on my computer and have enjoyed playing it so when I saw that I could get it on my tablet I was excited.  You match 3 until you turn all the spaces a different color than you can build the city back.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|It is very similar to the series, &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; of years ago, but I did enjoy it.  Many times, one could predict what was coming, but I'm glad I purchased the DVDs.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|Handy case that fits the headset well.  Don't understand what some of the space if for.  Looks like a cord, but didn't fit.
B00BQ1D9IW|5.0|after their debit album, this guys sound more mature and their music feels more evolved. The instrumentation along the vocals makes a perfect spooky and enjoyable combination
161655164X|5.0|If you like the game this is a must have. Naughty dog never disappointed me, all the drawings are awesome!
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Sorry, I posted the wrong review.  I have not read this one yet.  I will post the correct one after I have done so.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Our son suggested we check out this show. He said he thought it was something we'd enjoy. Well when you have multiple generations enjoying a program, then I think it's evidence of a well-written show that covers its bases. The episodes speak to taking risks, being loyal, thinking outside the box, and succeeding. In between all those are good characters that you come to care for (and others you despise!). It's fun, sharp, and everyone is just so darned well-dressed. :-) Enjoy!
B003JH8LPW|4.0|This was a fun read although, maybe, a little convoluted.  I know this is an older book, but stories about the NSA are very current.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book presents a thought provoking and sensitive consideration of what hurdles severely handicapped people face long term, while taking a very real view of two families and how family interaction shapes who we become.
B0018J6FOW|5.0|Love Michael C Hall.  Love Jennifer Carpenter.  Absolutely love the whole cast.  The best show in the history of ever.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My grandson loves to play it even though he does not get to far, he is only 2 and a half<br />He is not frightened of the gorilla so that makes it nice
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Great movie and was in great condition. Also, a great price for being a blue ray DVD. So glad I got it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game it is very entertaining<br />However it can become a little addictive I just love it
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I actually had never heard of this when I ordered it, but got it to watch when there's nothing on TV that we like.  It's not a bad movie & casting is fairly good.  The $5 cost was worth buying it & I'm sure we'll grab it and watch again.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This has a lot of complicated puzzles and it is very challenging<br />I like to go back and try to better my times
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It really makes you use your brain. I love the challenge. hope they make more levels!!! lets keep this game free!
B0063IH60K|4.0|You can't go wrong with Solitaire and this one is easy to use<br />I enjoy playing it and it is relaxing
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Anyone that is a fan of Marvel movies will love this one. I even enjoyed the Hulk in it. Instead of the awful graphics from the original Hulk movies, they have evolved into something more believable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can't wait for more rooms to be added. gets ya thinking yet easy enough and still challenging. great for my ten year old as well.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Although many people criticize Christian Bale, I think he is a better Batman than all of the '90's versions hands down. These movies actually show how Batman started. They are a bit on the &#34;dark&#34; side, but so is the Batman character. Not for young teens and below!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loveit!. I have really enjoyed playing this game it very interesting and challenging you will like it if you want your mind challenged. you wont be disappointed.
0446547638|5.0|As is usual for Nicholas Sparks it was a terrific book. Is this book going to be made into a movie?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Nice game and graphics.longer version would be nice before asking you to pay for full game. Other than that fun playing.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Just like my review on Season One....I STILL love it!!! Only bad thing about it... I know it ends after season Five :(
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game that is fun and gives me something to do when bored. Graphics are good but are decreased a little during game play. This does not take away from experience and i recommend to all.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Television, I usually find something else I'd rather do with my time. So I really can't write a &#34;comparison&#34; review. All I can say is that this series had my complete attention since the very first episode. The storyline is amazing and keeps you guessing with every twist and turn of events. The characters tie the whole thing together...I love them all. Perfect mixture of science, fantasy, comedy, suspense and of course, love. Highly recommend this to all sci-fi fans, with ease of Amazon Prime Instant videos I can watch at my convenience. One warning...telling yourself &#34;just one more episode&#34; can lead to major difficulty when the alarm clock goes off the next morning.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A witty show that our entire family enjoys<br />Watching. The characters are very likable<br />And the writers are doing an awesome job.
B0002C4JE4|4.0|James Taylor. Greatest hits. What more can I say? Great stuff! His pleasant voice and familiar songs bring back my lost youth.
B0025WX2YW|3.0|costumes are great, still no one to root for as all characters are quite unpleasant; conniving, sadistic, selfish, greedy, or combinations thereof.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|I love Modern Family. It's funny, well written, the stories and characters are very 'real', and the actors are excellent. Season 4 is very good, I give it 4 stars because it's not as good as the previous three seasons.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|The game is fun. But couldn't play after one day unless I ought more lives I have now uninstalled it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|this is a good game with nice graphics. my son who is 3 yrs had some good time on it today.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan than you will like this collection. A little pricey but I think it is well worth it.
0062238868|5.0|It's factual and done to earth in real human feelings and emotions. It is one man's personal life and how he lives with his love and devotions for his country, his family and his fellow-man. He is what I would call a  &#34;True American Hero&#34; !!!!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Another summer read for my 3rd and 4th graders...this one is a page turner. They usually want to read more than is required per day because they want to know what happens next. Books like this make reading enjoyable which is what summer reading is all about :)
1444777556|5.0|Just a perfect sequel to the first book &#34;A Street Cat Named Bob&#34; . James and Bob have gone through much, surviving together, bonded by their shared life experiences. Reading their story will touch one's heart and open one's eyes to the connection we all have to one another. Highly recommended.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I use it on the computer at home but now have it on my Kindle. It's great to see what others think of various locations before I go.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|The story of Rick Deckerd, a bounty hunter who tracks androids on Earth, specifically a band of outlaws escaped from Mars. Androids have been developed to be very much like humans, difficult to identify as androids, but their inability to empathize is their downfall. We see Deckerd have to act the same in order to carry out his job to destroy the androids. He experiences inner conflict when he questions why they must be destroyed, as they seem no threat to society; he finds himself on the verge of empathizing with them. We see humans act as cold towards the unwanted outsiders.<br /><br />There are two aspects of the dystopia represented that add, indirectly, to the plot of the bounty hunter dealing with his own identity. One is the nearly extinct state of animals in this post-war world, and the desire of the protagonist, as well as everyone, to possess a real animal. (There are mechanistic replicas available at affordable prices.) This, perhaps, helps to bring out the humanity of the human characters, in contrast to the inhumanity towards androids. The second aspect is a religion called Mercerism, what seems to be something of a self-help religion in which people empathize with the character, Mercer, in his continuous uphill journey and his suffering at the hands of unseen others. The religion appears to serve the purpose, also, of bringing out humanity in people, as people may, by use of a gadget called an empathy box, join with all others watching the same event to literally share their feelings. It also gives the protagonist a way to encourage himself by identifying with Mercer.<br /><br />The book is noted as the basis for the film, Bladerunner, though with marked differences, such as the film's omission of the two aspects mentioned above. The book has an important theme of considering humanity and the challenges to one's identity.
0515153656|3.0|Started out AWESOME.  Then just kind of stayed at that level or possibly got dissapointing.  I was hoping for more of a Robert Ludlum Jason Bourne Experience.  For me I DID NOT COME CLOSE.<br />Not a big fan of detective cop books.  After seeing the movie I thought it was going to be more techno thriller
B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoyed this story as it flipped back and forth between present and past.  The secrets unfold slowly and include some surprises right up until the end. If you enjoyed Morton's \\"Distant Hours\\" or \\"House at Riverton\\" you will enjoy this book too!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I hate musicals, HATE them.  But this one was awesome.  A total different approach to musicals in a rock way that wasn't creepy wimpy or lame.<br />Top 5 movies of all time for me.  And I'm more a Rocky I, Happy Gilmore type person.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I have my Kindle in the standing case. If I just want to take a break I just close the cover and when I come back, open the cover I am back to where I left off. I can stand the case up when I talk on Skype.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was a late to get on the band wagon...but it was well worth the wait.<br />Can, t wait for the next season.
1781162646|4.0|Certainly this was an enjoyable read, but it was a lot slower than most other King novels. I kept expecting to turn the next page and find something interesting happening. It never really got going until almost at the end.<br />A haunted amusement park with a ghost? The supposed ghost took up about one per cent of the entire book.<br />And as for the climax when all is resolved.....very theatrical, like something from a B grade movie.<br />However, having said all that, I still found it to be quite enjoyable. Devin is realistic character that I think many readers will identify with.<br />I wouldn't classify this as &#34;Hard Case Crime&#34;, more a coming of age, murder mystery with a small amount of supernatural undertone.<br />If you want a slow paced story with not much in the way of action, then this is worth reading.<br />After finishing I gave the book to my wife to read. I think she'll like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a good but it has some lag don't get me wrong you may not have lag on spf put I do
B005HEDI3K|5.0|I remember watching the original show on Friday night.  It's fun to watch them all over again.  You don't have the opportunity to see them anywhere else, so Amazon Prime is the place to watch them.
1423136802|5.0|im 18 and it was great, a real good read for any age. the series is really done well. worth it to read
074401493X|4.0|already got the &#34;LIMITED EDITION&#34; of the game, only thing missing from it was the keychain that comes with this so got it for that... the guide is good etc... got the artbook from the limited edition and this guide aswell
015206396X|5.0|im 18 and it was great, a real good read for any age. the series is really done well. worth it to read
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I'm a hardcore magic player and this is perfect for on the go, especially when there isn't anyone local to play with.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is an entertaining game. It doesn't take long to make money and refill your energy so that you have continuous game play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game tests ur reflexes.<br />it challenges how fast u can think then act! I think it's a great game!!!!!!:p
B008B11R1Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time.<br />Danceable, as well as an album able to sit down with and absorb lyrically.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|good but color was to black,dark dark dark dark it needed sunshine so you cold see what was going fair story.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|It was visually entertaining, but, other than that, not worth a $3.99 rental fee through Amazon. Maybe if I were a child, I would have liked it.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|Terminator will always be a Sci-Fi lovers best choice for a good Saturday night movie. It comes with Explosions and guns and excellent acting. though a little drawn out.
B000EQHHJW|4.0|We had the good fortune to attend our first opera, an abridged version of Rigoletto, in Venice last summer at the Palazzo Musica ([...] The venue was an authentic villa, or palazzo, located on the Grand Canal, and the audience of about 50 people moved from room to room within the palazzo for the various scenes. The voices and musicians were outstanding, and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. But what really made it worthwhile was the \\"homework\\" we did before our trip, by viewing this DVD of Rigoletto, with Pavarotti, so that we could familiarize ourselves with the libretto, understand the plot and characters, and become better acquainted with Verdi's beautiful musical score.<br /><br />The DVD opera is complete, unabridged and wonderfully performed. Pavarotti's voice was magical, as expected. But the big surprise was the performer who sings the part of Gilda. Not an attractive woman, unfortunately - she would be well-cast as Frankenstein's bride - but her sublime voice is the stuff of \\"pearly gates\\", heavenly.<br /><br />We liked that the DVD opera is really a \\"movie\\", not just a static film of a stage performance. The camera moves, and the director uses appropriate camera angles, lighting, close-ups, etc that make the performance much more engaging for the viewer.<br />We were surprised how much we enjoyed this DVD, as we are complete opera novices, but we loved it. And, of course, we loved the live performance in Venice even more - one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Don't miss it if you are planning a trip to Venice. Ciao!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is an excellent film with an excellent cast. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence  really shine in this off-kilter romantic comedy. It isn't your typical chick flick. It will put a smile on your face and make you think.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Passione is a collection of songs that were performed by Andrea Bocelli for a concert in the Portofino harbor that was recently broadcast on PBS. We purchased the CD after viewing that amazing concert, and we couldn't be more delighted with the varied collection of songs in Italian, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish, including several duets with female vocalists, including Edith Pilaf and Jennifer Lopez. The song production and orchestral back-up is outstanding. This CD is great for just listening and also for dinner or dinner party music. We play it almost every day lately. Just love it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|All about how the big things (government decisions, social forces) affect the little things (us) during the lead-up, fighting, and aftermath of WorldbWar II. A worthy second installment to the Century Trilogy. I can't wait for the third!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it's very cute to play. My son loves to play with his horse pet now he wants a real one!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely adore the characters and meticulous recreation of this period. A glimpse back to a lifestyle lost to history and technology.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This book is good read  I couldn't put it down  This James Rollins book is great, as are all his books.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was not at all what I expected...some nice twists that kept interest and make me look forward to the sequel.
B00846REIS|5.0|Gideon is a less sadistic version of Christian Grey. Rich, sexy, haunted and impossible not to love. You'll be hooked on him just as easily as Eva.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We were not sure if we would like this series, but were hooked from the start. Great plot lines and great acting.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Jackson's prelude to the Tolkien trilogy is as good as the first three. Well cast and acted with beautiful cinematography.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Loved the first and second seasons.  This third seasin was even better.  It kept me on my toes and I couldn't stop watching!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|You know what's going to happen the entire time. Kinda loses its luster in that way.<br />I loved the first one but the last two feel into the same trap
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Out of sight out of mind, the world (humans) will take everything on the planet we can possibly consume with little notion of the consequences, nothing new. We are a very clever species, although our intelligence is questionable.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel is as good as the Kite Runner - I couldn't put it down!<br />It was touching, sensitive and captivating.
B000J103PC|5.0|Still a great chick flick a few years later. I didn't know I didn't own it, as I think I've bought this film several times, but I moved out of my parents' house and found it was no longer in my collection. The price was low, condition was new (or like new, I can't remember which, and arrived promptly using the free 2-day shipping on my Prime membership. No complaints.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I give this app five stars love the jungle theme<br />The monkey is very cute Easy to play. All ages will enjoy it. Fun gamee
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The pinch spread zoom mechanic gets tiresome.  Double tap to zoom both in AND out would be much preferred.  Especially on those screen elements where a text element is want to pop up when you're intent is to zoom out.<br /><br />I like the puzzle box concept.  Really wish problem solving was more based in logic/reasoning and less in luck and hunt &amp; peck discovery.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Very nice case for a very reasonable price. Sturdy, looks nice, and isn't super bulky. I would definitely buy it again.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|AccuRadio has something for every work place, every time of day, every age, everyone!! Love it!!! Don't listen to anything else!!
B0058W74UY|1.0|I could not get this to download, my bad. I will not be able to use it . I was really looking for Adobe Flash.<br />..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. Love that there is finally a good game for all horse lovers to play. Can't wait to get my levels up.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best thing ever for ideas on anything you can think of from parties to hairstyles to christmas and even more
B0028IDXDS|2.0|He hates the paci part but he loves the stuffed monkey part, so I guess it was a good buy. The paci is not detachable from the plush animal, so if your baby doesn't like Soothie style pacis, don't bother buy this. Just buy a stuffed animal instead!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|This was also a book club choice, but I was very disappointed in the content and felt it was nowhere near as good as previous book by Khaled Hosseini.  I felt it was very disjointed.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The older version was much better all around. I have had it for a while now. They are too interested in getting you to support adds. They just want you to get points for some stupid gift card, I just. Want the weather.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|This was one of the most intriguing books we have had as a book club choice this year, thoroughly enjoyed every word and culd not put it down.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this CD on the recommendation of a friend as I was not familiar with the artist.  It is a wonderful change from the ordinary renditions of other artists.  I love it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I ordered this movie for my six-year-old and three-year-old.  I watched it along with them.  It was really funny!  There was kids humor as well as adult humor so everyone was laughing.  This is a really good movie choice for all ages.
0061537969|5.0|I am not a dog person, but you don't need to be.  What a wonderfully heartwarming story.  Definitely worth reading.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had inquired with Lifeproof because my case is cracked; and I was needing the back piece which I would normally get if it was a real Lifeproof, however this is a counterfeit case. DO NOT BUY CASES FROM THIS PERSON; you will get the same serial numbers on your cases and they are counterfeit!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun game that all ages can enjoy.  I love that you can challenge a friend but you can play endlessly on your own.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I found this book really hard to put down-not that it is a thriller or anything, but simply because I got so engaged with the protagonist that I wanted to see what happened to her.  Great story about how overcoming the odds gives us a sense of purpose and meaning.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I got this book passed on to me from a friend.  I didn't know that it was one of three.  When I got to the end of book one, I &#34;kindled&#34; Amazon and got the next two sent to my kindle. What a great read!!.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Doesn't even let you know when you've run out of moves.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I've seen much better free apps.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is ok but the world's have end points and they should have more things to craft. The game is not worth $6.99 it should be worth around $3.99
B00003CXA6|5.0|Almost every time I watch this film, I get choked up and emotional. After having walked/studied the battlefields, lately 2-3 July 2013, including Pettigrew-Trimble-Pickett commemorative walk, I still cannot comprehend the amount of courage, devotion, bravery shown by the soldiers 150 years ago... The true value of this film lies in and grateful thanks is due to the thousands of &#34;living historians&#34; participating. The major reason to purchase is the full-length commentary by Maxwell, Van Oostrum, and Drs. McPherson and Symonds.  Berenger, Elliot, Jordan, and esp. Daniels were admirable. Martin Sheen was sadly miscast as Lee and Bo Brinkman, Lee’s aide, was an real irritant. Unfortunately, maybe for length constraints, the many aspects of the recurring, and arguably the most critical, battles for Cemetery and Culp's Hills were omitted.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much. However I would have enjoyed it more if she had not used so many words that  I had to look up the meaning. Thank God I was reading on my kindle. It made the flow uneven.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app crashed my Kindle Fire!!! The app never even finished downloading and now my Kindle won't even power on now. Its toast!
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|We are having fun catching this series, as a family.  Friday night movie night has turned into three or four episodes of Falling Skies and we're addicted.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used this app for a long time because it was reliable, easy to use, and just great in general.  However they updated the app a while back and destroyed everything good about it.  As it is now the app is pretty much unusable.  The interface is difficult to read and navigate, assuming you can even get it to load at all.  I'll be uninstalling this app and lookong for something else.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|\\"The Conjuring\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Based on a true story, this horrifying tale follows world renowned paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren who were called upon to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in a secluded farmhouse. Forced to confront a powerful demonic entity, the Warrens find themselves caught in the most terrifying case of their lives.<br /><br />The cast led by Vera Farmiga (excellent as usual as Lorraine Warren), Patrick Wilson (solid as Ed Warren), Ron Livingston (also solid as Roger Perron) & Lili Taylor (also excellent as Carolyn Perron) is excellent. The directing by James Wan is excellent. The story & screenplay by Chad & Carey W. Hayes is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Joseph Bishara (also plays the demon Bathsheba) is excellent. The cinematography by John R. Leonetti is excellent. The film editing by Kirk M. Morris is excellent. The casting by Anne McCarthy & Kellie Roy is excellent. The production design by Julie Berghoff is excellent. The art direction by Geoffrey S. Grimsman is excellent. The set decoration by Sophie Neudorfer, set dressings by Kip Bartlett, set designs by John B. Josselyn is excellent. The costume design by Kristin M. Burke is excellent. The make-up effects designed by Jerad Marantz is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Chris Bailey & supervised by David Beavis is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Ray McIntyre Jr. is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Joel Kramer & Norb Phillips is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent, well-made, well-done and well-crafted supernatural horror-thriller that is entertaining, intriguing and interesting. It is also scary, as well. James Wan has possibly made, what is, his best film of his career, so far, and the best horror film of his career, as well. Vera Farmiga & Lili Taylor both give excellent performances and Patrick Wilson & Ron Livingston both also give solid performances, as well. This is one of the best films ofthe summer season and one of the best horror films of the year (actually the best horror film of the year, thus far) and of recent memory, as well.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Good action.  I liked that there was no blood, even with the killing giants.  The kids loved it without having nightmares
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We love this show! Thank you Amazon for carrying this...it is really nice to go to the beginning and start the show ou t right!
B009NY43NY|4.0|This is one of my favorite sookie novels yet.  Sad it's the final book but the ending is amazing. A must read!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The kingkiller chronicle is hands down the best series I have read, both books (NOTW/TWMF) blew me away, I read both books in the period of 3 days, I could not put the books down. This series has made what I previously felt were good books, look terrible. I cant wait for book three, Thank you Patrick for a truly amazing experience, Kvothe inspired me to learn the guitar and learn new languages.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So much fun, I think you should be able to add friends without having to put then on your fb page.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is amazing. A little like instagram with the following people and changing how the pic looks but other than that its not like instagram. And most of the packages are Aspecially the holiday packages it comes with backgrounds frames stickers cliparts and father stuff. So you should get pica art photo studio. and there's way more stuff you can do!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's very fun and almost realistic! I wish you could name your own horse and pick or design your own horse!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is his best book, in my opinion. It has many more aspects than the other two. It takes out of Afghanistan, following the main characters. His style with different narrators Works very well
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever. Not to be missed if you like baseball! Quality of pic was fine.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This was the  best game of  the game store in the world of my sistersister the world of my brother was the baby and that's why I love this game of the world.
B000FBJG04|3.0|Overall an interesting book.  Slow moving at times and needed maps to help connect with the action.  Enjoyed the description of the soldiers careers after the war.
B006P4FBUE|4.0|The mini piano works very well for what I needed.  Using 2 octaves makes the keys pretty small but using the single octave is better.  Works great.
1250004217|4.0|Although I have not finished reading the book, so far it is very interesting and draws you in. As far as the service is concerned the book was advertised as being in use but in good condition and so it was. Certainly worth getting a hard covered book in this condition for the amount I paid. I feel that I can trust the description of book conditions on tha Amazon site.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this app thinking it was just like 100 floors and in a way it is but better. It is a real challenge and fun way to pass the time. I found.myself not being able to put it down!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Everything about the show is excellent. The acting,writing and production quality are a ll top notch. A must see for anyone intothe Sherlock Holmes genre or quality television!
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|warning, this might contain some hints some people might perceive as spoilers.<br /><br />The first one, although unbelievable, and a little formulaic, contained a good dose of humour to carry you through and connect with the characters. At the end of the first one I was curious enough to see what was next in store for rip, scarlett, duke, anna and the rest.I now know, Nowt. Nada, Zip. Pretty much all the characters you were invested in from the first one are not in the second one.<br /><br />The second one was a real step down, both in characters and plot. Many of the Rock's other movies at least fit his personality, this one having laid the stage with humour and Duke, means the rock is playing second fiddle to this.<br /><br />At this point I have little curiosity in whatever the next installment would be, there are no characters to have curiosity about, there was no development of them, no humour. Lets face it, guns bombs and more guns are plentiful in movies these day, they have to up the realism because people are so numb to it. The whole, Storm switching sides for a few minutes felt fake and was really not very interesting as a plot line.<br /><br />A waste of money IMHO. Watch the first one, watch it again, go watch Red. Go watch the Expendables (first one), go watch iron man ..etc.
B008PWN0I4|5.0|I use this with my iPhone 4 and Logitech UE9000 headphones. The sound quality improvements of aptX are easily heard. Glad I picked this up. Wish Apple would add native support in future iPhones.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Excellent story with a winning mixture of funny bits and touching moments! Recommended for children of all ages! To me, the funniest thing Steve Carell ever did.
B00004XPPK|5.0|It is one of the my favorite pictures. So I have given many times to my friends. After I could'n found it. It was a pleasure found in your store.<br />Thank you very much.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I enjoyed this book and was unsure a movie could be good because of the internal dialogue. It was well done, however. My only complaint was that the Jared actor looked very similar to other actors in the camp, confusing me a little at times, but that might just be me.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Challenging story.  Brilliant character development.  Awesome archetypes.  Suspenseful.  Anyone can die at any time...or not.  Scenery is even more glorious than season 1 because it's real.  Good mix of fantasy and reality.  I'm totally addicted.  Can't wait for season 3.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The latest update has made this app practically unusable, uninformative, and a hassle to use.  The interface has lost a lot of its usefulness in a bad attempt to become visually appealing, at which it sadly fails.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Stunning production.  Amazing details.  Gorgeous scenery.  Brilliant acting.  Stomach-turning violence.  The only thing I don't think is realistic is the quarts of blood that gurgle out every time someone is killed.  Otherwise, it's top notch.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater.  I had high hopes for it but was VERY DISAPPOINTED with it and the way it portrayed the Superman character.  This is a heartless, soul less piece of cinematic garbage!  DO NOT waste your time or your money on this movie.  I really do not see how the people who give this movies high marks could do so; this is such a bad movie on MANY levels.  So much so that I am not going to take the time and be specific about what is wrong with it.  Many others have done a very eloquent job of doing that so I will refer you to them.  All I can say is that I think Warner Brothers was more on the right track with \\"Superman Returns\\" than with MOS.  I am really sorry to see that they decided to go this direction with Superman.  Mr. Nolan, Mr. Synder and everyone else involved with the making of this film have all but destroyed a great American icon.  I only hope that future sequels will die a quick death in the theaters so that those of us who really love the Superman character and what it represents and stands for can be spared further disappointment and disgust!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The book was easily written to help anyone trying to publish their book for kindle. Easy to understand and informative examples.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Simple to use and gives most of the information about the weather that one would want including weather maps.  It would be even better if it had sunrise and sunset times.  It does have wind speed which, being a sailor, I appreciate.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This is a standout book about clearing our spaces in the home. Many unusual ideas that Ive never seen in other decluttering books!!<br /><br />For example, you have others' belongings stored in your home, like grown children's. Francine has a fun way to solve this problem.<br /><br />Good job, Ms. Jay! You are a true minimalist and inspiration!!
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|Blocks annoying adds and makes surfing more enjoyable.  Easy to set up and use and runs well.  I would recommend
B00A8OWOSO|1.0|I love gangster films. This one sucked. It didn't flow like Goodfellas or the Godfather. The typical Coen stereotyping of Italians is very evident here. All of the Coen brothers films make people of Christian background look like morons, especially Italians. No different from the media. If you are GOING to stereotype Italians, do it like it was done in Goodfella's, The Soprano's, The Godfather. The Coen Brothers (in this case, one of the brothers) have an agenda. To smear Christians and glorify those of Jewish background. This movie is no exception.<br />I wouldn't even care about that if it was interesting. This was boring and painful to follow.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I missed season 1 and 2 but I saw season 3.  Only way to see them (without buying the dvds) is Amazon Prime.  Love love love.  Now I know what happened seasons 1 and 2 and recapped season 3.  I will watch them all over again before the next season begins in January.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I got 5 for less than the price of one. They seem to be solid batteries. I recommend them to anyone with an item they use seldom.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I can only give this 3 stars because there are issues when playing the game on the nabi2. The tilt feature does not work at all in the power-up and slide parts of the game. Very frustrating for the kids when they keep dying. Freezes at times as well. But not a lot of these games are compatable with the nabi system that I have found out the hard way.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Fun game, easy and addictive. Helps to pass the time while waiting at Doctors office, etc. I would recommend this game to my friends. Oh, and it's free.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is the best game ever it's the only game I play on here. Every body should get it I rated it 5 stars for a reason
B00DU74U74|5.0|Twilight is a guilty pleasure of mine so since this has the same author I was expecting to like it, but it might be pretty cheesy. It was actually way better than I thought and the plot is much more original than vampires and werewolves, (not that I don't love those shows, but they're everywhere!)
B002LB13SE|3.0|[[ASIN:B002LB13SE The Last House on the Left (Unrated)]]<br /><br />This review is from an Australian buff, so my take on the film may be a little different.<br /><br />***THERE ARE PLOT SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />I came to this movie with a fair degree of caution. Several years ago I hired the original version, and the differences are marked, and not necessarily to the latest version's credit.<br /><br />However, despite the issues I had with the film, let's start with the pluses. Most importantly, Garrett Dillahunt is again a revelation. Anyone who has seen him in No Country for Old Men, let alone the two characters he played in Deadwood (especially the masterful turn as `Mr W'), will know this is an actor who only comes along once in a while.<br /><br />Dillahunt's turn as the primary villain in this piece is for the most part quite extraordinary. He is menacing, unpredictable, ruthless, cold, manipulative, reckless, brutal, not to mention an extremely violent individual - a very convincing psychopath, and I do not use that word lightly.<br /><br />Aaron Paul does not rate a mention on the jacket, but he is similarly excellent, equally unpleasant and a total grub. It is difficult to explain just how well Paul and Dillahunt inhabit their characters without watching the film to see what I am talking about.<br /><br />The actress who is also part of the above two characters' gang is also very convincing although she is given very little to do and it is not really ever explained why she is there.<br /><br />Similarly with the presence of Spencer Treat Clark who made his name in Gladiator and forever since has been cast (in the films I have seen) with a very similar haircut. Such as in Mystic River. Here, he is supposed to be Dillahunt's son but they look nothing like each other and the relationship, such as it is, is hardly forged to a convincing degree.<br /><br />It would have made more sense had Clark been, for example, a street kid that Dillahunt had taken under his wing to school in crime, but here in this remake it just rings false, although Clark is convincing as a kid caught in a world of bad who does not want any part of what he sees.<br /><br />Sara Paxton puts in a remarkable performance as the young woman who runs into the above lot and has a horrific time - I'll leave it at that. As does her character's friend, an actress whose name escapes me but who is also terrific in her role.<br /><br />The scene where the girls and Clark are in the motel when the real crims return unexpectedly is beautifully handled and is genuinely unsettling.<br /><br />The scenes involving rape and other violence against both girls are hard to watch (as it should be), but it is a credit to all involved that in no way can the scenes be described as gratuitous.<br /><br />However, at this point I would urge caution for those with a weak stomach who think they are going to be watching one of those thrillers with by-the-numbers plot changes with no real surprises. This film is not for young adults but mature adults who can watch this stuff and walk away thinking about it.<br /><br />In other words, this film is a serious movie with some very serious things to say. The commitment by all involved to this project was flawless and that adds greatly to the end effect - no one is sleepwalking through their role in this film, for sure.<br /><br />I can't really talk about what I thought could have been done better without giving some of the plot away, so anyone who doesn't want to hear how it ends...<br /><br />One of the pluses of the film was that it was mostly very tightly edited and tightly scripted. However there is little backstory to any of the characters.<br /><br />In the opening scene that is excellently pulled off, the SUV holding Dillahunt's character and two Marshalls is rammed at the side by another large vehicle driven by Paul's character. The two Marshalls are either killed outright or badly injured, yet Dillahunt emerges virtuallyunscathed - I didn't buy it.<br /><br />I thought Tony Goldwyn (you may have seen him do a brilliant job in a few episodes of Dexter as the rather manipulative psychotherapist) was miscast in this film. Although he was a medical professional, which I felt was a bit of a cliché, he was not really up to a great range of expression (which I admit was partly driven by the plot i.e. where he features prominently is basically in the wake of his realisation of who the gang really are). But I thought his character was pretty two-dimensional.<br /><br />Monica Potter, on the other hand, did a brilliant job in inhabiting her role as the mother to Sara Paxton's character. I haven't seen Potter in much lately but in this I thought she was terrific. However, I felt no connection between Paxton, Goldwyn and Potter - it was just a stereotypical family which sat oddly with the chaos and anarchy we had sat through already, as delivered by the gang members.<br /><br />People trying to find things desperately through pouring rain is also another stock element to any number of thrillers I care to mention.<br /><br />That is what irritated me the most about this movie - the earlier scenes with the gang were done so brilliantly, and yet the latter half of the film reverted very much to a fairly predictable sequence of events that felt and looked like a completely different film.<br /><br />I cannot remember too much about the original film, except that it was made at a time when cinema generally was pushing boundaries and going to pretty dark places which is why they became cult classics and deservedly so.<br /><br />There is something unique about them, having been made in that strange era in the Seventies where we really took the lid of some things are stared into the abyss for a while (in some instances for a lot longer than we perhaps should have).<br /><br />What am I trying to say? Such movies in that era (the original films) were notorious in their era, were banned in many places, and often badly cut by the censors (to do so was a disgrace, in my opinion). They were disturbing, horrifying, and genuinely haunted you for days afterwards.<br /><br />Perhaps that is always going to be the problem with a remake - it will never capture the impact of the original, given we have become so used to such violence in cinema, of the cartoon variety or of the unremittingly bleak and full-frontal variety.<br /><br />Some may think I am being overly picky, but I thought this remake could have been great, but it lost its way and became just another `they done his family wrong' revenge piece.<br /><br />It may just be a matter of the compromises the artists have to make these days with the financiers to get anything made at all that is this good (as it was in so many respects). But it just feels like they got to a certain point in the script and decided to put the thing on auto pilot, injecting some very predictable and obvious references to past classics.<br /><br />The scene where Goldwyn's character puts Dillahunt's head in the microwave and it explodes was both gratuitous and too silly for words. If it was meant to be a clever reference to the head-in-the-television scene in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, then it was ill-advised.<br /><br />That is my point. `Henry: Portrait...' with Michael Rooker in the lead, was a masterful, horrendously terrifying ordeal dealing with the subject matter in a way that has not been done, in my humble opinion, as well since. And to try to recreate that masterful achievement is both impossible and slightly hubristic, and doomed to failure.<br /><br />As for the final scenes in which the father (Goldwyn) manages to apparently find the keys to the boat, and the safe, nuclear family zoom off down the river (cue credits) was a total wipe-out given what had been established in the earlier part of the film.<br /><br />I will give two examples to illustrate the difference between half-way decent and brilliant achievements in films.<br /><br />The first is Django Unchained (Tarantino), which I consider to be a modern cinematic masterpiece. However, the scenes involving the slave fights and the dogs attacking the runaway slave, amongst many other scenes in the film, were amongst the most difficult to watch and disturbing that I have encountered in a long time.<br /><br />Given his past reputation based on his previous films, Tarantino took a significant risk by boldly tackling such a raw subject, but he pulled it off brilliantly, albeit creating a storm of controversy. But that is exactly my point.<br /><br />The second film I would mention in respect to the depiction of violence is Pasolini's Salo, which I saw once many years ago in a cinema and have never been able to go back to it since.<br /><br />The film's disturbing scenes, and there are many, cannot be described here, however my point is that the director had something original to say and achieved something quite unique that was deeply disturbing and highly artistic at the same time.<br /><br />Of course, I am comparing this movie remake to some of the greatest Directors ever, which is unfair. But it serves to illustrate the point.<br /><br />Perhaps I am being overly pedantic, and I know a lot of people probably have watched this remake and thought it was very well done. On several levels, I would agree. It had a lot going for it, and for Dillahunt's performance alone it is worth seeing.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed how badly the film deteriorated to stock resolutions and some highly unoriginal images that felt in execution (no pun intended) little better than a high-school horror spoof.<br /><br />In summary, there was much in this remake that could have made it great all the way through. It is still better than most of what else is served up as `cinema' these days.<br /><br />But I do long for another film that is quite original and fairly knocks my socks off.<br /><br />One movie that did something quite remarkableand terribly disturbing was The Girl Next Door directed by Gregory Wilson with a brilliant performance by Blanche Baker and terrific supporting cast (definitely not for those with a faint heart - a very disturbing film).<br /><br />The last film that did that for me that I'll mention was No Country for Old Men which was so brilliantly executed that the seamlessness and perfection of every scene made it appear a disarmingly simple plot.<br /><br />The whole point is that truly great films make you think about a whole series of questions/ideas/theories/etc., whereas this remake of The Last House on the Left just left me feeling a tad under sedation.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love every season of How I Met Your Mother and season 8 was great. It's so funny and cute and I feel like there's been a lot more character development for Ted this season.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Downloading the game was easy.i played the game for a while  and it was entertaining, i hope there will be more games for Despicable me soon had fun playing this one.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|Love the game, they make it decently realistic, do not have to buy gems to go through game like others, just hate that suddenly all these ads start poping up!!!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, which wasn't long because I couldn't put it down.  Recommend for sure and can't wait for the next installment.
B008XG1X18|5.0|help with everything you can think of. you are hooked from the very first pin. easy to use and love.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This movie is well made. Keeps the suspense going. Not a boring moment. I enjoyed the story line and the acting.
0525478817|5.0|My 13 year old daughter is not an avid reader.  I was thrilled when she could not put this book down.  We were driving from NJ to North Carolina and she finished the book in the 11 hour drive.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book but didn't love it because I didn't like either of the main characters. They seemed like a couple of miserable people I couldn't relate to.  It was an interesting read with twists and turns which kept me reading and wondering what was coming next.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was weary about reading this at first, it was pretty dry--very British.  But it grew on me and I couldn't put it down.  It's about 2 people that would have never met except for these terrible circumstances.  It's about not giving up and standing up for yourself.  It is about being the best YOU.  It is about love acceptance, and compassion.  It is about living and dying.  A must read.....  I gave away no spoilers.....
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book will keep you up all night, frantically flipping pages as you try to work out the world of Ransom Riggs. Jake's story is one of loss, hope, and self discovery. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a tasteful blend of romance, suspense, and horror fantasy.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I am a great fan of the tv series Dexter, and recently found Jeff Lindsay's books.  They are fantastic!  The series is only loosely based on his books-with some different characters/scenes/murders,etc...  But I just love how the books are being told 1st person by Dexter himself.  They are intense, as well as humorous.  Who else but Lindsay could make you like and root for a serial killer!  I am already on book 3 of 7.  Definitely a great read even if you have never seen the series.  It is a unique perspective on life.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Thoughtful ble so horrible I think I might puke that is bad right I know I hate this book.<br />Yeah me too so horrible it hurt my eye..<br />Dictionary horrible.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addicting and challenging, hard to put down.  Want more rooms added, please.<br />Can't wait for more challenges in the future.  Would recommend to friends.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I have long had an interest in the history of England between the fall of the Roman empire and the time of the Tudor dynasty. I am aware of the affects that the Vikings had on English history, but not that well informed about the Vikings themselves. The creators of this series appear to have done a decent amount of research into Viking culture and the driving forces behind their expansion to the west. While the first season has made a good start, it remains to be seen if the writers can keep it up. One more reason to wish that season 2 was available already.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|When I open the app to play. The sounds are not usual<br />It sounds like a whirring sound...almost like its stuck...<br />I've tried to play different times but still no change.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I really like all of the songs on this cd/album.  I listen to it when I am doing digital scrapbooking.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book. Read it and you will not be disappointed. Have also read Shift Omnibus which was also a great read. Looking forward to the next segement coming out in August.
B00377E5SG|5.0|Five stars, the women in the family totally love this movie. I've now had to watch it more than twice and its tolerable from a Man's perspective. Not going to watch it with my Bros, but hey, its a great movie for watching with your girl.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|great gory horrer film<br />this is no 1980 b blood film this is the best horror film i seen since house of 1000 corpses
B00B2YH7D6|4.0|I was lucky enough to see this at the D.C. premiere and to meet Dave Grohl.  I enjoyed it enough that I just had to buy it.  Entertaining documentary on some historical albums and the people who made them.  I completely agree with the underlying theme that digital recording and processing is degrading how music making process.  If you love music from the 70s and 80s, I don't think you will be disappointed in this movie and soundtrack.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I've had the game for about a week, and I love it. I really didn't like Temple Run, and this game is fairly similar, but I can't get enough Despicable Me! I haven't spent any real money so it's possible I'm proceeding a little slower, but this is not a game that requires the player to spend money to have fun.<br /><br />I'm playing on a Kindle Fire, and I haven't had any issues. My only complaint is that when the game shows you that you need to move your device to move the character (instead of swiping), the graphic stays up for an interminably long time. I was afraid the system wasn't responding. Just be patient. (One time I actually hit the back button to \\"unstick\\" the game.)
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Very smartly written.  Very cheeky humor and great character acting.  I watched it on a plane trip and had the other passengers wondering what I was laughing at.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My 10 year old granddaughter loves this story. It's a little bit spooky, but great fun. Love the animations and the interaction with the reader.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I love the Despicable Me characters so ordered the free version to my Kindle today.  Tried it, and it locked my Kindle up tight, can't do anything on now at all.  So ordered today, CANCELLED today and hopefully it will clear my Kindle.  Very very disappointed.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|PICTURE AND SOUND ARE EXCELLENT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. SORRY FOR GETTING BACK TO YOU SO LATE ON MY REVIEW ON GHOST RIDER ON BLU RAY. BLU RAY IS BETTER FOR BETTER SOUND AND PICTURE. NOBODY AS FAR AS I KNOW CAN BEAT AMAZON SELLER PRICES. THANK YOU WITH 5 STARS!!!
B00CFQMVLS|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a die hard Bruce Willis fan, but this is just all kinds of bad, there's no snappy commentary we've all come to know and love, they blow up about 200 cars for no particular reason, and the plot is non-existent. A disappointing ride for any fan, avoid at all costs.
B00D555BBU|5.0|The app is nice, crisp and clean. Easy to understand and set up. Everything works as it should. Nice job!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Although I haven't seen all of the Marvel movies, I was still able to keep up with the story line.  I do recommend seeing Thor before viewing.  It will give you a better understanding of the prime villain in The Avengers.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Easy photo editor and great for resizing your images to fit any phone screen size. Straight forward and not the best but its simple and it works.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Despite being aimed to a teen audience, it manages to include complex political/ethical issues. This, plus the fast pace reading it has, makes it a good bus/Holliday lecture
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I kept waiting for it pickup... Not enough &#34;Action&#34; for me. Story and plot was, ok. You only need to watch it once.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Who does not love Walter Bishop? Really? You would have to be dead to not love his honest nature. This product like the other seasons of Fringe was ordered at the same time, from the same seller and was shipped as promised. Brand spanking new!! I would go back again and again to purchase stuff from Amazon. I have had more excellent experiences than not. Don't second guess, if you find something you love here. GET IT! Well worth every Penny!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brilliant game that makes you use your brain. Just give me more<br /><br />wondered what to do when I started but soon got the hang of it
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great story line with very good acting. Makes you want to live there. The type of story where you want everything to end well.
B00BATWJFE|5.0|If you are looking for an enjoyable read than the Rosie Project is just for you!<br />It made me laugh, a lot and I would recommend this book to anyone looking to<br />unwind and lose themselves for a few hours in a good book.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|It was an exceptional read. Such an insight to the drug heroin and others. So happy he found sobriety. For himself and his kids.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This was a gift for my sister and she loved the movie.  Also, it didn't take long to get the movie after I placed my order. Very pleased.
0061950726|5.0|The intertwined stories in this book keep you hooked. You want so badly to find out the next piece of Vivian's story! Great historical details about a little known event in the United States' history.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I can't wait until the sequel.  This game was fun and challenging and more than worth its price.  I highly recommend this game.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Not sure if I was brainwashed, but frankly I don't care. The 11th doctors 1rst season is epic. I will miss him in 2014. I'll get over him  easy enough though. You know, wibbly, wobbly, timey wimey and all that STUFF. I do hope I remember him!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Mostly, I kept seeing trailers for the 2nd movie and figured that I needed a little background info, so I decided to watch it on demand. The movie kept me entertained and I loved the dynamic between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louse Parker. Overall, I'd give it a 4.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|OK, I'll admit it, in my middle age, I'm still somewhat a romantic at heart! Or, could it be that I see so much drama around me everyday, that watching this teenage romance novel on screen is a short escape from reality?<br />Either way, I mostly liked, if not enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Host\\" is a slow flowing book, aimed primarily at teenage girls aged 14-19. The movie catches this flow quite nicely. Just like the book, it starts slow and stays that way till the very end. This is NOT and action flick.<br />The scenery is close to the description. I liked the acting by the entire cast, especially Saoirse Ronan and Jake Abel. William Hurt delivers a nice performance (as usual) and fits the part nicely.<br />As a rule, I don't like seeing books on screen. There is an inevitable change of storyline and a loss of characters from the book who are deemed unnecessary to the plot. That, however, doesn't bother me as much as the all-to-often deviation in the characters' physical appearances when compared to the book.<br />What I really didn't like (I'm a stickler for details like this),and this is where the physical appearance of the actor completely deviates from the book, is the choice of Diane Kruger for the role of the Seeker Lacey and Emily Browning for the part of Pat/Wonderer. The total lack of the character \\"Jody\\" also take something away, although not to noticeably.<br />Diane Kruger is a fine, very attractive actress, but she is a 5'11\\" blond, dressed in all white. In the book the \\"seeker\\" is described as a very petite brunette who wares all black<br />Pat is described as a tiny, very frail 16 year old with tons of freckles everywhere. She look like someone you just have to protect.  Mrs Browning is average height, in her mid 20's and relatively wholesome looking.<br />Futuristic scenery of the cities, cars and motorcycles is pretty believable. Since the movie is set in not-so-far future, the appearance of dress and technology is very similar to our own, sothat's a plus.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|Got this as the Amazon free app of the day, I couldn’t pass this up.  Been using it primarily from my tablet, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10”.  Always had a hit or miss problem performing a remote into my PC.  Still had and initial problem but began utilizing the Google account connection option, which got me connected.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|It all started with me blowing up WICKED !  ARGUH ! When will these trials end ? When will we have some answers ? How can they keep killing these few healthy kids off in this world of burn and disease ?  I am at the end of patience, i have pulled out almost all my hair. I don't know who is good, who is bad, who is adjusted, what is adjusted, what is real ?!?!?!?!?!?!?<br />I have been waiting, waiting waiting<br />Thomas, he is lied too, misjudged, tricked, back stabbed, kissed, kicked, shot, drugged.......and that's just the warm up.  He and the gang head off on their new trial across the Scorch, where they get burned, starved, beaten, killed..... yeah it's awful. They don't quit, they trudge forward, holding on to each other and the hope. They meet up with others, they watch friends die, they enter new twists and still they keep going. Who can they trust, what can they trust ? Do they really have any chance ? They questions never seem to be answered. Stressful, that's what this series is. Don't miss it if you love the hunt for the truth.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why haven't you updated minecraft to 0.7.2? I've been waiting for a month now. Please update it. I am not happy that my brother has it but not me.
0765325950|5.0|My mind is numb, and I feel drained. For over a decade, I've been reading this series. And now it's finished - beautifully. I haven't experienced this since the first time I finished the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and other grand fiction sagas. I feel bittersweet and changed like when a long journey ends and you come home finally.<br /><br />Hundreds of reviewers before me have better reviewed this book. There's nothing much to add except I which several stories had been given more depth before their brief conclusions. Also, although the Last Battle is monumental, I wish BS/RJ had done a better job at showing me estimates of enemy numbers as well as defenders.<br /><br />Every battle has a progress bar. This book's description made me feel like playing a video game where the computer just endlessly regenerates enemies. What prevented this from making it boring were the various viewpoints and the changes they experienced. I also appreciated the map of the battlefield so I knew very well how it all played out. Also, some of the obstacles which the heroes (channelers namely) faced seemed contrived when compared to past books.<br /><br />I was miserable at work yesterday. After 12,000+ pages of living in this world, I feel hollow now that it's gone. It's not too different than how characters in WoT feel when the One Power is gone lol. The mundane documents, endless typing and peering at screens, sitting in traffic, and so on... my mind would rather read about Tel'aran'rhiod or the group running for their lives in the Ways from Machin Shin.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Love the story, the way it was written and the history in the story. I felt like I was there and could see what he was writing about.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|This is a boring game.  I didn't find it any different from other boring games.<br />  I deleted it from my kindle.
B0034G4P80|5.0|He was so excited to get this, and I really must thank the vendor for delivering their goods so promptly and at such reasonable prices! Way to go & keep up the good work!
1439153663|5.0|Kathleen Grissom has written an engrossing story for her first novel.  She must have researched extensively in order to write this book.  Characters seem so real.  This is a hard-to-put down book.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This series came quickly and in great shape. I appreciated the vendor's promptness, particularly as it was for my mom's birthday. It was a great gift b/c she was very happ ywith it.
0345525558|5.0|How Vanessa Diffenbaugh was able to describe the life of the protagonist in this book is truly beautiful.  Surely, Diffenbaugh had personal experiences inorder to write about the intensity of emotions.  Most enlightening how Diffenbaugh applied the etiology of flowers to the story.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My mom loves this show, so I was very happy that this DVD arrived in time for her birthday and came at such a reasonable price to boot!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|the idea is great and my daughter loves it but it always freezes. we recently lost all of her houses and pets after playing for approximately 6 mos. because the game wouldn't load and we had to erase it and restart everything
B008JJM88Q|5.0|He knows slender man its realy cool for nabi but you run out of ideas fast he even  tobuscus really good game
B00B2166BS|5.0|Built well and solid. Magnetic strength strong. Definitely charges faster, I would say much faster. Easy to attach and simple to remove. Not much more to say other than a well built product that exceeded my expectations in every way.
B001NA6096|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry...excellent dialogue and realistic awkward moments. Very charming and sweet.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|As always Michael Connelly is a first rate writer and never disappoints . This is my second time through the Harry Bosch series and are just as enjoyable the second time around ! I'll read them again in another few years and will probably write the same review. Great writers always stand the test of time and this series certainly has for me!
B008FWHUQM|4.0|This is an excellent story of how peoples lives can be intertwined if only from the far side of a circle. The title &#34;360&#34; is appropriate. We were drawn to the movie by the named well known stars, but alas their parts are somewhat minor.  All-in-all a good movie and well worth watching.  It does require the viewer to keep up with the plot and connect a few dots along the way.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|I bought this for my daughter because it is one of her favorite movies and she had trouble finding it. Hooray for Amazon!! Fast delivery, too!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I found the subject to be very interesting. The story itself was slow at times. I enjoyed it for the most part.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Can't wait for the next season. I love how they developed each character. This series is very well written. A must watch!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The storyline was cute, but very predictable. There were some mistakes that probably should of been caught and I had to read some sentences a few times before it made sense. All in all a decent read for a free book.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was and is incredibly helpful and I think that students all around the word should have these. How it was written, though, could be more interesting.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Great story line, more twists and plots than the best detective novels. A no holds barred look at what life would have been like at a similar time in our history, except of course for the dragons and other mythical creatures.<br />Pity that we still have to wait for the last two books, hope George R R Martin will not take another ten years to complete the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the twists and turns. Kept me engaged the entire way through. I would recommend this book to friends and family.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  It is very addicting. I like it better than some of the other games like candy crush
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love the characters in the show, and the story just gets more interesting and make you not able to stop watching!
B000SW2F80|4.0|Bought on BD as a DVD replacement and it held up well after not seeing it for a couple of years.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Absorbing whodonits; set in the beautiful city if Edinburgh, Scotland, each episode features several interconnected mysteries involving unsolved murders or the hunt for missing persons. The common element in each is the main character, detective Jackson Brodie (played superbly by Jason Isaacs), whose innate compassion and tragic childhood history compel him to bring home the lost.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Buying things from the store sucks. I keep buying and not getting items. Other than that me and my kids love the game. G ave it on phone and tablet.
B008Y5UADK|5.0|I really loved this movie...Social Phobia is an illness the most people don't understand..The connection with the numbers was very interesting.You really have to pay attention when watching.It will keep you thinking way after watching it.Great acting!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoy reading, enjoy it more now that I can read without carring around a big book, never thought I would like reading romantic novels such as these, but now that I have been introduced, I love them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a very entertaining game. Also a bit frustrating at times, trying to find everything. Took me a bit to figure out what to do, but once I did, I liked it more.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought Fifty Shades was great and I think so far this is very good, too.  I will buy the next one and I think I will enjoy it, too, and now I find out that this is also a trilogy.  I will read them all.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I love this app. Sometimes I have hard time relaxing and I love this program because I can add what I want to hear I have a lot of  different options of what I want to hear.  Most things like this actually gets on my nerves, but this is very soothing. I love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I did not know what to think of this at first.  Never read such a novel before.  My daughter recommended it to me to read for my enjoyment.  And yes, I did.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I love this show I cant for more to come out.very  very very goo ahahahahahahahah jj aja aj aja aj
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Same as review of Fifty Shades Freed.  The continuation of the story lines were wonderful, couldn't wait until I could read the final of the trilogy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It captured my imagination so much that when I visit England next month I am going to visit Highclere Castle (Downton Abbey)
B003TOH8AE|4.0|If bad language and violence makes you squirm this is not a good movie but it doesn't bother me as much as it does some people.  This movie shows how much one person can make a difference if they tap into their inner super-hero.  Physically fighting crime, of course, should only be attempted by the highly trained and by someone not afraid to have to kill to save their own life.  There is a lot of action and good comedy.  I like entertaining movies and this one had me entertained!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This is a short but powerful look at man's place in this world and the human struggle to find inner peace and happiness.  Only to find out that peace is found within.  But the journey is filled with many trials and tribulations.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The author comes of sounding cocky to the point of arrogant, but that is not unexpected with a member of the special forces.  They deserve to be cocky.  The thing about this book that I really liked was how the author's wife's views were interspersed throughout the book.  That gave it a different perspective which I enjoyed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This App is So very easy to use on any device. I love it. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE.
B003G4W49C|3.0|This book was quite ordinary until you get to the end of the story, and then there is a wonderfully interesting twist.  So, hang with this book to the end, and the payoff should be worth it for you.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I adore Good Omens so I've been reading through all of Gaiman's other works. I wish I had started with this one because it is awesome. Very funny and off beat and scary.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I was amazed that this was a very good movie. My wife, my two sons and I all agreed that this was an excellent pick.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I find the information accurate and timely. Some times it takes longer to load but most if the time there is no problem.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game its fun to play with my toddler also doesn't ask for money and Can earn gems easy
B006S01GH2|5.0|I'm not wordy, so I'lll just say that this is a wonderful film, with great character development and plot twists!  I expected the guys in my living room to fall asleep or leave the room, but they didn't!  How's that for an endorsement?
B00DU74U74|4.0|I read the book and this followed closely,  its entertainment for the whole family, but teens will like it the best
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's entertaining just dislike having to buy bucks to get some dinos and what not<br />But it keeps me an  fiance busy
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I enjoy playing this game... however, since I usually only play games while I am in the subway on the way to work, it pisses me off that occasionally at seemingly random intervals when you first start the app it will try to look for an update, and not allow you to open the app if there is no internet connection. This is bulls***! Why should I be forced to look for an update before I am able to continue to use the app? I have to wait until I am out of the subway to open the game so that it can look for the update, that usually does not exist, so that I can continue using the app...<br /><br />I wish DEVs would stop doing stupid s*** like that... don't they realize that many people are only using these apps to pass time on their commute to work in public transportation, and normally do not have a signal during this time..
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Everyone needs a Travis in their life. This book has so many twist and turns. The epic conclusion still leaves you wanting more.
B0090SI4LU|1.0|If you have read the book, DO NOT watch this movie, you will never get it out of your head.  First, the person who selected the womens shoes in this movie should never be allowed near a movie again.  They were ridiculous.  Second, they should have made 2 movies.  They left too much out that were necessary parts of the story.  It was so sad to see it so butchered.  Third, they went and screwed up the last line.  It should be \\"native\\", not \\"switched sides\\".<br /><br />This was one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I have ever seen, and I've seen Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls.  Stephanie Meyer better watch out, she's going to be an even bigger joke then the Twilight series already made her.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old version was easy to use and provided the weather info I wanted.  The new version is worse than useless.  I am about to delete.  Did the weather channel ever hear of udsbility?
B00DU74U74|5.0|I would watch it again. I was very impressed with how well it followed the book. that was pretty cool.
B003VANOFY|1.0|In an area such as an apartment complex or dorm, you'll have quite a bit of wireless traffic.  This causes a lot of interference with the headset and so audio will cut out or crackle.  I suggest only buying this if you live in an area without heavy wireless traffic, such as a single family home or townhouse.  The software provided does not allow you to change the wireless channel, so you are stuck on that channel and it will get interference.  Logitech support says to change the channel on your router, but you can't get your neighbors to do that.  It's 2013 and this headset won't let you pick a wireless channel that is open.  I'll be returning this when I return from the SR-2 Normandy.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|A little smaller than expected but the boys love it. Easy to inflate, move around the yard with water in it and kept them both entertained.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. VERY addicting. My kindle hasn't seen as much of me since angry birds. Thank you Amazon for this game!!
B00DU74U74|2.0|William Hurt was doing someone a favor - not even &#34;made-for-TV&#34; quality, and obviously very low budget.  I can't even come up with 3 more words to describe something so &#34;vanilla&#34; and amateurish.
B00D5UMV5E|4.0|it was good .. had some good action but some where just missed the mark of being great.. did love watching it though and now own it and will watch it over an over.. I love the whole collection
B009NY43NY|3.0|It wasn't as bad as I heard. It was a bit confusing because Harris added chapters NOT in Sookie's point of view, but as mystery characters instead. I liked how it ended, but it lacked the suspense I have come to expect from other Sookie books.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I LOVE this one .. husband almost gets tired of me watching it lmao.. I do like who played his daughter and the guy Bruce rescued ... great casting job guys awesome movie
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Wandering around a WHSmith bookstore in Central Milton Keynes in England, I was an American looking for a book to read, something familiar that would please my Yankee palate. I picked up Killing Floor by Lee Child, prepared to put it down just as casually as I had picked it up.<br />Debut novel it said on the jacket. I bought it and took it home to Wavendon House, where I was living at the time. I didn't put this book down until I'd turned the last page. Loved it! I told my husband, you have to read this book, it's amazing. He loved it! I couldn't wait for Mr. Child's next novel to come out.<br />I have been a fan of Mr. Child from the time I read the opening chapter of his book, the new book, I'd been fortunate enough to stumble upon on a rainy afternoon in Milton Keynes, England. Lee Child can't write them fast enough for me...then or now.  Reviewed by Shelley Riley author of [[ASIN:1482679248 Casual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure]]
0783225547|5.0|A true LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie.. have had it and lost it like 3 times in my moves and soon as I realize it isn't in my collection run to get it .. got 2 of my nephews to love this also and got the older one a copy of his own for his birthday
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Works well on my kindle HD, no lag or frozen screens whenever I have a good internet connection.  Oh yeah, it was free too.....
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The classic story of boy meets girl, girl brings boy to another reality, boy brings back a great evil, girl saves boy.  A beautifully written story about growing up and losing the magic of childhood.
0060531053|5.0|This was the first book I got when I began homebrewing. It is an excellent primer and even now after 20 years still refer back to it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I played this on the Pc once an loved it now that I own it on my kindle I'm a addict it so much better it's perfected here.

B003UV8TFE|5.0|This book book quenches my thirst for knowledge in a brilliant pedagogical way! It's informative and amusing at the same time.<br /><br />I sincerely thank you Prof. Walter Lewin for getting me to search for rainbows.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun and not disappointing also has lots of fun things to do on it fun.. Lol it is really fun
B00005B602|5.0|Ahh what a great movie and what a great soundtrack! Makes you want to book a one way flight to France with a nice bottle of white wine to keep you company....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Do not get this app for kids that can not read.It is really fun otherwise. But you do have to buy money if you want. ALSO YOU HAVE TO PLAY FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE YOU RUN OUT OF ENERGY.<br />It is a great app!!!!!!!!!!  :)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Echoing the other reviewers - big enough to carry all my equipment (DSLR, multiple lenses, lens hoods, flash, accessories.  Way better than a traditional camera bag - of which I have plenty.  Quality construction.  Zero issues.
