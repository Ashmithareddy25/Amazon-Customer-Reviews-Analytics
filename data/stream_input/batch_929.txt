B00001QEE7|5.0|I was upset to find that the Little Mermaid was no longer available in stores, so I was thrilled to find it here.  While it may seem a little pricey for a kids DVD, my daughter loves it so much that it has already paid for itself.  It's as wonderful of a movie as I remember from my childhood, with all the memorable songs.  I'm glad that I got a chance to pass this movie on to my daughter.  The colors seem brighter on the re-released version, but that may be because my tape was about 20 years old.  A worthwhile addition to your collection, as it is a classic Disney movie the whole family can enjoy.
1881273156|5.0|As a dating and relationship expert, I love and frequently recommend Gary Chapman's \\"The Five Love Languages\\" to client as part of their reading list.  I'm always amused when I hear some people say something like, \\"Oh everyone knows this stuff\\" or something like that.  And I think, \\"Oh really?\\"<br /><br />Then why are there so many relationships, pastoral counseling, premarital counseling, marital counseling and couples counseling issues all about what Gary Chapman covers in \\"The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate?\\"  So often people have bits and pieces of knowledge, and yet they do not know to use in in their daily conversations with their loved ones.  Spouses who are squabbling and the surface it looks like it's about the circumstance.  When in reality, each is not *feeling* loved and heard by their spouse.<br /><br />There are many wonderful reviews here already at Amazon.  I just had to add my two bits and chime in on what an excellent resource this is for couples.  I know a number of churches who require this for engaged couples as they are planning their weddings.  In fact, it makes a wonderful engagement present when a couple of any age announced their nuptials.  The book has lots of PRACTICAL exercises in it, making it a useful reference guide not only now but also going forward into their marriage over the course of many years.<br /><br />I wonder what the divorce rate would be like if more couples were given this guide when engaged and did the exercises together and reviewed them over the course of their marriage?  Divorce lawyer costs avoided.  Broken families.  All the emotional and economic expense of Divorce, the toll on children.  Give this to your friends early in their relationship so they have the romantic toolkit with them for the Marriage Journey now.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Normally every PORCUPINE TREE album has a song that amazes you so much, that whatever isn't working on the album doesnt seem to matter. I've listened to THE INCIDENT over and over, and I'm just beginning to hear the key songs, TIME FLIES, and DRIVE THE HEARSE.  Steve Wilson's lyrics normally, for all their obscurity and surreal polish, find a way to work their magic, bringing his dark imagery to life within the soul. On THE INCIDENT, the lyrics are good, but at times too obscure, when they should be emotionally evocative. For a song cycle with concepts beyond purely musical themes, that can be a problem. AT least Steve had the sense to put his strongest song of the set at the end of the song cycle, \\"I DRIVE THE HEARSE\\". (There must be an inner competetiveness between PORCUPINE TREE, and THE DECEMBERISTS, who also just released an album that was one big song cycle.) The concept that ties everything together, is our mortality, and the passages of life that lead to death. This a 2CD set, because four of the songs aren't part of the \\"song cycle\\", which smacks of pretensiousness. All the songs here add up to about 74 minutes, so the second CDs isnt nessacary, and certainly not \\"Eco-friendly\\". Doesn't Steve trust his audience to stop the CD when the song cycle ends?  Strange. But he's a strange cat.<br /><br />Still, its a good album by any standards. THe OPUS opens with a couple of these HARD ROCK GUITAR CHORDS, only to let ambience, and sonic drones lead the listener to meditation. That is the connecting theme, and as a link piece repeats three times in total. TRACK TWO is a hard rock song which is far from the album's best. TRACK THREE is acoustic, minor keyed, and lovely. TRACK FOUR starts with a heavy guitar CHORD section, as we are told that \\"the Hero\\" is TAKING CONTROLL. The verse sections are soft acoustic playing, the chorus sections hard and heavy. The moog playing is phenominal, as you expect from Barbieri's playing. TRACK SIX has that NIN sound to it, lots of electronica swirling around, creating a dark intermezzo for the piece. TRACK SEVEN (Your Unpleasant Family) is ironically funny, with the lyric \\"Your unpleasant family just smashed up the car.\\" Like all the songs, it transistions seemlessly into a instrumental piece that evokes the first song, the THEME. The theme is repeated, in order to frame one of the best songs, and the statement of the central theme of the piece, TIME FLIES.  If this song reminds me of any of their older work, its STARS DIE. In fact, STARS DIE and TIME FLIES not only rhimes, if you sing the one song on top of the other, you discover their simularity. The song cycle has a point, TEMPUS FUGET, and we all know that. At nearly twelve minutes, this is not only the longest song, it also is the closest to a \\"Classic\\" sounding PORCUPINE TREE song, if such a monster exists. Minor chords with jazz extensions are arpeggiated, with ominous keyboards drapped over the soundscape, setting up a guitar lead that can levatate boulders. As the instrumental passage develops, its hard NOT to love. After this song, you get THE OPENING THEME again, since it's used as a frame, for key songs that develop the songcycle's inner meaning.  The poetic themes of a crazy family, a mundane life, our ultimate mortal ending, and the lack of ability to ever truly communicate approach their conclussion. OCTANE TWISTED (TRACK ELEVEN) moves out of the \\"theme\\", and into another prog hard rock song. The lyrics are very opaque, tho death and yearning for life underscore THE INCIDENT's theme well enough. THE SEANCE muses over death's mirror of a parallel universe of life. Here the album REALLY sounds fantastic, and beautiful. The next short linking track, is somewhat like TRACK SIX. Its the last time HARD CHORDS are used, it's instrumental, and frames the beautiful final song of the cycle, I DRIVE THE HEARSE.  The songcycle is about LIFE's inevitable connection to DEATH. Our bodies are a hearse we drive from our birth to our mortality.We can DRIVE THE HEARSE, by deciding to bring our mortality into our daily awareness.  Of any of THE INCIDENT's songs, this is the one that I'm listening to repeatedly.  The problem with a song cycle that's nearly an hour long, is that one is unlikely to absorb the message all at once. Compaired to PORCUPINE TREE's first concept album, VOYAGE 34, about an LSD trip, THE INCIDENT is much more satisfying, and ultimately more successful, as a concept album.<br /><br />The other CD has four well made, cool songs on it as well. . The first song on CD 2 is FLICKER, a beautiful, slow paced number, mostly instrumental.  BONNIE THE CAT is a hard rock song, at least in part, but the lyric has a deep, suggestive ambiguity to it, elevating these words to poetry, as is so often the case with Steve Wilson's composistions. Steve whispers  lyrics that are creepy and frightening, until the lead begins, where whispered guitars bleeding non-melodic lines slowly transform to melodic beauty once more, tho its a cold, minor melody. This song is deeply indebted to the drummer's recent work with KING CRIMSON, for its asymetrical beat groupings.  Even the keyboard parts have a miasmic, chthonic quality to them.  After that song, comes BLACK DAHLIA, one of the best songs I've heard by Porcupine Tree. The theme of this song, and its sound, would have made it a logical part of the song cycle on CD ONE.  Lots of dreamy, drone like guitar lines set off vocals that echo away into infinity. Just as the song captures you, its over. At 3:40, it's just TOO SHORT. CD two ends with a long piece (7:28), that starts out quiet and moody, but breaks into a harder rock song around 2 minutes in, becoming almost like Nine Inch Nails, shortly after that. Sonic dynamics that pull together acoustic whispers and distorted electric screams, producing another PT classic.  If one song could encapsulate this album's \\"sound\\", I might say REMEMBER ME LOVER does so.  Like so much of PORCUPINE TREE's music, it has to develop inside of you over a period of time.  Maybe in a couple of years, this album will sound trite, or the turning point where the band didnt have anything else to say, and remained quiet. Perhaps it's a holding pattern CD, or even a masterpiece we don't \\"get\\".  The ambiguity of the songs, even stretches to the overall quality of the whole CD.  Even if its not a great album, its a very good album, a successful experiment, and should be explored by fans. I'd be happy to give this FOUR AND A HALF STARS, if possible.DRIVE THE HEARSE, by deciding to bring our mortality into our daily awareness.

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|My family loves this show and watch the re-runs on cable tv as often as we can. Because we enjoy it so much we have begun collecting the entire series (seasons 1-7). Some of these seasons, as a collection, are pretty expensive. When we found this season at this price we had to have it. We received it days before we expected, in perfect shape, and were able to watch the special features immediately. The commentaries, cast roundtables, ducky's world, going behind the scenes to see what goes into making this hit was so much fun. We love all the characters and their stories as they are revealed starting with season 1. If you're a fan of NCIS we recommend buying this product. You'll love it as much as we do.
B002R5V7MG|5.0|A note to L. Crist and a thank you for his insights.  I am a double bassist and also teach the instrument.  So I can share your point of view.  I am also a Mahler addict.  The performance was electrifying, and this young man brought out portions of the Mahler 1 that I didn't even know where there. As often as I've heard this symphony, the young maestro's approach was so intense, so passionate, and so obviously carefully studied that it was as if I were hearing this masterpiece for the first time.  I also agree that the sound engineering at the time of live recording leaves much to be desired, and I hope that over the next 2 months before the DVD is released (I've already gotten my name in for a copy) an \\"orchestra savvy\\" engineer will take over the controls.      Are we looking at a future Bernstein?
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Wow, I am late to watch this movie, but wow! I had no idea that this movie would be so good. There have been so many mixed reviews that I shied away, but now that I have finally seen it I am dumbfounded. The level of acting in this movie was astounding! I felt for the characters and they sucked me into thier story. Now I can understand why a lot of people will dislike this movie, because it is a very melancholy movie, BUT the depth of the story just enchanted me. I like the fact that story is based around doubt, because if you think about it, haven;t we all accused someone unjustly because we are certain when it might not be true? I guess for me this story just hit a note in my heart. This movie will be on my top for a long time to come!
0671015206|5.0|The book of the week was The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko. Both authors are Ph.D.s and stumbled across some fascinating research which they based this book around. The two surveyed and interviewed thousands of millionaires to figure out what the living habits of the average millionaire really are.<br /><br />Some Shocking Statistics about these Millionaires:<br /><br />-The average taxable income for them is $131,000<br />-They live on less than 7 percent of their wealth<br />-Many of their occupations could be classified as dull-normal such as: welding contractor, auctioneer, mobile-home owner, paving contractor, coin and stamp dealer<br />-They invest on average nearly 20% of their household income<br />-Most of them are homeowners (97 percent) and their average home value is $320,000<br />-80% of millionaires today are first generation millionaires<br /><br />That last statistic was shocking to me. There is a huge misconception in society about the wealthy. The media portrays the wealthy as a legacy of the rich, one generation just passes it on to the next and the idea of getting there is represented as just a pipe-dream. The fact that 80% of the millionaires surveyed were first generation millionaires should really open someone's eyes to the possibility of being a millionaire an accessible dream. The other thing the media skews about the wealthy is the living habits. They show millionaires spending money like it's going out of style. They have great big mansions, fancy cars, and more toys than any adult really needs. Real millionaires don't spend like this. The media loves to cover the abnormal... that is why they cover crime, lottery winners, celebrities and so on and so forth. This book does a great job of laying out what a T.V. show about the average millionaire would look like. Just think of it... a man with a slightly above average career, diligently focuses on his finance and investing habits, living below his means, and double checking his budgets before he spends even a $500 on a new television. Not the most interesting T.V. show, however, that is what that average millionaire does.<br /><br />No matter how much money you make there is one golden rule to accumulating wealth... ready for it?... Live below you means! If you have $5000 coming in each month after taxes then do your best to live on $4000 and then invest the rest. This is the only sure fire \\"get rich quick scheme\\"... and it really works. Throughout this blog I give tips on what may make a good investment and why, but you will surely fail investing and accumulating wealth if you do not have the first step completed... live below you means. The average millionaire spends over twice as much time budgeting and analyzing their own spending habits than the average non-millionaire. So focus on not only what money is coming in, but also pay just as close attention, if not more, on the money going out.<br /><br />Being frugal pays big... A lot of these millionaires are just your average blue-collar entrepreneurial Americans and the way they made it to financial freedom is through frugality. They spend much less on their cars than non-millionaires... in fact the average millionaire buys 3 year old cars. At that point they have a lot of the first 30k miles bugs worked out and they still ride like a new car, but at 75% off the original price. There is no reason to finance out your life... Getting over your head in debt just amounts to unneeded stress and a bunch of \\"in-the-moment\\" toys. You can only keep up with the Jones' so long before you realize you are 50 years old with no retirement and just lots of cars, toys, and a big house with no equity. I don't mean to be too brash, but I want everyone to understand the importance of living below/within your means. The alternative is living well off with equity in several properties, a couple reliable cars, travel the world retire early, have the ability to teach financial discipline toyour children and live without a lot of unneeded stress!<br /><br />The book is very interesting and is well written especially taking in account it was written around research. Sometimes research-based books have the tendency to be boring. The Millionaire Next Door has it all right... great data and great case studies to reinforce the main points. Pick it up... I'm sure you'll discover a few helpful tidbits to increase your net-worth and put you on the track to being a millionaire. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.The book is very interesting and is well written especially taking in account it was written around research.

B001U0HBPG|2.0|I am sorry Brad Pitt, but this was wholy dissapointing. I guess if you look at the acting, I woudl say it was a good movie, but when you look at everything, it just bored. The story was interesting and worth-while, BUT there was no climax and no excitement. I guess nto every movie needs a giagntic fireworks and bombs climax, but really? I felt like I was watchign a doctor try to revive a dead patient....it just wasn't happening. All in all this movie realllllly failed to impress me.
0688014291|4.0|I read another classic book among fortune 500 companies, The One Minute Manager by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson. I was happy with this book. It is exactly what is says it is.... a book that focuses on skills of a great manager and more specifically centered around the idea that the skills can be done in one minute.<br /><br />The book is written in a fictional story format, however, the principles can also explained in a list format which is what I will focus on for this week's blog. The three key tools used by the manager in this book were The One Minute Goal Setting, The One Minute Praising, and The One Minute Reprimand.<br /><br />The One Minute Goal Setting- Each employee writes down their goals on about half a page. Something that can be read in 1 minute if needed. I think having goals is the best way to make big things happen. You will have a hard time getting someone from point A to point B if they don't know what or where either one of those points are... so help your team set goals.<br /><br />The One Minute Praising- You need to praise your people... The one thing humans crave more than anything on Earth is attention. When you give people attention for doing good things, they want to do more good things. Praising is one of the most affective and simple ways to get a person to do something. Take, for example, a baby, when they are getting ready to take their first steps. At first they may get up and stumble the first time and hit the ground, but parents are around to cheer them on and give them big hugs for their attempt. Then the next day the baby liked that treatment, so they try again... after a few times the baby actually takes their first full steps and is given more praise than ever before! Then the parents use the same \\"management strategy\\" to encourage the first words out of a baby, then good grammar, great driving habits, and before you know it you have a full grown kid living in Minneapolis, working 60 hours a week, starting a real estate business and writing a book blog in his little free time.<br /><br />The One Minute Reprimand- This book's One Minute Manager uses the technique of watching for his employees to do the \\"right thing.\\" However, when he saw something that was below their ability they would get a reprimand because he wanted to reinforce that they could do better. This is one of the most difficult skill sets to master as a management professional. It is difficult because you need to reprimand a behavior and not the person.<br /><br />The book gave a clever story of a couple trying to train their dog to do it's business outside. When the dog made an accident on the rug the couple would take the dog and shove it's face in it and then throw him out the window in the kitchen into the backyard. The couple asked if this was a good technique and they were told they were just training their dog to jump out the window after it had an accident on the rug. People, like animals, need to know the ultimate goal before they can try to replicate it. Humans are easier to train than animals because we speak the same language. Once the person knows what the goal is they will try to make it happen for their craved praising. And if you know they have the ability to reach that goal and they intentionally fall short it may be time for a reprimand.<br /><br />Leading people is a very important skill set! I can't stress how much it can make your life and the lives of those around you more successful. To lead people you just need to leave the bread crumbs... just like the child we were training in the analogy earlier... once the baby was able to walk you don't jump up and down every time they walk for the rest of their lives. You go on to the next skill you would like to train them on... after they have all the skills you are able to train them on they will go on to be as good or better than you... and that is what we want of those around us right? To live great big successful lives? And doing this will make your life easier.... if you train someone to do everything you know how to do, you have an easier load because you have employees that are capable of handling all the responsibilities that at one time were all on your shoulders. Great managers have much more available time than poor managers...<br /><br />This book has a great story that can really impact a management professional or anyone that wants a little help with leading people. It's a very quick read and written by the same author of the book Who Moved My Cheese which was a great hit on this blog. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.<br />[...].ing you know how to do, you have an easier load because you have employees that are capable of handling all the responsibilities that at one time were all on your shoulders.

1596912863|2.0|Seriously, I don't even know why I bother to read any P&P sequels, prequels, re-tellings, or books \\"inspired\\" by P&P. They all end up being a complete and utter nonsense (with the exception of \\"Bridget Jones' Diaries\\"). \\"Austenland\\" is no exception, unfortunately.<br /><br />The premise of the book is OK. 33-year old Jane Hayes is single and obsessed with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" Mr. Darcy (just like you are, admit it, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this review). She inherits a 3-week vacation to \\"Austenland\\" - an English estate where guests get a taste of Austen-time living (and maybe romance) with the help of local actors. Jane agrees to the journey hoping to make it her farewell to Darcy fantasy and to move on with her life afterward. What follows is a chick-lit story with a vague directionless plot, a luke-warm romance, and a contrived plot \\"twist.\\"<br /><br />The story never really takes off IMO, the book is void of real humor or passion, the heroine's inner thoughts and tribulations are hard to understand or follow. In the end, you fail to understand even if this Austenland trip is helpful or not: does it help you to cure your Darcy addiction by exposing the dullness of 19th-century living? or does it enhance it by experiencing a Darcy-like romance (which IMO makes the entire place seem like a some kind of expensive role-playing brothel)? I guess I'll never know...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the book isn't a complete disaster. There are some entertaining moments, but to be honest, I probably wouldn't have finished it were I not listening to it.<br /><br />Speaking of the audio, I think it is reasonable to expect from a person who narrates a book set in England to be able to do some English accent. The narrator of this book couldn't do English accent to save her life! It was rather sad actually...

B00164EAC8|2.0|Godzilla is popular all over the world.  But this is not Godzilla.  This is Hollywood's attempt at making a movie in a franchise they didn't understand.  As a dinosaur movie, it is a big budget movie with a low b plot, but might be acceptable if they didn't claim it was Godzilla.  If you either don't like the original Godzilla or have never seen it, you might enjoy this movie.  But if you know the real Godzilla, this movie can make you wince whenever you even see the cover art.  It is not faithful to the original.    The original Japanese Godzilla was a force of nature that was unstoppable and outside man's power, unless unthinkably terrible means were used to end that force of nature.  Means so terrible that the creator must destroy himself so that others less wise would not destroy the world using them.  Later, Godzilla transformed into a force of nature humans struggled against but failed, and were left wondering if they should have ever tried fighting it in the first place.  Godzilla is an earthquake, a volcano and a typhoon; something you simply can't defeat no matter how powerful you think you are.    This Godzilla is a stupid animal that man overcomes through intellect.  It reminds me of the 1950's Hollywood monster movies where radiation creates an army of giant insects which end up being wiped out by human power.  That was b material back then, and it is low b material now.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|\\"Paranormal Activity\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: After a young, middle class couple moves into what seems like a typical suburban \\"starter\\" tract house, they become increasingly disturbed by a presence that may or may not be demonic, but is certainly most active in the middle of the night. Especially when they sleep. Or try to.    The cast led by Katie Featherston (as Katie) & Micah Sloat (as Micah) is great! The directing and film editing by Oren Peli is excellent! The casting by Ricki Maslar is great!    This is another \\"Blair Witch\\" like movie that is excellent! This is a fun and fast-paced ride that will keep you thinking and on the edge of your seat until the very end. This is one of the best horror films of the year, up there with \\"Drag Me To Hell\\" (2009).

B002KAOSEW|1.0|Having read all the previous Reacher novels, and loving them for the most part, this one is awful...<br /><br />I kept reading it hoping that the plot would get interesting, but all that happened is that the ex-MP that we have come to know and love in previous books starts spouting Nancy Pelosi/Cindy Sheehan leftist drivel.<br /><br />The author should either keep his anti-American, anti-soldier politics to himself or invent a new character that he can write pacifist novels for.  I hope that he gets back to writing Jack Reacher as a good guy and leaves the politics out of it...<br /><br />and if you love Reacher novels and haven't yet read this one, just move along to tne next one... there can't be two bad ones in a row can there?
0920668372|5.0|This is a sweet bedtime book that touches my heart every time I read it to my children - both my husband and I always find it hard to finish without choking up a little at the end!  My two girls are 2 and 4 and don't understand yet why mommy finds it hard to read those last couple of pages!  But seriously, this is a wonderful book for children and adults alike.  For those who found it 'creepy', my only comment is that you're not supposed to take every part of the story literally.  Yes, it would be strange if a mother drove across town to her adult son's apartment, climbed a ladder and snuck in.  This part is supposed to represent his memories and not actual events.  Bascially, the story is supposed to touch a different part of you - not just your brain.

1595141979|5.0|To be honest... I am quite fascinated by vampires since I am 8 or 9. And last year it kind of really jumped out with the \\"Twilight\\" film. I bought the books, literally sucked them in and was sad when they were done. So I was looking around and found House of Nights and Vampire Academy - I decided to give both of them a try.    I read House of Nights first and I was like... 'Ok, that is all very predictable...' - I wasn't too gone on it but probably would have liked it as a Teenager.    Then I read Vampire Academy and absolutely loved it. Even though the main character Rose is 17 she seems a lot more grown up and obviously can't get enough of Dimitri. I ordered the 2nd one, Frostbite and afterwards was horrified when I found out I had to wait 4 weeks for the last 2 books to arrive.    I finally got them this week and I read Shadow Kiss in 2 days. I absolutely love it when an author can create a world that the reader doesn't want to leave. And Richelle Mead has created such a world. And especially this book, which thank god has more pages than the 1st and 2nd one, is very exciting and I couldn't put it away at all.    Can't wait to find out more what happens in Blood Promise and wonder if there will be a happy end after all...?[[ASIN:1595141979 Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy, Book 3)]][[ASIN:1595142711 Vampire Academy Collection]]

0385504225|2.0|Robert Langdon is fast losing his appeal as the leading character of this series. About two-thirds of the way through the book you just wish he would shut up and quit philosophizing and moralizing about every insignificant fact behind a symbol or a architectural flourish. I understand Dan Brown compiled a lot of research as he was writing this book, but he doesn't have to dump ALL of it on us. Also, he has absolutely NO role in the last 40 pages of the book. He just serves as a foil for the other major characters to tell him--what, exactly? I don't remember, because none of it seemed important or relevant.<br /><br />Anyway, the characters are pretty stupid because they are all duped by one villain. He is able to get into the most secure places in the nation's capitol by impersonating others and improvising. He's supposed to be the incarnation of evil, but there's no depth to a characterization like that. The revelation at the end of his real identity is hard to swallow as well.<br /><br />Once the book picks up pace (150 pages into it!), it doesn't take long to lose steam, and Brown fills the book with unnecessary flashbacks, sometimes flashing back to a single event from multiple points of view. It bogs the story down and makes an already long read much too long. Most of the book takes place over 8 hours, but it takes 20 hours to read it. There's something wrong with that.<br /><br />The stuff about Noetics is interesting, but it doesn't seem to have any bearing whatsoever on the plot until the last 20 pages, and even then it's a stretch. When Katherine spouts off for 10 pages about how every single human on Earth is his own God and that's what ancient texts like the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita are \\"coded\\" to tell us, I wanted to throw the book down, but I was so close to the end I suffered through it. It's supposed to act as the great climactic revelation--like the offspring of Jesus from the Da Vinci Code--but it comes off as artificial and as prosleytizing.
B002GMNLLA|5.0|Lets face it if your even interested in this album you are into the extreme side of the Metal universe. If your seeking something unrelentingly heavy and/or the most brutal album ever created I would advise looking into Behemoth's new album [[ASIN:B002DKF47O Evangelion]]. Across The Dark definitely has the heaviness you seek but also slows things down a bit utilizing dark (bordering on the edge of gothic at times) arrangements to add more structure to the songs rather then a complete barrage of chaotic riffing.<br /><br />If your not scared away then there is a lot here you should/will enjoy. Insomnium have always been in the Melodic Death camp but this, there latest release further defines there want to experiment with the melodic side of their music. The opening track 'Equivalence' begins with some very tranquil guitar and bass, the drums kick in and some soft whispering is heard as the programmed arrangements fade in and soon the guitars strike up. The opener leads directly into the second track (a personal favorite) 'Down With The Sun'.<br /><br />The second track definitely has a slower paced tempo not unheard by various Doom Metal groups but the guitars keep a faster pace not unlike that of the 90's Melo Death bands utilized. It is truly difficult to place this in any specific Sub Genre but that is where the power of this album lies, it stands on its own rather then follow others foot steps. Moving on the third track picks up the pace with far more up tempo guitars and head bang worthy riffing. 'Where The Last Wave Broke' also is the first track to offer some clean vocals to add to the atmosphere of the chorus.<br /><br />'Against The Stream' follows as yet another faster paced track showcasing some of my favorite lead guitars on the album. Ville & Ville deserve special credit as the guitars on Across The Dark steal the show and are easily the backbone of the album. Whether it be the subtle melodic Acoustics to the roaring leads these two show amazing chemistry and musicianship. In case you are wondering why this album has such a short track listing, the following track would be the first reason 'The Lay Of Autumn' clocks in at 9:10 and is by far (in my opinion) the best track on the album.<br /><br />From the melodic acoustics and subtle atmospheric arrangements to the amazing soloing and impressive drum work this track (The Lay Of Autumn) truly showcases all that the band aimed for on this album and is a must hear for anyone even remotely intrigued. 'Into The Woods' is a roller coaster of low to mid paced tempos and some of the finest song structure on the album and some of my favorite lyrics. Speaking of which Across The Dark has easily some of the best written lyrical content the band has released to date, surprisingly they are also some of the most positive lyrics by the group as well.. Here is an example as heard on the track 'Into The Woods'...<br /><br />\\"Now close your eyes<br />And open your weary heart<br />Let me soothe away the woes<br />Of fiendish world...\\"<br /><br />\\"As will the sun bathe the land<br />In its warming light<br />So shall the moon ascend<br />To guide the day to wane<br />In turn the rain to hush<br />The tumult of this world<br />And the wind to rise,<br />Sigh a lullaby in trees\\"<br /><br />Yes, there are many darker passages on the album but the band seemed to level out the dark and lighter parts of the album showing they are getting more creative in the writing department and not afraid to experiment. The closer of the album 'Weighted Down With Sorrow' begins as easily one of the most tranquil tracks on the album with some eerie arrangements accented with the albums trademark acoustics. The song soon twists into an anthematic mid paced rocker with another break to acoustics and some more quality leads.<br /><br />After listening to this album and really criticizing the music and putting serious thought to it I have come up with only one other band that really has a true similarity. Though I may get flogged by fans I have to admist that Insomnium and Opeth both have a similar grasp on leveling the heaviness with the melodic atmosphere. Even the growled vocals have similarities and the lyrical content is just as intelligent. I am not saying one band is cloning the other, simply that fans of this may also enjoy Opeth's various works.<br /><br />All in all I consider this easily one of the best releases of 2009 and a must hear for fans of bands that utilize a more melodic approach to Extreme music. As previously said the Guitars are a definite standout through out the album and fans (like myself) of good melodic leads should find the ones showcased here appeasing. I highly recommend Across The Dark to all fans of the Metal scene and ask that you all at least head over to the bands MySpace and check out a few tracks.<br /><br />Lastly I am trying to support the scene by writing these lengthy reviews here on Amazon and would be honored if you would take the time to click 'Yes' below and further more check out the rest of my reviews.

0739367676|5.0|the fourth book in Stephanie Meyer's quadrilogy sets all the players from the first  books into their final confrontations with their common enemies and each other.<br />Kydushin and Walters do a great job defining the voices of Bella and Jacob and the scenes with the most emotion and conflict are handled well, without additional inflections or drama on the part of the readers.<br />An excellent book to accompany one on a long drive or covertly listen to during a boring family dinner(Please pass the turkey with a side of type O).
B001W63DXC|1.0|I'm betting that the recording was done by chimps with not much more than blank tapes and the record button on a ghetto blaster. The tracks sound like they were recorded using crowd-mics only. There was no direct-source-output recorded on it.<br /><br />These songs all sound hurried, and give little to no justice to the studio-recorded tracks.<br /><br />I love Maiden, always have, and I can't believe that they actually released this TOTALLY sub-par \\"work\\".
0312117337|5.0|So far I've got only two items created by Osho - The Book of Secrets, which I had to get because I am passionate about Shiva sutras, and the Zen Tarot deck, as I am a Tarot cards collector and when I read Osho's interpretations in either of these two works, it's not just like reading a book or tarot card interpretation, but rather like savoring honey drops of wisdom.  Often I may ask a question, pull out a Zen Tarot card and find myself spontaneously contemplating the wisdom expressed in that card for days to come, not just intellectually, but feeling and experiencing it with my whole being.  The experience is that of awe and sheer delight.<br /><br />I have many beautiful Tarot decks and I tend to use different decks for different purposes, but this one is in a category of its own and I highly recommend it to those who are actively involved in their own spiritual unfoldment.  Your soul will rejoice.<br /><br />I should add here that while this deck contains 78 cards like any other tarot and the interpretations of the cards are in the spirit of the tarot, the imagery on the cards is very different and it is particularly suited for bringing out information most appropriate for one's spiritual unfoldment.<br /><br />And the end of the enclosed booklet there are suggestions for several spreads, however I personally prefer to pull out only one card from this deck rather than doing spreads.  I use other decks for spreads.  With this deck, for me, it's more like each card is like having a \\"full meal\\", and gives me plenty to contemplate.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|People condemn Lucas for this atrocity, but Spielberg can also be condemned. His nostalgia got the better of him, so we have three (THREE) references to Marcus Brody and one to Indy's dad, along with a very unnecessary Marion Ravenwood return and the predictable Indy jokes about getting old. This was their chance to do something new with Indy. Lucas and Spiel blew it, serving us a feast of rotten tidbits we'd eaten too many times before: the evil bad guy, the car chases, the big huge guy indy has to fight at some point, the ancient relic that hold ancient powers.    How can two legends of film armed with hundreds of millions of dollars, a legion of crew members, one of America's most beloved characters and nineteen years in which to do it accomplish what will go down as one of Hollywood's most embarrassing films?
B00297FEUI|3.0|The first movie's soundtrack was amazing, I loved just about every minute of it. The same applies to RotF's, except...in many places it fell short of epic and into the world of mediocre sci-fi nonsense music that sounds more like typical ambiance to fill in the cracks. The new themes I enjoyed, but I can't find a reason to really buy this album for everything that it's worth. Like the movie, it's missing something, a something I can't really put my finger on; but it in no way feels complete.
0307588335|5.0|This book is fairly easy to follow.  It starts out with the authors life and how he ended up at Lehman's.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought this part of the book was integral to the rest of the story.  It really made the story personal, so that I was right there with the author, through all of his successes and failures.  I laughed and cried with him.  It was not a dry factual book that is so boring, you can hardly make yourself pick it up.  I stayed up half the night to finish it, but finally had to go to bed.  Then, I woke up the next morning early, and like a child at Christmas, could not go back to sleep until I finished reading it.  As other reviewers have commented, he has interviewed numerous people to get his facts, and his facts are correct!!  There is no conjecture here, he has dates time and numbers, all in the correct order.  This book will make you run the gamut of emotions, and in the end, you will be terrified that this could have happened in the USA, and you will wonder when (not if, when) this will happen again.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|Solid breakdowns - great CD.  The case was a little broken when I got it, but I put my CDs in my case, so who cares?
0738711500|4.0|For the most part I liked this book and the cards, however while the cards are beautiful, I am at odds with some of them:<br /><br />- 2 of cups which traditionally has an image of a man and a woman, in this set of cards has definitely 2 women;<br /><br />- 10 of cups which traditionally has a family, in this set has a house with two women (there is a note that the reason for that is because that is how the artist who designed cards, Ciro, likes to envision himself coming home - to two women)<br /><br />- 10 of pentacles card has an image of a wooden chest with coins upon which is happily perched a rodent and while I think that rodents are really cute in cartoons, I prefer my 10 of pentacles card to be without rodents;<br /><br />- the Devil card can be interpreted as a warning that the person may be ignoring that silent voice that guides us to do what we know is right.  In occult following the voice of your conscience is what is essentially meant by walking straight along your spiritual path and is portrayed with a pentacle having one point upward, while the Devil card which stands for one's spiritual blindness is portrayed with a pentacle having one point facing downward.  In this set, the pentacle is pointing upward, and if you're not into occult symbolism, it may make no difference to you.  Traditionally, the Devil card may elicit the feelings of un-ease, however in this set the Devil looks more like an incarnation of lust, perhaps pointing to the fact that temptations can have an irresistible pull upon the individual, regardless of the flames surrounding him.  While you may interpret the card any way you feel appropriate for you, to me it seems that Josephine has missed the point in her attempt to defend the Devil, saying that having lot of sex can be a good thing.  The card is not about how much sex you may have or not have, but rather are you following your conscience and are you in control of your base impulses, or are your base impulses (and addictions) controlling you?<br /><br />- Wheel of fortune - while I don't mind the design of the card which has a mechanical device under the Wheel, I wish that the material in the book was congruent.  At the beginning of the book, Ciro points out that he has included various mechanical devices on some cards because they serve as symbols of mankind's involvement and interaction with natural and spiritual order of things, however Josephine's interpretation of the card states otherwise \\"there is no human element shown here to influence the movement of the wheel, so we are left to consider that faith is at work.\\"<br /><br />Every now and then there are other contradictory statements interspersed throughout the book, as if Josephine couldn't make up her mind - one one side she is offering several rules regarding the readings, among them are never to ask the same question twice in a same day (in my experience that depends on the question and on the situation), and she is saying how you will never get correct answers that way, and some pages further she points out how if you do ask the same question again and again, you will get cards that are telling you the same thing.<br /><br />When it comes to what you should or shouldn't do - how you should take care of your cards, how you should shuffle them and how you should pick the cards, I much prefer the attitude of Michelle Morgan and her book A Magical Course in Tarot.  You can learn all the \\"rules\\" different people may have, and all \\"do's and don't\\", but ultimately it is best that you do that which feels right for you.  Whether you choose to put your cards under your pillow and sleep with them, or you choose to keep on shuffling them - it's up to you; whether you choose to toss the cards and pull one or more cards at random from a pile, or you choose to fan the cards and pull those that are calling you, or you choose deal them, and how you choose to shuffle them - it's up to you.  Josephine recommends that beginners do large spreads, but I stand with most other people who believe that it is easier to master the cards if you keep it simple.<br /><br />If you are new to working with Tarot, you have to start somewhere so this book and set is as good as any other to get you started.  If you are serious about learning it, you'll pick more books and more Tarot decks and by practicing you'll be in a better position to decide how to go about reading Tarot that fits your situation and the questions you may have.it is easier to master the cards if you keep it simple.

B002DZX96C|5.0|This is the last set of Beethoven piano sonatas recorded by Brebdel and probably the best. It was recorded in digital sound.<br />It is true it was recorded for Philips (Brendel second set for Philips), but after Universal bought Philips, the time to use \\"Philips\\" brand name was limited and it seems all the back catalogue from Philips will appear under Decca lebel (or DG).<br />This set is excellent and at its time won the best prices from specialised critic.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|For the time that I will never get back after reading this book. I took the reviews with a grain of salt before I purchased the book. Maybe next time I'll believe them.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Simply put, this soundtrack is moodier than the first. Twilight was mainly rock, while New Moon is more indie and soulful. I love both soundtracks and encourage Twifans to pick up New Moon. My personal favorites are (by artist) Death Cab for Cutie and Hurricane Bells, but they are all excellent.
0756655307|5.0|i think some of these reviews shouldnt be on this page.  these reviews apply to the first edition that had serious flaws. this is the updated and expanded version that was released oct 2009. these reviews are from the book that was released in 2006. they actually have the same reviews listed under the older version that was flawed.     when i brought this book, there were no reviews for it yet. i purchased this book the second day it was released in oct 2009.   i think amazon does this book a disservice by applying the same reviews to this book. it misleads people into thinking it has major flaws.     if you look at the titles it clearly says \\"updated and expanded version\\". maybe amazon used the review to imply it is a hot commodity(and it is), but by having the same outdated reviews for a book that was revised in 2009 seems a little self defeating and manipulative at the same time. being as though the reviews by some of the people are complaints about the older version.    even with the flaws, if you read the reviews below, you will see that many people also enjoyed the book. the only complaints came from hardcore geeky fans(no disrespect). most were somewhat minor, like the info for a few characters being off. but the artwork and lay-out is beautiful. and these complaints are fixed in this version, and thats why the complaints dont apply.     i think everyone will enjoy this book. as an artist who enjoys creating my own comic book characters and superheroes, the action poses are a tremendous reference for my characters. that was the main reason i bought this massive book. page after page of action  poses and fight scenes. im not a hardcore collector at all! i enjoy comics but i dont live and die by them.     i used to flip through comics to get reference poses and inspiration and this book gives me more references and inspiration and insight than any book i ever came across.    if you want a good book thats informative i would suggest this book. by the way, i amturning into that geeky guy now. reading this encyclopedia has given me info on characters i never knew existed and exposed me to a world of supereroes that goes back 5 decades or more. i didnt realize some of my favorite and most familiar characters from childhood were around for so long.    i guess i had no concept of time when it came to the characters from marvel.   all in all, you cant be dissapointed in this book. even someone whos not a fan  will enjoy  the material in this book. hope this review helped
1593081545|5.0|Published first in 1814, this work is often compared unfavorably with Austen's brighter novels. The heroine, Frances (Fanny) Price, is humble, shy and retiring. The hero, Edmund Bertram, is for most of the novel unaware of the charms of the heroine, drawn instead to a very different creature, Mary Crawford. Bertram himself is upstaged for a very long time by dashing Henry Crawford, Mary's brother.<br /><br />Fanny Price is, at ten years old, brought from her necessitous family in Portsmouth to live at her uncle's country manor, Mansfield Park. Her childhood, while privileged, is also flawed. She is viewed as an inferior by her cousins Maria and Julia, teased by her oldest cousin Tom, and terrorized by her other aunt Mrs. Norris, who takes a sadistic delight in making Fanny miserable. She has one friend in the entire household: Edmund, second son of Sir Thomas Bertram, who by simply displaying some basic human feeling towards a frightened little girl, earns her wholehearted devotion. The infusion of the London-bred Crawfords, devilishly charming Henry and effervescent Mary, throw Fanny's world into confusion again.<br /><br />For me, the charm of this novel lies in its complexity. On the surface it is a story about a little community in rural England. Scratch that surface and you find a layer about morality, in which Fanny reigns supreme. She is retiring, but she is observant, and her constant observations and deductions lead her right in every circumstance. Further beneath that is a study of the sexes. Henry Crawford plays a dangerous game that ends ultimately in the ruin of a woman, for which she is held wholly accountable. The helplessness of women during that era is pretty well portrayed.<br /><br />Delving even deeper you discover that Mansfield Park takes on the appearance of paradise. Sir Thomas may be its proprietor, but its real guardian and caretaker is Fanny herself, who opposes any change that is not beneficial to the estate. Outsiders are not welcome until they have proven their worth, though they are often given more chances than they deserve. Worldly wisdom and town polish have no place at Mansfield, and eventually are eradicated.<br /><br />I have read this novel five times, and each time I have discovered something new. If you like reading books with some depth and complexity, this one is for you.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I am extremely pleased and happy that I purchased this Michael Jackson Ultimate collection.  All the songs are digitally mastered and preserved.

B000002MG1|5.0|In a way, it's ironic that 'Automatic For The People' became REM's most acclaimed album, because it's not really representative of their typical sound. Rather than the slightly ragged jangle pop of their early years, or the political rock of the late 80's, 'Automatic..' a collection of subdued, introspective folk-rock songs. It's still recognisable as REM, but it is a departure of sorts, particularly after the bright pop of 'Out Of Time'. The risk certainly paid off, with the album becoming a critical and commercial success, and spawning some of REM's most loved songs.     This album contains some of REM's best and most thoughtful ballads; the euthanasia reflection 'Try Not To Breathe', the positive but bittersweet `Find The River', the beautiful `Nightswimming', the sly `Star Me Kitten', plus of course `Everybody Hurts'. The latter has probably suffered a bit from over-exposure, but has a strong melody and a simple yet effective message. Despite the often weighty themes presented here, the songs never become bogged down in sappiness, and despite being quite restrained they contain some neat musical twists (e.g. the bridge of `Everybody Hurts').     There are also a couple of slightly more upbeat songs that are more reminiscent of `Out Of Time', in particular 'The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite' and the Andy Kaufman tribute 'Man On The Moon'.     The album is not quite perfect, with a couple of songs in the middle stretch being a slight step down in quality. `New Orleans Instrumental' has never really done anything for me, and while `Ignoreland' is not a bad song, its politically-charged lyrics don't fit that well among the deeply personal themes one the rest of the album.     In many ways, it's a bit surprising REM didn't continue down this route, since it was a perfect direction for the band to follow as they matured. In typical REM fashion they went their own way and made the music they wanted to, but it would have been interesting to see them build on this direction as they got older. Their less-than-consistent output since this album means that 'Automatic..' is the peak of their achievement. Simply, it's their best album.  Five stars.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Wow....14 years is quite a long time in between studio albums.  When their self-titled album came out in 1995,  I was very unhappy with the direction the band decided to go.  It was beyond obvious that the band's drug problems were negatively impacting their music at this time.  It was sad to hear of Layne Staley's passing in 2002 from an overdose, and I had pretty much long accepted that the Alice In Chains I knew and loved from \\"Facelift\\" and \\"Dirt\\" was now no more.    Like many others, I was surprised to hear a couple of years ago that they were hiring William Duvall to fill Layne's role in the band, and that they were going to make a new album.  I was cautiously optimistic about how this album was going to sound.    Fortunately, I was very pleasantly surprised to hear how awesome this album sounds!  I had downloaded \\"A Looking In View\\" from their website back in July and played it nonstop on my iPod.  It did seem that there was plenty of promise, and now that Black Gives Way To Blue is out, it confirmed my best expectations...this is the best album of their career so far!    On their previous albums, there were tracks that I could easily skip over after the first listen or two.  Here we are, a few weeks and many listens later, and I cannot find a single track on this album that I can skip over!      Black Gives Way To Blue is not an album by a band trying to re-live their glory days.  However, in the songwriting process, it seems that they really looked to their strongest material in the past, and wrote these songs based from that criteria.  There's nothing here that jumps out of the speaker and gets in your face like \\"Them Bones\\", but that doesn't mean that Black Gives Way To Blue doesn't rock.  \\"Last Of My Kind\\", for instance, boasts some of the heaviest riffs they've ever recorded (towards the end of the song, the riffs remind me of Metallica's \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\").  \\"Acid Bubble\\" is classic AIC, with the slow build-up before going into a hypnoticSabbath-style riff that only Jerry Cantrell can pull off.  They also don't shy away from the acoustic and mellower material, either.  \\"Your Decision\\", for instance, would not have sounded out of place on \\"Jar Of Flies\\".  \\"Private Hell\\" has a \\"Down In The Hole\\" vibe to it, with a great memorable chorus.  The title track is quite emotional, and you can almost feel the band's pain over losing Layne.  Elton John adds a nice touch to the song with his piano contribution.    As for William Duvall and his role in AIC...I can say that he doesn't try to imitate Layne at all.  He holds up quite well on his own, as evidenced on \\"Last Of My Kind\\", and his vocals mesh with Jerry Cantrell's quite nicely.  With time and subsequent albums, I think William Duvall will get more and more comfortable with his role in the band.    As far the reviews on here stating that this sounds like Jerry Cantrell's solo material...his vocals and guitar sound were always 75 to 80 percent of AIC's sound anyways.  Of course it would resemble his solo material!  You didn't think Jerry Cantrell was going to make country solo albums, did you? LOL    As I stated before, there's not one bad track on this CD at all.  That said, the strongest material here is \\"Check My Brain\\", \\"Last Of My Kind\\", \\"Your Decision\\" (which I understand is going to be the next single, and rightfully so.), \\"Acid Bubble\\", and \\"Private Hell\\".      If you're an old-school fan of Alice In Chains, you should have this one already.  If you're of the newer generation, then check it out also, since these guys inspired Godsmack and Staind, and have demonstrated that they still do it better than those bands.
B000WC3864|5.0|Believe it, ladies and gentlemen. The Evil Dead is a bloody, gory, explicit, and sometimes darkly humorous low-budget horror movie. There's no doubt about it. If you have a weak stomach, you'll probably find yourself puking in the toilet halfway through the film. Good thing I don't have one (no offense). This is a gore-filled masterpiece. It really is. If you think Saw and House of 1000 Corpses (both of which are great horror films, by the way) are bloody and gory, wait until you see this one. Like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Evil Dead is a prime example of how hands should be bitten off, and how bodies should be dismembered with an axe. And it's all done in such a low budget; it's unbelievable. I have to say that this is an excellent movie to watch on Halloween, and an excellent movie to watch any day or night. It's scary, funny, bloody, gory, intense . . . . and that's basically how it is.<br /><br />P.S. Bruce Campbell is ****ing awesome. At least in the second half of the movie, anyway.
B000002UBB|5.0|Somewhere I read once that it was thought that this was Steve Miller's bid to create \\"the ultimate playable album\\". Not that there hadn't been any concept of that in his music before but on this one that was the primary thing he was going for. Following up [[ASIN:B00000DRBI The Joker]] was probably a pretty difficult task and the end result was a session of recording so strong it actually yielded enough high quality material for at least two albums,the other of which was released a year later as [[ASIN:B00000DQT1 Book of Dreams]]. In terms of the musical flavors Stevie Miller borrowed here from every single one of his many influences from blues,jazz,country and plain old rock n roll:not to mention the newest weapon in his musical arsenel-funk. The result is an album that blends all of this into this flowing pop mixture. The title track,which we probably all know from all it's radio play.......if your listening to it from my point of view actually reveals itself as an electronic tinged funk workout. Funny how,if the time and place demand it such a tune could end up being revered as classic rock. \\"Wild Mountain Honey\\",while likely forgotton is one of the strongest songs on the album-an atmospheric space soul piece that again makes excellent use of synthesizer. \\"Serenade\\" extends the theme with an Isley Brothers-ish rock n soul number that works well in Miller's general musical viewpount.\\"Dance Dance Dance\\" is the very old timey bluesy country number. You could almost call \\"Take The Money And Run\\" as something of a musical follow up to the title song from the previous album and not too surprisingly ended up becoming one of this albums big smashes. \\"Rock N Me\\" is more what could be described as classic rock although,as if everything here there is less relience on noise making than there is created rhythm of some sort.\\"Mercury Blues\\",\\"Sweet Marie\\" and \\"The Window\\" reveal the bluesier side of this album and the allter two to close things down on. Within all this diversity the songs are linked musically in a way by a wind like sound effect. Without any doubt Steve Miller's commitment to his sound and craft shines through even as he was reaching for the top of the charts too. And this being 1976 and along with the..well what SHOULD be obvious funk and soul elements that says a lot about the sense of pop creativity at the time.wn on.

0767827791|4.0|I first saw this movie as a teenager in the 1950's and remembered it fondly.  Watching it again fifty years later and reading a number of reviews of both professionals and multiple viewers, it seems to me that many are missing the entire point of Inge's play and the movie.  While the music score, the melodrama, and over-the-top-acting, especially by Holden, certainly make the movie look dated, there is great irony in the contrast between the carefree, fun, happy atmosphere of the Labor Day picnic and the anguished lives of a mother whose husband left her to raise two unhappy daughters, a spinster whose entire life appears to have been spent caring for her aging mother, a love-starved schoolteacher who is terrified of living her own life out as a lonely old maid, and especially Hal, the child of a broken home of an alcoholic father and an unloving mother who was abandoned by both parents in his teens and who has come to the realization that there is no future in store for him.  Real life is not a picnic.
0312427999|5.0|This is what I consider to be one of the most important books on how the U.S. has manipulated foreign governments over the past three decades.  Naomi Klein is an amazing journalist.  Her research is thorough, her analysis impeccable.  I was either ignorant most of my life or these events were just not reported with any degree of thoroughness.<br /><br />The central ogre in all of our mayhem has been Milton Friedman and his Chicago School of Economics.  The Chicago Boys started with Pinochet taking over Chili in the early 70s.  The central theme has been to privatize all state-owned institutions (and everything else they could grab) and sell them to (largely U.S.) companies at pennies on the dollar.  In the process, it required laying off sometimes hundreds of thousands of locals, plunging the respective country into sever poverty (The Shock Doctrine), disappearing and torturing dissidents (the other shock doctrine), even utilizing genocide.  This was done under the cloak of bringing democracy to the country, but actually was instituted to bring heavy handed capitalism.<br /><br />From Chili, we moved to the \\"Southern Cone\\", which included Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Brazil.  Then, taking the hint, Margaret Thatcher used the same principals to create and win a war in the Falklands, which was successful in getting her re-elected despite her plunging support in Britain.  Believe it or not, the break-up of the USSR was considered a similar \\"opportunity\\", and Gorbachov was kicked out, Yeltsin let in (easily manipulated).  The only difference in Russia was that they \\"de-socialized\\" the country by selling to rich Russians instead of to U.S. and other ultra-national countries.  Yet, Chicago Boys economists still got paid big bucks to lead the economic revolution in Russia, just they had in the other countries.<br /><br />We heard that we were going to Iraq because of WMD.  Then it was about freedom.  Rumors were that it was about oil.  What it really was encompassed the same greed-inspired attempt to sell off all the state-owned operations to private companies - Halliburton, Bechtel and others at the top of the list.  Locals were not employed in their own operations, but instead, foreigners were brought in as employees, while locals were left impoverished.  The only problem with Iraq was that the people responded with unanticipated gusto to thwart Bremer's attempts to privatize (under guidance of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld).  So, major players pulled out after earning billions in wasted efforts to bring back infrastructure to the country.  Interestingly, all these \\"contractors\\" were paid on a cost plus basis, guaranteeing them profit on their work with no downside for failure.<br /><br />I sincerely recommend you get this book.  It's dense reading, but you can't go more than a couple of pages without voicing profanities.  I can't help but keep a highlighter handy.empt to sell off all the state-owned operations to private companies - Halliburton, Bechtel and others at the top of the list.

B002MW50KO|1.0|For the die hard Dylan fans.  My sincere apologies.  This is awful.  After listening to the sound clip of \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\"  I just couldn't bear to listen anymore.  The album cover artwork is better than the music.    There are other Dylan albums which really represent his talent, writing and vocal skills.  This IS NOT one of those.    Start with his Greatest Hits Albums volumes 1 and 2, Blonde on Blonde and Live with \\"The Band\\".  Then move on to Blood on the tracks.  I have others. But when I want to listen to Bob Dylan, these are the one's I find myself listening to.     It's unfortunate.  His work with The Traveling Wilburys project appeared to be genuinely his last real effort.    Save your money and donate to a worthy cause.

I recently purchased a copy to read to my friend who had sons. They all enjoyed it.

B002HNA95E|4.0|I really like this compilation.  However, given that the songs are \\"remastered\\", they might have paid some attention to the bass in the older songs.  As it is, the newer tracks sound rich, with good bass and pleasant tops.  Dotted through the 2 discs are older songs which, quite frankly, sound \\"tinny\\" in comparison.  If they went to the trouble of remastering for this album, surely they could have balanced the entire collection.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|So what's your pleasure?  Do you enjoy tunes from the Great American Songbook?  How about a  little rhythm & blues?  Perhaps you dig the music of Van Morrison.  Or maybe you are someone who enjoys sampling terrific new music from a gifted singer/songwriter.  Michael Buble continues to be one of the most dynamic and versatile recording artists working today.  His brilliant new album \\"Crazy Love\\" offers up an eclectic mix of venerable standards, reworked favorites as well as a pair of exciting new tunes penned by Buble himself.  Seems like each time I play this disc I enjoy it even more!<br /><br />Now as you might expect, no Michael Buble album would be complete without a representative sampling from the Great American Songbook.  \\"Crazy Love\\" features a handful of these remarkable tunes including the perennially popular \\"All Of Me\\", the Hoagy Carmicheal classics \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" and \\"Stardust\\" (at one point the most recorded tune of all-time) as well as the enduring favorite \\"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\\" and a terrific song that you just don't hear all that often \\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" which was a huge hit in the 1930's.  Some mighty impressive stuff here!<br /><br />Judging by the rest of this album Michael Buble could certainly never be accused of being a one- trick pony.  For one thing he proves to be an extraordinary songwriter as evidenced by a pair of fabulous new songs on this disc.  I would have to say that my very favorite song on \\"Crazy Love\\" just might be the Buble penned tune \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\",  a lively little ditty that reminds me an awful lot of Randy Newman's \\"Short People\\".  Among the other outstanding tracks on \\"Crazy Love\\" are Michael Buble's duet with Sharyn Jones of the old 1960 R & B favorite \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\\" and of course the title track \\"Crazy Love\\" which Buble culled from the Van Morrison album \\"Moondance\\" from so many moons ago.  Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of \\"Heartache Tonight \\" which I found to be the most surprising track on this disc.  With a remarkable new arrangement featuring a strong brass section Buble makes this old Eagles hit all his own.<br /><br />Now I realize that a lot of younger people might dismiss this Michael Buble album as \\"Old Fogey\\"  music.  This would be a mistake.  I can safely predict that someday you are going to like a lot of this stuff, particularly the tunes from the Great American Songbook.  Remember that the same kids who listened to Led Zeppelin and the Grateful Dead in the 1960's and 1970's are now flocking to concert halls to see this guy.  \\"Crazy Love\\" is a disc that can be enjoyed and appreciated by listeners of all ages.

0061438294|4.0|What Everybody Is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People is a book that opens your eyes to the very things about body language you already know. It is easy to read even the not-so avid readers could just take a couple of days or so to complete the entire book. Yet, in the end you feel as though you have achieved and understood the nonverbal behaviour with a better view of the world around you - able to see most of what we take for granted in everyday life.<br /><br />In the book, Navarro demonstrates several types of body languages in pictorial format and then correlates those postures with real-life FBI past experience making his arguments even more convincing! He conveniently highlights his life experiences as an FBI agent in separate boxes over many pages bringing the tapestry of human experience in all of its delightful complexity. Some of these experiences may seem over the top, but I would like to think they are real.<br /><br />As much as this book seems popular it is worth noting that it covers complex issues some of which have no scientific evidence due to the fuzzy nature of the topic. At least, Navarro admits to this and I give him credit for his plethora of bibliography! For example, what may be a good gesture to one may not be to another depending on several factors such as culture, religion, ethnicity to mention, but a few. However, what is good about this book when you read it is that you realise that there is nothing new about body language. In fact, most of what is explained is common knowledge and experience that anyone at some point in life might have come across consciously or sub-consciously.<br /><br />Conveniently, Navarro splits the nonverbal behaviours into two categories on the basis of human-consciousness - those controlled by the neocortex [conscious] and the limbic part of our brain [sub-conscious]. Most of Navarro's illustrations in this book are based on the limbic part of the brain, which in essence has no control of the human brain. I believe this stance is what gives Navarro the flexibility to stretch his arguments as much as he likes, because he knows there are no right or wrong answers in his approach.<br /><br />So, find out for yourself if this man with a distinguished twenty-five year career with the FBI is what he claims to be - a human lie detector that can spot deceit with relative ease and even teach you to become a personal polygraph in short order. One thing for certain this book will do as it has done to me, is put you on the spot-light and be aware of your surroundings than ever before!ieve this stance is what gives Navarro the flexibility to stretch his arguments as much as he likes, because he knows there are no right or wrong answers in his approach.

0002171856|5.0|I obtained this book from an Eagle Scout years ago and I have read it many times over. Each time I learn something new that I didn't remember from a prior reading. This book covers all the most common circumstatnces, as well as all the climate regions on earth. Great for anyone who may wind up in a survival situation away from the climate/region they are most familiar with, or simply in their own home.    The coverage of emergency scenarios and preparedness has changed the way I travel and live, from my awareness of my surroundings, to the supplies I always keep on hand in my home and car. I would rather be accused of being overprepared any day, than become a statistic!    The coverage on trapping animals is extensive and thorough, I still have yet to practice all of the methods described. The section on Camp Craft is also especially detailed. It gives great advice for the best types of camp based on the environmental situations you may encounter.    My only criticism is of the edible/inedible wild plants. It describes some of the most common plants that are edible or inedible, but far more detail would be needed in a long term survival situation. I can't count that against the author however, as a truly detailed plant guide would easily double the size of the book. I highly recommend a supplemental field guide on wild edibles.    I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to increase their survival odds no matter what the situation they may find themselves in.  Get two!  One for the home, another for the car. Girls, don't be afraid of this, we have as much survival instinct in us as the boys!

B002GYVRRI|5.0|I will focus on the 5.1 surround mix, because to me, that is the reason to purchase this set. I first listened to the MLP lossless version on a NAD t585 universal player with B&W CM series speakers. The sound was fantastic. Steven Wilson, who did the surround mix, understands surround as well as or better than just about anyone, and he deliberately put King Crimson \\"in the room\\" with the listener. There are different ways to go about a surround mix; in this case, Mr. Wilson chose not to attempt to recreate a \\"live\\" feel which would place the listener in the audience. With Red in 5.1, you feel as though you are right there - on stage or in the studio.    The music surrounds you, but the mix is not too gimmicky. To me, it is a perfect balance of restraint and creativity. Some songs benefit more from surround than others; I thought that the \\"in your face\\" power of \\"Red\\" was perhaps the least interesting (as a surround experience). \\"Starless\\" was a different matter. I've listened to it several times in each format, and the 5.1 MLP lossless is a revelation. The clarity of the bass and John Wetton's voice in 5.1 lossless was wonderful. Once again, the mix benefits from Steve Wilson's experience; Wetton's voice is in the center-left channel rather than floating in the center, as is common in other surround mixes. Too me, this is a more natural choice.    I mentioned my equipment because I think that it makes a difference in the listening experience. Obviously, if you do not have a DVD-Audio player, you will have to listen to the DTS surround version. I was impressed with the DTS sound as well. I prefer the MLP lossless, but if I did not have the ability to directly compare, I am sure that I would have been quite satisfied with the DTS version. There is no Dolby Digital surround mix.    Perhaps my fifty year-old ears are too worn out to tell the difference, but unless you are a big enough King Crimson fan to be drawn by the extras (there is a significant amount of video), Iwould not buy this for the stereo versions. I could not discern much of a difference between the redbook CD and the MLP lossless stereo versions. There is no indication that this is a new mix of the stereo version, and, my 30th anniversary HDCD version sounds excellent. I honestly cannot hear any improvement; but once again, you may have a more sophisticated system (or younger ears).     I just noticed that the December issue of Sound and Vision magazine has an article (several, actually) on the King Crimson 2009 releases, as well as Steve Wilson and surround sound. It's worth a read if you are interested in these recordings. The bottom line is that if you are a King Crimson fan interested in a surround version of Red, your decision is a simple one. Buy this now!

0385504225|3.0|As a follow-up to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", it almost goes without saying that \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is going to be a runaway best-seller. Nor does it take deep literary analysis to suggest that the plot involves symbols, codes, secret rituals, freemasonry, mysticism, religion, history and frantic chases from one secret location to another as symbologist Robert Langdon slowly unravels \\"the\\" ultimate secret to lay it bare before Dan Brown's breathless readership.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is (and it doesn't even begin to compare with his previous efforts), tells the tale of Mal'akh, a shadowy, bizarrely tattooed villain who seeks to unlock the wisdom of the ages guarded by the Mason's greatest secrets. Mal'akh kidnaps Peter Solomon, the secretary of the Smithsonian institute, a billionaire and a 33rd degree Freemason. Using him as a hostage, Mal'akh forces Robert Langdon to search for the clues that will unlock the code on the Masonic Pyramid which is presumably a map to the location of the wisdom that he seeks.<br /><br />As a thriller, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is pretty weak stuff - repetitive, over-written and melodramatic. It lacks the intensity, the passion, the drive, the pacing and, indeed, the controversy that understandably (and quite justifiably) drove \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to the top of the best-seller lists. I might even go so far as to suggest that Brown's focus on the Christian bible (well, at least, the Masonic interpretations of the bible) are a blatant apology to the fundamentalist Christian groups that seemed to be so deeply offended by \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".<br /><br />The real power and enjoyment of this novel rests in its non-fiction content and background - the interpretation of Masonic philosophy, secrecy and rituals to a public that, by and large (myself included), has misunderstood the group for many years.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't be rushing out to spend my money on a hard covered version of a novel that comes nowhere close to fulfilling the overblown expectations of hordes of Dan Brown's fans. But I certainly would sit back patiently, wait for the thousands of copies that will make their way into second hand shops and read it for the history, the philosophy and the interesting sidebars on scholarly interpretation of religious books such as the Talmud, the Bible or the Koran.<br /><br />Paul Weissctations of hordes of Dan Brown's fans.

B001GCUO1Q|2.0|Cheesy action movie without that much great action. Compound that with the fact that there's barely any respect for the source material, add in the fact that they don't even care too much for sensible continuity to the other films that have been made and you get a pretty awful film. Except commerically speaking, since it does satisfy giving Wolverine his own vehicle and showcasing all the fun things he can do, and throwing in a few mutants who couldn't get crowbarred into the other film series.     Even looking at the film on its own, ignoring any source material or other films whose canon or continuity it mutilates or just completely overlooks and ignores, it doesn't hold up. Put on it's own, it needs to be seen as an action movie, and the action was boring and stereotypical. If this movie was made in 1999 the sequences might have wowed me. Too bad that was ten years ago and this movie wasn't made then. What could have been the best sequence with Wolverine on a motorcycle being chased down by two hummers and a helicopter was ruined by a bleached-out looking cgi that screamed fake and the fact that it wasn't choreographed very excitingly.    There were some moments I liked, notably Liev Schrieber in general since he's a great actor who really shines in this one. I wasn't feeling the ferocity from Hugh Jackman, although maybe he lost some of his bite trying to trudge through the script without feeling he was losing some kind of integrity as an actor.     In general, I've seen Jean Claude Van Damme movies that made more sense, had more emotion, and were less cheesy than them. So I'm going to go back to them and Hong Kong for my cheap action fixes and pretend this didn't happen.
0440178002|5.0|When it comes to the late James Clavell, I am completely biased.  In spite of some pretty God-awful mis-steps like \\"Gai-Jin\\" and the execrable \\"Whirlwind,\\" they never diminished his powers as a superior writer and story-teller.  \\"Shogun,\\" alongside the much shorter and harrowing \\"King Rat,\\" is a testament to his amazing talent.      This is, however, a work of historical fiction, crammed full of inaccurate and manipulated historical information bent to serve the story.  So, if you are looking for a primer on the history of Japan, this is not the book.  But, Clavell's research does contain little gems about the life of everyday Japanese before the Battle of Seikighahara (sic?) and the inter-class, social, and gender relationships that did so much in defining an amazing culture.  He also manages to weave both European and Japanese power-politics into the tale with a great deal of sometime-relative accuracy and a deft hand.  But, even against his epic backdrop, the characters, high and low, both European and Japanese, are beautifully developed to the point they become almost tangible, all revolving around the fateful love affair between the brilliant and beautiful aristocrat Lady Mariko and Captain-Pilot John Blackthorne.  (Her letter to Blackthorne at the end of the novel is achingly beautiful prose).  It is so easy for any writer to \\"lose\\" people when paining on such a huge canvas, but Clavell does not.  And his skills at merging disparate plot threads into a coherent and penultimately readable narrative are so good, they are worthy of study.  This made the story unpredictable and continually fresh, keeping me turning pages.  This is one of those stories I did not want to put down, and disappointed me when it was over.      Again, this is not a history lesson.  But as a novel, meant to entertain and enliven, it would be very hard to get much better.      So, if the reader takes \\"Shogun\\" for what it is, I cannot see how anyone could be disappointed.  Recommended without reservation.
B000C13Y2S|4.0|This is a fairly small at 4 inches by 1 inch and is able to stand securely if you take the half-second to position it so your keys aren't pushing it over.  The brightness is good for the size and the slide switch is fairly hidden when the face is in the upward position instead of the 45 or 90 degree position.  There are many different colors to find if you look hard enough, which is nice if you like that kind of thing.      The bad parts are minor, but that the sliding switch is a bit small and can slip from where you want it, meaning it'll take some time to get used to turning it on and off without having it snap back to its previous position once you let it go.  The batteries are tough to find because they are hidden, turn the head to the 90 degree position and remove the screw, and they are small hearing-aid batteries instead of the more common AAA which would have made it a little larger.  The legs aren't as strong as you'd like, and the feet don't have much grip but that is probably to make it easy to remove it from your pocket.    Overall, most people will be happy, if you're worried about breaking it, there are more rugged flashlights out there, and if you aren't good with small switches, there are others with nice push buttons on the tail which I love.
0060090367|4.0|Just what I was in the mood for: fluffy chick lit! And Marian Keyes continually gets this genre right. (I also liked \\"Sushi for Beginners\\" and \\"Anyone Out There?\\"). The plot was entertaining without being overly sappy or contrived, and the main character, who narrates the tale, has a fun and witty voice. In fact, most of the characters were well-developed and likeable. All in all, I'd recommend this novel to anyone looking for a thoroughly escapist summer read.

047119350X|3.0|I was first introduced to this book in my 3rd year undergrad biochemistry course (a biochem-for-biochem-majors course). I couldn't stand it! It went into so much detail about every aspect of biochemistry (well above and beyond the scope of the course), but never provided any simple introductions. Advanced material is always appreciated (by me, at least), but not in the required readings, and certainly not when there's no gradual introduction into it!     Three years later, I had to take a basic biochem course (with no exemptions allowed...argh), and the required book was the Berg, Stryer, etc. textbook. That book provides a great low-level introduction. Being the kind of person that likes to know a lot about a topic and actually UNDERSTAND material as opposed to memorising it, I started referring to my old Voet & Voet text again. What a difference! When I read sections of V&V with a basic understanding of the concept, it was very informative, helpful and INTERESTING!     I highly recommend V&V for everyone who wants to UNDERSTAND (not memorise) biochemistry, but absolutely not as the main textbook for an intro course. It's a great supplementary resource for those intro courses, and a fantastic reference afterward, but it's just too complex and in-depth for the beginner, even the beginner chem or biochem major.

0061703087|4.0|I don't know much about nanotechnology. I have no way of knowing if this book was even remotely in the realm of possible. I would imagine it was, since Michael Crichton was always very good about that. I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would. When a book focuses on a topic I am completely clueless about, I worry that I'm not going to be able to follow the plot even if the topic is dumbed down for me. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could enjoy the thriller without constantly having to wonder what the hell they were talking about.

B0029O08WA|5.0|There isn't one single song on this album that I don't like. All the songs are great. If you've read the books you can totally picture the time to apply the songs and its lyrics to the book, they really do fit! Just like the Twilight soundtrak this soundtrack did its part in fitting perfectly well and introducing bands that otherwise I would have never heard of.
B002SJIO54|5.0|This is one of those movies that everyone hates or everyone loves. I happened to like it a great deal.   Starting with a docu-style film and morphing into more of a traditional movie was definitly a great move.   Character development went along very nicely, with the pompus office worker turning into what appeared to be a selfless \\"hero\\" of sorts(although in the end he still did things with himself in mind).   Action scenes were plenty, and a bonus was that the bad guys didnt seem to suffer too much from bad guy aiming syndrome, or what is known as \\"storm trooper syndrome\\".   Overall the graphics were certainly top notch and definitly believable.  This is one of those films that makes you think. It doesnt explain everything out and leaves just enough unexplained; although if you have even the least bit of imagination, then it is easy to see where something could lead. Essentially this movie was like a dive into a large universe where you get simply a glimpse of what is happening, but that is enough to see basically whats going on. This a big reason some people end up thinking its a terrible movie, they likely want a traditional Hollywood movie where everything is explained and nothing is left in the air.   A second thing to mention is the fact that this flm is essentially a satire of events that have happened in South Africa. It leaves you wondering a few moral questions. This is another fact that some people did not like; this movie shows what the ugly side of humanity can look like.  This is a short review but does touch on the more major points.  If your looking for a more traditional Hollywood movie, this is not a film for you.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I have found this blue-ray version to be grainy at best. Maybe, it's my 32inch Sony, but I have the remastered standard version, and that plays better and cleaner.<br /><br />Ralph<br /><br />Update 6_30_2014<br /><br />I have re-watched this in the high def mode, duh there are two modes, hence the grainy picture in the first mode. And, I have to say, I was wrong, this high def version is amazing. The picture quality is superb, the fx redone and very well done. Compared to the original it's like watching the series all over again for the first time.<br /><br />Ralph.

B001EO2UJK|3.0|If you are a big fan of Gabriel-era Genesis, then there is no way to avoid buying this unless you can't afford it.  The purchase is worthwhile for some of the extras, particularly the original slide show from the \\"Lamb\\" tour, and for the novelty of the remixes.  However, this by no means should stand as history's primary enduring representation of these albums, and they certainly should not be expected to be an \\"improvement\\".<br /><br />The \\"Definitive Edition\\" remasters of the 1990's still stand as the next best thing to pristine original vinyl.<br /><br />In many cases, much of what made some of these songs special and groundbreaking is literally lost in the mix of this new edition.  In particular, I single out \\"Back in N.Y.C.\\" in the new edition of \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" as being an unforgivable hatchet-job.  I suspect that there were effects applied during the mix-down of the original album which were forgotten, impossible to re-produce, or simply not even considered by the new engineers.  To make matters worse, the US edition does not include the hybrid SACDs, opting for standard CDs instead, and the mastering of the stereo mixes features some of the most excessive ham-handed brick-wall limiting I have ever seen.  Somebody needed to tell the mastering engineer that this is art-rock, not nouveau-punk.  I can only hope that SACD editions in Japan and the UK were mastered with a wider dynamic range, although I wouldn't bet on it.<br /><br />As long as I'm being so sour, I should note that while I found the new interviews on the DVDs to be informative and very revelatory regarding the personalities and interactions of the band members, I must say I liked Tony Banks a whole lot more before I heard him whine and take cheap shots at Gabriel for hours on end.  In the interviews, there appears to be a direct correlation between each band member's degree of solo success and how positive their comments were about other band members and past work, as well as their ration of screen time. Thus, Phil can afford to love everyone and everything, Peter is gracious if slightly arrogant, Mike is diplomatic and kind, Steve is curiously snobbish, and Tony is an ill-tempered toddler who didn't get what he wanted from Father Christmas.  In terms of screen time, Tony gets more than his share, no doubt because he wanted it and nobody else saw any point in fighting about it.<br /><br />I feel bad now, so please find and buy a copy of \\"The Fugitive\\" by Tony Banks; it is his best solo album and very much worth having.time.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|As with the premier of all of the Star Trek movies I made a point to go see this one at the theater. I grew up watching the reruns with my father and still have not stopped. He is such a die hard fan of the original series that he never liked T.N.G. or any of the spin-offs It just wasn't the same without Kirk, Spock, and McCoy on the bridge to him.    I however have watched every episode from all of the spin-offs and enjoyed most of them. It was a bit strange seeing these new characters emerge and seeing Spock more emotional than I was used to. But I got past that right away. They did a very good job getting some of the characters persona's and adding a little twist to each of them, Like Uhura hating Kirk at first, Scotty was a little wilder,  The actor who played Chekov was trying a little too hard with the Russian accent, it didn't seem to flow like Walter koenig. Sulu wasn't bad and Karl Urban did a great impersonation of McCoy hating the transporter. The one scene where he kept injecting Kirk and making him sick was funny The special effect were terrific and I can't wait to see the movie on blue ray. The main thing I was not impressed with was the design of the Enterprise. It looked a little too much like a hot rod and not like a design you might find in the practical sense.  The original is Still my favorite, with NCC-1701A and E comming in as my next favorites. I never really liked enterprise D because I think the saucer section looked like a smashed pancake. Possibly a new series with this new crew might make it. We have been too long without a Star Trek series in prime time. If they come up with some good new material I think the movies and (If) a series might have a chance, But if they try to remake some of the old episodes they might be shooting themselves in the foot.   I hope in the upcoming sequel(s) if there are any, they follow Gene Roddenberry's morality lessons. he was way ahead of his time with every thing.    I was overall pleased with this remake, Too many times remakes seem to fall flat because we expect the new actors to emulate the originals and they can't be expected to do that. but sometimes they are better or just as good as their original counterparts.    If all else fails, just sit back and enjoy the alternate universe theme.
0441017177|5.0|Alastair Reynolds reaches for the sky with this novel. And succeeds. Actually he reaches for millions of years into the future with this book and it works. It's been a long time coming but I think Reynolds might just put some life back into Science Fiction.  If you like hard SciFi and like a good story, then this is your book.  Fantasy people need not apply.  Reynolds does modern SciFi like Larry Niven did in the 70's. An awesome romp around millions of years, but entirely believable.  Reynolds gives you people you care about, in situations that are totally believable, and are millions of years in the future.  What more can you ask from a science fiction writer?  This book is awesome.  If you're into hard SciFi buy it now.
B0026ZNL80|5.0|Upon first listen this CD didn't impress me as much as Second Life Syndrome and Rapid Eye Movement but, in recent memory, I can't think of a better example of \\"That one REALLY grew on me!!\\" Now it's tied for 2nd with 2nd life, though I still think REM is their best effort to date. But this CD definitely proves one thing if nothing else, their song writing skills are growing by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />And it's also hard to pick a favorite at this point, I don't think I've NOT listened to the entire thing, even on my MP3 player. Though the last ones, \\"Left Out\\" and \\"Hybrid Times\\" (the long ones), pack a heck of a 1-2 punch!!<br /><br />At this point I think it goes without saying to get the version with the bonus DVD. Since spring me & my buddies have been complaining (on message boards and in chat rooms) about the lack of a live DVD, guess they heard us!!! :)<br /><br />While the DVD doesn't have my single favorite song, Cybernetic Pillow, it does have 3 of my top 5: Beyond the Eyelids, 02 Panic Room and Ultimate Trip (Rainbow Box being the fifth) so....how can I lose?!?! And, while it's only stereo, no 5.1, it sounds just fine, very well produced!<br /><br />If you like Riverside there is NO way you'll be disappointed, especially a month later. And if you like powerprog, progmetal, symphonic metal (whatever they're calling it this week) and want to check out Riverside, I'd say start with this because of the DVD. I still think REM is their best album.....by a hair.<br /><br />Now...if we could just get them to tour over here, preferably opening for someone like Porcupine Tree or Tool...I'd be a happy man!

B0029O08WA|1.0|I am so incredibly diappointed in the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack.  I absolutely loved the Twilight soundtrack so I couldn't wait for the next one and ran out to get it the first day it was released only to be filled with regret.  This seems like an experiment in how far they can go off the beaten path music wise - an experiment I consider to be a failure.  Stephanie Meyer said when she heard the lead singer of Blue October, she felt like she was hearing Edward sing but Blue October was no where to be found on the cd and compared to the stuff they threw on this, Blue October could have been a saving grace.  Only decent track is the last one - instrumental and sounds like it may actually relate to the story, unlike all the other tracks.
0440242401|4.0|3.5 Stars, bordering on 4 (Out of 5)<br /><br />Lexi Smart wakes up after an accident and finds out that she has no recollection at all of the past three years of her life. The last thing she remembers is being stood up by her boyfriend \\"Loser Dave\\", trying to find a cab after a night out with her 3 best friends.<br /><br />Three years later she has apparently gotten married to the man of her dreams and lives the perfect life she had always wanted. Only, she doesn't remember anything about her husband, or her work or why her friends are now her enemies.<br /><br />It reminded me a bit of the movie \\"13 going on 30\\" - the character there doesn't have amnesia but fast forwarding her life lead to the same kinda problem Lexi had: a more glamorous life, best friends are enemies, too good to be true boyfriends/husbands, etc.<br /><br />It's a light read that can be finished in a sitting. There are several LOL moments (\\"loft style living\\" with the parallel hands gestures). I've liked most of Kinsella's books and this one definitely makes the cut.
0765350386|5.0|This whole series is extremely well done in my opinion. Some of the things I personally really like about this series:        * The first book was very good and focused on some specific topics to tell a great story, the second has built and progressed upon these plot lines without rehashing the same stuff, and the third takes the story to yet another level in scope. Almost as if you are moving higher over a landscape. Less like three books set in the same world, and more like 3 acts of the same story. I appreciate this. I hope the third does the same.      * The characters, especially Vin and a couple of the other main characters, are complex enough to show depth, likeable, and they grow over time. Not too much navel gazing, which is a good thing.      * The political/power and social struggles and issues are well thought out and interesting to watch evolve      * I like the juxtaposition of the personal and small scale struggles with the overarching power struggles and large scale problems the characters face.      * The plot seems really well planned out and confident (for lack of a better word)      * The characters are mortal      * The action scenes are good, but are written to fit into the scale of the story and plot as it evolves, if that makes sense.      * The creatures are interesting      * The history/background and world building is well done      * The magic system is very cool, it also has limits and seems well thought out    I really would recommend these to those of you who are at all on the fence about reading them, are looking for a completed trilogy to read, or would like a taste of what Sanderson's writing can be like. I understand these books (Mistborn) are the ones that solidified Sanderson's offer to write the end of the WOT series(?) Good stuff.
B0013D8LOK|3.0|I had heard a great deal about how frightening this movie was. I guess the concept is a bit scary, but in this day and age, it's not nearly as scary as a madman with nuclear weapons, or people walking into shopping centers or classrooms with automatic weapons. I know that the play was a musical, but it would have been a great deal more frightening if the characters hadn't burst into song periodically. On the plus side, this proves that Tim Burton can sing.

B001GCUO16|4.0|Over the course of the \\"X-Men\\" trilogy there has been one constant story thread that has been touched upon, yet it's never been fully explored. For those of you that have watched the series, then you most likely know exactly what I'm referring to... the origin of the most popular mutant of all, Logan/Wolverine. Finally, after three highly successful films chronicling the adventures of the X-Men team, 20th Century Fox has chosen to spin-off Wolverine into his own movie and potential franchise by providing his official origin story with \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\".    \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" presents many key events in Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) life prior to his fateful arrival at the X-Mansion in the original \\"X-Men\\" film. Beginning with his initial discovery as a youth that he possessed the ability to unsheathe claws from beneath his skin, to his complicated friendship and eventual hatred of his former best friend Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), his time spent working for the government as part of an elite team of mutant trackers, and all of this culminating in a senses-shattering showdown that will leave no one unscathed.    The mystery behind Wolverine's origin has been a long-standing plotline, not just in the film trilogy, but in the various comic books in which the character has appeared. In 2001, Marvel Comics began a six-issue limited series aptly titled \\"Origin\\" that would establish the official backstory for the berserker mutant once and for all. Obviously, so long as interest in the onscreen version of the character remained alive, it would only be a matter of time before his origin, or at least some semblance of it, made it to the big screen as well.    Many times with spin-offs, the story tends to be weaker than those utilized for the main franchise; however, this film appears to be one of those very rare exceptions where the quality actually remains intact. Written by David Benioff (\\"Troy\\") and Skip Woods (\\"Swordfish\\"), with some elements loosely based upon the mini-series \\"Origin\\", the story focuses upon some of the various influences, circumstances, and powerful outside forces that shaped Logan into becoming one of the most dangerous mutants on the face of the Earth.    The story spends ample time showcasing the extremely visceral nature of the film's two primary characters, Wolverine and Sabretooth, and how they deal with their inner beasts in drastically different ways. Along with this complicated relationship, the film delves into the almost constant, yet subtle, manipulation that eventually led to Logan's decision to participate in the excruciatingly painful Weapon X program, which bonded liquid Adamantium to his bones. It's during these moments of manipulation, mostly at the hands of William Stryker (Danny Huston), that the film's story really shines.    Another strong aspect of the film is the sharply written, and often times witty, dialogue. The interactions between the characters felt believable and completely natural within the scenes. Some spin-offs suffer from an over-abundance of clichés or merely recycled lines and moments from the original franchise on which they are based; however, \\"Wolverine\\" easily side-steps these issues in every respect. In the hands of less capable writers that didn't feel some responsibility to keep the quality of the franchise intact, the dialogue, and the rest of the story for that matter, could have potentially gone the way of so many other spin-offs and failed miserably, thus hurting the main franchise in the process. As a fan of the series, I am very pleased by the fact that even though this is the fourth film in the franchise, the creative minds behind the series continually try to surpass what has come before.    For all you action fans out there do not worry. This series hasn't lost sight of one of its key elements. Throughout the film's story the action scenes never take a backseat to the drama unfolding within the characters' lives. The fights are much more violent and at times graphic in comparison to the previous three films of the \\"X-Men\\" franchise; not to mention, even more up close and personal due to fewer mutants with projectile-like abilities. The decision to make the fights even more brutal worked very well alongside the animalistic overtones of the story; although it may have resulted in some parents not wishing their children to see the film, despite the fact that they may have seen the other three in the series.    Of course, what would a comic book movie be without the use of visual effects? Well, obviously it would be quite boring, but that almost goes without saying. For the most part, the CGI-intensive sequences were well executed; however, there were some surprising scenes in which the effects looked a bit shoddy. Oddly, enough these scenes involved the use of Wolverine's claws, which by this point should have been mastered and no longer a cause for concern. I'm not sure what caused the problem, if it was a lack of texture on the CGI claws or what, but something was definitely off about them during a couple of scenes. Please note, that these are not pivotal scenes and that the problem was not all that detrimental to the end result of the movie, it's just something that I found frustrating and thought honestly shouldn't have occurred within the film. Otherwise, like I said, the visual effects were very good, and at times numerous sequences were truly awesome to watch and easily overshadowed any of the weaker moments in this area.    Lastly, the acting for the film, just as it was in the original three movies, remains consistently high throughout. Despite having played the role of Wolverine three times already, Hugh Jackman is still able to bring a fresh new approach to the character that is crucial to the continued success of the series. No doubt the ability for Jackman to convey such enthusiasm for the role was assisted by the fact that he was so passionate about finally getting to tell the official originfor this beloved comic book icon. Another neat aspect of the character that was explored a little further in this film than in the previous movies was Wolverine's famed \\"Berserker Rage\\" (comic book fans know what I'm talking about). Although, we don't necessarily get to see an all-out fully realized rage, we are given a much closer look at what he would be like if he succumbed to his unbridled fury, and it was obvious that Hugh enjoyed this new side to the character being explored.    Supporting Hugh are some extremely talented actors beginning with Liev Schreiber (\\"The Sum of All Fears\\"). Liev takes a role that was relatively wordless in the original film, and was tasked with creating a character that was dramatically rich, incredibly feral, and ultimately could become the nemesis to Wolverine we saw in the first movie. Not necessarily an easy job, but Liev pulled it off perfectly. He delivered a multi-layered villain that was a prime example of what Wolverine could have become if given a couple of different choices along the way, and Liev is clearly relishing every evil moment he gets onscreen. Next is actor Danny Huston (\\"30 Days of Night\\") taking over the role of William Stryker from Brian Cox (\\"X2: X-Men United\\"). Danny played Stryker with the perfect blend of subtle manipulation and malice. At times he would be fatherly, especially towards Logan (albeit only to further his own agenda), but then he would snap and show his true colors by unveiling an obviously twisted, sadistic, and potentially unstable man who wanted nothing more than unlimited power to quell the surging mutant problem.    Rounding out the supporting cast is actor Ryan Reynolds (\\"The Proposal\\") and singer turned actor Will.i.am (\\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\\"). I've become a fan of Ryan's work over the last few years, and I enjoy his unfettered sarcasm that he seems to imbue into almost every single character he portrays, but never in a way that feels unnatural or tired within in the role, mindyou. In this film, Ryan isn't given all that much screen time, but what he does get he definitely makes the most of by making his character of Wade Wilson (comic book fans know him as the Merc with the Mouth, Deadpool) an enjoyable addition to the group of rogues that Stryker has assembled. Sadly, his role was intended as an introduction to the character in hopes of getting an eventual spin-off for him as well, a tactic that most likely worked given the film's success; however, I for one wish there could have been a little more of the character in this story, not to mention fewer major tweaks to the character's origin that don't line-up with the comic books. But, I digress. Last, but not least, is Will.i.am as John Wraith, a mutant teleporter. Will shows that he definitely has potential, displaying some good comedic timing in a few scenes, and a natural charisma that makes for a more interesting character than I believe he would have been if played by another actor.    Directed by Gavin Hood (\\"Rendition\\"), \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is an incredibly fast-paced action film that delivers on all counts. Granted there are some gripes with the movie, but overall it's a very solid addition to a terrific franchise. This is a must-see for fans of the original trilogy and a perfect jumping on point for newcomers to the series.    \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Alice in Chains was my favorite band. I loved Layne's voice. I loved the music. I was so heartbroken when Layne died. It reminds so much of what I loved, thanks for bringing back the sound I love! It's different, it's missing that tortured soul & raw pain. It needs to get a little sicker.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|This is the first King book I ever bought, and I still remember the moment I bought it while on a shopping excursion with my grandmother when I was only fifteen. I remember marveling at its size, but I was undaunted: I consumed the words and pages as a ravenous bookworm and had it all read within a matter of days. To date, it is the only King book I read more than once and when the Kindle came out I was disappointed that this book wasn't available. Now that Signet finally made their King library finally available for the Kindle, I immediately purchased it so that I'd have it forever. It is King's best work, and as you can see from the reviews I am hardly alone in that opinion. I strongly urge you to purchase this book. You will be far from disappointed that you did.

B001GCUER0|5.0|This is a fantastic new show - but there's so much going on in each episode, that it really helps to go back and watch them again!!!  It's a show that doesn't give you all the answers at once....it tests your patience and makes you think!!  Not many shows do that anymore!!!!  I love this one, and hope it stays on the air for 20 more seasons!!
630529142X|5.0|The Waterboy is a very funny film starring Adam Sandler as a dimwitted waterboy who vent his frustration at his aggressors by becoming a powerful defensive tackle for a little-known college football program. Kathy Bates and Henry Winkler were great in their respective roles, and the cameo appearances by Dan Patrick, Lee Corso, Lawrence Taylor, Lynn Swann, etc. were a treat. The Waterboy is a perfect movie for any college football and Adam Sandler fan.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|but it does NOT excuse it from being pretty darn bland and uninspiring during the first half.     The main problem with the Bourne Ultimatum is that there was almost no build-up in the beginning of the movie, and that meant no reason to really care about the characters, especially Matt Damon's character.      For the first half of the movie, we were basically going into the storyline head-first, and left with a lot of confusion as to what was going on, and why we were supposed to care about this guy that kept running away, getting involved in conflicts, and constantly baffling the FBI as to his whereabouts.    The film started winning me over once the action picked up, and especially when a particularly lengthy fight scene took place around halfway through.  It was about 10 minutes before this scene took place when I finally said \\"Hey, maybe this movie has a shot to be a good one\\".      It ended up a better movie after a while, though it's probably the kind of storyline you have to pay VERY close attention to understand, so you can't afford to daydream while some very important clues in the development of the storyline are taking place.   Smack yourself if you start daydreaming :)    The ending was great.  In fact, it was the best part.  The very end I mean, because it sums up what you've just experienced while watching the film for the last two hours.    I do wish the beginning with the story development was better executed though, because jumping right in and having a guy constantly running around with a gun in his hand was just confusing to me.  Other than that, pretty good action movie.
B002KFJWBG|5.0|From the decade that gave us Pet Sounds, Revolver, Highway 61, Surrealistic Pillow, Moby Grape, Out of Our Heads, The Doors, I Never Loved a Man, Otis Live, For What It's Worth, Are You Experienced? (and the list goes on), Odessey and Oracle stands as the prettiest, most emotionally moving album of all. It is always fresh and surprising.
0385504225|5.0|I think that this was a good follow up to Dan Brown's last novel and I really enjoyed it. It was fast paced and the story was really good. Sure there was some filler, but that's the kind of book this is. It's an entertaining story and I think it was quite good.
B001DZDTWW|5.0|2112 is a story about a guy in the future. He finds a guitar in a cave, figures out a little bit how to play, then goes to the temple and tries to join his church band. But the guys in the band think he sucks, so they smash his guitar. He goes home all sad, has a dream about a world where everyone gets to be a rock star, wakes up depressed, then kills himself. Cool, huh? Well, the concept is kinda comical in a way, but the music just rocks. A must-have for any rock collection. If you buy 2112, Moving Pictures, and Permanent Waves, you'll have all the very best work of Rush.
1594488916|5.0|I LOVED this book.  I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />If you love books, the reading of them, the hint of promise each one has when you pick it up - whether first edition rare or just a new novel you picked up at this library, you will love this book.  There are so many gems throughout it.  Stories of rare books, quotes, tales of thieves, descriptions of those who collect. The author lost herself in the research for this book and it shows.<br /><br />This is the story of a book thief - or as he would describe himself, a man who collects books.  Of course he doesn't steal them!  Another man who set out to get him - and succeeded, to an extent.  And a woman who became fascinated with their story.<br /><br />I just can't describe how awesome this book was.  I read it from cover to cover in about 3 1/2 hours and literally did not move from my spot on the couch except for a quick drink break and an update to let people know how much I love this book.<br /><br />Read it. I'll be reading it again, and again - and I have no doubt finding a new treasure hidden in it each and every time.
B0021L8UPS|1.0|The only reason I watched this was people said it had a crazy twist ending, on the contrary, it was adequate at best and all I kept doing throughout the movie was trying to guess what it was.  Could it be that Esther was really the baby from the first scene - that was my first guess.  Could it be that the mother wakes up in the insane asylum - too easy.  Could it be that Esther was a schizophrenic part of the mother due to her drinking and the fact that she was artistic as well (like the mother) - sadly no.  Could it be that Esther was the reincarnate angel of Jessica sent down to smite the sinners - that would be cool, but no.  It's sad that there are serious issues in this film that don't really get discussed (developed), the death of Jessica, the fact that mom has a serious drinking issue but it's OK for the dad to down a whole bottle of wine and (almost) sleep with his daughter*  This movie had very little character development if any at all. Seriously I felt this film was all over the place. Some people got hurt of killed and no one shows any real emotion to it whatsoever.  Besides the Dad part right before the end... that was pretty chilling in my opinion, that was the only positive this movie had, that's sad.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Although predictable this is delightfully done. And that's not even comparing it to the other crap I've seen Sandra put out. Both Sandra and Ryan looked great as well. Even the Alaskan scenery was breathtaking. I loved the comedy because it wasn't over the top and it wasn't slapstick. This is indeed a good old fashion hate to romance to love story. it's about time Ms. Bullock, and thank you Ryan I finally enjoyed my time at the movies.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Now that I have had this cd for over a month and given it many, many listens I can confidently say this is the one of the best metal cd's ever.  Fans will say that this cd cannot top the mighty \\"Rust in Piece\\", but it almost gives it a run for the money.  Now I absolutely love \\"Rust in Piece\\" but along with that cd, \\"Endgame\\" is a work of Megadeth art.  By far some of the best guitar playing by arguably two of the finest metal guitarist out there today.  Mustaine is in top form and Broderick is a machine!  Take it from me, get the cd.  You will be humbled by the music and the talent behind it.  Thanks to Dave for truly going back to his roots and producing some of the finest metal for the next generation of metal-heads and \\"old-schoolers\\" alike.  If you are a fan of metal, speed metal or heavy metal, this is a must have for your collection.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan since before I was in grade school.  I grew up listening to my dad's Capitol LP's and my first cassette tape was The Beatles 20 Greatest Hits which was released in the early 80's.  This CD is an excellent compilation of all their number one hits from the US and UK.  It shows the change in style of the Beatles music from 1962 to 1970 from being a \\"simple\\" rock band to creating some of the most innovative, not to mention memorable, music to come out of the 60's.  The CD starts out with \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"From Me To You\\" and \\"She Loves You\\".  These three tracks are presented in their original mono mix while the rest of the album is in stereo.  I especially like that \\"From Me To You\\" is in mono because the stereo version had the hard pan of vocals on one side with bass, rhythm and drums on the other.  In mono everything is centered.  From the beginning and up to \\"Help\\" the tracks on here are mostly on the lighter side.  Paul's \\"Yesterday\\" starts to show a more serious side to the band and from there you can really see their music change from songs like the happy and fun \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" to music about prostitutes, \\"Day Tripper\\", and loneliness, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\".  While some may complain that their favorites are not on here (there isn't a single track from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) that's not the point of this collection.  This CD is a compilation of their number one singles and should be viewed as such.      Now, I bought this album for less than ten bucks and before the new remastered CD's were released.  I had most of these songs on older CD's so my purchase was to get a taste of what the remastered one's would sound like.  Well, I wasn't dissapointed because the quality of these versions is clearly superior to the ones from 1987 and are on par with the new remasters as well.  Now that the remasters are out I would recommend this collection for the casual Beatle fan or somebody that's never heard (Oh, how I envy you) this wonderful music from, IMO, the greatest band of all time.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|You want heavy???  Metallica brings you heavy.  Boy do they...This is the cd that should have been released after ...And Justice For All or at least after the Black Album.  Forget what you have heard and what you believe.  You should give Death Magnetic a chance.  This album is full of the guitar riffing that made Metallica famous from the beginning of their career.  \\"All Nightmare Long\\" is the song that I personally have been waiting for over the past 10 years.  \\"Broken, Beat and Scarred\\" will be a crowd pleaser for many live shows to come.  5 stars, hands down, start to finish this recording is great and only makes me yearn for a follow up that is as heavy.  As far as performing these new tunes live, Metallica does not disappoint.  \\"What don't kill ya, make ya more strong!\\"
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We enjoy the show a lot and appreciate having the episodes all in one place. It's fun to go back to the first episodes and see how the writers developed the characters.

B000YAA68C|3.0|I liked P.S. I Love You more than I thought I would but didn't love it. I absolutely hate being manipulated emotionally and that is what I expected but most of the relationship between Holly (Swank) and Gerry (Butler) is revealed through flashbacks. The movie starts with an annoying and somewhat amusing overtly long fight between the couple. The next scene shows his funeral so the viewer doesn't get too caught up in the story of them, ending up chewing fingernails in dread waiting for the moment the story changes in a bad way.<br /><br />A feel good chick-flick where the heroine moves out of a rut, wins self-respect and becomes a better person for surviving pain.<br /><br />A naked man backside parades across the screen and Lisa Kudrow's character plays the field like a talented trout fisherwoman...(is that PC?) tossing bait out and whipping it back, moving with the current til the prize fish bites. I wouldn't recommend it for family viewing or if you are annoyed by the genre.
0307454541|1.0|What an awful book.  The beginning and end waste hundreds of pages just to provide cover and justify the story in the middle.  All that plodding to pretend that the book isn't an excuse to provide lurid details of torture and sexual abuse.  My version of the book contained a \\"tease\\" - part of a chapter of the next book \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\"  The few pages presented there describe a  near-naked 13-year old girl bound and gagged and locked in a room by a tormentor.  I can't wait to get this book out of my house and into the trash where it belongs.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I loved this film, which is surprising given two things. First, I am not a food guy. I don't appreciate gourmet cooking and I can't cook anything that doesn't involve a microwave. I don't really enjoy going to restaurants and I would rather watch bowling or golf (two sports that I loathe) than any cooking show. Food plays less of a role in my life than it does for most people. Oddly enough, however, I have seen an unusually large amount of Julia Child. My ex-wife was a devoted viewer of Julia's show so her voice is emblazoned onto my brain in an indelible way. Second, I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep. I make no defense of this. She simply rubs me the wrong way. The most I can say in making a case against her is that I'm always aware of her \\"acting.\\" I find her deliberate and self-conscious and always \\"plying her craft.\\" I was delighted when I heard Katherine Hepburn make the same claim. There is no doubting her talent, but for me I'm always conscious of her as an actress assuming a role, instead of becoming the role. I will not argue against anyone who believes that she is the greatest actress of her age. This is about me and my reaction to her. And it is a positive one. So, the film had these two large marks against it from my perspective, so when I say that I loved the movie, it had a fair amount to overcome.<br /><br />So why did I enjoy this film so much, despite my built in biases? Because both the stories in the film - that of Julia Childs and Julie Power - were about everyday people deciding to do something that no one expected them to do. Julia Child undertaking French cooking more as a hobby, a pleasant way of passing the time, or Julie Powell writing her own blog detailing her cooking all of the recipes in the book that grew out of Julia's book. There is no difference between Julia learning to cook or Julie writing a blog and any of us - me, you, her, or him - undertaking a self-empowering project. (This resonated very strongly with me because I am seriously contemplating starting my own blog, either on an established website or by starting my own website.) Maybe the projects that we take on won't result in publishing a book or having a movie made, but the important thing is doing something that engages our interests, that excites us, that makes us feel, in the words of the singer Hayden, that every day is too short. This is, in short, an inspirational movie. And frankly, as I've been thinking of starting my own blog (split between writing on culture and writing on contemporary politics), I have realized that I have a built in hesitancy in starting this project that this film made me feel should not be decisive. I felt, watching this, that I should . . . just start the damned blog already! In short, just as Julie was inspired by the story of Julia Child mastering the art of French cooking, so I was inspired by Julie's story. We should all be inspired to do whatever we would like to do, but have been prevented only by fear or failure. Maybe my blog will be junk and maybe no one will read it, but I've wanted to undertake it. Hopefully the story of Julie and Julia will inspire others to take on projects that they've wanted to.<br /><br />So yeah, this movie hit me where I live. And that is the mark of a really good movie; it sucks you in and makes you a part of it.<br /><br />Even if one doesn't experience this as a inspirational film, it is a ton of fun on a host of other levels. The cast is extraordinary, with supporting actors of the quality of Stanley Tucci and Jane Lynch in small but important roles. As I said, I'm probably Meryl Streep's smallest fan, but she really nailed Julia Childs's voice. She absolutely and completely nailed the voice, even though she was physically wrong for the role. Meryl Streep is half a foot too small for the role and really has not facial resemblance to her, but make up, pulling out every trick in the book for making her look taller (extremely high heels, surrounding Steep with shorter actors, the use of extremely short actors, and the constant use of forced perspective (the technique whereby someone is moved to the foreground while everyone else is kept in the background to make them look taller - this technique is used constantly in the Harry Potter films to make the 6'1 Robbie Coltrane to look over 8' as Hagrid). Frankly, Streep is not very convincing as Child . . . except for the voice. I hit Youtube after seeing the film and watched some clips of Julia Child and cold detect no difference between Steep's voice and Childs's. I had a much easier time enjoying Amy Adams as Julie Powell. Adams is not the virtuoso that Meryl Streep is, but she always seems so tremendously natural in every role she plays. And as Julie she plays her as Everywoman. She plays just an everyday person. They definitely glam her down for the role, giving her a remarkably nondescript hairdo and minimizing her astonishing good looks (though they can't hide those huge blue eyes). (I have to confess that I also have a soft spot for Amy Adams because she bears a sharp resemblance to an ex-girlfriend.)<br /><br />The plot is a simple one. Julie Powell, feeling somewhat distraught that a pompous and somewhat absurd friend has started her own blog, decides to start her own blog. But what on? Her husband suggests doing it on something she loves. Well, she loves Julia Childs book on cooking. So she decides to cook every recipe in Childs's book and blog about it. The blog later was published as a book and . . . as the closing credits point out, made into a movie. This is all told in parallel with the story leading up to Julia Childs's growth of an interest in French cooking, her development of her interest, and her eventual publication of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, the book that popularized gourmet cooking in America. The one really odd twist in their parallel stories is when Julie learns that Julia, who was aware of the blog, was disdainful of it. I would have liked to know more about this, about precisely why she found it disrespectful. One hears few bad things about Julia Childs, but this particular tidbit does not place her in a very nice light. But you have to respect Powell for pushing forward with her own project despite the disapproval of her idol.<br /><br />One little twist delighted me. You know the game where you get to name the six people you would like to invite to dinner? One of the people I would invite is Bernard DeVoto, a brilliant man of letters from the mid-twentieth century, who wrote a series of brilliant popular histories and was a columnist for Harper's (in his column The Easy Chair DeVoto initiated a public information campaign against the attempt by some in Congress to sell off a huge percentage of public lands in America - he is credited with almost single-handedly stopping making most public lands private, arguably the greatest environmental achievement in American history). DeVoto was a tremendous prose writer, a powerful personality, and a natural teacher (Wallace Stegner was DeVoto's best student). So I was delighted when DeVoto's widow, Avis DeVoto, appeared in the film as the talent scout who let an editor at Alfred Knopf know about Julia's book. I have actually read a book that Avis solicited. She asked Wallace Stegner to write a biography of Bernard. Somewhat against his own inclination, Stegner agreed, producing the exceptionally nice bio THE UNEASY CHAIR.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film. And I hope that it inspires others, like it has me, to undertake their own projects. (I've already started researching web hosting services and seeing what site names are available.

I had a much easier time enjoying Amy Adams as Julie Powell. Adams is not the virtuoso that Meryl Streep is, but she always seems so tremendously natural in every role she plays. And as Julie she plays her as Everywoman. She plays just an everyday person. They definitely glam her down for the role, giving her a remarkably nondescript hairdo and minimizing her astonishing good looks (though they can't hide those huge blue eyes).

Julie Powell, feeling somewhat distraught that a pompous and somewhat absurd friend has started her own blog, decides to start her own blog. But what on? Her husband suggests doing it on something she loves. Well, she loves Julia Childs book on cooking. So she decides to cook every recipe in Childs's book and blog about it. The blog later was published as a book and . . . as the closing credits point out, made into a movie. This is all told in parallel with the story leading up to Julia Childs's growth of an interest in French cooking, her development of her interest, and her eventual publication of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, the book that popularized gourmet cooking in America. The one really odd twist in their parallel stories is when Julie learns that Julia, who was aware of the blog, was disdainful of it. I would have liked to know more about this, about precisely why she found it disrespectful.

DeVoto was a tremendous prose writer, a powerful personality, and a natural teacher (Wallace Stegner was DeVoto's best student). So I was delighted when DeVoto's widow, Avis DeVoto, appeared in the film as the talent scout who let an editor at Alfred Knopf know about Julia's book.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|I liked this movie.  It was cute.  She's his boss from Canada, and she's about to be deported because her visa is about to expire.  She tells him that they have to get married, otherwise he is going to lose his job if she gets deported.  He agrees even though he doesn't like her.  They go visit his parents and his Grandmother.  They spend time together, and start to fall for each other.  Not as good as \\"While you were sleeping\\", but still a movie worth watching.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|The Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone CD is music that's so compelling I am moved to tears.  The album was featured on my favorite public radio station as a gift enticement for people to contribute (more than I could afford to contribute).  I found it on Amazon and was especially drawn to the tracks from The Mission - one of my favorite movies ever.  Yo-Yo Ma's cello playing cannot be paralleled.  The album is already one of my favorite CD's.  It's on in the car almost all the time.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I was really looking forward to this soundtrack after the wonderful one that came with the movie Twilight. With the exception of the Meadow theme I did not find a single song I wanted to listen to multiple times.  Even the art work is a disapointment, they used the first Summit poster and it was bad.  All of the fan produced artwork has been superior to those produced by the studio.
B001GCUO16|4.0|I'm not going to review the movie.  That's been done elsewhere.  I just want to say that I just finished watching it for the first time (10/23/2009).  Why did I wait so long?  Because the \\"critics\\" and some fan-boys of the X-men comics said it wasn't any good.  Well, so it didn't follow the comic book perfectly.  Who cares?  The X-men movies took liberties, too.  This is a terrific movie!  Good story, good acting, plenty of action, and even (gasp) good characterization, too!  Rent it!  Buy it!  Let's have some more X-men movies!  Where the heck is X-men 4?  P.S. I gave it 4 stars because I only give 5 stars to absolutely exceptional movies.

0307389839|4.0|What an odd little book. I have read nothing else by Murakami, but knew the name, and this seemed an good place to start. The connections that Murakami makes between running and writing were quite fascinating, as are his thoughts on owning a jazz club and running an ultra marathon.      Ironically, although Murakami attributes success in writing novels and running marathons to the ability to focus, the book as a whole lacks focus. While each chapter is about running or writing, Murakami jumps randomly around the world in detailing his experiences in training for the NYC Marathon, running the Boston, running an ultra marathon in Japan, etc.      Still, a very intersting concept that makes me want to read more by the author.
B002436WJE|5.0|I like action movies and this one is exceptional planned and the actor, Liam Neeson is great.    If you like action movies, this is one to see over and over because every parent would do whatever it takes to keep their children safe.
B000001GXE|5.0|If you are looking for a definitive 8th recording this is it! The orchestra sounds spectacularly, and Kleiber's choice is to connect Schubert with tradition, that means you can listen to Beethoven in this performance. The tempos are very well chosen and the tension is always there. I also like Sinopoli's recording, but this is IMHO the way to go.
B000QCUB8I|5.0|All I can say about this album is WHOA    If you have a powerful stereo this album will rock the house like nothing I've ever heard.  Its incredibly dynamic, almost tearing the air around you.  Mix in a little alcohol and prepare to be transported to planet Justice!!    I wouldn't pick this up if you only have a boom box, there is a lot of transient sub-bass that needs real woofers (12\\"+) to do it justice.

0553381687|5.0|Don't want to make this seem a self serving review but I need to say it.  I was not a fantasy reader before I came across A Game of Thrones.  Closest things to it I read were some of Stephen King's horror-fantasy stuff, Harry Potter and Terry Pratchett's half-fantasy, half-satire Discworld series.  I remember finishing the latter, and looking for something a little more...serious.  Saw reviews for George R.R. Martin praising him, decided it couldn't hurt to give fantasy a shot, and picked up Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I read it in one sitting.  Seriously.  Since then I've read it again and again.  I recommend it to anyone who will listen to me.  Several have, and are now just as big of fans of Martin's series as I am.<br /><br />It's because of this book I love fantasy.  Because I tore through the first four books and wanted a fantasy fix while waiting for A Dance with Dragons, I got to discover Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, Scott Lynch, Joe Abercrombie, and Steven Erikson.<br /><br />But still, none of them top Martin and his Song of Ice and Fire series.  And A Game of Thrones is arguably one of the best books in the series.<br /><br />Why?  So many reasons.  Martin is simply a gifted writer, who grabs your attention and is great at both description and characterization.  He somehow makes EVERY character, no matter how big or small, captivating.  I was sucked into the lives of the citizens of  Westeros and its environs and never looked back.<br /><br />The plot is unpredictable and features huge twists.  What makes them great is they don't seem to be twists for the sake of shock value, but are deliberate and calculated on Martin's part.  When something big happens, you see the impact it has on the characters and the world.<br /><br />The story is told in point of view format, mostly from the perspective of members of the Stark family but also of Tyrion, an enigmatic member of the Lannisters, the Starks' rivals, and Dany, an exiled member of the former Westeros ruling dynasty both the Starks and Lannisters helped overthrow who is now with her brother in a distant desert region.  Won't say more than that.  While every reader will have their favorites and those who they may just groan at when they see their name, every character is well realized and even the 'boring' ones have their moments of awesomeness.<br /><br />The writing. The story and the sheer scope of the story.  The characters.  Hell, everything.  That's why this book is a great recommendation to anyone.  Add the fact that as far as fantasy goes, there aren't even that many fantastical aspects to it, and you'll be able to lure even the most leery skeptic in.helped overthrow who is now with her brother in a distant desert region.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Having heard virtually every mix of every Beatle song on every medium, I leave it up to the listener to determine their own favorite.     Are these reissues necessary?  NO!  The Beatle's popularity came at a time when the majority of us were listening to their music on POS transistor radios.  I doubt these will significantly alter your appreciation for The Beatles.    Could they have been done better?  YES?  Although I appreciate the novelty of these mini-LPs, I would have preferred a full size, hard bound book (with legible type) of all of the cover and inner sleeve art and liner notes.  Come on, at $200s plus you couldn't afford to give me full size, quality reprints of the \\"White\\" album posters?  Now that would have made for a nice boxed set.  As for the CDs themselves, I've transferred them all to slimline cases and store them next to their predecessors.  I bought them to listen to.    Is this the last version we're likely to see?  NO!  Will I buy the next version?  MORE THAN LIKELY!  WHY?  If only because it prompts me to listen more intently.  With every listen my appreciation of The Beatles simply grows.    The following is my post regarding the inner sleeves:    Outside of the novelty of these mini-LPs, I don't see the point of any of this.  That's not to say I don't appreciate these toys, but the first thing I did while waiting for delivery of my boxed sets (yes, both the mono and stereo versions) was to order some slimline CD cases.  Come on now, I bought these to listen to the music, and one of the benefits of CDs over LPs is their convenience.  The boxed sets shall remain in intact/pristine condition on display as part of my collection.    Owning everything on vinyl from the original US issues and reissues, as well as later issues of the British releases in both mono and stereo, the Blue Box sets (LPs, EPs and Singles), Blue, Red and White albums on their respective colored vinyl, and many picture discs, to the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab 1/2 speed masterpressings of The Beatles Collection (including the UHQR of Sgt. Pepper), as well as the original CD releases, owning both of these CD sets was a given, but I didn't buy them to sit in a box.    To this day my entire collection of LPs is encased in VRP (Valuable Record Protector) sleeves both to protect the vinyl from static and pulp dust, and to help preserve the inner and outer paper sleeves.  Sadly the US didn't catch on to loose plastic sleeves to protect the outer sleeves in the way the European market did.  These precautions were necessary for vinyl, but I consider them to be only a nuisance in the case of CDs.    In the end it all comes down to one thing:  SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO THE MUSIC!!!!!  Myself included.
055357342X|5.0|Storm of Swords is my favorite installment in Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, for the sheer reason that you-know-what goes down for every single character.  It's non-stop, intriguing, gripping, from start to finish, and fans will not be disappointed.    I get the feeling that this book sets the course for every character on the path they will be heading on for the rest of the series.  And when you combine that sense of resolution from the first two books with the anticipation of not knowing what's come...well, it just makes you want to read it again and again until the next installment.    Both new POVs are welcome. Samwell and Jaime have been around for awhile now.  But actually getting into their heads, seeing their perspective on things for the first time, is amazing.  Jaime in particular, among all the characters, really stood out to me.  By the end of the book I came to really like him.    The fact that Martin can do that for such an odious character in the previous installments is a testament to his writing ability.  Martin is at his best here. Every time you finish a chapter, you want to read another. Every character, even ones who were previously boring, have exhilaratingly exciting storylines.     Mysteries from the prior books are solved, while new ones are created.  There are truly, truly shocking moments here that eclipse the ones from the first two in terms of greatness.
0385504225|1.0|I don't want to talk of how disappointing I have found this book, other reviewers have done it pretty well. I just wonder what's wrong between the author and water. I mean, he keeps detailing on people drowning. One in Angels and Demons; one in Deception Point; TWO in this book. He must have some serious fears about it. Ah, for those complaining about paying 16 dollars for this book, I have said good bye to 25 euro...To Mr. Brown: next time you need money, please just ask for it, instead of writing something this bad.     P.S.     Amazon.com Review  Let's start with the question every Dan Brown fan wants answered: Is The Lost Symbol as good as The Da Vinci Code? Simply put, yes.     .........................
0553381695|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE A Song of Ice and Fire. I think George R.R. Martin is an incredible writer and probably one of the best, out of all genres, working today.  And this is a good book.  But it's not a great book.  It's crucial one to read in the series but as far as everything that made A Game of Thrones so incredible?  Most of it is lacking here.    The problem for me with ACoK is that the entire book is buildup for the last 200 pages.  For all plotlines.  And most of the POVs, even the ones for characters who in Game of Thrones were constantly thrilling, just seem to be stagnant, not going anywhere.      The best aspect of the book is that it develops the world of Westeros and its environs much, much more than its predecessors.  Thanks to the new (and probably two of the more interesting) POVs of Theon and Davos, we learn alot about the Greyjoy and Stannis factions, and consequently the cultures of the Iron Islands, Dragonstone, and R'hllor religion.  We also learn quite a bit more about the Westerosi culture and the land's dominant religion, the Seven.    This is all needed, and appreciated.    But that being said, not much really happens until the end with the final battle and developments in Jon's storylines.  Stuff just happens. Without going into detail, those POVs that you found boring in Game of Thrones?  You will find even more boring here.    It's just too much description.  And yes, stuff does happen before the last 200 pages.  But the stuff that does...just doesn't matter as much as those same kind of moments did in the first book.      If I were reviewing this after only one read, it'd be a four, even five star review.  But upon repeated readings you notice more and more flaws with it and realize not much really happens.  The main thing is, is this book is supposedly taking place during an epic war between around four armies at any given time.  And we never see any battles, except for one, and that's not until the very end.    But just keep reading.  It gets better.
B001O54NKS|5.0|Yeap, this album kicks a** all around, every song delivers, well crafted, well performed. this was Dokken at their prime. Don never sounded better and George's guitar work is perhaps his best, even when Back for the Attack runs very close. This album has power and soul. Absolutely essential for hard rock fans, buy it in this very minute!
0765322889|4.0|...and even after that, you still won't get entirely what's going on all the time in Gardens of the Moon.  But, even without a concrete beginning or end (the story begins in the midst of a military conflict and ends on the brink of another), Erikson's debut sucks you into the imperial and magical intrigue so deep you can't help but tear through the novel, and not care that you don't completly get everything.    A synopsis is impossible.  Simply put, we follow the points of view of several characters aligned with the mighty Malazan empire as well as other POVS of citizens of Darujistan, the city the Malazans are intent on taking over.  An overall story slowly but brilliantly unfolds involving political intrigue, great action both in military battles and one on one fights, ancient history, meddling gods (called Ascendants) and an intricate but extremely fascinating magic system that involves Ascendants, decks of tarot-esque cards and magic sources known as Warrens.    These aspects of the plots, especially the very likable and well-realized characters (I preferred the Darujistan characters to Malazans, but that's just me), as well as many unpredictable plot twists and developments, will keep anyone reading.  The only real problem I had is that, especially early on, GotM is a tad intimidating as, like I mentioned, you're pretty much just thrust into the action without any preamble.  It's a challenging and complex read, and may put some more leisurely readers off.      Also, one would think the character, location, magic, and term glossaries (yes, individual glossaries for each of those categories) would help lessen the reader's confusion...nope.  None of them help at all and pale in comparison to the family trees in Martin's Song of Ice and Fire or Jordan's glossaries in the Wheel of Time books, which are actually a useful resource to flip back to when one gets lost in the story.  They basically coming off as not having much effort put into them, and I feel like it would have helped me appreciate the story MUCH more if I had resources that actually helped me get what's going on.    That aside though, if you stick with Erikson and GotM, you won't be disappointed.  I was pleasantly surprised, even, but how much I truly enjoyed the book after I finished it, and I've quickly as of this review started working on the next novel in the Malazan sequence, \\"Deadhouse Gates\\".  Be forewarned, though; this, and from what I've read the other books in the series, aren't true sequels to one another.  DG only contains one group of POV characters from GotM (at least from what I've read thus far), and while it continues their story, it introduces an entire new conflict, new settings, and new characters, so just keep that in mind if you think you'll catch up with all your favorite characters right away.  Apparently It's not until the third book, Memories of Ice, that the other GotM characters return.    But I have no problem with that and I have feeling many others won't.  If you're a fantasy fan who prefers military action and pseudo-historical qualities with plenty of characters, action, and intrigue, than Erikson's Malazan series and Gardens of the Moon is for you.
B00028HBKC|3.0|Yes, I know there are over 2,000 reviews here but I think mine can be more specific with too many words. First of all this is Christ's Passion as Mel Gibson sees it, is his particular gospel. Is a very personal, very pious  version but it is not attach to the canonical gospels, there are too many deviations from scripture to call it \\"base on them\\" . Gibson used many sources outside of the Bible. Second is not historically acurate in many things. The most basic one is that the common language back then and in that area was greek, the english of the times, so you can bet when Jesus and Pilate spoke it wasn't in latin, it was probably greek, even when is very possible people back then knew the basis of many other languages and local dialects. And not going to talk about the whole crucifixion thing, anyone with a small background in ancient history knows is based on medieval images and misconceptions, is not at all a first century execution.     Perhaps the most talk about aspect of the film is the violence. Ok, Jesus received one hell of a beating, you can be sure about that, but nobody would have arrives alive at the cross after the one in the movie, even if you consider Him(as I do)to be perfect God, perfect man. I understand this is like a painting in motion, a way of display the idea of God's eternal love for us and his sacrifice for those that are not worthy of been forgiven.  Is Art, is an interpretation, but I believe Gibson and his crew went to far. The whole scourging secuence could have been half that long and the impact kept the same.    That said is a good movie, it shakes you to the core. My favorite scene, well is not on the Bible but it makes perfect sense, is when satan is tempting Jesus in the garden and a snake appears coming from Satan's robes crawling towards Him. Then Jesus stands and squashs the snake's head looking at the enemy with a firm \\"I am God, don't come with your cheap tricks to Me\\" stare. That's my God!!!, and He gets pushed by no one.If you want to see the movie, go ahead, but remember this is an artistic interpretation of the Lord's final hours, and a very violent one. Elderly people and children under 12 should stay away from this one.
B000008GAC|5.0|Appetite for Destruction may best be known for the hits like Paradice City, Welcome to the Jungle, and Sweet Child O' Mine, but the entire album oozes with the same quality as the three prior.<br /><br />A rarity in ablums these days, every song in Appetite for Destruction is uniquly amazing. in fact, my personal song is not Paradice City or Welcome to the Jungle, but Think About You.<br /><br />There isnt much to say that hasnt already been said, but its unfortunate that such a talented group of guys are no longer willing to make music together again. So if you enjoyed any of the \\"hit\\" songs in Appetite for Destruction, youll love the entire album.
B00005O3VC|5.0|You know what, I'm 28 years old and I've never seen this movie until yesterday.  LAUGHED harder than I've laughed at a comedy in a good while!  I can see why this has always been hailed as a classic.  Its like every scene is memorable and one of my favorites was with \\"Tim\\" and the rabbit.  Also loved the king yelling \\"Ni!\\" at that old woman for a shrubbery (and I thought she played her part perfectly) and then a \\"shrubber\\" just happens to be riding by.  So many running gags but not over done.  This is a real gem and I'm glad I popped it in!
B000QFCD2W|5.0|I have to say that this album is a total package. From the vocals, to the guitarwork, to the artwork.  This is a truly great Metal album in a time when great metal albums are few and far in between.  Very melodic....very catchy. I now find myself humming the choruses. I have been a metal fan since the early 80's. I have seen metal bands come and go. I have witnessed what I call the \\"stagnation period\\" in the late 80's early 90's. And I have also witnessed the RE- emergence of metal. And I have to say, King Diamond has survived it all.  His name says it all: \\"King Diamond\\".  A diamond is a symbol to me of endurance.   Because it took a lot of time, pressure, and endurance to transform into a diamond.  And in the world of metal....The end result is...\\"KING DIAMOND\\".
B001K3JF7K|2.0|This is one of those records that looks great on paper: song selection, orchestration, appealing singer.  What's not to love.  It's the singing, really.  Diana sounds slurry and indistinct, coy and phony at times.    I recommend \\"Bossa Nova Stories\\" by Elaine Elias instead.  Ms. Elias doesn't have a \\"belt 'em out\\" voice either, but does have an actual feel for the material that completely eludes Diana.
B001GCUER0|5.0|The series starts a little slowly but directors build tension in an exquisite manner.  It really takes you on a ride and is well worth watching.  A great TV experience.
B002P7UCMC|4.0|The first Rammstein album proper (excluding 2006's Volkerball which was just a bunch of live recordings and a DVD) in four years will obviously have a lot of expectations for die-hards who have been following the Teutonic pyromaniacs from the beginning, as well as those of relatively new listeners. Speaking as one of the latter (I started listening in 2006) and as someone who owns all of their studio albums, Liebe is probably Rammstein's best album since Mutter. That album saw the band diverge from synthesizers and samplings on the previous album [Sehnsucht] and focus more on bludgeoning guitars with more power chords than an Alice In Chains record. It was a fine way to diversify their musical portfolio but the two albums released after it [Reise, Reise & Rosenrot] stuck with the album's successful formula but began to stagnate since there wasn't anything different than what was on Sehnsucht or Mutter, with the exception of a few dubious experimentations that polarized many fans (remember Stirb Nicht Vor Mir?). Following this pattern, Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da should be another bunk recording exclusive to the faithful, right? You'd be inclined to think so, but something happens by the time you've finished unwrapping the plastic cover and pulling the CD case out of its cardboard confinement to lay eyes on a cover art of the band members decapitating a woman; you realize that this is, indeed, a Rammstein album.    If the previous two releases sowed the seeds of skepticism in your mind, be comforted knowing that the boys mean business this time, a notion they stamp onto your face with the gut-busting opener \\"Rammlied\\". It recalls the decade before when Rammstein made their big major label break with Sehnsucht and earned worldwide recognition (and disapproval by concerned parents everywhere) as the band chants their glorious return to the limelight (\\"Bist du einsam und allein/Wir sind hier schalte ein\\") assuring their fans that they're not about to throw in the towel so readily.    The band hasn't lost their touch for controversy and romanticist, Gothic musicianship. And the band certainly sounds like it. Check out the single \\"P****\\" (censored to Amazon's convenience) as the band belts out their excitement of traveling around the country just to experience new kinds of sexual intercourse. You'll see a lot reviewers on this page slamming it for its juvenile lyrical meaning but would you expect them not to do that? For God's sake, this is a band that made a song about a little girl who played dead and was buried alive only to alert everyone that she was still breathing by using - of all things - a musical box! It's a solid choice for a single with industrial keyboards, machine-like drums, and guitars mingling with Till Lindemann's as-always commanding, guttural vocals. The entire albums seeps with juicy cuts like this to sink your teeth into, including \\"Waidmann's Heil\\" and the title track. The band also continues to show their darker side of fascination for Western horror-themed tales on \\"Wiener Blut\\" which is actually based on a real event that I won't go further into. The band DOES reveal their softer side on this album (if you're so worried about any musician playing in anything but drop-D tuning) with \\"Fruhling In Paris\\", so if you find that irritating, I'd advise you to skip it.    As some may have pointed out, Liebe comes in two flavors: the single CD edition and the double CD edition. The single edition contains 11 songs while the double edition has a second CD which contains 16; that includes five \\"bonus\\" tracks and I use that word lightly because I don't imagine it would be impossible to fit all 16 songs on one CD and sell it like that, which makes me question whether those five songs have any place on this album at all. I recommend the double CD editon IF you can find it at a reasonable price. Otherwise, buy the single edition and download the other five.    In summary, this album pulls no punches. It's still Rammstein, the guys who like to glorify homoeroticism and doomsday, among other subjects, brutalize their instruments with barbaric strength, and suck you into their world with carefully placed samplings. It's not as uneven and erratic as Rosenrot, or as heavy and stale as Reise, Reise, but it doesn't quite reach the magnificence of Sehnsucht or Mutter. It's wedged somewhere comfortably in between and is a sure-fire way to reassure their dominance in the worldwide market of music. Parents beware; the flamethower-wielding Kommandants are back!    Top tracks: Rammlied, Haifisch, P****, Roter Sand
0783240236|5.0|*exhales deeply* 20 horror reviews down, 11 to go before I reach my \\"31 reviews for 31 days of October\\" goal. With Halloween at the tail end, October is definitely the \\"month of horror\\" should there ever be one, and \\"The Birds\\" is a definite horror masterpiece. Although this movie is over 40 years old, watching it today, there really isn't any \\"dated\\" feel to it, unlike some other horror movies of the time (such as \\"Blood Feast\\", although that movie is still enjoyable B-movie gold).    \\"The Birds\\" is full of suspense and a thickening plot, and is able to be a scary movie without relying heavily on the graphic side of horror, although I will admit there are a few scenes that were probably quite graphic for the mid '60s audience. However, this is certainly a movie that proves Alfred Hitchock the \\"Master of Suspense\\". The birds are the villain altogether, a miniature army like the dinosaurs in \\"Jurassic Park\\". And that's one of the things that makes this such a great horror movie. Usually, there's only one villain in a horror movie, but \\"The Birds\\" is able to produce a countless amount of villains, in the flocks and flocks of angry birds! Even today, such a concept is rather rare, so for it's time, it was most certainly a visionary concept, I would assume!    Although I'm probably a lot younger than most people familiar with this film, I still think \\"The Birds\\" is a suspenseful and brilliantly-done horror masterpiece. What it lacks in the gorier side of horror, it undoubtedly makes up for in the awesome writing of the film, and the all-around suspense. Highly recommended for all horror fans, especially in time for Halloween! Well, only ten more reviews to go before I reach my goal, time for a breather. Thanks for the time, and peace.
0385504225|3.0|It was a good read. I started slow but then the book drew me in, and frankly, I just wanted to finish it. It's a long one indeed. The scrambling from place to place and deciphering stuff is all too much of a copy-down from Da Vinci Code days. I know that's the genre, but it's a little too close for my own liking. At least with say Digital Fortress, Dan explored a new kind of fast-pace problem.  The end of the book (I won't tell don't worry) is a little tacky, in that it brings to bear a sense of the current political changes we see (ie new President).  One other point: This is fiction, but I'm sure, like his other books, people will take it to be solid-gold fact about the true world we all see. It isn't, folks. A hefty supposition or two is made about spirituality and it might disturb some people. The idea about the nature of the soul that the book touches on has actually been discredited in science. So read this as fiction: It's still good, not Dan's best, but is worth the purchasing price. Just don't take it seriously. Even if we think the idea is true that powerful people network together, well, it shouldn't surprise us so much should it? Throughout eons humans have done this same behavior, foolishly or to great effect, and I think that is the book's other message.  Of course you may find other 'messages' or 'morals' from it. Happy reading!
B000UJCALI|5.0|Among the seminal and influential horror films is \\"The Shining\\", which is an undisputed masterpiece, and one of the greatest psychological-horror movies of all time. Be it as lengthy as it is, \\"The Shining\\" is captivating in every second of its terrifying glory. I think one of the reasons \\"The Shining\\" is so influential is because throughout the entire movie, the characters are continually becoming developed. They grow and grow with each twist and turn of the series of events, and as the plot thickens, they still show signs of unfolding the layers of their persona.    Another thing that makes \\"The Shining\\" such a great and influential horror movie is that it became one of the definitive movies where the location plays just as big a character role as the lead characters. In this case, The Overlook Hotel, which unfolds the dark and haunting mysteries of its twisted and murderous past, showcases that it plays just as big a role as Jack Nicholson or Shelly Duvall, both of whom are amazing actors here. The concept of the building playing a charater would later influence such great, modern-day psychological horror movies such as the great \\"Session 9\\".    \\"The Shining\\" is a movie that gives a good reputation to horror, because it's one of those movies that you really have to watch a few times to truly pick up on everything thrown in your direction. I honestly didn't fully understand everything until the fourth time I saw it, and by then, the movie went from being a puzzling masterpiece to an utterly terrifying masterpiece! Watching it in the right mood, one can see why this movie made #6 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.    However terrifying this movie may be, it is undoubtedly brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed. In addition to all of these positives, the scenery and atmosphere are incredible and quite surreal at times, making the movie even better. It's for these reasons that make it understandable why \\"The Shining\\" is one of those horror movies that even non-horror fans can really like.    Another interesting thing about this movie is that it's not incredibly violent. Through the over two hours that this movie runs, there are only two kills. Although I do get a lot of enjoyment out of the gorier side of horror, I really like the fact that \\"The Shining\\" never became too graphic, because that would try to make the movie something that it's not. So bonus point for the movie staying true!    Well, I know I built this movie up as much as a skyscraper, so I hope all readers out there really enjoy it! In short, if you're willing to watch a movie's that's quite long and progressive, but heightens in it's intensity and terror until the very end, \\"The Shining\\" will be a classic for you! Be sure not to hate on it until you've seen it a few times to better understand it, because if you're like me, by about the fourth time it'll have you terrified! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|My only negative thought about this CD/DVD combination is that there isn't MORE!  We play it two to three times per day.  I plan to get one for everyone on my gifting list.  LOVE IT!  Keep up the good work and give us MORE PLEASE.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Being yet another movie that comes from The Golden Era of Horror Films, \\"The Fog\\" contains all the elements that make up a classic horror movie. It's got a great and chilling atmosphere with the mysterious fog that rolls in and out, a really cool setting with the city on the bay, great monsters that are in this case, the ghosts of the sailors, and there's even some good gore shots throughout.    Although the pace of this movie is not the fastest in a horror film, I think it's suitable to the overall atmosphere of the movie, which for the most part, is dark and surreal, the sort of tone that's set on a movie you'd watch on a stormy Friday night. By the time the movie climaxes at the end, you'll definitely feel the impact and the wait will indeed be worth it. The ending, however, is the most likely part of the movie that will be the most debatable among horror fans. I personally felt that, for the most part, it was satisfying, although it the tone of the ending was a little awkward, almost as though the writers were preparing a sequel.    With all said and done, \\"The Fog\\" is a classic, atmospheric horror movie and is highly recommended to fans seeking such a film. An ideal movie for Halloween time, be sure to pick it up in time for the 31st! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0024F08UG|3.0|A few years back I saw a HD broadcast of \\" The Towering Inferno \\" on my then less than perfect projection TV and it looked great. So when I heard this was coming out I was really pumped. While it looks very good , it still did not stand up to the broadcast HD version I saw. I tell everyone who has Blu-Ray, REVIEW YOUR MOVIE BEFORE YOU BUY!! Just cause it's on blu-ray does not mean it's been remastered and will look amazing. Take heed, cause this is one time I did not review this it was a bit disappointing to say the least.
0783226837|5.0|With this review getting me past the halfway point in my \\"31 horror movie reviews for the 31 days of October\\" concept I had, leading up to the 31st by Halloween, I figure I should add my input on yet another classic, namely \\"Tremors.\\" \\"Tremors\\" is one of those movies with a universal appeal, whether or not you're a hardcore fan of horror movies. It's got a strong plot, consistent series of events, awesome action and intensity, and characters that are very likable and the kind you want to see survive. Although it's not as graphic as other movies of the genre, highlighted by the PG-13 rating, there are some good monster-related gore scenes, like when a construction worker jackhammers a monster through the ground and blood bubbles up. There's also a lot of good laughs throughout the movie, including some brilliant one-liners that make for some down-to-earth comedy. Even more, we have a budding romance in the sub-plot that makes for a happy ending at the end. The monsters, although are kept underground in the earlier half of the movie, are amazing when shown. And of course, great monsters make a great monster movie.    The sound and picture quality of the disc is really nice, too. What's more, there's lots of extra features here that beef up the quality of the disc. I actually got this in the \\"Tremors 4-Pack\\", which has all four movies in the series, and at a great price too. Overall, I can't think of a single bad thing about this movie, or the disc it comes on. For those seeking a highly-entertaining, down-to-earth monster movie, \\"Tremors\\" will sound off a 10 on the Richter Scale! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000JLSM00|5.0|First, this was the finest performance in Wayne's career. He's darker and more bitter than any of the other role he's played before. This is also the first time John Ford and Wayne teamed up in a color film shot in Vista-vision 70mm which is brilliantly remastered to Blu-Ray. The details are so crisp and clear. Patterns in the cloth and every grove in every mountain can be seen. The story is very dark and at points disturbing to watch, but the story is just great. Jeffery Hunter does a great job in this film next to his performance of Jesus Christ in MGM's \\" King of Kings \\". Other Ford Favorites such as Ward Bond, Harry Carey Jr.. Hank Worden as Ol'Mose Harper, also make notable apperence in this picture along side a very young Natalie Wood. This a must for any Wayne/Ford fan who wants to own a fantastic Blu-ray for their collection.
B00006JMQG|5.0|One of the first horror films in history, although not the very first (1896's two-minute silent film \\"La Manoir Du Diablo\\" and 1910's absolute original \\"Frankenstein\\" both beat this movie), \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" is, to say the least, a landmark film in horror movies. Being that I watched it through the eyes of a younger horror fan, I noticed some interesting aspects. For one thing, this movie is way ahead of its time. The scenery and the use of it, something that I'll get to in a minute, is something that's rarely touched upon even nowadays, well over 80 years after the movie was made.    The scenery is really what makes this movie such a masterpiece and a film far beyond its contemporary time-frame. The settings in this movie make it like a film version of a Salvador Dali painting. All the buildings seem crooked and surreal, and the fact that whatever appears onscreen is surrounded by black even gives it the appearance of the classic \\"dream bubble\\" sort of imagery. The entire movie has a very dreamlike, actually more like nightmarish, quality to it, that takes you to another place and is, even today, unlike many many other horror films.    Another thing I find great about this movie is the acting. Silent films are usually considered movies where overacting is almost a given. However, I really didn't think there were any moments here where the acting was way too over the top. For a silent film, the acting was quite good, and the dialogue (for a silent film, which would be the words that appear on screen to read, of course) is quite poetic at times.    Bringing this review to a smooth ending, I'm glad that I was able to rewind far back in cinema time to an early and landmark horror film. Avid horror fans will hopefully be able to appreciate \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\", with is both simplistic and extravagant at the same time. Although I haven't seen too many silent films, I definitely think this is a great one, and is recommended for horror fans, especiallythose that want to watch a piece of horror history! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Sam Merlotte, played by Sam Trammell, is the sexiest thing on this show. Forget Vampire Bill or Eric...SAM. And he's even hotter on the blue ray discs so get them so you can watch his neck flush when he gets nervous.
0803731094|5.0|My 3-year-old originally got this book through Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, and we've been reading it nearly every night since.  She LOVES this book!  Unfortunately, she ripped a couple pages out of it while trying to read it herself, and so here we are on Amazon to purchase the replacement.  Definitely the best children's book we've ever had the good fortune of having in our home.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Best TV show ever.  This is what TV should be all about, great stories, impeccable acting, entertaining, intelligent.  I am addicted to this show! Long live Mad Men.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|An excellent selection of Michael Jackson's number one hits that spans the lifetime of his career.  You are very likely to find your favorite MJ song on this one.
0307277453|5.0|This is a wonderful book! Shubin, with great enthusiasm, shows how our bodies are interconnected with other species, and he makes the experience of learning about the evolutionary history of humans fun. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested the evolution.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I found this comeback CD disappointing.  None of the songs captured the excitement of Ms. Houston's earlier music.  There was nothing about the selection that said, \\"I'M BACK!\\"  Her voice is there, but her feelings are not.  She is still a great artist who can sing better music than this CD provides.  I look forward to that.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins, world-renowned biologist, takes on religion and belief in god. In 'The God Delusion', he argues that religious faith is irrational and downright dangerous to society. Dawkins does an excellent job disproving arguments given for the existence of a god, such as the Argument from Design, while also showing how science can explain many things in the universe, and how far more beautiful the scientific explanations are. Oh, and he backs his claims up with evidence, something theists refuse to do. I recommend this book to any rational person whose brain is not shut off due to religious indoctrination
0691142165|5.0|Be prepared for a very sobering and complete review of eight centuries of financial crises, complete with charts and graphs that even those who fell asleep in the Macro 101 in college should be able to understand.  This book is worth reading in its entirety, but chapters 13 to 17, in which the authors draw important lessons from the 800 years of financial folly for the present course of the \\"Second Great Contraction of 2007\\" and its aftermath, make this volume well worth the price.<br /><br />Also, be prepared for some sobering analysis of the effectiveness of central banks and government policymakers in addressing economic crisis (yes, regrettably, still not very effective even with the benefit of 800 years of history and analysis to draw on).  You will learn why This Time is Ultimately Not That Different in so many ways.  Carmen Reinhart is a brilliant economist and Ken Rogoff worked at both the Fed and the IMF so they are in a unique position to evaluate the global scope of the 2nd Great Depression in modern history, and it is the very global nature of this event that leads them to conclude that the aftermath with be long-lasting and have profound effects on the global economy for many years to come.<br /><br />While documenting the fiscal policy response to the Second Great Contraction of 2007, including the massive global government bailouts in the banking sector, Reinhart and Rogoff point out that the size and long-term impact of these measures, while profound, may be dwarfed by the effects on the U.S. national deficit and national debt of reduced Federal tax revenues during the global downturn.  With such high levels of debt and limited means to reduce government expenditures to compensate for sharp reductions in tax revenues, the ultimate effect may be a debasing of the U.S. dollar by the Fed, producing a period of increased inflation or stagflation.<br /><br />The earlier chapters describing periods of hyperinflation, bank and sovereign defaults throughouthistory are fascinating, leading up to the payoff in the final chapters, in which one can draw one's own conclusions about what course this most recent crisis will take and just as importantly, how policymakers are liable to miscalculate once again.  The Federal money-printing presses around the world are in high gear once again, more automated and sophisticated than ancient regal sovereigns clipping coins and extracting gold and silver from the royal coinage to finance their realms.<br /><br />Proving once again that history doesn't always repeat itself, but it does rhyme.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This is a job well done, great sound maybe better than the original.  Its a must have for your collection.
B002FVM9SS|5.0|Natalie's voice is amazing, and the musicianship is very sharp on this album.  Noah's Dove is a favorite track, but the album is strong throughout.  This ranks with Live Bullet among the best live recordings I have.
B00004RFFI|5.0|It came in good time and was in good shape.  The jacket and cd were like new.  My grandson (age 10) was glued to the tube the whole time! We'll keep it in our library.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|The album is great. I never heard it before so I bought it with my eyes closed, because I'm a fan. From the first song I heard I said to myself \\"man I already like it\\". This album really rocks. It's even better than what most people say. It makes a great addition to my collection. It's a must have for any rock fan out there.
B001AKTZOG|5.0|Simply listen to \\"It's Just a Thought.\\" Fogerty's a poet. I have lived by these words.<br /><br />This is a great album.
B001DZDTWW|5.0|Hello fellow fans of the mighty Canadian power trio RUSH! I have been a Rush fan since the 1970's and I love them more even today. They are my favorite band of all time. Too many people always say that they are geeks, but they just simply rock, from the guitar riffs of the 1970's, to the keyboard 1980's, 1990's and present. They are more than just great musicians, but very low key professionals. I love the fact that they have never been a \\"look at me\\" type of band. Unlike most bands of today which hunger the spotlight, they have kept their devoted fans like myself and still pack up a pretty full house at every show. My favorite bass player in the world will always be Geddy Lee. What a guy! To be able to play bass, keybords, foot pedals, and sing, WOW!! Alex is a fantastic guitar player with a style of his own. And Neil? What can I say! My favorite drummer of all time. Their music has always put me in a good mood no matter how depressing a day might be. With so much bubble gum spoiled bratts, recovered addicts bands, rap barking thugs, or \\"cool\\" country B.S.; I just put my RUSH on the stereo and enjoy their music all night or day. Thank you Neil, Geddy, Alex, for saving me every time I have been low. Your music is already programmed to play at my funeral. No geek here, just a true fan till the end. Forever and ever beyond 2112a.d.!!!!!!!
B004HD61KE|1.0|Did Rollins really write this book? I've read a couple of other book by Rollins and they were much better. The style of this book also seemed different. It's mostly Native American supernatural nonsense bordering on Voodoo cliche. Highly implausible. A big disappointment.
1416594787|5.0|Richard Dawkins shows us that the appearance of a designer is just appearance.<br /><br />How do you ask?  By pointing out design \\"flaws\\" that should not exist if we were conceived originally in our present form.  This includes a nerve that travels a lenght greater than twice the height of a human being to connect two parts less than a foot apart!(In a giraffe).<br /><br />In its different chapters he talks about microbiology and fossils.  Some reviewers complain that each of these is not done in as great detail as other books which provide emphasis in that one area, and that is true.  However the intent here is not to get lost in one area, but rather to present all areas of scientific inquiry that provide proof evolution is true, and how the different sciences coincide with each other.<br /><br />He avoids religion in this book, except where religious groups pose a challenge to evolution, specially those of the \\"Young Earth Creationism\\" creed.  His point is that these groups discount available evidence from the sciences and present challenges to evolutionary biology that are the equivalent of asking a physicist to measure the falling speed of all objects on the earth prior to accepting the theory of gravity as true.<br /><br />Interestingly one reviewer who identified himself as Jewish called Dawkin a fascist because of his ideology of portraying a struggle of the strong VS the weak Jews.  It is rather shocking to me that a Jew would call himself part of the \\"weak\\" when we consider Jews have gotten more Nobel awards for Science than any other group!<br /><br />If you are interested in an evolutionary explanation of Jewish intelligence(yes there actually is one), you might want to read \\"The 10,000 Year Explosion\\".
B001UV4XTC|3.0|Having not at all enjoyed the pointless violence of No Country for Old Men which no critics including the Academy behind the Oscars dared to admit was - well pointless! (as taken out of HC Andersen's 'The Emperors New Clothes') we went into this movie with limited expectations.<br /><br />When the movie started off in Yiddish (with only Danish subtitles) not assisting non Danish speakers much we were not sure we were actually in the right cinema.... and when we realised we in fact were we were even more sceptical as to what to expect.<br /><br />Without giving quite as much away as the earlier reviews I can just say the main characters life is depicted rather miserably - a loveless marriage, disfunctional kids with whom he shares little, a workplace where he does not seem respected, and an autistic brother staying in his home .... and knowing the Coens we were just awaiting that he would crack and slaughter everyone one by one.... lets just say he does remarkably well keeping his cool and his challenges are actually very funny. His delivery of his character is excellent and despite the relatively slow pace you are entertained all the way through.<br /><br />Being a great lover of movies 'with a message' I must agree with earlier reviews that this one does hold one, and challenges the viewer to think; A bit - but no more - unless your aim with movie reviews is to over analyse and see sublimilal messages behind every line and scene.<br /><br />Enough said - a fine little movie that keeps you entertained and makes you think - a bit - which is reason enough to see it. If you are among those who could find deepness and sophistication in No Country for Old Men I am sure this movie will change your life forever.
0812548094|5.0|Stone of Tears, the second book in the sword of truth series is another great read. For some reason when I was reading this book I got really lost as to what was going on and what exactly was the importance of some of the characters. My own fault for probably overlooking some important fact though did not deter me from giving this book a perfect 5 out of 5. The story was very interesting and just like the first part, Terry Goodkind did a very good job of character development and story telling. I only time I read books is right before I sleep but for some reason the sword of truth series has me driving to starbucks in the middle of day to read! Haha. I strongly urge people to read the first book first before reading this one. This book is full of mystery, action, and drama, don't miss out!
B001D6OKJ2|5.0|There was some kind of Creative Harmonic Convergence that Jazz was the recipient of during the brief time The Bill Evans Trio,(Bill Evans (Piano), Scott LaFaro (Bass), Paul Motian (Drums), played together. To listen to SUNDAY AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD is to become aware of a chemistry, a creative fire present in this trio. A fire that is timeless. The music on this c.d. sounds as fresh and exciting today as the moment it was expressed through these three musical artists. Sometimes I wonder how Scott LaFaro might have evolved musically. There is no doubt of his consummate gifts as a bassist. He seems to me to be exploding with musical expression. Wonder if he had the chance to develop further whether there might have come into his playing less busyness, more economy, silence. Somehow Bill Evans had that quality from the very beginning. I've never had a pianist affect me the way Bill Evans always has. Especially the ballads. This album is mostly up tempo, and yet I love it for the same reason I do the ballads. It seems to me that Bill Evans played from his heart and soul, and that he penetrated into such a depth in the region of his own being, that his own heart and soul becomes the heart and soul of the listener, in this instance - mine, too. Paul Motian's exquisite, understated and refined playing was the perfect support and complement for the trio. This is the trio against which all others have been and will continue to be measured. To listen to this album is to be touched by PERFECTION.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I found this to be entertaining and can not wait for season 9 to be available on DVD. I hope to see more in the future.
B00005R62N|5.0|\\"You're in for a surprise, you're in for a SHOCKEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!\\" The octave that Halford hits on \\"The Ripper\\" has me questioning whether he is man or beast. Unleashed in the East is the place to start and end as far as Judas Priest live albums go. The track listing reads as a greatest hits album (Sinner, Green Manalishi, Exciter, Victim of Changes, etc). Halford's vocals are front and center throughout. KK and Glen are in top form trading off deadly licks while Ian holds down the groove. I've heard some people claim that there was excessive overdubbing on this album especially with Rob's vocals, but I say who cares? This is one cd that remains on heavy rotation in my collection. An absolute must own classic. Highest Recommendation.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I got these when i found out about them while looking for some ps3 stuff on amazon. Being a past 360 owner, the controllers triggers weren't quite the quality of what they were on the 360. But now that i have these (on both of my controllers), i get the same precision out of them. Me and my friends like to play zombies on call of duty world at war, and switching the default settings changes the controls to be identical to the 360's, and it feels a lot better.  The only downside that i have (if it could even be considered one) is that the controller to me looks very weird with them on, but its not a masterpiece to begin with anyway.
031606792X|5.0|PURCHASED IT FOR MY GRAND-DAUGHTER.  IT WAS A MUST HAVE TO COMPLETE THE SAGA.  SHE COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN, A MUST HAVE!
B002S0OBFK|5.0|I had very high expectations (something I usually try to avoid because you end up disappointed 90% of the time) for this movie and I wasn't disappointed at all! I think that it's awesome! I've seen over 1000 horror movies and Paranormal Activity is definitely one of the best I've seen (top 50)! It's not one of the best I've seen only because it's one of the scariest, it's also one of the most realistic! The mix of realism, suspense and tension is just perfect!     A lot of people say that it's boring and I really don't get it. It's WAY too suspenseful to be boring. I've been trying to understand why the people that thought that it was boring went to see it since it was released. Why does someone who get bored easily go see a movie about a couple filming in their house? Why does someone who hated The Blair Witch Movie go see a similar movie? While we're at it, why does someone expect to be scared in a theater full of people? The fact that there are idiotic teens that can't stop talking and laughing 90% of the time doesn't help. Personally, I can't imagine finding a movie scary with 30 persons around me. I thought that the movie was scary (compared to most movies), but I watched it alone in the dark with an headset. The fact that I believe (or want to) in ghosts/demons helped as well. Actually, I can't imagine someone who doesn't believe in ghosts/demons finding a movie about them scary. What makes ghost/demons movies scary is the fact that maybe they exist.     Anyway, the first few minutes of the movie was the only time that I didn't feel uneasy! The atmosphere was simply creepy! Hell, even a few parts with nothing but the couple talking were creepy! I guess that it was the expectation that something really bad was going to happen. The movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and/or scary images and doesn't have any over-the-top scare, it's all about tension and suspense.     It's not for people who need action every 5 minute and over-the-top scares. It's not for people who take trailers seriously and go see movies with unrealistically high expectations. It's not for people who watch movies with a closed minded and try NOT to get scared.     Finally, if it wasn't hyped, it would be much more appreciated. Some people just HAVE to hate hyped movies. Some others are so naive that they believe the hype.    PS: All of the people who call the people who like this movie idiots or sheeps are immature idiots. Just because you think that a movie is bad doesn't mean that those who think that it's good are sheeps or stupid or whatever dumb *beep* bigots love to come up with.
0061719544|5.0|Craig is a great comedian but this shows the wonderful human side of the Super Scot. I enjoyed every page to the very end. He has an interesting way to keep you intrigued. Very easy reading. Hope he continues to write. For someone without the educational background he is brilliant; actor, writer, comedian. Can you image what he would do with an extended education ~ Einstein, Edison? I hope this book comes out in the audio verison also; wait until you hear his voice!

B000002J5K|3.0|The title given says \\"The Blues Brothers: Original Soundtrack Recording.\\" Although, on the cover of the hard copy I received it is titled \\"Music FROM the Original Soundtrack\\"<br /><br />Now, I don't complain too much because The Blues Brothers are boss and it's good enough for what I need. Title your things more accurately.
B002KAJ0AO|1.0|I grew up listening to the Backstreet Boys and have remained a fan through all of these years because of the strength of songwriting, vocal talent and the good nature of all of the members. I'm sorry to say, I was HIGHLY disappointed with this release. They sold out their signature sound to sound just like everything else that's on top 40 radio right now. It would be one thing if they were *evolving* ... GROWING. This is not evolution. The only real Backstreet Boys song on this record is \\"Bigger\\" ... and may I note that one of the writers on that song is Max Martin (this is the only Max Martin song on the entire record), who was behind previous BSB hits (majorly behind the 13x multi platinum (= 13 MILLION) certified record Millennium. I really hope this isn't an indicator of their future releases and is just a hiccup in a run of quality releases. I had found it curious that I forgot that their record came out initially because I didn't hear any support from radio, nor retail ads, when there had been for Unbreakable. Now I know why ...

B002HNA95E|5.0|A REVIEW OF MADONNA'S HITS.SOME FROM HER BEGINNING UP TO THE LATEST HIT CELEBRATION.THERE ARE A FEW GREAT SONGS MISSING BUT OVERALL WONDERFUL.
0307278255|5.0|I think this may be her best work yet. She completely and effortlessly drew me into the emotional worlds of her characters. I grew attached to them, triumphing in their victories and anguishing in their heartbreaks. The stories all had a sad air about them and there were no happy endings in a traditional sense, which made for a bittersweet read. As for the critics who claim Lahiri is just offering up \\"more of the same\\" cross cultural stereotypes, I think these powerful stories actually transcend race, gender, and class, and present universal themes of grief, loss, and familial and romantic love that can be appreciated by all. Although she might revisit some underlying issues from her previous works, these tales stand alone as works of pure art.

0321525655|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone wanting to communicate to an audience. The book is written in a logical sequence and like it's central premise uses images freely to make each major point in the book ... well visual.  Anyone that has ever been to a good presentation innately can see why they enjoyed the presentation.  And the corollary is equally true, just spoken words and bullet points do not stick and leave the audience bored and tuned out.  The most lasting lesson in the book is that \\"creativity comes from constraints\\" - less is more.  I would also recommend that you get the paperback version as opposed to the Kindle version as the latter does not show all the images and they are by definition black and white. If you are a presenter on a regular basis make sure your briefcase contains this presentation \\"bible\\".

B0013NS6EU|5.0|Where to start?  This is not just a book about thinking visually, it also contains a powerful nomenclature for problem solving in life.  There are the six types of problems (the 6 W's).  There is a look-see, imagine and show model evolving a simple image of look (crossing a railroad track), see (a train coming), imagine (how long will it take for me to cross the train track vs. how long will it will take the train to reach where I am standing) and show (the act of walking ahead). SQVID which is a \\"show tool\\", uses an amplifier analogy of trading off simple vs elaborate, quality vs. quantity, visual vs execution, individual vs comparison and delta vs status quo.  Finally the author puts it all together by using a Swiss Army knife tying everything together as a simple took kit. Simple, brilliant and a must have tool for problem solving in life.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|It is so cool to hear AIC again even without Layne. True to their sound and updated.    Now for the but.... I miss layne' aletrnative, dark, depressing, edgy vocals and lyrics.    Still its good to be back!
B001QXE0OC|4.0|\\"Kiss & Tell\\" is great, as are many of the songs on Selena's album - But it also would have been great to hear her own version of \\"If Cupid Had a Heart\\", the song she lip-synched to on \\"Hannah Montana\\" (It was played 3 times on 2 episodes of Hannah Montana, so most Selena fans know the song.) The good news is the actual original recording of \\"If Cupid Had a Heart\\" (that was played on Hannah Montana) is now available on amazon and i-Tunes! Just type in \\"If Cupid Had a Heart\\" in their search engines - it's on 2 albums! (Julie Griffin was the actual singer on the recording played on Hannah Montana). Still, this album has some great songs like \\"I Won't Apologize\\", \\"I Don't Miss You At All\\" and \\"I Promise You\\". The Scene do a great job on the album, too. Let's hope Selena does her own rock spin on \\"If Cupid Had a Heart\\" for her 2nd album. The song is catchy and could be a big hit for Selena.
0743289412|1.0|I'm A SK fan from way back, and have been off fiction for about 5 years.   I got back on with some  SK novels that I missed recently, and they were all pretty enjoyable, until I hit a wall with 'Lisey's Story'...The only reason I am commenting is because I couldn't believe that what I was reading was as boring as I thought it was. I got to page 332 and hung it up. Honestly, this is the first SK book I was bored enough with to put down. Major plot hole; if 'Lisey\\" has 20 million bucks, and doesn't trust the police, why doesn't she hire a body guard?  I guess I'll never find out , because I can't get through this. I have slogged thru many, many of SK's minor(and less bloated) works, and this is the worst by far.
0385504225|1.0|The Da Vinci Code was good.    Angels and Demons was not so good.    The Lost Symbol, the third book in this trilogy (and hopefully the last) is not good at all.  It is tedious, boring and its obvious formulaic similarity to the prior Robert Langdon books is just too much.    It is not that Dan Brown cannot write.  He has the technical tools.  I fear the problem has become that he is overly enamored with writing about things in the minutest detail to show that he has been thorough in his research.  So what.  Minutiae does not equate with a good read.  Almost anyone, with sufficient time and interest can research anything on the internet these days.  And, this fascination with Masonry has grown very tiresome.    Per his usual formula, he has a sadistic, monomaniacal antagonist, who is set on wreaking havoc of one sort or another in a plodding, methodical way.  Langdon must figure out what is going on and put a halt to the nefarious plot.  Simple enough in principle, but Brown's tiresome discourses on various and sundry things having nothing much to do with the plot makes this book nearly impossible to read.  The book seems cold and I could not become engaged with the characters at all.    Sadly, all of Brown's works reflect a similar writing style.  When you pick one up and open it you know you are going to get something remarkably like on of his other works.  That does not speak well for an author.  Compare Dan Brown to Elmore Leonard and you will see just what I mean.    Give it a miss.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|I debated which remastered Beatles CDs I would purchase to replace the original - this is the perfect CD to purchase.  It has Beatles tunes from 1962 to the end, and the improvement in the quality of the sound is astounding.  Each of the stages of their unique sound, from early rock and roll to the groundbreaking sounds of the late 60s are greatly enhanced by the remastering. From this purchase I moved on to buy my favorites such as Sgt. Pepper and Revolver, and I have my birthday and Christmas gift suggestions set for the next two years.  The Past Masters is a collection of singles not originally released on albums; the two CD set is 100 minutes of pure bliss.

0547258305|5.0|I have to be honest in saying that I felt Graceling started out a little slow.  But, the story builds very quickly until you feel like the book is going at breakneck speed towards the end.  I was fascinated by the idea of the Gracelings.  Gracelings are people born with rare talents and can be distinguished from regular people by their different colored eyes.  The lead character Katsa is one of them.  Her grace is killing people.  As she struggles with her Grace, her Uncle's command of her, and her own thoughts of who she really is, she discovers that she is more than what everyone sees.  She does this with the help of Po, a Graceling Prince.  Po is a wonderful male lead character who is willing to sacrifice everything for Katsa.  I was riveted by their developing relationship.  But, the story isn't all about finding who you are and romance.  The action takes your breathe away.  Katsa and Po must save a young princess whose father is hiding something that no one will believe.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I very much enjoy watching this series of documentaries. I am also looking forward to inviting friends over to watch them. The series is amazing and very educational. It really makes one appreciate how marvelous our home the earth is. I do wish that the extra features that were included on DVD version would have been included on the Blu-ray version also.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|There was nothing in this that I did not anticipate way before the storyline was exposed... all the \\"twists\\" fell flat and I have to rate this low.    The ending is particularly disappointing in its preachy tone; Brown seems to be building up to his own patentable 'religion' much like the Celestine Prophecy...    But what was most cheesy was the fact that the story mirrors the old Star Wars story of father and son discovering each other in a battle of good vs evil... except this time its the father with the hand cut off... The text even mentions Darth Vader, so perhaps Brown was under its influence in creating this storyline... It's almost plagiarism...    And finally, surely there has to be worse prisons than the ones in Turkey, especially one just outside Istanbul? Cheesy, cliched and unimaginative to the extreme...
B00006BC7V|5.0|One of the best albums of all time and the best Stooges. One of the most important early punk albums. Energetic and great riffs. Crazy vocals. Acid jazz and heavy rocknroll with simple blues scales. Influenced by Sun Ra and (even stealing lyrics from) the Rolling Stones and possibly Coltrane and definetly not the Velvet Underground. This is the roots of punk. The first Stooges was slow and depressing, still great, but this is totally different. Fast and fun. Don't listen to dumb hippies and close minded rock critics. A great album for all fans of rocknroll. If you want the best pre-Ramones punk get this, the other Stooges albums, the Sonics Boom, and MC5 Kick Out The Jams but don't stop there. The Ramones and Black Flag may have perfected the art but I'm sure even they'd admit noone can touch this album.
0452286751|2.0|I read this book in college at the behest of a girl with whom I was infatuated at the time. It was 1981, and she, a Polish-American conservative, was trying to save me from from my social democratic ideals, and depression, in the Age of Reagan. After I realized she really believed Ayn Rand's selfish drivel, I dropped her like a hot rock. For that, I owe Ayn Rand a debt of gratitude, for which I give two stars instead of one.    If you're young and curious about why some people can be so selfishly righteous and blind, read this book. As a cautionary tale.    As for the book itself, the stereotypes of the characters and the blatant attempt to insert a \\"philosophy\\" into fiction have been well-drawn by other reviewers. I am writing this now because America has been plunged into the Great Recession by people who tried hard to live their lives according to this dead Russian emigre's ideals.    Those ideals are easily summed up: individualism is the height of human development, extreme selfishness is the way to achieve individualism, and anything that gets in the way of selfish people achieving their goals is an evil perpetrated by jealous, inferior people hellbent on keeping the geniuses among us down.    Given Ayn Rand's background, a daughter of Czarist Russian nobility forced to flee their homeland by the Russian Revolution, her attitude is at least somewhat understandable. Unfortunately, it was seized upon by Americans who wanted to return to the Gilded Age of robber barons who railed against any regulation of their endeavors by those who believed in a common good for everyone who lived in our society. They basically scream: Government of the people, by the people, and for the people is EVIL!! It stifles individual creativity! It stifles the FREE MARKET, that great god who rewards the deserving if only given a free hand! Let us do whatever we want, whenever we want, to whomever we want, or we'll throw a tantrum!!    Like the protagonist raping the woman in this book,but, according to my would-be girlfriend of long ago, a \\"good rape\\" because it set her free of her horrible collectivist and socially responsible convictions. Like the greedy traders of Wall Street and the fixers and flippers and mortgage lenders of the subprime real estate market, who raped our economy for their own short term benefit. Like the health insurance industry profiteers, who claim that any government run plan is inherently inferior on the one hand but is in fact so insidious on the other it would somehow drive them out of business if allowed to exist on a level playing field.    Like the people who look down their noses at the less fortunate as \\"losers\\" who got where they were by their \\"choices,\\" never mind that most of the fortunate got their fortunes in one of the three old-fashioned ways: inheritance, luck, exploitation, or some combination of the three. Ayn Rand offers them convenient cover.    What it all boils down to is that Ayn Rand and her followers believe that the ideal of the spoiled brat should reign supreme over any notion of the common good. Isn't that what the Czar was really all about in the first place? If Nicholas II and his ilk weren't spoiled brats with absolute power, what else were they? And look what happened to them, and deservedly so.
B00000GAIW|5.0|One of the great rock albums.  Must be listened to from a really good CD remaster (or get the original vinyl), because some remastered versions (including this one) have not been good.  Also good with a copy of the original gatefold vinyl LP to read the lyrics and view the interesting artwork.  A pity the old great coat that was given to Ian Anderson by his dad when he left home (to keep him warm on those cold English nights as a poor struggling musician) was eventually stolen. It was an icon, as was the image of a down-and-out, ie. the wheezing Aqualung.  The music is of course, classic Tull, progressive rock, flute, rapid changes of cadence, acoustic guitar, rock guitar and vocals, at once loud and happy and mischievous, then soft with a threatening undercurrent. I bought this in 1972 on release, and never tire of listening to it.  Purchase the limited \\"25th Anniversary Special Edition Aqualung\\" featuring a 20-bit remastered sound, five additional tracks (including \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean,\\" the famed quad version of \\"Wind Up,\\" and excerpts from an Anderson interview).
B0021L9ME6|1.0|Catwoman: 3 out of 10: Halle Berry isn't the first actor to squander Oscar gold (F. cough Murray cough Abraham) but I can't recall an actor doing it so quickly.     Sure Oscar winners have old films embarrassingly show up on DVD and after a few years and ex-wives they will take a paycheck role in some European schlock. But in your next movie in which you are the star?     Berry isn't awful as simply horrible miscast (lacks a certain erotic nastiness for the role.) and apparently doesn't have the acting chops to make up the difference. One must speculate how the studio felt when the first rushes came in. It sounded so good on paper and Berry is such a big star it's doubtful that any screen test was done. Now the evidence is in front of them and the enormity of the casting mistake is obvious. Was anyone in that room brave enough to admit the emperor has no clothes?     Now Berry is hardly the worst actor in the movie (Alex Borstien as the fat horny comic relief is pretty awful but the honors go to Frances Conroy as the cat lady who is so awful one wonders if she has ever had a conversation with another human.)     (On a side note it really is amazing that I list the worst actors and Benjamin Bratt doesn't make the cut. Now that is some bad acting.)    (On another even more aside note I list the worst actors and Sharon Stone doesn't make the list. Good lord somebody call Guinness)    While the movie overall is not nearly as bad as its reputation led me to believe, Catwoman still falls short.    Along with the acting there is the horrible horrible (did I mention horrible) music which sounds like a 13 year old girls idea of what is hip; a lot of silly jumping around the city scenes; and the coup de grace, the Ferris wheel scene.     Now no-one wants to see Catwoman save cherub face boy from carny ride gone badcome to think of it no-one wants to see Batman do this either. The direction and scripting on this scene is bad Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever bad. Between this and the main villain being a cosmetic tyrant whose anti-aging cream is faulty the lightweight plot is not doing the movie any favors.    Superhero Karma at the theater is returned. For every Dark Knight there is a Catwoman. This movie might be awful by every conceivable measurement but it helps return a cosmic balance to the universe.
055358202X|2.0|This book had me wanting to \\"dance the finger dance\\" with a gun to my head. After a few thousand pages of reading about endless characters getting into conflicts with the \\"good guys\\" consistently(as in always) getting murdered (with or without some type of ancillary insult or rapage thrown in for good measure), one would think that the next thousand pages would maybe change it up a little, a curve ball per se...    Not so. In what must have originally seemed like a shockingly realistic form of writing, Martin's style has now become one of the most predictable of all time. Basically, if something is going on, some struggle or what have you, its entirely certain that whoever plays the role of the sick and deranged villain is undoubtedly going to prevail, without fail, 100% of the time, take it to the bank. It's making me wonder if I should even read on or just wait for the final installment so that I can read the last chapter. For some god-forsaken reason the \\"Iron born\\" have a couple of POV characters who have a few hundred pages devoted to them in what could have been summed up plot wise in a little under 10 pages.     Most of AFFC is literally unnecesary; I'm pretty sure you could skip it and not miss a beat in the next installment, as there have been countless story lines which have petered out and a few weak ones which have started up.    The 1, 2, and occasionally 3 star reviews here all hit the mark. It was nice to see that some other people have the same perspective on the way that this series is going. I'm gonna wait for some reviews to be written if and when part 5 pops up.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|Donnie Darko: 6 out of 10: Some movies just pass me right by. I found Amelie by the end more irritating than cute, I didn't laugh once at Rushmore, and only a hostage situation could coerce me to watch The Piano again.    Donnie Darko has a large legion of fans and I certainly understand its appeal. The acting by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Drew Barrymore is some of their best work. The rest of the cast also shines with a special kudos to Holmes Osborne as the father in what is almost always a throw away role.    The school and kids remind me of my high school from the eighties (Though this being Hollywood the music is much better than what the radio actually played in those years.) and the filmmakers certainly know how to frame a shot. I was even able to look past the Holden Caulfield and Harvey flashbacks the movie caused me to suffer.    So what went wrong the plot. Oh up until the payoff it's fine enough, in fact it is better than fine. One wonders how the filmmakers are going to pull it off. The answer is simple. They don't. If anything the end of the movie reminded me of that atrocious horror film from a few years back Soul Survivors. Like Soul Survivors the movie holds your interest with more and more implausible plot twists and coincidences then cheats at the end like a bad junior high school English essay.    Now Donnie Darko is otherwise superior to Soul Survivors and other films where the ending is a groaner (cough The Village cough), but after all that goodness the magic is gone and they couldn't pull a rabbit out of their hat. Even a six foot demonic one.

B000002GJS|3.0|I've been a huge B.A. fan for years. He didn't start out too great, but with Cuts Like A Knife in '83 and (especially) Reckless in '84, Bryan found his sound. During the '80s, he was commonly referred to as \\"cheesy\\", a claim I never found to have any merit. However, when it comes to this record, \\"Waking Up The Neighbours\\", I think that I, a Bryan Adams fanatic, would have to agree. The album has too many tracks. That wouldn't be a problem if they were all amazing, but sadly half of them are filler. The first few on the album are strong, as are some of the last few. In between though, it kinda just lags like a wounded duck trying to make it to that magical number 15. \\"Thought I'd Died And Gone To Heaven\\" is a strong track, but it could have done without the cheesy backing gang vocals that sound more than a little Def Leppard-esque.  This seems to be a running theme throughout the album. The 'woahs' in \\"Not Guilty\\" prove this. Not to mention the entire song \\"All I Want Is You,\\" which sounds ENTIRELY like Def Leppard from start to finish. The drums sound pretty cheesy in a lot of the songs as well, especially \\"House Arrest,\\" another particularly bad track that might have been saved by better lyrics and drums that didn't sound like Bon Jovi. \\"Do I Have To Say The Words?\\" sticks out, however, as a strong ballad, with a great lead guitar line and chorus. Some of the better tracks also include the opener \\"Is Your Momma Gonna Miss You?\\", the closer \\"Don't Drop That Bomb On Me,\\" the mega-hit \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You,\\" and the cheesy-sounding, yet surprisingly awesome song \\"Touch The Hand.\\" The album's stand-out track, however, is \\"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\\", which is arguably one of Bryan's best tunes from the '90s. Overall, it's Bryan Adams, so there are gonna be some great songs and some bad songs. This is probably his weakest effort, but still worth checking out for a few good songs. Just don't expect much. Check out Reckless and On A Day Like Today for some better tunes. Oh, and if you're a Def Leppard fan, you've found their missing album.
B000SSS05Q|5.0|I bought this 2 record set on vinyl back in the 70's and while I'm not normally a fan of live albums, I loved this recording from the get-go. If you've ever hung out in the wee hours, you will identify with Tom Waits on this album. A couple of years later, I was lucky enough to see his show in New Orleans' French Quarter at some hole-in-the-wall club. It was the perfect venue for him and his audience. This album was recorded in much the same kind of  intimate setting. Believe me, you will feel like you're in the audience when you listen to it.    It's difficult to place Waits in a musical genre because he has so many moods. With a voice that sounds (as he said himself) like he gargles with Drano, he can sound like a balladeer, a beatnik poet, or a jazz musician. Regardless, he is emphatically unique with an unmistakeable voice, and this recording brings out his raspiest best. Out of all his records, this most represents him as you would see him live.      From the show I saw in New Orleans, Waits uttered an ad lib that pretty well illustrates what you can expect to hear on 'Nighthawks at the Diner.'  A true chain smoker, he looked up at the audience while lighting a cigarette immediately after putting one out, and said in that scratchy voice: \\"I'm the only guy I know who has a nicotine fit between drags.\\" I recommend listening to this recording late in the evening while sampling your favorite alcoholic beverage. Enjoy.

0596522347|5.0|If you are trying to develop a presentation for business, school, or communicate anything to anyone then you need this book.     It's far more than a guide. It delves into the deeper design & psychological understandings.   Why are you making the presentation?   Who is your audience?   What do you need to convey in the simplest form?   How does design effect the message?   How should it be laid out, what effect does color and design do to the flow have on the person receiving this visual message?    I read the reviews of others who said it was not worth the cost, to those I can only say they missed the point or did not read the book in it's entirety.     In examining other books on the market this one is the most comprehensive and best written. One key element for me were the examples, the design implementation and process's that were shown in a well designed fashion.    For me this is a must have design & business library book.     If you follow and learn from the book I believe you would be guaranteed a well designed and conceived presentation.    Robert  NY
B000GPIPTW|5.0|This review is for the Pet Sounds 40th Anniversary CD + DVD.<br /><br />- Audio CD: This is a NEWLY remastered mono version followed by the same superb remixed stereo program that was first introduced on the 1997 \\"The Pet Sounds Sessions\\" box set, and then released on the 1999 one-disc audio CD.  Differences with the 40th Anniversary edition are that unlike the 1997 and 1999 versions, (a) the mono remaster comes from superior original master tapes (see Mark Linett's review) and (b) the entire CD was subsequently remastered in 24-bit format in 2000 using the HDCD process.  Although all audio CDs are 16-bit, HDCDs have 20 bits of data encoded in the standard 16-bit audio signal.<br /><br />- DVD: This is where the 40th Anniversary edition really shines.  There are two components to the DVD: the videos, and the audio.<br /><br /> - DVD Videos: There is \\"The Making of Pet Sounds\\" which is a new edit of the fun & informative 1997 promo video.  This is followed by \\"Pet Stories,\\" which includes some 4 decades worth of interviews from ALL of the Beach Boys as well as Tony Asher, Bruce Johnston, a handful of the session musicians and other music industry insiders who were there at the time.  Next is \\"Rhythm of Life,\\" a 1990's BBC-produced short video segment where Beatles' producer Sir George Martin goes to Brian Wilson's home and the two end up in the studio going through the master tape for \\"God Only Knows.\\"  The video segment ends with the original 1966 promotional films for \\"Good Vibrations,\\" \\"Sloop John B,\\" and \\"Pet Sounds.\\"  These original films are worth a watch.  The \\"Good Vibrations\\" promo film is the only one in color, and is brings to mind the \\"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\\" 1966 recording sessions from the legendary \\"Smile\\" album when Brian brought out the red fire hats.  The other two are more campy, black & white videos featuring Halloween masks, Mike drinking percolated coffee out of his boots, and The Beach Boy's playing an a pool.<br /><br /> - DVD Audio: This is the best part of the 40th Anniversary package.  For the first time, listeners can hear Pet Sounds in either (a) High-resolution 96 kHz, 24-bit PCM stereo, or (b) Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The Hi-Res stereo sounds even better than the audio CD, especially when using good-quality headphones, but again there is not a monumental difference between the three different stereo versions.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound version, however, really elevates Pet Sounds to the next level.  In the technical notes, Mark Linett says of the 5.1 mix:<br /><br />\\"In placing the sounds in the mix, we have taken a very \\"wide\\" approach to the music, and attempted to surround the listener with sound.  Note that the center speaker is barely used since the phantom center created by the left and right speakers is a much more accurate way to reproduce the desired imaging and reverb in the front channels.\\"<br /><br />This is immediately noticeable, and as Linett says, the end result is true to the original sound while surrounding the listener with a wide-spectrum aural experience.  Just as the stereo Pet Sounds was a revelation to those of us who grew up listening to the mono all those years, the 5.1 mix brings out instrumentation and vocals that were even downed-out in the stereo mixes.  The percussion is crisper and I can hear things I never noticed before, and yet when turning back to the stereo or even the mono version, sure enough those sounds are there too, just buried a little deeper.  Because of the broad sound spectrum and sparse use of the center, turning the volume up a few notches is best when playing the 5.1 Surround mix.<br /><br />- Pet Sounds booklet (liner notes): This release has newer, expanded liner notes, including more sections, added detail and even updating some of the information from the previous version.  It's really nice to see the thorough notes on the remastering and remixing processes - this information is lacking and in some cases not even included withso many remastered albums today (Led Zeppelin's \\"Mothership,\\" for example).<br /><br />- Conclusion: Of course Brian Wilson did the original mix of Pet Sounds in mono, and that will always be the true reference, the benchmark, the final authority for how Pet Sounds was meant to be heard.  Because the mono Pet Sounds on this CD is far superior, I have mothballed my 1999 CD and now strictly play the 40th Anniversary CD.  The previous remastered mono version was flat and compressed, but those problems have been remedied here, and the results are stunning.  The quality of this mono version is finally comparable to the quality of the stereo remix.<br /><br />Having a Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound DVD audio mix is a rare but welcome option for classic albums such as Pet Sounds.  The only other DVD 5.1 mix that comes to mind it The Beatles' \\"Love,\\" but that seems somewhat less significant because it is not one of their original albums.  With this release the bar has been raised for future remasters and anniversary editions - hopefully technology such as Dolby 5.1 and even 7.1 Surround Sound (not to mention Blu-Ray) will continue to be employed for projects such as these.<br /><br />Brian is a musical genius and it is thanks to him and Mark Linett that all of the versions of Pet Sounds sound as good as they do.  We are lucky to have so many options for experiencing the original Pet Sounds (and don't forget Brian's live Pet Sounds DVDs - they rock!).  This 40th Anniversary edition is now out of print, so I recommend buying a copy if you can while they are still available.  You won't be disappointed.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I've read the many of the reviews written before this one and I understand that there are many knowledgeable people when it comes to the inaccuracies of this movie. However, the criticisms are made on the acknowledgements of the facts and not on the bases of how well the actors portrayed their characters or how well the director directed this movie.  Every documentary/biography is not going to always be completely factual because let's face it, these movies are made in Hollywood. I am a big fan of r&b music and its history.  This movie was more than just entertaining to me. After seeing it, it made me want to go out and learn more about each individual person's journey from his/her beginning to his/her end.  I never would have known about a Little Walter or a Muddy Waters had it not been for \\"Cadillac Records.\\" I am a twenty-something year old woman and there are not too many people my age who were even interested in seeing this movie. It's sad that a movie this good and actors like Columbus Short, Jeffrey Wright, and Beyonce' Knowles did not receive the accolades they were due. I hope that in the near future there will be individual movies about Little Walter, Etta James, Chuck Berry, and all the other musicians in the movie because even though this movie was great, I truly believe that their lives were better than any fiction.

B001FB4W16|5.0|When I first saw a True Blood poster, I thought that this series was terrible thing to the HBO Specials, this is beacuse I'm tired of seeing vampires everywere, affortunately one day with nothing to do I turned my TV, and I saw one episode of this faboulous series, and since then I love true blood. To be honest, I actually didn't read the books, but if they are as good as the series they rock!!!!!.    The image quality of the Blu-Ray is awsome, even on the extras that are very ingenous, and the sound is really really nice, actually I love this, and since is my first series on Blu-ray I thought that i see her with love.    By the way sorry for my english, and buy True Blood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Ok, I liked Heroes season 1. The more it went on the worse it got. Season 1 was the only good Heroes. The show 24 was good to begin with, but then it got repititously stupid, so I don't watch those shows anymore.<br /><br />I was skeptical with Supernatural, but WOW! It is the first show that I have ever watched that gets better with each season. So simply put:<br /><br />Supernatural > Heroes<br />Supernatural > 24<br />Supernatural > Jericho (and I liked Jericho)<br />Supernatural > House<br />Supernatural > Any current show
B00004XQ8H|5.0|The musical archeologists of the Decca Legends series dig deep in the mud and not seldom have brought up real gems. A brilliant recording, exemplary performance this. Apart from that, the cd offers us a glimpse in a primordial world of the compostion in question: Four Last Songs. How would it feel to listen to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony only four years after completion? Or Wagner's Ring? Here is, the music paper hardly dry, a view on Strauss' swansong by a renowned Strauss interpreter, a divine soprano and an orchestra which was (and is) perhaps the best in the world.<br /><br />Not hindered by any tradition of interpretation Della Casa and B&ouml;hm have formed the standard by which all my favorites must be gauged. Over 55 years old but as fresh as if the songs were recorded yesterday. You can write pages about the spotless textual interpretation, as well as about the suprisingly up-tempo playing (Im Abendrot clocks under 6 minutes!), the original playing order of the songs (3-2-1-4) and so on. And what about Della Casa's excitingly sultry voice with uniquely distinguishing vibrato?<br /><br />What I like most about this interpretation is its insistence not to trip into the gaping hole of false sentiment this music appears to embody - a trap in which other famous sopranos (Jessye Norman!) so ostensibly plunge. For this is no music for funerals: this is music accepting death as a transition to another phase - not an end but a beginning, no sadness but comfort. Exactly as Strauss' own philosophy comprised - see for instance Death and Transfiguration, music that tends to rise up instead of move downwards into the earth.<br /><br />Della Casa's rendition, in the Lieder as well as in the operatic fragments, certainly is not faultless. In Arabella now and then an awkward moment appears. Not all notes are spot on nor exquisitely finished. But who cares when listening to a vocal highwire act of such intensity and soaring sensibility. A flesh and blood singer, not a digital perfectionist.<br /><br />Finally, Lisa Della Casa's aristocratic posture and 'old-fashioned' beauty must be mentioned, two not unimportant features of any operatic actrice, that must have made a live performance including Della Casa into a very exciting evening indeed. The Arabella fragments with that other operatic beauty from days gone past, Hilde Gueden as Zdenka, make the hearts beat faster in more than one aspect.Lisa Della Casa's aristocratic posture and 'old-fashioned' beauty must be mentioned, two not unimportant features of any operatic actrice, that must have made a live performance including Della Casa into a very exciting evening indeed.

0385474547|5.0|A story about the tragic loss of a proud man and his culture.  In the beginning of the book, Mr Achebe provides a narrative of the cultural practices and norms in this Nigerian society.  These characters are not necessarily painted with a sympathetic brush and many of their cultural practices seem to be arbitrary, capricious and harmful.  What is amazing about the first part of the book is realizing how variable the fabric of different cultures can be and wondering how certain cultural practices came to be accepted as obvious.  The characters themselves often wonder at the reasons behind these practices but they are seen as being as fixed as the African soil where their feet tread.  Regardless of your sympathies, the reader can't help but get fully absorbed in the communities involved and mourn the loss of a once proud man Okwonko.  Okwonko is a man who is wholly invested in tribal life.  His life's ambition is to be accepted in to the culture as a well-respected man.  He buys in to the rules and thinks he has a lucid path to success.  This is no different than the person who seeks power and prestige in any society.  Rules and customs are laid down and there are many folks who make it their life's goal to be successful in that society.  Tragically Okwonoko is denied his long sought after success two times.  He is first banished from his village by accidentally breaking one of the rigid, somewhat arbitrary, unquestioning rules he has so much faith in.  When he has finally climbed his way back in to the society, he finds that things have changed as white christian missionaries have infiltrated his clan.  The clash of these civilizations is illuminated in the differences between their courts and a humorous discussion of monotheism vs polytheism.  These missionaries are treated sympathetically by the author when they end the practice of abandoning twins and banishing castes of people to the fringe of society.  They are treated less sympathetically in the description oftheir mock courts which ultimately causes the final tragedy to unravel.  It is this final denial of Okwonko's dreams that is the most tragic because he has lost faith in the tribal society he was once so proud of.  He is left a shell of a man whose dreams and vision of the world and his place in it have evaporated.  When his tribemates are unwilling to fight for their way of life in the teeth of encroaching missionaries with a vastly different way of doing things, he has no other choice but to end his life.

B002HNA95E|4.0|Even with a two-disc set, it was going to be difficult to please everyone with the track listing for 'Celebration'. (Who on earth bought the single disc version? Anyone?)Just my two cents worth:<br />WIN - 'Express Yourself' is the single/video mix, not the mess from LAP; 'Dress You Up' and 'Burning Up': love that 80's guitar!Great package design and artwork. Can't wait to watch the videos.<br />FAIL - some really key tracks missing: 'What It Feels Like For A Girl'single mix, 'Power Of Goodbye', 'Deeper and Deeper', 'American Life', 'Bedtime Stories' and 'Love Profusion'. \\"Everybody' - this track wants deletin'. \\"Crazy For You\\" - over it. Same with 'Cherish'.'Celebration' as the single is a whole lotta nothing. Lack of liner notes, pics of single sleeves etc...<br /> Also I think 'Revolver' is a pretty strong track but then I quite liked 'Hard Candy'.<br />What the hell, it's Madge. You either love her or you don't. And the pin up looks fab on the bedroom door.

Great writing, very evocative, wonderful characters and just scary enough to give me chills but not nightmares.  Read it if you like knowing and living with intriguing characters, beautiful settings and twisty turny story lines. Beware of the seductive power of this book and the urge to read just one more chapter- it should come with a sleep deprivation warning!
0385333846|5.0|Slush entombs his feet / Billy Pilgrim driven mad / It had to be done    I recently replaced a lost copy of Slaughterhouse Five, gave it a quick read, and wondered what all the fuss was about. It didn't have the same punch that it had when I first read it nearly 40 years ago. Then I gave it a close read, and another and found things that weren't there, for me, even that first time long ago.    The central structural feature of S5 is the time travel of Billy Pilgrim and, given its importance, it's puzzling how readers remember the details so differently. Billy first encounters the 'time window' when escaping from the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge, in Luxembourg. He was 'bleakly ready for death' and stopped to lean against a tree to await his fate. He could not escape by going forward, going backward, or remaining still. He was in a double bind as R.D. Laing has described and his only escape was through time, his madness the 'perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.' Vonnegut describes Billy in this moment as 'like a poet in the Parthenon.'    The poet reference puts me in mind of John Keats, also called a poet in the Parthenon, writing his 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' after viewing the Elgin Marbles taken from the Parthenon. The vignettes of Billy's time travels are much like the verses of the Ode, much like the sculptures from the Parthenon. Vonnegut's Tralfamadorians 'can look at all the different moments [of time] just as we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains . . . can look at any moment that interests them.' Just as Keats could look at all the moments captured in the marble frieze.    One moment, or verse, that is particularly apt is this: 'Who are these coming to the sacrifice? / . . . What little town by river or seashore / . . . Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn? / And, little town, thy streets for evermore / Will silent be; and not a soul to tell / Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.' An eyewitness, thinking back to Dresden onthe Elbe, might very well dwell on this verse, on this urn.    'It had to be done.' Not because the Tralfamadorians say so, but because that's who we are. Billy Pilgrim survives the war, sires a son who goes off to his own war. Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Vietnam. If not war, 'there would still be plain old death,' the human condition, from which there is no escape. As Camus would have it, 'But the point is to live' and 'Live to the point of tears.'
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I understand that there will always be varying degrees of mixed reactions to even some of the best movies, but, boy, there ought to be way more negative reviews of this thing! Memo to the world...THE DARK KNIGHT IS NOT EVEN A GOOD MOVIE! Having the veneer of seriousness, self-importance, and pomposity does not a good movie make! It is a sequence of quick, confusing, messy scenes with dialogue as juvenile as in any junk movie I've seen the last decade! There really isn't all that much action, as has been proclaimed and the action that it does have is barely entertaining and is convoluted as all get out. Seen it 3 times to TRY to find redeeming qualities. The first time, only Heath Ledger saved it for me and I found myself WAITING for him to appear just so I could enjoy part of the film. The 2nd and 3rd time? Even he became annoying and I actually don't think his performance is truly Oscar-worthy.     The fighting scenes are very lazy. Looks like Batman and the bad guys are just doing kid karate chops at each other. The guy is a NINJA! He took out Al Ghul's highly trained ninjas in BATMAN BEGINS almost like it was nothing. He certainly ought to be able to more easily handle a bunch of low-level criminals, including the Joker. And what is with the uber-raspy voice and the ridiculous outfit? The voice wasn't nearly as raspy in BB and the outfit was much better in that film, too. What adds to the absurdity is that, for some odd reason, Nolan abandoned the Gothic city look in BEGINS to favor a REAL city look in TDK! Now, Joker and Batman REALLY look ridiculous in those outfits traipsing around the city.    Except for Joker, ALL characters are one-dimensional and dull. In BEGINS, the main cast was smaller and were operating with an ACTUAL script! Also in BEGINS, there were essentially no minor or non-essential characters that were given spoon-fed dialogue to ruin the proceedings, unlike in this movie. So now in this sequel, you have the main cast, multiplied by 2, with crappy dialogue, along with an army of minor cliched, dull extras that add NOTHING to the movie. Where's the depth, the emotion, the humanity? Not in this trash!
B002GU5V24|1.0|The ads lead you to believe that there are DVD's in this set.  A DVD to me means video of a live performance, but this one only has still pictures.

Even if you are a fan of DBZ... DON'T BOTHER.  Wipe this from your memory.    It makes a complete mockery of the iconic series.    My guess is someone wanted to make a movie using DBZ as the backdrop, hit it big with the kids and come out with a series crafted from the Power Rangers business model as a follow-up.  Didn't work.    Thank you.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|After a weak \\"Live At Madison Square\\" CD earlier this year which seemed to bring out the worst of his mannerisms and cockiness, Michael Buble has delivered \\"Crazy Love,\\" a wonderful surprise and bravura tour de force that has deservedly debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and maintained that position for a second week as I type this.<br /><br />Michael Buble has evolved from a derivative Sinatra wannabe into a confident singer with both emotional and musical dexterity. He has learned when to dial it up and when to pull it back. He is now at the peak of his vocal powers and has provided us proof of that with this new CD \\"Crazy Love,\\" a collection of standards from the first half of the 20th Century, some of more recent vintage and two wonderful originals, \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" and \\"Hold On.\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere I have taken Barbra Streisand to task for trotting out the same old standards we've heard a thousand times and not offering anything new. Looking at the track listing on \\"Crazy Love\\" I expected to call out Michael Buble for the same reason. I was wrong. While I see other reviewers hating the arrangement of \\"Cry Me A River\\" comparing it to a James Bond movie theme, I absolutely loved it. In general, \\"Cry Me A River\\" is one of my favorite songs and this was like no other version of the song I've ever heard. Perhaps the younger naysayers were expecting the Justin Timberlake song of the same name? \\"All Of Me\\" was free of any Sinatra-isms and \\"Georgia On My Mind,\\" a song so easily gone way over the top with (remember Michael Bolton and cringe) is tender and controlled and filled with longing. \\"All I Do Is Dream Of You\\" is a joyful, jaunty, nimble vocal which is my favorite on the CD. \\"You're Nobody Until Somebody loves you eschews the cliched swing of most versions, starting out nearly a capella then adding instruments until the big band joins in and multiplies the power of Michael Buble's vocal. And how could you fault his collaboration with Naturally 7 on the old chestnut \\"Stardust\\" turning it into a late 40s-early 50s vocal group sound, sweet and melodious. Yummy.<br /><br />When Michael Buble takes on more recent material he leaves you wanting more more recent material. He tackles the Dinah Washington/Brook Benton duet \\"Baby (You Got What It Takes),\\" ably assisted by Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings, and totally nails it. He gets vocal assistance from Ron Sexsmith on that songwriter's own \\"Whatever It Takes\\" which fits Michael Buble like a glove. I don't know if it was specifically written for him, but he makes it his own as he does with Billy Vera's signature tune \\"At This Moment,\\" shows what a real singer can do with borderline material. His cover of The Eagles' \\"Heartache Tonight\\" is pure musical alchemy, transforming California country rock into Big Band Swing gold leaving me smiling and clapping along.<br /><br />Lastly we come to the cover song that Mr. Buble has decided to title his CD with, Van Morrison's classic \\"Crazy Love\\" from his seminal album \\"Moondance.\\" Taking his cue from the song's lyric, \\"Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole/Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul,\\" Buble is laid back, showing both vulnerability and wonderment, emotional colors we've heretofore only heard hints of in his vocal pallete.<br /><br />Variously produced and primarily arranged by David Foster, Bob Rock, Michael Buble, Alan Chang and Humberto Gatica, and performed by a collection of the absolutely top studio musicians, this CD never sounds less than wonderful, intelligently conceived and perfectly realized.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is an incredible read.  It took me a little while to get into.  I did not feel as though I immediately connected with Ender, but after a few chapters I was thoroughly and hopelessly engaged.  Recently, when speaking with a friend, I commented that I cannot imagine the intellect it takes to produce a book like this, and I maintain that stand here.  It's phenomenal.  I would have to put it up as one of the best books I've read.<br /><br />The story is about a futuristic Earth, where space travel is not only possible, it's practiced.  Not only that, but humans have engaged aliens in battle out in space, and the threat of a repeat hangs heavily in the air.  This generates so much concern that the government decides to begin a search of children in hopes that they can find someone qualified enough to take on the aliens known as buggers.  They find that someone in Ender and this is the story of his discovery, training and ultimate task.  The ending is so surprising that it took my breath away.  I reread it three times.  The first time to make sure I read it correctly and the second and third times to experience again the shock of what had happened.  It's amazing.<br /><br />I know that this novel is used in many high schools, but as an adult, I read it for personal purposes and I wasn't disappointed.  I know that there are other novels in this series, but Ender's Game can be a stand alone novel as it has a beginning, middle and end without any annoying cliffhanger endings.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book and hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.

0767817664|5.0|I decided to write up this review since this is the \\"scary season.\\"  \\"Fright Night\\" is one of those great chillers that takes every cliche about vampires and somehow makes it all work well.  Chris Sarandon, a very underappreciated actor (Prince Humperdink from \\"The Pricess Bride\\" and the voice of Jack Skellington), plays vampire Gerry Dandrige to a charmingly oily, serpentine perfection without being remotely campy.  Stephen Geoffreys, who plays uber-geek best friend \\"Evil Ed,\\" lightens the mood of the film with sometimes horrific comedy, and Amanda Bearse (\\"Marcy D'Arcy\\" from \\"Married With Children) and William Ragsdale are perfectly cast as teenagers caught up in a battle of wits and wills with Dandridge.  But, the icing on this cake is Roddy McDowell's homage to Peter Cushing as the embittered, washed-up B movie vampire movie star who manages to find both his dignity and his faith as he comes to the ultimate realization that vampires DO exist and he is the unlikely choice to do battle against them.  McDowell's performance was so fine - alternatively funny and prosaic - it is worth watching this film to see how an older actor can still turn in stellar performances, who uses the script and props without letting them overpower his range.  It is such a pity this wonderful actor has since passed on since \\"Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer\\" is arguably one of his best roles.      The movie does have scary parts, so I would be leery of showing it to kids under thirteen.    Just a really, really fantastic vampire movie and well worth watching.      RECOMMENDED.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|It is hard to find movies for younger kids.  My daughter is almost four, and my step daughters are eight and twelve.  It is near impossible to find a movie for all of us to agree on.  I took my nearly four year old to see this first in the theaters and she loved it.  She gets scared a bit easily and this was no problem for her.  She also didn't mind sitting through the whole thing and we all cracked up.      When we took the older two girls they also loved this film, it appeals to all ages but isn't inappropriate for younger kids.  GREAT MOVIE!  I pre-ordered it on Amazon as soon as I could and look forward to getting all our girls together again and again for this film.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I was first introduced to Joe Bonamassa via a promotional clip off his first at the time VHS video now DVD A New Day Yesterday Live. Two songs was all it took for me to seek out the opportunity to see him live for myself. It was a few months later and I got my chance just 90 miles away at a no longer in existence blues festival. That experience took me on a road of discovery of just how far this young guitarist could go.     Evidently all the way to the Royal Albert Hall. I traveled considerably longer to be a part of that historical moment but I just had to be there. You can too. Order this DVD today. This DVD captured the moment just like you were there. From the 12 camera shots that capture every angle of the unique setting. The room itself is a supporting player in this what will become a historical document as important as Creams Farewell concert.     The short interviews leading up to the show itself set the scene that to Joe this just isn't another gig it is a huge moment in his career with the grand entrance on the stage playing the searing notes to his instrumental arrangement tribute to Django Rhinhardt. The big band he assembled for this show which included Anton Fig on second drums and Lee Thornburg on trumpet, Sean Freeman Sax and Mike Feltham on Trombone just added to the arrangements in a tasteful way.     For those of you that may be new to Joe Bonamassa may I suggest this be your entry point. Absorb this performance and watch his tour schedule. See him for yourself live. Take the time to explore his back catalogue and get caught up to speed so you can move forward with Joe as his career continues to expand and grow to legendary status. To close get this DVD and find that Avalon theatre in your town or a town near you and have that moment of discovery because this is one ride you don't want to miss. I don't know what is next for Joe. The Royal Albert Hall is a pretty good gig to aspire to. I have a feeling he is going to keep going up from there.Just a quick note to packaging. So often music DVDs lack any real effort to make the package something special. This issue has a book insert with photos and credits and a special note from Joe.

0330485385|4.0|After much hype, I decided to read this book. The entire premise of a murdered girl telling the story from heaven, was compelling to me. Overall I was pleased with this book and would recommend it to others. I do have a few \\"issues\\" though. There's a lot of editing that needs to be done in this book. We don't need several chapters on where certain characters are working or eating, it's just not necessary or important to the story as a whole. Also, time skips and it's up to the reader to keep up and realize that it's several years later. I do wish that the author would have delved a bit more into the whole heaven aspect of the story, considering that's what first attracted me to the book. I do hear that a movie has been made based on this book. I'm very interested to see how they make this young family's life appear on screen.

B0029O08WA|5.0|This is an amazing CD and far superior to the first CD Twilight. And I liked that CD very much. But these tracks are great and the more I listen to it the more mesmorized I become. I can't stress enough how awful the CD could have been with re-hashes of already released tunes and top 40 artists. YUK! YUK! YUK! This original mindblowing release was the very best way to go. I love every track but especially: The Violet Hour, Friends, Rosyln(stuck in my head all day), White Demon Love Song, Monsters, I Belong to You, Satellite Heart, The only one I See(track 13) and the wonderful Shooting the Moon. Oops and The Meadow of course. This CD PERFECTLY reflects the growing, mature and deep feelings that are the essence of the second book. Which is after all dark and emotionally difficult for all the characters. How anyone can say with any validity that they know the book is depressing but can't we have happy rock tunes is beyond me. All I can say is did you really read the book?? These Indie artists are amazing and I can't believe they were able to get them to contribute. The Twilight franchise fans should be grateful for their effort. Time to join the ranks of the grown ups and leave behind the tweenie top 40 garbage. Now I can't wait for Eclipse soundtrack which if I'm guessing right will have a harder edge. But we'll soon see. In the mean time my daughter and I will listen to this in the car and try to guess were each song will go. A fun bonding time for us. Thanks Alexandra Patsavas (musical director for this franchise) for helping me steer my daughter safely from the danger of top 40 hell. Can you imagine Beyonce's \\"Put A Ring On It\\" on this CD??? I feel sick just thinking about it.

0312427646|4.0|Books change us, and in this novella, Bennett imagines how books would change the Queen of England, if she were to start reading for pleasure. She reacts like the rest of us did when we started reading a lot: she questions everyone she meets about what they're reading, and she starts making up excuses to leave functions early or skip them altogether to read. The only problem is that more people are watching the Queen than are generally watching us. Her visitors don't know what to do with this new conversation topic, and her staff becomes increasingly uncomfortable with it. This book isn't deep or meaningful or meant to be taken very seriously, and some of it is probably a little unrealistic, but it was a quick, charming read.

1580088694|5.0|Menzel, a photographer, and D'Aluisio, who authors the text that accompanies Menzel's photography and happens to be his wife, spent a week each with thirty families in twenty-four countries. At the end of that week, Menzel and D'Aluisio paid for each family to buy an average week's worth of groceries. Each family poses with their food in their home, such as it is, and the book provides a grocery list in addition to a few pages about the family. The families vary greatly in size (both the size of the individual members and the number of family members), location, and wealth, from a family of six refugees in Chad (the total street value of their UN rations for one week: $1.23) to a family of four in Germany (total food expenditures for the week: $500.07) and many other places (including a hunting family in Greenland, which I found particularly interesting, as well as Bhutan, Bosnia, Guatemala, and - of course - the United States). D'Aluisio doesn't pass judgment on any of the families for what they eat, but it's difficult not to notice that, for example, the family from Guatemala eats almost all whole grains, fruit and vegetables, or that fifteen people in Mali eat significantly less than even a family of five in Mexico. My only complaint would be that I think the essays interspersed in the text distract from the book itself, even though I agreed with the topics in the essays. Highly recommended.

B00275EHCI|3.0|**may contain minor spoilers**<br /><br />This movie borrows quite a lot story-wise from I-Robot, though that was a much better film. Though unlike I-Robot, where robots were used basically by corporate America, in this film everyday people have a \\"surrogate\\" that carries out their day to day functions. The original inventor intended this to be a chance for those that were sick or handicapped to live a fulfilling life as a \\"normal\\" person. However, the technology has run amuck and now people have become overly-dependent on their surrogates, never leaving their own homes or in some cases their own bed it seems.<br /><br />The story is rather slow developing and it really took me about half of the movie until I was finally somewhat interested in the story. However, the ending though it was a twist I didn't foresee, was none-the-less unsatisfying. So the point of the film is to tell us that we are or will be too dependent on technology in the future? I'm not sure why so many of these \\"sci fi\\" films end up finding all the possible faults of technology rather than the good. I'm sitting here writing this review of this film and anyone with an Internet connection the world over, who can read English can read what I'm writing. Oh yeah, that technology is REAL evil and must be destroyed!<br /><br />Annoyances with the film's \\"message\\" aside, another major pitfall to the film is the acting. This is not a good role for Bruce Willis and he seems out of sorts here. And the supporting acting isn't much better or memorable.<br /><br />All in all it's a decent film though I was disappointed by the movie's \\"anti-technology\\" ending. Final grade: C+
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Like many fans of the 'old' Metallica sound, the 90's and St. Anger well..just...hurt.  And then the 'Some kind of Monster' video...ouch.  And out comes Death Magnetic - happy days are here again!  THRASH, albeit not quite the MOP or RTL-intense, we have a winner!    It is not a 'perfect' CD, and upon repeated listens, it holds up VERY well (unlike others that sound great at first, but fizzle by listen number 5).  Bottom line is that this is a SOLID heavy metal CD, and it is great to hear the 'masters' do it up right...shame how time flies, and Metallica was considered in their 'prime' in the 80's when they were in their 20's and thrash was new, daring, cool...and they were IT.  Here we are 20+ years since MOP, and what do we have?  Metallica considered \\"old HM geeks trying to pawn off HM stuff on the masses?\\" Quite frankly, I think some fans would have preferred Metallica to take the AC/DC route of 'musical progression'...which is none, but heck, they would still sound like 'Sanitarium' today, right?  Right.  I am guilty, and some of you reading this might feel the same...however the other side of my brain wants Metallica (and other bands like them) to find a magical heavy new groove/sound/etc that is NOT a re-hash of their earlier stuff.  I have felt this way about many metal bands that I have been fond of since the mid-70's that still exist today (IM, Judas Priest, Scorpions, etc) as well as the hair bands (Motley Crue, Poison, Great White, etc).  I think rap-metal was an attempt (Korn, Staind, RATM, etc) to bring the metal sound 'forward', and I really do like a lot of it, but nothing quite does it like the ole IM/JP/Metallica riffs of days gone by (Where Eagles Dare, Breakin the Law, Creeping Death).  After listening to the latest CD's from Metallica, Def Leppard, Iron Maiden and the like and hearing the 'sound' of classic heavy metal brought up to today's 'standards' and sound (as well as hipness on the lyrical end), I am one happy camper - glad to hear it isn't a 'so totally dead' thing.    So...the bottom line...this CD kicks a** and all Metallica fans should have this, as well as anyone who like the heavy metal sound...this is one first class flight the best of Heavy Metal.  Crank it and ENJOY!

B0002DB0FO|5.0|This season - and now the second, have been released on DVD.  Never heard of this show before then, but thanks to Netflix and searching for dramatic TV shows on DVD 'Everwood' popped up...and it has been a part of our lives for many months!  My wife and I have not enjoyed a drama show as much as this in quite awhile, and we are looking forward to all the seasons being released at some time (namely 3 and 4).  It would be a shame if the 3rd and 4th seasons never get released, considering so many insipid shows that have had all of their seasons released on DVD.    EVERWOOD is one of Greg Berlanti's (Brothers and Sisters) early shows, and he did it right - for 4 years until the 'sudden cancellation' (from what I read on the net).  Only the good die young, I guess.  Get what you can, as TV drama doesn't get this better that this.

A lot is revealed in this one that drowning in other people's needs and desires, the priviledge of owning one's own life is lost. Childhood trauma defines lizbeth's strengths and intravert, distant character type. She's a survivalist and is now in control of her comfort zone. This story is intense and absolutely brilliant!

B000MNP2K8|4.0|Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman first brought James Bond to the cinema in Dr. No (1962).  In the years that followed, with one exception, the two men adapted all of Ian Fleming's full length Bond novels into motion pictures.  Now over forty years later, that omission in addressed, as Daniel Craig makes his debut as Bond, the MI6 agent, licensed to kill in Casino Royale, based on Fleming's very first Bond novel, originally published in 1953.<br /><br />Each actor that assumes the role of Bond, is subjected to immense scrutiny and criticism.  Being fair haired, and looking nothing like past Bonds, is a superficial gripe against Craig.  What is hard to swallow is that someone as old as Craig (38), is supposed to be a newcomer to the double O classification.  Craig, comes to the role of Bond, looking tougher and more weathered, than Pierce Bronsnan did leaving it at age 49.  Craig being nervous about killing is a joke.  This Bond doesn't need any of Q Branch's gadgets, he will just shoot you dead, or snap your neck with his bare hands.<br /><br />In the film's first action sequence Bond engages in what is probably the most physically challenging, one on one, on foot pursuit in the history of the franchise.  The deadly serious pursuit of Mollaka (Stebastien Foucan), on and across the crane arms is so demanding, that no previous Bond would have been physically capable of attempting it.  Craig is overpoweringly masculine, and dominates the screen wherever the setting, be it Madagascar, the Bahamas, Montenegro, or Venice.<br /><br />The key element from Fleming's original story remains the same (except that the original game was baccarat), but how plausible is it that in 2006 an international criminal, and the British and American governments, would do battle at a poker table?  With the explosion in popularity of Texas hold 'em tournaments on television, watching the play here is pretty boring, regardless of how much the drama is forced.  Gambling aside, Casino Royale works well enough.  Head villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), goes through the movie with a sour expression, failing at every turn, and besides being a vicious ball slapper, doesn't really distinguish himself as a memorable villain.<br /><br />The Bond women are also the subject of scrutiny.  The exotically beautiful Caterina Murino makes a brief appearance in a sacrificial role.  The casting of Vesper Lynd is critical, as like the Contessa Teresa (Tracy) Di Vicenzo, in `On Her Majesty's Secret Service', this is a woman who captures Bond heart.  While Diana Rigg was an actress with considerable stature, it might be difficult to say the same for Eva Green (The Golden Compass), who apparently was a late selection to play Lynd.  While her performance is serviceable, whether she was the ideal choice is a very open question.  Some may not question what happens between Lynd and Bond, because the new Bond is such an unknown.<br /><br />The remake of Bond into a harder edged character, was an opportunity for the producers to take the character into the R rated category.  Surely teens have many others they relate to more than a middle aged, British spy, fighting the last war?  Instead Bond remains in the PG-13 cage.  The finale in a collapsing building in Venice is nicely done, and at the end of the mission, with M (Judi Dench) providing a little TLC, all the pieces have fallen in place, and Bond ends the film uttering his most famous line.  It has flaws, but Casino Royale is quite nicely done.<br /><br />The 2 disc version is an intermediate release, without the typically comprehensive Bondian special features.  Maryam d'Abo (The Living Daylights) has taken up being a `Bond Girl' as a cause, and an updated version of her documentary `Bond Girls Are Forever' (48 minutes) is included.  The somewhat curious selection does help pad the content, that also includes the featurettes 'Becoming Bond' (26 minutes), 'James Bond: For Real' (23 minutes), and Chris Cornell's music video for'You Know My Name'.  The two disc version has since been surpassed by the upgraded blu-ray version, which has commentary tracks, and additional extras.ersion has since been surpassed by the upgraded blu-ray version, which has commentary tracks, and additional extras.

B00003CXHJ|4.0|A DeLaurentiis production, Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000) is a World War II adventure featuring submarines operating in the Atlantic in 1942.  With plenty of tension, and some unexpected developments, the story is a bit more involved and exciting than the average underwater mission.<br /><br />German sub U-571 has been crippled in battle, and another U-boat is on the way to try and repair the craft.  The American Navy's plan is to immediately dispatch sub S-33, get to U-571 first, and attempt to capture the sub's enigma cipher machine.  With U-boats inflicting huge losses on the supply ships to Britain, and the Allies being unable to break the German codes, securing an enigma could be a decisive development.<br /><br />Mathew McConaughey is Lt. Andrew Tyler, executive officer on sub S-33, who due to lack of support from his commanding officer Lt. Commander Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), has just been denied command of his own vessel.  Aboard for the mission are Intelligence officer Major Coonan (David Keith) and Lt. Hirsh (Jake Weber), who have a plan to recover the device.  Initially luck is with the Americans as they get to the crippled sub first, and take control of her.  But the German rescue U-boat is not far behind, and sends sub S-33 to the bottom with a torpedo shot.  Tyler and a small group of sailors still aboard the U-571, scramble to get the crippled U-boat underway, and somehow manage to sink the other U-boat.  With the enigma machine miraculously still aboard, the Americans begin limping toward England, facing an uncertain future.<br /><br />The film has been criticized because the British, and not the Americans actually first recovered an enigma machine from a German sub.  Fair enough, but listening to his commentary track, director/writer Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown), appears to have a good general knowledge of WWII movies, and has done some research on submarine warfare in particular.  While the British were first, Americans did procure an Enigma machine later.  Few war films put realism before being entertaining, and Mostow explains much of the thinking behind what happens in the film.  U-571 is well-acted, and does not go over the top with panicking sailors.<br /><br />A big fan of sub films, Mostow makes sure to include a number of the more popular submarine related clich&eacute;s, stretching believability in a typically Hollywood fashion.  Since the sub is crippled, we are spared the out of control crash dive down to crush depth, where water leaks in through the hull, and bolts pop out, where the crew's eyes are glued to the depth gage, listening to someone announce the depths lower and lower.  We do however get to see U-571 take out a destroyer's communications with a deck gun, rush dive and cross underneath a ship, run silent in near darkness, survive exploding depth charges, release debris and a human body to simulate being hit, take cannon fire, restore the ability to fire at the last second, and launch their last remaining torpedo, which strikes home, sending the enemy destroyer down, in rather dated looking CGI flames.<br /><br />For pretty well done reality based fiction, this seafaring action/adventure is recommended.put realism before being entertaining, and Mostow explains much of the thinking behind what happens in the film.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I really like the Pixar movies, as does my son. He seems to go back and forth as to which one he likes the most. Right now it is between WALLE and the Incredibles. This was great movie to add to the pixar collection as it was really funny and dramatic. I like story telling, and this gave us a great story and an adventure to go on. My wife and I both told each other after we watched it that we couldn't wait until this one came out on DVD so our son could watch it as he is still too young to go the theater. This will tide me over until Toy Story 3 comes out next year, which I am sure will be another great addition to the Toy Story saga. I wish Dreamworks would take their cues from pixar and give us more meanful movies instead of the low end stuff they usually send us, with the exception of a couple of movies. Not all of their movies are safe for young kids like Pixar movies are.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|I decided to review this movie as I have read reviews of all the Harry Potter movies that have come out. The big thing I notice is that people are upset that they did not follow the book more. Have any of you nerds out there ever seen moveis based on books or comics before? They never follow the book or comic to the letter. I like the Harry Potter films more probably because I have not read the books to have any expectations. But with movies that I have read the book or comic, I don't go into it with the expectation that it will be the book to the letter. You need to go to movies for what they are, entertainment, and try to go and just enjoy them. Unless you are a movie critic, why go so crazy when they didn't make it the way you wanted. These movies are good movies. Film makers will change things from the book to make the movie flow more. Do you realize how long these movies would be if they followed the books to the letter. It would be like \\"Gettysburg\\" or \\"Gods and Generals\\", which are 4 to 6 hour movies. They were and are great movies, but they are not the best for theaters because of their length. The film makers are making Harry Potter films for theaters, not for direct to DVD movies. So when the next one comes out, go with no expectations, and see if you just might enjoy the movie more.

Rocky is a movie that should be watched by every single person who is willing to fight to have a little peice of dignity in their life. A true underdog story that motivates and inspires.

0887307280|1.0|I cannot for the life of me understand why this book gets so many four star reviews, except to say three words, \\"paid reviews perhaps\\".  This book was full of generalities and fluff.  I may have gotten a few ideas, but not enough to justify the price.  His push for buying a franchise instead of going it alone, I really have to question, as the failure rate for franchises these days is extremely high.  All in all, this book was just not worth it.  You would do better to simply read any of the latest blogs on this subject for free.

1416594787|5.0|This is the book that Richard Dawkins should have written a long time ago. He explains things so clearly for the non-specialist that one can really add to one's understanding of the important matters in biology, even those of us who have read much already. He puts some effort into rebutting creationsists. I suppose that is necessary, although I usually do not think it worth while engaging with them as they are not interested in evidence.    I think this book is a must for everyone who is interested in this area, and every thinking person should be interested in it    Donald Cameron  (author \\"Purpose of Life\\" a book about evolution and philosophy.)

0345444051|5.0|This masterful writing has one more captivated not only my interest but my psychological and mental capacity fit for fascinating inferences and a dynamic set of revelations all from the cunning words of Clarke.<br />Clarke's writing is just about as outstanding as the tales he weaves. He gives a full-circle compliment of thought, not only allowing for thoughts to repeat themselves in characters but also in the readers own mind. Each time the revelation happens, a little bit more is understood. Although this short but engrossing tale reflects a kind of god of all gods science fiction theory it is the inferences beneath this theory that truly shines through. What are humans, truly, but mere life forms set on a particular world amongst incomprehensible numbers? And what is it that we will leave behind, if anything? Weaving evolution, religion, impeccable scientific thought and the paranormal Clarke delivers a strikingly shocking tale that will speak through the ages for as long as humans are around to read it.
B000006NPY|2.0|It is hard to believe this is the same great band that put out Gish, Siamese Dream, and Pisces Iscariot. I am all for growing as an artist, but the album as a whole is just routine and spiritless. Radiohead has shown the world what good change is all about. The only song that lives up to what the pumpkins were is the first one, To Sheila, so just download that one from amazon. This truly was the beginning of the end.
0451457994|5.0|This novel is simply timeless. I doubt, while humans are still around to read it, this novel will ever lose its stark truth and its even more abysmal future for mankind. It touches on many different aspects of human nature and our uncanny ability to just kind of 'mess things up'. It poses a question of intelligence and what that really means for us and for the rest of not only the world but the universe as well.<br />Hal is just one example of our audacity for intelligence, our menacing show of what we think is right to accomplish. Even the expedition is what seems right, what seems just, and even the explorers were deceptively kept in the metaphorical dark about this mission. It is a chilling reminder of timeless existence of what we are and what we do and its similar consequences. Anybody of 'intelligence' should definitely pick this story up and give it a read. :)
B000WS8SA4|1.0|If you have lived a life of ease and a sheltered one, at that, you might believe all the stupid Philosophical mumbo-jumbo that is contained in this waste of time. If you have ever had to work for a dollar the hard way, You know, that dirty WORK word, then you will find this book to be one of the most ludicrous pieces of fiction you will ever read.

0385333846|5.0|If you want to have your mind pulled to the limits of reality and unreality with no explanation allowed then pick up this book. It's hard enough reading a book on a beach which is what I did with this and, of course, Vonnegut made it as difficult as possible for me to get my mind around every little detail he presents.<br /><br />As usual, he is not writing a story. More of a critique and a heavy satire on the world surrounding us. Unlike Cat's Cradle which seems to be a much easier read, Vonnegut really pushes his skills to a level that even he knows he oversteps. It does not make this any less of an exciting, thrilling and captivating book.<br /><br />With his repeated phrase of 'So it goes' and the main character's repetition of events in his mind creates a whirlwind, a cacophony of thought that is all at once quite human and flawed.
0739319175|3.0|If you can get over the fact that the novel at times reads like a George Lucas penned dialogue of two Wikipedia articles talking to each other and way too many cheesy melodramatic cliffhangers that leave you with winks, sly smiles, blank stares, clichés, and unanswered questions every time Brown switches scenes like a Dukes of Hazzard commercial break, then you will enjoy this book. Fortunately, although it was hard at times, I was able to get through these massive faults which do, thankfully, slow down towards the last half of the novel once the Mason back-story is established and all of the characters end up more or less in the same location. But we do not watch Star Wars or read Dan Brown, John Grisham, and Tom Clancy for their high art; we read them for their escapist abilities to thrill us with adventure, mythology, and intrigue.   Dan Brown is the go to guy for conspiracy theory mysteries these days and he once again doesn't disappoint in this aspect of the story. The problems surround his need to educate the lay reader in all of the back-story surrounding the Masons which creates the previously mentioned clunky Wikipedia-type conversations on almost every other page for the first half of the novel. I wish that he would have let some of the back-story just remain unknown to the uneducated like he did in the Da Vinci Code. Or if he felt that it was critical to the plot development just put it in a footnote or an annotated web link on the book's webpage. Point those that need the added information in the right direction, but don't train wreck your character development and flow to \\"teach\\" your reader in the middle of a scene. I assume that all of the delays in this book's publication (2 years later than advertised) were due to his trying to fold into the novel all of the background knowledge about the Masons that an uneducated reader would need to understand the story. What Brown has going for him, which saves the novel from becoming a complete train wreck, isthe fact that Robert Langdon's character has already been developed to the point that we care about him in previous novels. I also see that more than one reviewer has pointed out the many, many similarities between Mal'akh and Francis Dolarhyde from Thomas Harris's The Red Dragon which I think Brown should have anticipated and gone to greater lengths to eliminate.    With all its faults I was still pulled in enough to listen to the audiobook's 17 hrs and 51 mins in five days. I walked away from the novel intrigued about the Masons, Noetic Science, and more importantly entertained which is all that I can ask of this type of novel.
038533348X|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's creation of the Cat's Cradle is a satirical, comical and yet strikingly frightening take on the human condition and here it will, inevitably, lead us. He is extremely misleading in his simplistic, choppy, writing style that gives the opportunity for anybody and anybody who has a small amount of reading skill to pick this volume up and consume it. Though its simplicity is comforting the words spelled out in the metaphorical between-space of each line tells an entirely different tale.<br /><br />Vonnegut picks apart aspects of family and love, religion and war, science and government so well that this book is absolutely worthy of reading several times over. The most important aspect that he delves into is the concept of science. Is anyone else out there frightened of science and its ability to make new and 'better' technologies at such a phenomenal rate that eventually, inevitably, somebody is going to mess it up? Ice-nine, the scientific creation that seems like it would be a work of genius is, in fact, a work of stupidity that eventually leads to destruction and chaos. Science dooms as well as heals. Seemingly, Vonnegut ties this aspect into all his other lessons. Family, love, religion, war, science and government all heals as well as dooms those associated with it. A positively fantastic story by a complicated, yet clear-as-day, author.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|This is one of those movies you really need to watch more than once. There were things i did not realize until after i had watched it three times. Will Smith is great in this. It's funny because this action flick is also a tear jerker. You really feel this guys pain and lonliness. The scene were he is begging the manequin to speak was incredible. No this is not some kind of epic action film but it does enough to keep you interested. This movie has a good script,you could probably replace Will with almost anyone and it would be just as good. But then it probably wouldn't make as much money. LOL
0199535981|5.0|I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.<br /><br />Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years.
B002S0OBFK|2.0|This movie will get very mixed reviews. The first hour of this movie is very boring. It's mostly just this couple sitting around talking about there haunted house. But, if you stay to the end it's almost worth it. I've seen both endings and enjoyed them both. It does not make up for the first hour though. Yes, this movie does get scary toward the end but your ready to stop watching long before you reach that point.
0385341008|5.0|My wife and I listened to this book on audio download on a long drive together, and greatly enjoyed it.  This is a wonderful little book, and particularly good on tape as the wonderful production has a different reader for each of the main letter writers in the book.  The plot centers on a group of quirky characters living on the island of Guernsey -- a part of England, but located close to France and occupied by Germany for much of World War II -- immediately after the war and a young English writer who comes to know them.  The story unfolds in the form of letters written amongst the various characters.  So there are a lot of genres mixed together here: fish out of water story, humor, and romance, but also holocaust story, occupation story, small town story, etc..  In our judgment, however, the book treated all of its subject matters with respect and, though sad at times, was a delightful book.  Highly recommended.
1932100660|4.0|I am just in the beginning pages of this book and already I'm intrigued by the authors collection of research material and comprehensive study of this subject. I believe him. In a world where nutrition books come down like rain water one never knows who to put there trust in. What gave more credibility was the NPR interview I listened to in August T.Colin Campbell and his articulation in answering some very tough controversial questions. Some of the things he brings up I do question but not dismiss as he give merit to looking at it in another way. While I am still a poultry eater (not meat) I am heading toward diminishing that as well and going vegetarian. I am not sure if I could be a total Vegan but I do think about what goes to my digestion more thoughtfully every single day.
0307269981|4.0|If you have not read \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" you should read that before starting this book.  That is clearly a predecessor in a single story.  And if you have read Tattoo and enjoyed it, you should like Played With Fire too.  Between the two, I liked this one better.  It is more of a straightforward thriller.  Like the first book, there are two plots:  one relating to an investigative magazine expose, the other to a thriller with a killer.  This time, there is more thriller and less of the magazine stuff (a plus for me) and less, in general, of the disturbingly descriptive detailed sexual violence (although still too much for me).  Much more Salander (also a plus for me).  My sister said she liked it but it went off the rails with its ending that extended credulity.  Well, the ending does that, but so do the middle and the start, and I thought the ending less ridiculous then the ending of the first book (admittedly, a low bar to clear).  Still, overall fun for me -- Swedish thriller still a novelty -- and I'll read the final book in the trilogy when it comes out in English next year.
B000FC12SM|5.0|My husband bought this book after seeing Dr. Gray on TV.  Now, you have to understand my husband does not read anything he doesn't absolutely have to.  He read it and insisted I read it. I was raised with 3 brothers and grew up in a neighborhood of all boys.  Not much of this was news to me but my husband came from a family of all boys. This WAS news to him. He thought it was such important information he recommended it to quite a few people and even bought at least 6 copies for those that were resistant. He has had most return with a big Thanks.  This book will help in all male/female relationships, father/daughter, boss/employee, brother/sister, I don't need to go on do I? Call it hogwash if you want, those who read the entire book and apply it know it works.

B001BTG3OQ|4.0|Like everyone else, I have an issue with the overheating.  However, it's a lot more powerful than my old sb600 and great in every other way. The star off is for the overheating.  Obviously, the sb600 is way less powerful, but I've never had that one overheat, even after hours of continuous shooting.<br /><br />For anyone accident prone this maybe good to know:  a week after I got the sb900, I was shooting a band by a creek and accidentally dropped it into the water. It was fully submerged for a few seconds while on. When I scooped it out the screen was freaking out so immediately I turned it off and popped the batteries out.  I thought for sure it's gonna be dead, but after drying it thoroughly for several days in the sun it worked! This probably makes me love it a little more.
0316069906|5.0|Incredible book.  I have never read anything about the meat industry that was so informative without being preachy.  Foer is brutally honest, and encourages us to take a long hard look at the way we eat.  However, he never tells us what to eat or that what we're doing is wrong.  What's wrong is factory farming.  The author allows others to tell their stories as well, and is really fair in assessing what they share.  Foer has convinced me that not eating meat may not be enough, and I may need to consider cutting fish out of my diet as well.  I may be in a minority in making these choices, but I can't imagine having a clean conscience any other way.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|I've always considered Diana Krall a jazz pianist who can sing, not the other way around. She is a musician first.  When she does sing, I consider her an intimate singer. She is at her best alone with her piano, and surrounded with as few others as possible. That's why an orchestra of any kind takes away from her talent. She is special and unique, and the best album she's ever made was \\"All For You\\" dated, 1996. There was Diana, and from three to five other musicians, alone. Her voice was in it's natural lower range and each song was intimate, even the upbeat arrangements, and sung only for the listener. That's the kind of music Diana Krall is best at doing. I miss that and wish she would go back to doing that type of recording. I encourage anyone who is considering this album to order \\"All For You\\" first, and hear Diana Krall at her very best. She is a national \\"Jazz\\" treasure!

B002PEP4SC|3.0|The subtle and not-so-subtle interactions between the \\"Castle\\" TV show leads played by Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion are what for me make the show a very enjoyable bit of entertainment.  The book reads like a screenplay for one of the TV shows, and that's not altogether bad, just set expectations appropriately if you are anticipating something else.  Bought my copy for the Kindle; if there's another one released, I'll get it on the reserve list at the library.  The upsides?  1-given the popularity of the book, I can only assume it bodes well for the TV show, which almost didn't get renewed for its sophomore season.  2-While reading the book, I envisioned the TV characters in the various roles, and that worked well for me.
B0000072NV|5.0|Moonlight Shadow was a big hit for me several years ago.  Travel and moving kind of made me forget about it.  Then, one day, it came back to me.

B002ELM5HY|3.0|Mark Knopfler, once upon a time the singer-songwriter of Dire Straits, has really turned it up a couple of notches in the past decade: after doing 7 movie soundtracks from the mid-80s throughout the 90s, he released \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" in 2000, and hasn't looked back. This is his 7th studio album in this decade.<br /><br />\\"Get Lucky\\" (11 tracks; 55 min.) starts off with a pennywhistle (reminiscent of his outstanding \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Cal\\" soundtracks--still his best work to date), with strings eventually joining in. It's a gentle and beautiful opener. However \\"Hard Shoulder\\" is way too laid-back for being only the second track of an album. \\"You Can't Beat the House\\" is a lazy rocker, but rocks hard compared to most songs on here. \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" sounds like a Dire Straits song, as does \\"Remembrance Day\\" (which somehow reminds me of \\"Brothers In Arms\\"). I can't name too many highlights on here, to be honest. The vast majority of the songs is in that \\"middle of the road album rock\\" variety that I have little little patience for or interest in (and this comes from a lifelong Knopfler fan).<br /><br />I've seen Mark Knopfler in concert before, most recently on the \\"Shangri-La\\" tour in 2005 and that was an excellent evening of music. I'd go see him in concert again in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I don't share the same enthusiasm for the \\"Get Lucky\\" album. Buyer beware!
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|Finally!!! An animation about kung fu!! It was about time!<br />With an influx of animation films to choose from this one was definitely a great find.  I think animation should be fun.  Animations should also have characters do 'stuff' that live characters cannot.  Kung Fu Panda has covered them all with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments with some beautifully exaggerated fight scenes. :)  Jack Black brought his distinct comedic style and gave this Panda character and adorable-ness as well as the agility deserving of a kung fu master.  I grew up in Hong Kong watching kung fu movies as a part of my regular TV routine and this movie did fantastically in covering the basics of the authentic kung fu film: The underdog who no one believes in, comes through and surprises everyone.  There's the serious, yet wise kung fu master.  And then there's the wiser kung fu master above him.  And of course the funny supporting cast.  Perfect.  One can never watch enough movies about believing in oneself, can one?  So, go out and have some fun!  Watch this!
B00005JM02|5.0|Of all the children's movies I own, my daughter loves Finding Nemo the best and that in turn has had me watch Finding Nemo about 327 times.  Thankfully it is a wonderful movie and the more I watched it the more I came to appreciate all the wonderful nuances of the story.<br /><br />Basically this is a story of two clown fish: a father and a son.  The son, Nemo, is captured by a diver who is also a dentist.  Nemo winds up in the dentist's aquarium.  Nemo's dad begins a quest to find his son making all kinds of friends along the way while Nemo and the rest of the aquarium fish plot how to escape.<br /><br />It's a wonderful story and no wonder it has made hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /><br />In addition to the great story, the visual rendering is just plain gorgeous.  Everything is so crisp and vivid - it's like being in the ocean or in an aquarium.<br /><br />If you have a child - do yourself a favor and get this for your kid.  It has a ton of cautionary tales built in like \\"don't go with strangers\\" ---- my daughter keeps asking, \\"I want to see Nemo going with a stranger.\\" and she buries her head against my chest when Nemo gets captured.<br /><br />In addition, when your kid gets hooked on Nemo at least you can retain your sanity after watching it 200+ times....there are some shows out there that would just plain drive me nuts if I had to watch more than once.  Nemo fortunately, is not one of them.<br /><br />Get it and enjoy with your kid.

015626224X|4.0|The kind of Entitlement we feel as Americans is something made up mostly of the funk exuded from the idol we revere of ourselves as Middle Class people -- one myth created by decades of Madison Avenue advertising, and a lie like most of them -- which we don't recognize because TV and pulp infortainment have blinded us with the vulgar dazzle of celebrity-hood, until dopey, we have come to feel that we know them, the celebrated PEOPLE people; that we share their quirks and inhsecurities; that we have so much in common with them -- trouble with excess weight, with prescription drugs, papparazzi, out-of-control credit card debt -- that we are celebrities too.  That we too are people who need people who need people like us.  I mean, we're all American, aren't we?  A rich, successful and powerful classless society?  ...Of ordinary people, with excellent credit.  No?  But...  Haven't you ever travelled to strange places and looked at your fellow-citizens and wondered sometimes, Who in the world do they think they are?  So rude!  So inane!  So pretensious!  And, of course, they're our Neighbors.  Our selves.    I've heard it said, \\"With foreign travel its either palaces or poverty.\\"  But you don't have to go to another country to come face-to-face with the big P; with the unspeakable danger, Poverty.  And that's what everybody's afraid of.  Looking at a recently released and much-praised movie recently, THE WRESTLER, one sensed that this evocation in contemporary style of a favorite genre from Depression days, one had the feeling that much of the attention to it and praise of it was generated by the fact that it looked as though it might have been filmed in Manesquan, NJ; that is, on location somewhere below the poverty line.  And the public reaction was sincere embarassment on one hand, and on the other, gratitude for not being that poor oneself.    DOWN AND OUT was published in 1933, that fateful year Roosevelt got his Congress and HItler got his Reischtag; the nadir of the Great Global Depression that began in '29, and the book was possibly written two or three years earlier.  Considering the shape the world was in, with the financial systems of Europe and America and everywhere else in collapse, and including the inevitable unemployment and the resulting wide-spread poverty, it is astonishing to contemplate Orwell, young and only trying to make a career for himself, deciding to not run off to a foreign country, as he did later when he went to Spain, but deciding to leap head-first, as it were, into Poverty, POVERTY ITSELF, in the country just across the channel.  Simply to have experiences?  Simply to have something to write about?  To have subjects for his fledgling journalism?  Yes!  Apparently so.  On the final page of the book he writes that he believes he may have written a kind of Travel Book.  He did!  And the means are shocking; the effects quite free of tinted light.  Except that the second, third and fourth letter of the commonest Anglo-Saxon epithet are deleted in print, there are no euphemisms.  But oh! my foes and ah! my friends, the results are spectacular.  What extraordinary courage!  What powers of observation and description!      Here is a tourist who does not intend to look at the world through the windows of the Hilton lobby.  Imagine:  Without even a credit card!  You don't know what to say.  You stand back, gasp in admiration and wonder if you would ever have the nerve to undertake anything like it; the discomfort, the embarassment.  Work as a Dishwasher?  Me?  And you wonder if you would ever have the nerve to be as honest with yourself as you wrote it?  Honest about your squeamishness?  About your dirt hatred.  About being seen among uneducated people.  About the fear of looking dirty.  Or going a week without changing clothes.    The English have written some great travel books.  I've always admired Cunningham-Grahame and Maugham, but this book is different.  It doesn't cover much land or take a great deal of time, but it plummets to depths often ignored by other authors.  Depths of the human soul and condition so terrifying to many -- which never terrified him -- I'm reminded of that french song...    \\"Children with faithful hearts have no fear of wolves.\\"    Ritz Plongeur?  Moi?  Quelle cauchemar.

B00000DFSK|4.0|As a newer-generation U2 fan, I was interested in hearing their older material. Sure, I knew many songs from \\"The Joshua Tree\\", but beyond that, my education was lacking. Listening to \\"The Best of 1980-1990\\" seemed like a good way to catch up on the music I missed because of my age. Result? It's a good album, but as I'm quickly finding out, not a true greatest hits record.    When a band like U2 decides to go the route of a greatest hits album, there are sure to be critics following. Having the first such album cover a decade of material is a good idea; they have amassed so much music that any other attempt at cramming it all on one disc would be sure to meet with failure. Ten of the first eleven tracks are an absolute delight to listen to. Despite my young age (I was not yet born when the first of the songs from this album was released), I am familiar with most of the early ones on this disc. 'Pride (In the Name of Love)' starts off the record with an explosive energy, and from there it is, for the most part, one hit after another. I grew up listening to many of these songs, from 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking for' to 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and everything between. But the end of the album has me puzzled. It's not that the last few tracks are bad, just that I'd never actually heard of some of them before. And 'When Love Comes to Town' seems to stick out like a sore thumb on this disc.    I can't honestly say that the music on this one is bad, because that would be a lie. However, from talking with other U2 fans and attending their 2009 360 Degrees Tour, I can say that many of the earlier hits are missing from this album. Worth it? Depends on what's in your current collection, or whether or not you like having hit songs all in one place. But in this age of digital downloads, it seems that you might be better off picking out your own favorites.

B00005NTJK|5.0|Released in 1970 - a great year for music - Benefit is a wonderful experience!!! A definite classic. Still with the same line-up of Stand Up plus John Evan on piano and organ, it is the sound of a band which spread its wings and reached marvellous highs. The album was recorded in London and produced by Ian Anderson who made sure the instruments sounded fresh thus making the album age really well. The lyrics offer great insights and Ian's voice never sounded better! Songs like With You There To Help Me, Nothing To Say, To Cry You A Song and Sossity; You're A Woman are all unbelievably amazing but it would be unfair to give the aforementioned titles more credit than the others on Benefit - this album MUST be experienced as a whole! All songs are great and make up for a defining experience.   Although Aqualung gets all the glory, ultimately it is Benefit which mostly deserves it. Please note that I'm not putting Aqualung down by saying this as it's a superb masterpiece in its own right.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My DVD set arrived a few days ahead of schedule, just in time for my brother's birthday! Although it was used, it looked like new (he couldn't even tell) Overall, excellent service! Thank you:)
B000003S0P|5.0|The title track alone makes Red a classic album. That dissonent blues with its roaring guitars was labeled \\"art rock\\" at the time; but listening now, you hear the punky energy that bands like Tool and Shalack made careers from. Even Sonny Sherrock had Red influences in Last Exit. Vernon Ried loves the album, and Kurt Cobain, the ultimate do it yourself mastero, said Red  was an influance.<br /><br />And if the mix of live material fragmented Starless and Bible Black, this is not an issue on Red. Beside the title track, \\"Fallen Angel\\" and \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" are the most pristine of the 1969-74 band. The live \\"providence\\" dovetails with the closer, \\"Starless,\\" perfectly. Nothing seems patchy as it did on Bible Black<br /><br />Ian McDonald was about to rejoin the band, and you can hear how Fripp had found a more potant, ecconomical way to intagrate jazz instruments in what was becoming increasingly hard rock.<br /><br />Had the band stayed together, they might have done their best work. Pity. But Red more than compensates.

B000003S0B|5.0|The common buzz with this album is that it is too much like the first, In The Court Of The Crimson King. That may be arguable for the first--well, I was going to say side, but now we have to say half.<br />For the second, this is just not true.<br /><br />\\"Cat Food\\" is King Crimson moving forward at warp speed, with Keith Tippit's jazzy improv panio. It is a perfect song, and nothing like anything on In The Court. \\"Devils Triangle.\\" is Fripp working with a mellotron in far more dissnonet ways than on Mach I.<br /><br />And even if you listen to \\"Pictures of A City\\" or \\"Cadence And Cascade,\\" it is more Crimso expnading on ideas they laid down than copying them. \\"Pictures\\" has more complicated stops and has a funkiness thanks to Peter Giles tight and chunky bass work. \\"Cadence\\" with its light flute and accustic guitar, is far from the trippy keybords on talk to the wind.<br /><br />The title track is a copy. Ok. Ok.
B001GJOL22|3.0|Concert itself: 5 stars  Video quality: 5 stars  Audio quality: 2 stars ( the low frecuencies are really really absent.... its not joke!, i have a lot of concerts and the 5.1 mix from this BD is not good. I prefered the stereo option)  Extras: 3 stars
B00064WSNM|4.0|This album is one of the worst King Crimson pieces as far as conception, but also has some of their best music.<br /><br />What a quandry: \\"Great Deceiver,\\" \\"Lament\\" and \\"Nightwatch\\" are three of Crimso's best tracks. That art funk they started to establish was truely edgey--edgey as the most underground prog, such as Henry Cow and about thrity Vertigo bands I could list. \\"Fracture\\" and the title track are even more exciting. They feature some of Fripp's best work as a composer and improviser, and Wetton's bass playing is increadibly athletic and adventurous--from the sound of his hands around that Fender Persicion thick neck, remind me never to pi-s John Wetton off.<br />Even the Mincer and We'll let you know are nice snippets of what this and could do live, and make no mistake, this was a killer live band<br /><br />The problem is, none of this really cohears. Crimson should have probably done what Pink Floyd did with Ummagumma-one great studio album and one great live one, realeased as a classic double set. This would have worked much better than the patchwork that keeps this album from being top flight.

B001G0MFOM|4.0|I might not have purchased this final season had I accepted the negative reactions I've read.  Now that I've just finished watching it, I feel the series has had a satisfying conclusion which included seeing, if only briefly, characters from the past.  (The Dylan storyline could have been much better thought out, though.)      The over-the-top marketing about \\"Who Killed Jennie?\\" put the wrong slant on the final series as I don't believe she was killed.  The better question to have asked as a framing device for the season would have been \\"Who was Jennie?\\" As Bette said, she was complex.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|The Ear Force X41 wireless headphones was a wise investment. The sound of a theater in your ears, being able to hear sounds I couldn't hear normally. I just wish they would make a recharge system like the xbox controllers recharge pack. A feature that is VERY much appreciated is the chat volume automatically increases and decreases with the game volume. I can hear my buddies even through the loudest game effects.If you play COD4 and plan on playing COD modern warefare 2 then these headphones become 100 times more usefull. put on the dead silence perk and you will be able to tell where any enemy is from 30 feet away and you will be able to pinpoint their exact location just from the sound.
B002RSDW80|5.0|So...you saw the reviews and the clip shows and this film got quite a bit of hype during its theatrical release.  It boils down to this: when was the last time that you saw a film that delighted you?  Nice people, good marriages, and no explosions or crime scene autopsies is reason enough to enjoy this DVD.  You have already heard about the canonization of Streep for her performance. Please put all of the praise and hyperbole aside and enjoy this fine film.  Stanley Tucci alone is well worth the effort.  Sometimes happy things happen to good people, so enjoy the fine performances within the two delightful period pieces that compose this film.
068485743X|5.0|Excellent book!  Good review of things that can be done to tighten up your writing and simply make you a better writer.
0385504225|1.0|Like most of the literate public, I cheered and eagerly awaited Mr. Brown latest effort.  I love The Da Vinci Code and had read it in first printing.  The movie was absolutely awful, which took much of the glow off the book.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol simply stinks.  I read it all out of an ill-considered optimism.  It still stank.<br /><br />I will not likely buy his books in the future.  If I hadn't pre-ordered it, after reading Maureen Dowd's review in the NYTRB, I probably could have saved $20.<br /><br />\\"A must to avoid\\".
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|i laughed out loud at several points in this book. being my first Sedaris book, you can rest assured that i will be downloading more this afternoon. lots of fun. if you like his writing or his radio you will not be dissappointed.
1401302378|4.0|I am a graduate student in mass communication and though I was required to read this book for class, I have to say it is one of the better books I've read in a very long time. I would recommend it to any business owner, journalist and even to other college students trying to determine a career path. It is well-written, easy-to-understand and 100% relevant even though a couple years have gone by since it's release. If anything it is a little wordy, still great though.
B001UV4XTC|3.0|A sort of black comedy comprised of multiple vignettes rich in Judaica with ample synagogue chanting and Yiddish melodies throughout.  Seems to center on one man's multiple troubles as portrayed by humorous/troubled characters and interludes--some of which are simultaneously entertaining, ambigous and difficult to decipher.  Have to think more about this one.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I can still remember the feeling of electric delight that went through me when I first heard this album.  While cynics can dismiss it as derivative, obnoxious, mindless frat-rock, I feel like they're missing out.  This album is the most visceral expression of joy I have ever heard.  It's triumphant, vibrant and elating.  Exploding with hedonistic zeal, this is an album about being alive and present in the purest sense.  Whether one enjoys it ironically or sincerely, the feeling is the same: delighting, uplifting and intoxicating.  And in case anyone is wondering, I'm being dead serious.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|I've been a Buble fan since his first CD.  A young guy doing the great standards in Sinatra fashion, but with fresh arrangments, etc.  His CDs prior to this release included a couple of contemporary tracks, one, \\"Home\\" charted for him. So now he's gone over to the other side!  There ARE a number of standards on this new CD, but the arrangements on most are horrendous. This one is selling, so I guess the Buble, I knew and dug because of his smooth, fresh way of interpreting The Great American Songbook has decided to move on.  Sad, really.
B0029O08WA|3.0|I loved the Twilight soundtrack and was expecting the same quality, if not better, for New Moon. There were a few good songs but I didn't love it. Of course it's not gonna be upbeat like Twilight and I expected that but... if it wasn't for the fact that its New Moon, I would have just downloaded the songs I liked.
B000THIHA4|2.0|Only good song is Harder Better Faster Stronger. The rest of the album just annoys me. Too much repetitive beats and noises... it was causing me to stress out instead of getting in the zone. Didn't really take me anywhere except a loop. If you must sample the songs and buy à la carte.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well made and very disturbing/creepy film. Isabelle Fuhrman is brilliant as Esther, one of the craziest movie characters I've ever seen and Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga turn in their usual great performances. CCH Pounder does her thing also and is one of our most underrated yet familiar film faces. I'm sure you've heard all about it by now so I'm not repeating what's been said or written to death. Just order this one immediately, if you haven't already. With Halloween falling on a Saturday this year, it will be the perfect centerpiece for my annual horror film marathon. I usually pass out candy to the kiddies and watch fear flicks until I pass out or hit a late party afterwards. This year's features include Orphan, Trick 'R Treat, Drag Me To Hell, Night Of The Creeps, and The Children. With all of this Amazon supplied entertainment, I'll probably just stay in for the night and enjoy one of my best Halloween's ever.
B000002KGT|1.0|I know because of the 'popularity' of this album I will catch a lot of flak for this, but so be it. Rumours have been known to destroy others many times in the past and this case is no exception! This album,(and the induction of Stevie-(Baaaa)- Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham into Fleetwood Mac), killed this Great Band starting with the pop tripe of 'Rumours'. \\"Heroes Are Hard to Find\\" was the last \\"REAL\\" Fleetwood Mac album, which also proved the title point. Nicks and Buckingham were no heroes! A ham sandwich any day of the week.   Those who still relish the rock blues sound that WAS Fleetwood Mac until 1974 know what I mean. The Albums- Fleetwood Mac, Mr. Wonderful,Then Play On,(particularly),Kiln House, Future Games,(WOW!),Bare Trees,Penguin,Mystery To Me,(double WOW) and Heroes Are Hard to Find complete the must haves of the band I LOVE! Rumours buried them in \\"the tomb of the rundown pop song\\". R.I.P.
B0021L8UPS|3.0|[[ASIN:B002SG7P0M Blood Moon:  Thrillers and Tales of Terror]]<br />I have mixed feelings about \\"Orphan.\\"  On the one hand, it meanders along at such a pedestrian pace in the beginning that I experienced a strong urge to leave the theater when I saw it.  On the other hand, I enjoyed the twist ending.  It's an  eye-opener.  But the payoff destination is not quite worth the jejune journey getting there.  In other words, I liked \\"Orphan\\" with strong reservations.<br /><br />A thriller needs to move along at a certain brisk pace, but this movie waited far too long to switch into high gear for it to generate many thrills before the final act.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Blood Moon\\" and \\"Fete of Death.\\"
B0000524EM|5.0|Product arrived exactly as described, and rather quickly!  Packaging was great, and nothing was damaged.  Great product, Great service, and great price!  I would definately reccommend this seller to others!
B002R4K6AG|4.0|I wanted to pass on this, but since I own every Bob Dylan \\"album,\\" and since I like all of his recent releases, I gave this a purchase.  At first I laughed.  Hearing those standard, gentle Christmas songs with that raspy voice cracked me up.  But I got it on the second listening.  The songs are retro, with 1950 and 60's arrangements.  The backing vocals are reminiscent of the Ray Coniff singers or an old Canadian vocal group.  The music starts to come alive with each song and you realize this is Bob Dylan, once again, the music man.  The greatest singer-songwriter of all time releasing a Christmas album on his terms.  This is a must buy for any Dylan fan.
0061719544|4.0|Craig's book, American on Purpose is an inspirational read.  It takes you through some of the darkest days of his life  but shows there's light at the end of the tunnel. You can feel  the weight lift as his life changes for the better in more recent years.  I love a happy ending!

B00005JPSM|3.0|It was a good for a sunday's afternoon but it's not a keeper for me. Just not my kind of movie, I guess.
1416550542|1.0|It should be titled The Forgotten Editor. How on earth was this rambling mess published in this state? How on earth did it make any book choice list??? What a complete waste of time. I usually donate my books to the local hospital, this one is going in the trash.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it first came out but it was taken off the market within a week never to be heard from again.  I wondered why all of this information that everyone should know about would be suppressed.  Well now I found the movie in DVD and it is most interesting - everyone should see it.  And the price is right on. Thank you so much for making it available.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|It doesn't quite have the same level of irony and refined plot lines as Bad Santa, but it is pretty dang good! Oh, yeah, and funny as hell.
B00009R86L|5.0|I load up my messenger bag with a lot of stuff, and I was starting to get shoulder pain whenever I used it.    This shoulder pad took a little getting used to, and it added weight to the bag, but it has made me able to wear my messenger bag as long as I want to with no shoulder or back pain. Even with a full day of walking around including the particularly fatiguing \\"museum crawl,\\" my shoulder still feels great.    I also like that you can attach it to any bag strap without having to completely replace the strap, as you do with some similar products.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I received an advance copy of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Edition from One2One Network to review. The Diamond Edition includes both DVD & Blu-ray discs.  I do not have a    Blu-ray player so I could not review the extra features which include games, newly discovered storyboards, DisneyView, and more. I definitely recommend getting this movie and is a must have for Disney lovers young and old. I definitely recommend going for the Diamond Edition if you are lucky enough to own a Blu-ray player, so you can take advantage of all the special bonus features.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|If you want gripping drama....here it is. If you're looking for a drama that equals other FX Network shows such as Nip/Tuck,Rescue Me....this will keep you in the chair too.
B0000252YK|2.0|The fact that the \\"Ultimate Sin\\" has averaged 4 stars proves without a doubt that Amazon's star system cannot be trusted and is voted disproportionately by \\"fans\\" and not objective listeners. I was attending high school when this CornBall album was released, it sucked then and is worse now. Cheesy 80's slick hair metal,that's all. To think only 5 years after \\"Diary Of a Madman\\"! Crazy. I've come to expect crap from the once mighty singer of Black Sabbath and frontman to Randy Rhoads (thanks sharron), a parody of himself actually, but this was the first album of his solo career that was terrible and was a sign of things to come! When such a high star rating is given to crap, the stars have lost all meaning, and if you actually think this drivel deserves 4 Stars my advise to you is.. nothing. Don't mistake nostalgia for quality, sure it reminds you of a happy time growing up? but vote with your ear.
0316044695|2.0|This book was highly recommended by someone I do not know well-so I read it not knowing what to expect. I agree with the comments about the poor writing being a distraction - I almost stopped reading it and had to skim over much of the jingoistic/provincial parts.  That said - the description of the SEAL training was fascinating and should create respect for that organization on the part of most who read it.  The failed mission is also interesting.  If read while recognizing the book as a cathartic writing by Luttrell (where was the editing?) that helps to get past the glaring problems with this book.  You have to wonder why he choose to publish this - as it becomes obvious that it could be perceived as a dishonor to those with whom he has served.
B00000IFP6|4.0|This is for sure a new and interesting approach to Beethoven's symphonies,   in new critical editions, but this fact doesn't make them necessarily better   or more enjoyable. Zinman's just proposes another valid , but NOT definitive   approach to these works.
0385504225|3.0|Another reviewer nailed it when they described this book as reading more like a screenplay than a novel.  Expectations were higher than what this book delivered.  If I wanted kitsch, I'd have read a James Patterson novel.  Should have just let Robert Langdon die, bringing him back from the dead at the end was.... cheap.  The subject matter and the talent of the author, combined with the hoopla surrounding this book's release, really set me up for a letdown.
0061914177|5.0|[[VIDEOID:38897251]]I read more than 100 business books a year, and have every year since 1989 -- and I feel that \\"Crush It\\" is definately worth reading if you want to understand how to build a personal brand on the Internet. Superb! John Spence
B001QXE0OC|5.0|If you're a Selena Gomez fan, then this is an awesome CD. It has the lyrics of all 13 songs in the front booklet contained and the CD looks pretty cool (it's black with white word). On the inside, behind the CD, is a picture of selena bowing towards you in a purple-colored background. My favorite songs on the CD are Falling Down, Naturally, Tell Me Something I Don't Know [New], and Kiss & Tell. The \\"special features\\" included when you put the CD in a computer, however, is pointless. All it does is take you to a site and you answer a survey and that's it. Nothing more. However, the CD itself is still good to listen to.
0061914177|5.0|Crush it! is not just motivational, Gary does not hold back on giving information. Social media is a business strategy for the long hall and Gary tells you exactly how to do it effectively. He also makes no bones about it - this is a process that takes endurance. This book won't live on your bookshelf. It's meant for your desktop.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|When I first saw the preview for this movie I was enraged at what they had done to my childhood favorite. All my life I had wanted to se SR come to the big screen and it finally gets there and they do this to it. Now having said that, being a real SR fan and as long as the car looked mostly accurate, I gave it a chance and went to see it in the theater. Long story short, I think I stopped at 8 times. I took everyone that would go with me, to see it. The Mach 5 is really what the show was all about, nothing else matters. And as long as they created a version of the car that was at least a respectable effort, that was all I cared about. I am not a film critic. All I know is that the film moved me emotionally. But that was mainly because the characters were so dear to me. And of course, the coolest car ever created, real or otherwise. I really just got a huge kick out of seeing a real life depiction of the Mach 5, and they did alot better version that that one guy did who custom-made a couple to auction them off. I still would love to see a more accurate version of the car, I mean exactly like the original series. Critically speaking, this movie did not get a fair shake. I saw soooo many reviews for this movie from people who never actually saw it! who reviews a movie they haven't watched!!! Yes this movie is a little acid-trippish. Yes it is long. Yes it is not exactly as the original. But it's SPEED frickin' RACER, and it's on the big screen, and the car looks totally awesome! 5 STARS.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I was very upset when I bought this! I'm only up to season 7 and half the disk don't even want to play in my dvd player. The packaging was horrible, they come in a flip like book in plastic sleeves and the package with Rachel on the cover was unglued from the back cover. The disk look like they are illegal copies passed off as new. Around the center there are glue marks and finger prints. I contacted the seller (dusteeshane) and was told that they were really sorry but they bought it off someone else so they had no idea if they were illegal copies or real. No refund was offered even. I'm looking at re-buying the series but am scared to do so now from anyone now not just amazon. Thinking about buying the seasons one at a time but not sure how to store them.
B001F0TM5I|1.0|I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. Tarantino is well known for his parodies of cheap exploitation films. I thought that Reservoir Dogs was good, Jackie Brown was very good, Pulp Fiction was excellent, and the two Kill Bills were a masterpiece. Death Proof looks like it was thrown together without much thought or intelligence. Worse, it is mean spirited. Death Proof is not a parody. It IS a cheap exploitation film.<br />Tarantino films have great dialogue and humor and feature interesting characters. There is not a single character I could identify with in this film. If you want to see car crashes, go to a demolition derby.
0545123267|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. Without delving into plot, etc., I want to quickly state that if the Twilight Saga left you wanting more--search no longer. I have the pleasure of meeting Maggie Stiefvater this week (she will be a guest speaker at the HS I teach at), and I cannot wait to pick her brain about this beautiful creation. While not altogether linguistically or thematically challenging, Shiver is a feel good novel that you can enjoy with a cup of coffee on the couch.
0060558121|3.0|Thought provoking modern fantasy, but a bit against my grain. Times change, people change, nothing remains the same...not even gods.<br /><br />The character of Shadow is well done, with traits that make the reader like him regardless of his past, present or choices.<br /><br />There is a bit of shifting from time periods and I questioned as I read whether some of them were truly necessary for the story. Overall this was a good read, though not a title I would purchase for my personal shelf.
0064440346|5.0|So charmingingly simple - my kids (2 - 4) love these tales.

This is a fun book for ages 2 - 4.

0061914177|5.0|This book 'CRUSH IT' is a little masterpiece of career guidance.<br /><br />It SUCCESSFULLY changed my career path for the wildly better. NO other book has done that.<br /><br />In fact I was so impressed I put up a program on my TV channel with a link to Amazon.  Gary will not know about this yet but one day I hope to meet him.<br /><br />I'm certainly not part of an orchestrated campaign to promote this book.  Simple fact is that until I read this book I did not believe there was a passion-driven career pathway for me at my stage of life - I'm not old, but time rushes by. Now to my delight I see a path illuminated I never knew was even there, and now nothing can stop me. NOTHING.<br /><br />It's never easy to picture how life might be following a passion. e.g. how will I pay the mortgage if I become a dancer, rock star, missionary, painter? Worse, if a person thinks about this in a steady, mathematical unimaginative way they cannot see the immense implications of the way of thinking outlined in the book. But closed minds can be opened. Give it a shot!<br /><br />Nothing will dissuade me of the good intentions of this entrepreneur and his old style American honor.  So best wishes to you Mr Gary Vaynerchuk. And to you if you've read this far, go grab hold of this book with both hands - I truly mean it.<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Jonathan<br />[...].
159007131X|5.0|Glenda Jackson gives a superb reading of PERSUASION.  She brings an asperity to the text often missing in film adaptations of Jane Austen.  Anne Elliott, unlike Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny or Emma, is older and the novel has a subtle autumnal quality, which, of course, gives way to spring in end.  Jackson captures the novel's rhythms and invests her narration with heightened humor and poignancy.  My only regret is that this version remains available in cassettes only.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|An abridged version of this concert has been floating around on video bootleg for at least 20 years. It's my favorite Tull bootleg of the 30 or 40 I have. They were ON FIRE on this night - I consider this their best live show ever.     If you are a fan of Tull's '70s-era music, do not hesitate. Buy this. You want it. I\\"m amazed and delighted that they decided to give it an authorized release. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
0061914177|3.0|While the book had plenty of great examples, resources, and specific tools, the advice won't become timeless. Twitter and Ping.fm may not be here in 10 years...<br /><br />With that said, this book has plenty of great takeaways. If you don't know Gary, this is an excellent introduction to him, his style, and his resulting success. If you know and love Gary, you'll learn a lot more behind all the great things he does. I've been a Gary fan for a few years and walked away with at least 4 or 5 solid, actionable ideas to help me with my latest endeavor.<br /><br />I do wish the book were longer though. It was long-awaited and felt like I only got a taste of what can be said and taught. But, I'd recommend it to anyone with a few hours to sit down. You'll walk away inspired.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Tom Hanks came to Cleveland earlier this month and gave a presentation on non-fiction in film, and it included a sneak peek of a scene from \\"The Pacific.\\"  He showed an amazing clip from the upcoming HBO miniseries, and it was truly stunning.  People say the opening scene in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is unforgetable, which is true, but I can definitively say that the scene we saw from \\"The Pacific\\" has all that drama and perhaps more.  My heart was pounding watching the young men take the beach.  I instantly cared about these Marines, there was a true connection to them -- the acting is superb.  I didn't think it possible that \\"Band of Brothers\\" could be topped, but I'm telling you, if the scene we saw is any indication, \\"The Pacific\\" is going to go gangbusters.  Buy stock in HBO, and line up the Emmys now.
0688103111|5.0|Across Europe, from Brussels to Bulgaria, Bill Bryson takes us up alleyways, into coffee shops with indifferent waitstaff, into overpriced museums, across ancient bridges and onto crowded buses through death-defying mountain passes, into magnficent town squares and finally, repairing, into various hotel rooms which occasionally overlook gloriously sunsetted harbors.  It's a fantastic and schizophrenic yet entirely believable mix of experiences (even as Bill's out-loud thinking sometimes intrudes into the narrative).  We're right there with him, thanks to his down to the dustball description of every minute detail alerting every sense.  One can almost smell the malodorous feet of the geezer next to him on the bus to Belgrade.  Or hear the Swedish girl of his dreams as she breathes into his deleriously drunken ear: \\"I'm fool of lust\\".    Mr. Bryson's amazing account of this journey falls back occasionally to a trip taken with a college buddy two decades earlier.  At the start of the book this flashback is a little distracting and seems out of place, but as the diary progresses it makes sense; a brief understanding of his earlier trip comes in handy in spots as he looks back at how things have changed in the various countries he visits.  The continuing communistic state of Bulgaria (in 1990) is particularly poignant and despite his gourmand-like tendencies, Mr. Bryson is not without honest compassion for the poor, currency-waving, bedraggled citizens queuing up to make meager purchases at nearly empty shops.  Especially as he reposes in the only place of true civilized comfort in town:  the Sheraton.  It is also interesting to read the peaceful account of his stay in Sarajevo -- \\"the setting sun crowning a skyline of minarets and ... muezzins' tortured calls to prayer echoing over the rooftops\\" -- on the eve of the bloody few years which would follow in that region.      Mr. Bryson is a master at descriptive writing and a master of English, if not language in general.Second only to this is his skillful and biting sarcasm, which allows for at least one LOL moment per page.  Some may find it tiresome, some of the humor IS repulsive and it DID border on \\"enough already\\" for me too at times.   But I have to say, this is one of the most entertaining AND informative books I've ever read.  I highly recommend it, if you can put up with Bryson's non-stop sarcasm and propensity for nerdy self-obsession.      Indexed; endpapers contain handy map of Europe with countries outlined.  It is a curious oversight that Poland is unnamed.
B00004VVND|5.0|My 20 year old son had never seen this. I told him about it and he thought it sounded good, so we had to get it. I really enjoyed seeing it again and he thought it was pretty good.

0321603508|5.0|Got it yesterday and cannot detach it from my hands. I won't list a review of content here because it's on the book preview.<br /><br />Techniques you might already be doing intuitively, and many you probably don't, are described with clear examples and detail helping you convert intuitive decisions into a continuous working method.<br /><br />This book is a cornerstone for people who is serious about Ruby and want their code to be readable, robust, built from testing, beautiful and easy to change.
1593080492|3.0|Since I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice so much, I thought I would follow up with Austen's first book Sense and Sensibility. Sadly disappointing. Although Austen's excellent writing style is evident here in her first attempt, the plot is maudlin and predictable. Two sisters, one beautiful, sweet, and trusting and the other more prosaic in appearance, but wise beyond her 19 years (if this sounds a lot like P & P it is because it is) alternate their time between the rural English countryside and cosmopolitan London. The more comely of the two is enamored with a dashing chap who turns out to be a cad. Dumped unceremoniously by said cad, she proceeds to mope and weep through 150 pages. A good smack to the chops would do her a world of good, but sadly never happens. In the end every thing works out, more or less, in a contrived and unbelievable manner and every one lives happily ever after.<br /><br />Most interesting aspect of the book is the description of British customs, class distinctions and the courting ritual. Also, it is remarkable how little has changed in the English language in the 200 years since this book was written. Austen is a superb stylist, but beyond the fascinating historical descriptions of the British upper classes, circa 1790, there is little there here(to paraphrase Gertrude Stein's description of Oakland, California).

1400063515|1.0|The book is largely a rant against use of the Gaussian distribution. But Taleb doesn't tell just what is being plotted against what in the cases where, he says, the Gaussian is no good.    He also says that Mandelbrot's work with fractals is applicable to economics and finance, but doesn't say just how.      He comes across as egotistical and defensive about his ego.  He drops an awful lot of names along the way.

0061914177|2.0|To be completely honest I am astounded that this book has achieved such great reviews and rankings in sales on Amazon. I had never heard of the author before reading this book, but I understand that he is very interested in selling wine. The author's enthusiasm for his subject is great, and some may say that it is inspirational. However, in reality all that I could gather from this book was the importance of social media outlets. There were no real tips except that people should spend 12 hours + a day to work on their \\"brand.\\" This makes me realize that while one may be able to create a great business with all of this work input it may be for nothing. I am of the experience that great ideas do not take so much effort to introduce to others.  It would be nice if the author could have analyzed the avenues that social media will take instead of just saying \\"feel good\\" \\"inspirational\\" stuff.     This book seemed like more of a useless sales pitch than a useful tool for entrepreneurship.    I have a deep suspicion that most of the reviews were at the doing of the author in some way. Many of the profiles are new and only have ONE review (this book). Just wanting to inform people.
0061002860|5.0|Agatha Christie is known for the unusual twists she threw into her mysteries to make solving them especially difficult and gratifying.  I have read many of Christie's mysteries and have been able to solve some, but \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" left me completely in the dark.  It is a thorougly mystifying and pleasant puzzle featuring her famed detective Hercule Poirot.<br /><br />The novel is narrated by Dr. Sheppard, doctor of the small village of King's Abbot.  Mrs. Ferrars, a wealthy widow, has just died due to an overdose of poison.  Before her death, however, she sent a letter to her fiance, Roger Ackroyd, confessing that she had been blackmailed about her husband's death and wished him to make the blackmailer pay.  But before Ackroyd can follow her wishes, he is stabbed to death and almost every member of his household had a motive for killing him.  The list of suspects includes his adopted son, who had incured a great deal of debt that Ackroyd refused to pay and who has not been seen since the murder, and his young niece who had money problems herself due to the extravagance of her and her mother's lifestyle.  Dr. Sheppard allies himself with Hercule Poirot, who is meant to be retired in anonymity, and together they take on the case.  Poirot immediately employs his little \\"grey cells\\" to solve the puzzling intricacies of the mystery at hand, while Dr. Sheppard functions in the Captain Hastings role of earlier mysteries.<br /><br />\\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" is a fast-paced delightful read.  The solution is entirely fitting but completely baffling to the reader as well.  There are a few places where this work shows its age, particularly the chapter dealing with a game of Mah Jong, but otherwise it stands the test of time.  This novel would serve as a fine introduction to Christie's work for anyone who is not familiar with her wonderful mysteries.

B000002KHH|5.0|The sophmore album by Black Sabbath, perhaps deemed by all metal heads as a timeless head banging masterpiece.  Throughout the Ozzy years with Sabbath, no album epitemizes the band more than this record.  Although many think War Pigs posseses political overtones, rest assured, the words were changed at the request of the record label because of the true gloomy nature of the lyrics, listen to the true version of this song on Ozzy's \\"The Ozz Man Cometh\\".  Paranoid, the riffs, the sound, the music often imitated, never duplicated, Sabbath's anthom if you will.  Rat Salad, a true unappreicated work of musical genious, Bill Ward on the drums-WOW.  Planet Caravan, a haunting melody, with grizzly overtones, Sabbath at their best.  In the annals of metal, few if any, will ever stack up to this album, and history will continue to truely designate Black Sabbath as the \\"Fathers of Heavy Metal\\" Hail to the Sabb's and their legion of fans...Never Stop Rockin!

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Raise your hand if you remember how long it took for the Star Wars Trilogy (any version at all) to become available on DVD.<br /><br />For nearly two decades, Star Wars was *the* movie with which to showcase high-end home theater systems.  Any store that was selling big-screen TVs and Surround Sound receivers (back when both were prohibitively expensive for the average household) was guaranteed to have a copy of Star Wars on hand, to show off the hardware.<br /><br />Then DVDs came out and blew VHS and LaserDiscs out of the water.  And long after DVDs had firmly been established as the video format of choice, George Lucas still waited years to release any version of Star Wars (even the versions he tampered with) on DVD.  It seemed ridiculous that these movies, which were so ahead of their time that they were still being used as the litmus test of home theater technology 20 years later, were only available in an inferior and obsolete format that was rapidly losing market share.<br /><br />And now, he's doing it again.  Giant TVs and high definition video are rapidly becoming the norm.  Judging by George Lucas's unprecedented use of spare-no-expense digital movie magic, it's clear he's no purist or technophobe.  So what's the hold-up?  Why must we *again* wait for what was once the greatest home theater showpiece to play catch-up with the mainstream technology?  The entire Star Wars saga should have been one of the first things released on Blu-Ray, not the last.  (Though I'd still hold out for a remastered-but-otherwise-un-tampered-with version of the original trilogy.  I don't much care for the edited versions or the new trilogy).
B002JM1VJG|1.0|I bought this DVD recently. I love madonna and I have others dvd, like The Immaculation Collection and Madonna video Collection 1993 - 99   I don't understand why Warner choose the 4:3 letter box format instead the 16:9. I don't understando too why Warner don't sell this colection in Blu-ray.   Other point is the picture quality. It's very, very bad. Even if we compare with the DVDs IImmaculation Collection and Madonna Video Collection that were made years ago.   Why Warner don't put subtitles with the music lyrics like we have in the others two DVDs?  It seems that all technology invented to bring us more content in a media like DVD or Blu-ray fails when faces the economic politics of the WARNER.  PLEASE MADONNA, I BEG TO YOU.

B00008V6WA|5.0|As with most Black Sabbath albums in the Ozzy years, this one remains true to form, solid metal riffs, heart pounding bass lines, blasting drums and the most recognized voice in the metal industry.  The song Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is one of the heaviest songs ever written, if you do not like this song, then you are not a metal head in any generation.  Killing Yourself to Live is a remarkable piece of music along with Looking for Today and Sabbra Cadabra, hell, even Metallica did a rendition of Sabbra Cadabra on their album Garage Day's Revisted.  The songs on this album never did get a lot of air play and they are not the most recognized by even Sabbath fans, but do not let that fool you, this is an epic release and should be hailed by all Sabbath fans.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|The first thing I thought of when I heard this was that it was a pretty good album that more solidly cemented my opinion of Muse as a cross between Radiohead and Queen - but even though the roots are here, they stand on their own and are very listenable.  The second thing I thought of was, hmmm - concept album.  Is this a jump the shark moment?  Like Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime?  And, arguably, Pink Floyd's The Wall?  Will they peak and sink after this?  History will tell.  I like the album, it is well-produced and delivers fun Muse-y songs.  I look forward to many future listens.
B000URDEB0|4.0|All in all this is an absolutely great album. I am actually a fairly new fan of Nightwish, to both their new and older music and I love them. I wish that I would have found them earlier in my quest for amazing music...... So here is my take on the new album: very experimental, creative and pretty vocals from Annette. There is one major problem I see though and I know Im not the first person to say this but Annette cannot touch Tarja live....sorry. Thought Annette was great on the album but she doesn't have the strong voice and presence that Tarja has. I just wish I would have found Nightwish earlier when Tarja was the lead singer and seen them live. I still have hope and respect for Annette but she really needs to step it up to be able to follow someone as great as Tarja.
B001EZ78T6|3.0|Oh how I wanted this album to be a great one. I never expect masterpieces;that word is bandied about far too much anything. Being one of those people who really appreciate and loved John's send up of 70's funky soul on[[ASIN:B000HCPWZO Once Again]] it was an extension on this direction,whether it be toward fusion ,blues/rock or even disco-funk would've seemed logical. This is the same Legend/Kayne West collaboration that made the first two albums what they were. Meanwhile John's \\"evolution\\" was unexpected but wasn't particularly focused on his musical strenghs. The emphasis here is definately on a variation of British Two-step,which is very over done by this point much the same new jack swing was by about 1996. Not only that but the ballads that are here have...a very processed and static folk-rock flavor if you can imagine such a thing happening. That's not to say this album doesn't have a handfull of high quality songs. \\"Good Morning\\",a song that starts as an intro and continues later into an actual song that has this great rise n shine R&B feel with the nice touch of horns on the accent. The song \\"Greenlight\\",featuring Andre 3000 manages a good comobo of two step and 80's funk with Andre hillariously noting \\"even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes\\". The Kayne West collaboration \\"It's Over\\" is by far the funkiest thing on the album and very nimble with it's use of electronics. This naked funk send up was a wonderful possible direction for the rest of the album but it wasn't quite that way. With the exception of the equally wonderful duet with Brandy on \\"Quickly\\" and the epic modern people music of \\"If You're Not There\\" a lot of this album,up and down tempo is lacking in a certain vitality and spark. Considering this includes a bonus disk about the making of this album I can tell a lot went into making this and perhaps that was the problem. \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Everybody Knows\\",while very good songs seemed as if they were third and fourth guessed and some labored elements of the production make it clear if your doing something soulful and funky,it does'nt have the proper effect if everything is overworked. I will not condemn John Legend for trying some new ideas and,considering how obviously inspired by Jeff Buckly he is the rockier direction in some of this production is not surprising. At the same time a looser feel might've better benifited the intentions a little bit better. John's persona is elegant but not stiff and,considering he's only on his third album and is due a somewhat less powerful one the future still has a lot of brightness in it for John Legend.guessed and some labored elements of the production make it clear if your doing something soulful and funky,it does'nt have the proper effect if everything is overworked.

B000002LTU|5.0|Miles was no longer on this Earth by the time this came out-we all know that. The point is that while he was making this recording with Easy Mo Bee towards the end of the life Miles was at the very least throwin' down and having one wail of a time. And that's no pun because this album allows Miles to wail away with the best of them. After a string of electric jazz records that alternated from mildly abstract to almost smooth during the late 80's this found Miles in a place that really worked for him. The hip-hop culture,much like that of be-bop fueled it's creative juices in much the same sort of colorful environment. And being who he was this \\"sweet n low down\\" kind of atmosphere really baught him into a place where he could just play his horn and know what he was dealing with while he did so. Every track on this album are a funk track-created from a sampadelic musical pallet using everything from fender rhodes loops,percussion,drums,horn blasts and yelps. Sure it's a pretty common type of funk/hip-hop backing to be sure but hey:it was created AROUND Miles and the man and his horn are definately telling the music where he wants it to go. On a couple songs such as the title track Mo Bee throws down a very ego tripping (on Miles' behalf) rap,memorably (in my mind) proclaiming Miles as a \\"multi talented and gifted musician who can play in any position\\". Yeah it's a little padding but by the time to get to the playing and how everything works around it you know a lot of it is dead on-had been for decades. Some of the songs are in fact just unbelievably fast n funky such as \\"Chocolate Chip\\" and \\"High Speed Chase\\". While your listening to this album you won't only find yourself dancing off all the beats and loops but also to Miles' soft but often very kinetic solos and wails. Does that say anything for this most complicated of musicians?Sure does! The fact that someone who's style flows so directly from Bird and Dizzy could make it clear that this new thing (for him) called hip-hop was coming from the same place if you peeled some layers away was a hugely deep idea in and of itself. So if you like Miles' playing and want some of his stuff you can really jam to in your car,on the dancefloor or pretty much doing anything involving a physical movement you also have to think about this will really pump up your second wind. Even if you cannot see this,thanks again for that Miles!his new thing (for him) called hip-hop was coming from the same place if you peeled some layers away was a hugely deep idea in and of itself.

B001DJ7PR8|4.0|The reviews of this movie are all over the place, which tells me that a lot of people just don't get Woody Allen's distinctive approach to making movies.  Yes, of course the plot and characters are exaggerated, to the point where the plot seems implausible and the characters seem like caracitures.  They're meant to be that way.  In a Woody Allen movie, the plot and characters are intended only as vehicles to bring particular themes into sharp relief.<br /><br />In this movie, the theme is indeed quite clear.  If you were wealthy enough to have financial freedom, how would you live your life?  Most of us can't relate to that situation, but we aspire to it, so it's worth exploring as a thought experiment.  Would you go for passion and adventure, throwing yourself into unfamiliar situations, thereby risking physical and emotional harm for the hope of a life filled with uniquely rich experiences and self-expression?  Or would you instead go for an (upper-class) mainstream life of material consumption, social networking, stability, and security, all at the expense of predictable and monotonous conformity?<br /><br />This movie explores these two options, revealing the pros and cons of each, and showing that neither option is ideal, with tradeoffs involved either way.  For some people, the choice is clear, so at least they don't have to worry about making the wrong choice.  For other people, the choice isn't clear at all, so they at least have a genuine choice, but either choice will come with a painful awareness of what was given up.  Not surprisingly, what the movie fails to point out is that both of these options are relatively hedonistic, whereas there's also the option of living according to a purpose which transcends the self.  In fact, the inadequacy of the two presented options could be considered evidence that a self-transcendent option may make more sense.<br /><br />Despite this major limitation, I still think the movie explores its theme in a worthy and stimulating way, and the acting and scenery are also very good, so I recommend it and I'm happy to give it 4 stars.g and scenery are also very good, so I recommend it and I'm happy to give it 4 stars.

He walked across the country with his dog to find her and had a little run-in with her ex who happened to be the Sheriff.

0553381687|5.0|It is a great book, maybe one of the best fantasy/science fiction books I have ever read. It is well-written, interesting characters, and a well-developed plot with lots of twists, turns, and foreshadowing.<br /><br />So why not read the book? Because it is part of a series, and I don't think George Martin has it in him to finish it. This book was first released in 1996--almost 14 years ago. Book two came out in 1999 with book three in 2000. The fourth book didn't make it out until 2005 and it was a not as good as the previous books. He introduced new plot lines, new characters, and pretty much ignored the older ones. Supposedly the fourth book manuscript was so long that he had to split it into two books. If so, he must have taken all the uninteresting, confusing chapters and put them in book #4.<br /><br />If you read his website, his time seems to be pretty much taken up with NFL football, writing for another series, talking about how HBO might pick up book one for a series (I wonder if anyone at HBO realizes how far away he is from completing the series) and going to book signings. He recently announced he is 1,000+ pages into book 5 with lots of fragment chapters which means he isn't anywhere near finished.<br /><br />Maybe he has writer's block, shouldn't have killed off so many characters, whatever the reason, I don't think he is going to finish the series, and if book 4 is any indication, not with the high standards of writing from the earlier books. I might feel sorry for him except I am so disappointed in not being able to finish reading this wonderful story.

0439023483|3.0|In the book, The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins tells of how twenty-four teenagers fight to the death.  Panem is a new country where North America used to be located. Panem is made up of a capital and the twelve districts surrounding it.  Katniss, a resourceful teenage girl volunteers to compete in the hunger games as a tribute, when her younger sister, Prim, is chosen to be the female fighter for district twelve.  Katniss is forced to compete against twenty-three other teenagers, including Peeta, a boy from her own district.     Eventually, the Hunger Games begin, after many parties that the tributes are forced to attend.  The Games start at a gigantic cornucopia filled with food and weaponry supplies.  Katniss gets a backpack and runs into the forest.  Katniss has an advantage over the others, because she is used to hunger, unlike most of the other districts.    About half of the tributes die the first day, because they were killed by other tributes.    As the days pass, more tributes die.  Katniss pairs up with Rue, a little girl from District Eleven, who is a lot like her sister, Prim.  Rue dies when she is impaled by a spear.  Then Katniss partners up with Peeta, who is injured, and they continue to fight the others until they are the only two fighters left.       I think that The Hunger Games is a book that has room for improvement.  The Hunger Games is a good idea, but I don't like the way the author organizes the story.  I think that it is really boring, and predictable that whenever Katniss needs something, that item falls from the sky.  When she gets burned, the burn-medicine falls from the sky.  When she gets hungry, a loaf of bread falls from the sky. And when Peeta gets injured, she goes to pick up a backpack that has medicine for him.  I think that Suzanne Collins' idea of writing this story in the first person point of view was a bad choice.  The character, Katniss, could not see everywhere, so the reader cannot understand what is going on.  Also, youcannot understand what is happening in the districts and the capital.  First person point of view helps the reader understand what is going on in Katniss' head, but not much else.   I liked the future age setting, because it puts things into perspective, because our world could turn out like that.   The werewolf beasts and the tracker-jacker bees are also very cool things that Suzanne Collins invented to put into her story.  I liked the fact that the book cover shows a mocking jay, to symbolize the people making fun of the capital, and starting a rebellion.  I would recommend this book to other teenagers who like futuristic action stories.

It is products like this that make NJ's reputation for garbage well-deserved.  For an ungodly amount of years, these clowns have churned out unlistenable, trite, derivative noise, which seems to be some kind of gender-based version of a dog whistle. By that I mean, only women seem to think this hair-band lite mush is great art, when all they really think is \\"Oooh, how cute they are\\".  This is the ultimate \\"Video made the radio star\\" band, cranking out old Peter Framptom guitar licks over lyrics found on shopping bags and Cracker Barrel samplers.  Bottom line:  if you can stomach anything else these guys have made, you'll be able to take this without gagging.  For everyone else, try the shallow end of the kiddie pool for something a little bit deeper and more challenging.
1594488878|3.0|Hornby has seemed exceptional over the years because he is an adequate, competent writer in a sea of mediocrity. \\"High Fidelity\\" remains the benchmark of his fiction while \\"Juliet, Naked\\" adds one more readable and interesting tale to his library.    There's nothing spectacular about \\"Juliet, Naked\\", but there's nothing offensive about it either. You could do better, but you could certainly do worse.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|If you're a Michael Bubl&eacute; fan, 'Crazy Love' isn't going to disappoint. He continues to sing the classics as with his past releases and for the most part, stays true to the arrangements that made them American standards with only minor tweaks to the instrumentation to make the songs feel a bit modern. As a casual fan, the album lets you down a bit because this album just feels like a rehashing of what he's already done without many chances being taken. Yes, he's adhering to the classic adage of 'If it's not broke, don't fix it' but at the same time, you get this feeling that the act is getting a bit old because you know exactly what to expect from him and he's not really singing any songs that are surprising or come with any risk.<br /><br />The Good: Bubl&eacute;'s voice is probably the best thing about 'Crazy Love', as with most of his releases. While there's nothing truly new or daring about the music he's singing (since they were made famous by other artists and are old standards and classics), it's his voice that makes him stand apart. I feel like his best vocal performance is probably on 'Georgia In My Mind' where he's forced to just slow down and focus on putting some emotion into the lyrics to keep it from being a straight karaoke performance.  Another great example of him putting some heart into the performance is with 'At This Moment'. It's on these two songs that left me feeling that this was something worth buying and that he wasn't just singing another batch of songs to put out a CD.<br /><br />The Bad: The fact that he's this far in his career and still singing classics and standards feels a bit tired and worn out by now. I wasn't really impressed with 'Crazy Love' because there's little that makes it feel like a new product and something different than his past releases. There are some songs where I felt he was just performing them without putting in much of emotion or thought, as if this has become his niche and since there's no risk involved, he's just singing to make a buck. \\"Heartache Tonight\\" is good and his voice is okay but it just feels like an 'American Idol' performance. \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is another song that I felt he had no connection with; it just sounds like a performance he spat out. My overall complaint or critique with 'Crazy Love' is that by itself, it's a good cd. The vocals are better than most and the music is decent. When compared with all of his other work and releases, it sounds a bit less authentic and as if it's become so routine that he's just chosen whatever songs and classics he hasn't done before and is spitting them out without any thought or without connecting to the music and slapping it on cd and calling it a day. It struck me as lazy, unremarkable, tepid and just plain boring.<br /><br />Overall, average songs and nothing surprising in terms of performance from Michael Bubl&eacute; but it will please his niche and fan base. For the casual fan, I'm not sure it's original or good enough to buy and spend money on. I'm hoping at some point of his career, instead of continuing to sing classics and standards made popular by others, he'll actually take a chance musically and do a full release of some original material fit for his voice and preferred genre. Unfortunately, 'Crazy Love' is not that and is very paint-by-numbers and tame.buck. \\"Heartache Tonight\\" is good and his voice is okay but it just feels like an 'American Idol' performance. \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is another song that I felt he had no connection with; it just sounds like a performance he spat out.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|Looks like the USA Network has got another banging hit in its lineup. WHITE COLLAR, an easy-breezy crime drama, swipes heavily from the buddy cop genre, and that this beaten-to-death premise (which owes a lot to 48 HOURS) works for this series is purely because of the appeal of the two leads, and specifically Matt Bomer. This is not to dis his semi-rumpled co-star Tim DeKay, but clearly this show rises or collapses on how effectively Bomer brings the sexy. Tim Dekay - while also charming in a more low-key sort of way - works best as Bomer's exasperated foil.<br /><br />Sophisticated con artist Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) - convicted of bond forgery but suspected of many other crimes - is hailed as \\"quite the Renaissance criminal.\\" He has only three to four months left to serve in his prison sentence when Kate, the love of his life, breaks up with him and then amscrays for parts unknown. Demonstrating that a maximum-security prison isn't a deterrent if you're crazy in love, Caffrey breaks out of stir to try to find his girl. Except that he gets caught, and gets caught by the same dogged FBI guy who nabbed him the first time, Peter Burke (Tim DeKay).<br /><br />Agent Burke toils away in the white collar crime division in the Big Apple and, before he got pulled away into again running down Caffrey, he was steadily getting baffled by a cunning master forger called the Dutchman. But the long-awaited break surfaces when Caffrey proposes a deal: Caffrey will help Burke catch the Dutchman if Caffrey is remanded to Burke's custody and be out and about in the real world. It's plain to both that the real reason for Caffrey's offer is so that Caffrey can keep looking for his lost love. Burke reluctantly takes the deal. Caffrey gets fitted for a GPS tracking anklet. And off they go to make a serious dent on the Friday Nielsen ratings.<br /><br />WHITE COLLAR debuted this past Friday, October 23rd, and it was so much fun watching it that I went and saw the repeat airing a few hours later. Matt Bomer - who also played Bryce Larkin in [[ASIN:B000VWC9YW Chuck - The Complete First Season]] - is projected to be the show's breakout star, and it looks like he's got the goods. But it helps that the writers saddled his roguish character with a romantic streak. Meanwhile, Tim DeKay holds up his end, making lemonade with his more thankless role. DeKay is really good at doing that \\"exasperated and ill-at-ease\\" thing, and nothing ruffles his by-the-book FBI agent's feathers quite as much as the ridiculous ease with which Caffrey persistently finagles his way to the cushy things in life. Given that $700 is what it cost to house and feed Caffrey while behind bars, the same amount is allotted to finance his new digs on this shaky \\"work release program.\\" Initially assigned to a very seedy flophouse, Caffrey moments later charms his way into becoming a house guest in an uber-luxurious penthouse. Along the way, he also lands some very sleek threads. He airily describes his new wardrobe as \\"classic Rat Pack.\\" Burke grinds his teeth, yet can't resist sipping from Caffrey's excellent coffee, from sampling a taste of the good life. It's immediately apparent that Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay demonstrate a terrific give-and-go rapport. Their characters aren't exactly overtly adversarial, but they are trying to one-up each other in subtle ways. It's fun to watch.<br /><br />As these two start to build a working relationship, their respective personal lives are touched on. For Caffrey, this involves touching base with his street contact (nicely placed by Willie Garson) and searching for his vanished girlfriend Kate. For the workaholic Burke, it's all about balancing career and marriage, except that the scales tend to tilt in favor of career. Tiffani Thiessen plays Burke's impossibly understanding, long-suffering wife Elizabeth, and since this is Tiffani Thiessen, I'm guessing there are fireworks scheduled ahead for Elizabeth Burke.<br /><br />Like other shows on the USA Network (MONK, BURN NOTICE, PSYCH), WHITE COLLAR flaunts a playful side. In it's key conceit (\\"It takes a thief...\\"), it actually shares more in common with a series on TNT, the very good [[ASIN:B001OQCVCY Leverage: The First Season]], and with Spielberg's cool con flick [[ASIN:B00005JLSB Catch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. This isn't one of those cable shows that tries to be ambitious (MAD MEN, SONS OF ANARCHY). And, as great as MAD MEN is, there are times when I'm in the mood to just be entertained and not have to think or analyze things too much or get mired in serious angst. WHITE COLLAR is irresistible comfort food for the mind. I just saw the 90 minute pilot, and I thought: So what if maybe things fall in place a little too conveniently in this show? So what if the unlikely partners develop camaraderie maybe just a tad too effortlessly? So what if the \\"collar of the week\\" isn't all that compelling? The point is that the show knows its strength rests on showcasing its ridiculously likable two leads. And maybe there's someone on television currently more rakish and dashing than Neal Caffrey. But, for the life of me, I'm drawing a blank.twork (MONK, BURN NOTICE, PSYCH), WHITE COLLAR flaunts a playful side.

Travis visits a theater and eats junk food. He can't sleep. We see a campaign office at work. [Does the film drag here?] The cab drivers gossip. The conversation drags, and so does the film. [Is this a parody of campaign workers?] Do they have anything in common? \\"You need to clean up this city.\\" \\"It's not going to be easy.\\" A young woman meets his cab.

The film drags on.    There is a near accident. Travis meets a salesman who makes house calls to display his wares. Are the prices reasonable? [Is this a parody?] Is Travis stalking somebody? Was that ZIP code correct? Is Travis going insane because of a lack of sleep? Does anyone notice? There is an attempted robbery of a small store. [Believable?] The film drags on. \\"No rough stuff.\\" There is a failure to communicate. Is this a parody? Iris has a new friend. Is the conversation pointless? And the film drags on. There is a political rally at Columbus Circle. Does somebody stand out like an odd haircut? Travis runs off to do what he has to do. There is a violent shoot-out that should wake up those who dozed off. And so it ends, a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing.    The last scene seems tacked on for the happy ending needed for commercial success. Is it believable? It just goes to show that a good plot is needed for a good story.
0307716988|5.0|ive just started reading this book and so far its wonderful and very insightful.what i dont understand about this book is michael has stated numerous times that he never referred to joseph as dad and yet in this book when he refers to joseph he calls him dad.im a little confused on that one.

0385341008|4.0|It's 1946 and Juliet Ashton is an author in London, trying to decide what her next book should be about, and trying to recover from the effects of WWII. She receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, who found her name and address in a used book that he purchased and loved. Dawsey lives on Guernsey Island, which has been occupied by the Germans throughout the war, and thus completely cut off from the rest of the world for years. Juliet responds to the letter and soon she is corresponding with Dawsey and a dozen or so more Guernsey Islanders, most of them members of The Guernsey Literary Potato Peel Pie Society- a book club formed during the occupation in a most unusual way, and destined to change all of their lives forever.<br /><br />The entire book is made up of these letters, all beautifully written and fascinating. By the end of the book the characters felt like old friends that I adored and trusted. This book made me long for the time when people wrote each other long, detailed, carefully worded letters instead of short, impersonal text messages or e-mails.<br /><br />I especially loved reading about the small kindnesses that people bestowed upon each other during wartime and the simple things they were so grateful for when luxuries were scarce. A lovely book!

Half of me wanted to read quickly because I was anxious to know what would happen next and the other half of me wanted to read slowly, savoring each sentence, because it was so beautiful.

Twenties Girl is easily my new favorite of all her books. I loved Sadie (the ghost), loved to hate Natalie, Josh and Uncle Bill, and (of course) had a crush on American Frown. I really liked the research the author did on the 1920's and enjoyed the interesting anecdotes she sprinkled throughout the story. I spent this Sunday in my pajamas, curled up with the cats reading this, and I am really glad I did. It was funny and relaxing.
B000YDOOUK|3.0|I know, I know, majority of you have been looking for a good classic rock bands.  But, this is nothing compared to the other material that has been produced by other classic rock bands, that just arrived on the horizon.  This is certainly a good band, yet this band is nothing compared to the other bands such as The White Stripes, The Dead Weather, and The Answer.  They are talented, but their music is a bit too simple.  The lyrics for every song is stupid, the guiter, bass, and the drums are there.  Don't get me wrong, their music isn't bad, but you never give five stars to a band like this.  This isn't Pink Floyd.  This band is a joke compared to them.  Another example, Led Zeppelin!    Please, don't say,\\" Well, you can't compare these guys to them because their style is different.\\"  The problem is the fact that you can't give every band an \\"A.\\"  You've got to have a B- their and a D their, and so on.      What's the big deal?  This is certainly not a super group, or a group that is going to produce a Back in Black.  This music is just too mindless.  It's insignificant.      To conclused, this band is average.  Nothing special here.  But, I certainly can give you a list of \\"better\\" and new bands you can listen to.     1. The White Stripes  2. The Answer (currently touring with AC/DC)  3. The Dead Weather (reminds me of Physical Ghyfitti by Led Zeppelin)     Thank you, for reading this review.  You may disagree with me, but I'm just being Mr.candid.
B002IT5OV6|4.0|David Sedaris is always hilarious and touching, and When You Are Engulfed in Flames was no exception. I listened to this on audiobook during my commute, and I was alternately laughing and tearing up on the highway! This wasn't my favorite Sedaris that I've ever read, but he's still better than most of what's out there, especially when you are listening to him on audio. He is one of my favorite narrators; his delivery is delightful. While I have purchased his audio versions of Holidays on Ice and Live at Carnegie Hall to listen to over and over again, this was one that I chose to borrow from the library and probably wouldn't purchase. I did enjoy it a lot, but I am pretty frugal (a Scroogey miser). If the price doesn't seem extravagant to you, I would say it's definitely worth it. If $25 seems like a bit much (hello, kindred spirit!) request this from your local library. You'll be glad you did.

0385504225|3.0|Another Robert Langdon adventure from Dan Brown. Same slightly lame story (a frantic scavenger hunt for information with a hot babe for a sidekick...an attempt to save a pretty good guy from a wicked bad guy [who, again, was physically odd looking and crazy] before the clock runs out and utter disaster befalls the world as we know it) filled with interesting and fun factoids and ideas (noetic science, universal consciousness, \\"secrets\\" of the freemasons). That the story took place in D.C and had lots of historical references made my nerdy little presidential-trivia loving heart go pitter pat, and ALMOST made up for the disappointment of figuring out the big \\"surprise\\" halfway through the book. Fun, but definitely predictable. Hopefully the next Robert Langdon story will have a different plot...if not it will undoubtedly be the last I read.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|This CD/DVD set is ideal for a fan such as myself. I have enjoyed the standard soundtracks for a long time now, and I bought this since the Return of the King has some of my favourite music. The complete soundtrack has parts that are otherwise unheard in the standard disc, and have some of my favourite parts - one of these being the 'Houses of Healing'. It is also fun to have the Hobbits' drinking song as seen in the extended edition film. More importantly the full elaboration of themes is heard, rather than just the highlights which cut from one part to another (with respect to the film).  It is great to study to, though I have found myself distracted at times by this epic soundtrack!    Having heard this I would love to buy the remaining two Complete Recordings, but I will have to save my pennies once more - buying these in New Zealand dollars is not cheap!
B000000OAN|5.0|Night At The Opera released by Queen in 1975 has contributed to changing the face of rock music for ever.  Their hard rock and even metal movements all of a sudden were being listened to by ever growing crowd of people who would have not came near such music before. On the other hand, the lovers of hard rocking sound started accepting softer rock, folk or even pop songs they would normally be running away from. Night At The Opera has mixed it all up which in itself was a bit of a gamble. However, that was an easy gamble to take considering how many great songs this album contains. I wonder if the band had any idea which song would become their ticket to riches, when they were working on their material. Bohemian Rhapsody by many called the best piece of rock music ever written became that breakthrough hit for the Queen. Considering how many bad songs become huge hits it was good that in this case the song was great. However, the fact that The Prophets' Song (which to me sounds like it could be dedicated to Robert Plant) went straight to oblivion and got very poorly rated by many is a mystery. You might want to listen to this song carefully. Following The Prophets' Song both Love Of My Life, a beautiful love song and Good Company, a melodic parody which sounded like it was written and sung by Paul McCartney took us all the way to the Bohemian Rhapsody. When we used to listen to records and not cds nor digital files back in the 1970s, putting side B of this album on was a great experience. Night At The Opera's side A starts with great Death On Two Legs (Freddie wanted to express his feelings towards their former manager right away), which after a funky and moody little filler Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon takes us back in time and....roaring forward again I'm In Love With My Car, the best song ever sung and written by Roger Taylor, their drummer, which also happens to be the most beautiful car love song ever. The following song You're My Best Friend was composed by their bass player John Deacon and makes this album a true team effort. Following it is another great song by Brian May '39. The only song on this album that I could never get into was Sweet Lady, which was followed by Seaside Rendezvous, funky moody filler taking you back to the 20s or 30s again. These short fillers, because they are strong and stylistically so all over the place, work well with the complex structures of Bohemian Rhapsody and The Prophets' Song, and together with the remaining love and rock songs create quite an album. Queen's following album Day At The Races was very strong as well. Their following albums contained some great songs but my recommendation would be to turn to their earliest music first, if you like both Night At The Opera and Day AT the Races and you are thinking about exploring their music further. My favorite songs of Queen are the following: Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together), White Queen, Love Of My Life, Nevermore, Jealousy, Bohemian Rhapsody, Forever, Dear Friends, Don't Try So Hard, The March Of The Black Queen, The Millionare Waltz, Killer Queen, Spread Your Wings, Who Wants To Live Forever, Las Palabras De Amor, You're My Best Friend, You Take My Breath Away, We Are The Champions, Bicycle Race, I'm In Love With My Car, Lilly Of The Valley.r bass player John Deacon and makes this album a true team effort.

B00007LTIB|4.0|This album sounds great and like all of Yes/Roger Dean album covers Rhino went the extra mile and got rid of the plastic Jewel case to make these cd disc covers as close as possible to the album covers of the LP.  Extended tracks are wonderful and Gates is cool to listen to as a studio run thru which ofcourse I love.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This is my last Dan Brown book! Not only is the bloom off the rose for this genre, but I think the entire plant has died. I enjoy a good romp outside of \\"realistic\\" boundaries, but this is just so obviously a contrived, and unbelievable, story, that I could hardly finish it. Anyway, the Devinci Code was terrific. The Lost Symbol is rubbish! I wish Dan luck in his next line of work.
B00007KWHN|5.0|This is the first album of the holy trinity of Yes.  Sounds great and the extra tracks are worth the price alone.  I will purchase this again if they can find more rehersal tapes but from what Steve Howe said on the YesYears documentary they may not have been tapeing all that much during this album and many classic Yes songs were forever lost before they began.    (This is my review of the Rhino CD.  I have not purchased the MF gold disc yet so this review should not be here.)
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Nothing but pure enjoyment from this DVD.  All of the extras are entertaining and I'm willing to watch the entire thing multiple times just to hear all the commentary.  This is a rarity for a DVD for me.  I wish that this came with the soundtrack though, I don't want to have to purchase it seperately.
B00009Z574|4.0|This was the first Yes album I purchased as a new release.  I was a little dissapointed and missed the lower end boom and hardness of some of their other albums but this remastered CD seems to have fixed that a bit.  However what I really love about it is the extra tracks.  That is what I listen to the most now and hardly ever listen to the original tracks.  This is true with some other albums as well since I have heard these songs so much.  I hope Rhino can continue doing all of their catalog because they do such a great job.  I plan on getting every one with some as duplicate copies since you never know when they will be forced to go on the cheap and be forced to make them without the booklets etc.
B0017TFLBQ|4.0|this is a old game but i still have playing it on my off time and when i get board with my other games i come back to play this and its always fun :)
B00007LTIC|5.0|Great album and remastered to perfection but like I have said on other reviews of Yes/Rhino is that the extra tracks are what really thrills me now because you get to hear new material (granted some are not really finished and some are just being fleshed out) from a band in their prime.  I like the funkier and less jarring and high pitched (extended) Going For The One track  better in some ways than the original finished version.
B001FB55H6|3.0|While the movie has well-written costumed vigilantes performed by above-average actors, the movie ran like a re-telling of the graphic novel verbatim.  The movie itself is so long, the additions provided by the director's cut are forgettable.  The last forty-five minutes are still the best part of the movie.    Blu-ray helps with the visuals; but does not accentuate the storytelling.  Unless you are an avid Blu-ray fan like myself, Watchmen can be viewed in regular DVD Video format.
B001WCN23W|5.0|This is a classic and has a great sound quality to it.  A must have for serious collectors.  So glad I got to see them at Ford Field in Detroit when they came.  Worth every penny and will see them again if they ever tour again.
B001QXE0OC|5.0|This is a fun, upbeat album.  Just about every song will take 80's kids like myself back to their childhood, which is probably part of the idea.  If you liked the Go-Gos back in the day, you will also like this album.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|Right off the bat, this less-than-five stars does not signal that I dislike this album. the Beatles are an excellent band, but, like most of their works, it is overrated. is it good? certainly. is it puffed up beyond relief? in my view, yes.  If you want a superb album, this should definetly be one you purchase. but don't expect as much as you've heard
B002K0WBXW|2.0|This was a very overhyped movie to start with.  The movie showed very very little romance or comedy and it was filed under romantic comedy.  I hate 99% of these style of movies but I sat through this with my gf and managed to watch the whole thing, so thats worth two stars I guess.
0307588335|3.0|These two authors pen a thrilling and well written insider account of Lehman's collapse. Fools abound, villains are tarred and feathered, heroes lauded, tragedies laid bare, strange financial terms and roads to riches revealed and the insider's emotional and psychic catharsis given air. McDonald's subjectivity might have succumbed to a publicized rant except for the deft writing of Robinson who knows how to turn a phrase and lubricate the storyline to bring facts and authority to the reader.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|I think the criteria here is simple... If you liked Paramore's previous two efforts and want more of the same then you will like 'Brand New Eyes'. If you were hoping for something entirely different or an evolutionary change in style, you will not get it here.    For my part, I loved the first two albums and this one does represent a consistent presentation of new material and solid musicianship and songwriting within the same somewhat unique style (IMHO) that they have always had. In particular the vocals are always a strong point for me. One note, I don't know what kind of vitamins the drummer has been taking, but one thing that struck me is that the drumming on this album is exceptional. Some of the best I've heard in this style of music in some time.    So, all in all a very good effort and worth the money, even if safe stylistically (and there's nothing wrong with that for a third album).

I only wish I could speak French so I didn't have to take my eyes off the screen to read the subtitles. The Backward time edit is really efective, but takes a few scenes to set in. The fire extinguisher scene is supremely gruesom, very realistic, and horrifyingly disturbing. And not a second of CGI I might add. Monica Belluci is beautiful as always, and gives a terrific performance. The fact that the tunnel scene ( as all others ) is one continuous cut, proves that the director was interested in the utmost realism, and He delivers. Be warned however that this is not a movie for youngsters or someone who would be easily offended, there are scenes of full frontal male nudity, erect penises, and more pelvic thrusts than a Ron Jeremy movie. The first 20 minutes or so have some wild camera work, but it is demonstrating the state of mind for Pierre, and Marcus, and is very effective. Over all a great movie expierence.
B000X1YDCM|5.0|[[ASIN:B000WGZGNS The Beyoncé Experience - Live!]]  This woman is absolutely amazing and hardworking.  Even when off-stage to change clothes she leaves the audience with something to do.  And those changes are perfectly placed too!  Beyoncé's voice is incredible as shown by many songs but REALLY shown in \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\".  Her ability to dance SO hard, giving her all, and to sing at the same time is AMAZING! This is truly an Experience...

1582701709|4.0|This book is truly inspirational and I have recommended to several of my friends.  I believe it is worth reading a number of times to receive the full benefit. There is a great deal to absorb, but really worth it.  I would highly recommend this book it is quick reading and the ideas shared are very logical and motivational.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Pleasant read told in the voice of a young and aged Lady's Maid.  The book slowly builds to a mysterious ending that I found unique.  Writing style seemed a bit understated; a style I associate with the British.  It left me wanting to know more about the main character, Grace.  But, as in real life, a servant's story remains largrly untold.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|Well - I held in my hands the Legend of the Seeker.  What did I find Xena or Hercules meets Matrix and Star Wars.  The ideas are there, the background superb, and the costumes not bad.  Then came the acting.  Unlike some who comment, let us really look at the acting.  There is promise, but the dialog leaves much to be desired.  Zed is a standout.  But so much is needed.  In a time when other better written Sci-Fi suffers from cuts, we still have the curse that Fantasy has a problem on TV.  Xena and Hercules show that a tongue-in-cheek attitude can win over a lack of consistent dialog.  The curse of Fantasy on TV continues.  The answer is still out there...somewhere.

1607961423|5.0|Slowly, but surely, the mysteries of the subconscious mind are simplified through the common language of the book.  What's more, a clear picture of the power of your mind begins to form and crystalize, allowing one to move confidently in the direction of self-control and unlimited possibilities through autosuggestion, visualization, decision, and persistence.  What a great book!  I highly recommend it.<br />--John Fox<br />Certified Bob Proctor LifeSuccess Coach
1577314808|5.0|This book is very easy to read. The approach is simple and direct approach, yet conveys a great depth of meaning. This is the kind of book that is best read slowly to savour all that has come before.
0061122416|3.0|I'm giving this 3 stars, though I would rather give it 2.5 stars.  Here's the deal on this book.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful.  Although it doesn't flow as much as I imagine it does in its native language, the story has a calming effect in the way it's laid out.<br /><br />Santiago's struggles are easily related to.  We all have goals and dreams that we want to pursue, and many of us have put them by the wayside, for various reasons.  I got that - and I understand that what the author seems to want to portray is that in order to be at peace with yourself you have to put the smaller rewards aside and continue on toward the greater goal.<br /><br />Here's what I didn't like about the book.  Santiago made his choices without thought toward the others it affected in his life.  He had no sense of duty or responsibility (now, granted, this doesn't affect him as much as it would affect many of those reading the book).  Having lived through experiences of people setting out to fulfill their hopes and dreams.. at the expense of others happiness - especially those innocent, I would have to say that the moral of the story here would need to be taken with a grain of salt and understanding that this one boys story does not apply to us all.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty story, a tad unrealistic and a fairly interesting read.
0810983915|4.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kids books are great. This one wasn't as funny as the others but I still liked it alot. Another funny book is Secrets of a Lab Rat. It has a really funny story about a boy named Scab who invents stuff (I won't tell you what!). You should read it!
B002KWLUU0|4.0|It was revealed about the time that Steve McQueen(UK)/Two Wheels Good(US) was remastered and re-released with added Paddy McAloon acoustic versions of some tracks that Paddy was coping with both blindness and deafness. So if he releases some older demos under the Prefab Sprout brand, give the man a break. Maybe his infirmities have brought him closer to his God as well. His is a remarkable legacy.<br /><br />And I, like NME, believe that Steve McQueen IS one of the top 100 albums of all time. Thomas Dolby, who produced the album in 1985, and oversaw the remastering in 2006, states on his blog, \\"If you never heard this album, I urge you to seek it out. You won't regret it. And, if you like my music, please know that you don't have a complete overview unless you own this album and 1990's `Jordan: The Comeback'-because these two works are as close to my heart as anything I've ever put out under my own name.\\" Enough said.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|As with all Rammstein albums...it takes time to truly appreciate their intelligence.  This cd takes you back to their roots, but it is laced with something more...intelligent planning of every note, riff, line...you name it.  It's not like the past two albums...this one is oh so raw.  But absolutely excellent.  One reviewer mentioned something 'bout the singing in English with Pussy.  They did a fantastic job.  What's the prob. ?  The accent?  The catchy words?  Get real.  In order for a band to survive there must be at least 2-3 songs that appeal to the masses.  Pussy does this.  The chorus is absolutely catchy. The lack of rhyming IS the catch.  Rock on Rammstein!  Liebe ist ja fuer alle, da, da, da.
B000RIWAVW|3.0|With Halloween just a few days away, this movie came on TV and I watched it for the first time. Though there are nearly a thousand reviews already on here, mine might be the only one from an overtly Christian point of view, so I thought I'd post it for a little something different.<br /><br />Right up front I'll let the (black!) cat out of the bag in a single sentence: There were actually a number of things I liked about Halloween, even though, for reasons I'll mention, in the end I personally had to give it a miss.<br /><br />On the positive side, I love the fact that this was an independent venture made on a shoestring (by movie standards). In my opinion, the distinctly non-studio feel of the film works nearly 100% to its advantage. I was in junior high in 1978, and all I can say is that \\"it felt like that\\", and I think the big studio treatment would have ruined this. Secondly, evil should be presented as evil . . . and it was. Many might mistakenly assume that Christians want no evil at all in movies, but that is silly. The Bible is full of examples of evil, from the devil on down. I appreciated that the film made no pretense on this point: Michael Myers (as the doctor said) is pure evil -- cold, menacing, heartless, terrifying, relentless. Acknowledging this evil forthrightly, rather than having Dr. Loomis 'redefine' it as simply a psychological malady was, I thought, refreshing. (BTW, I thought Myers' mask was perfect . . . expressionless, uncaring, otherly.) On a related note, kudos to director Carpenter for achieving this portrayal without resorting to buckets of blood, etc. (This was why I was willing to give it a try in the first place.) An atmosphere of dread and genuine suspense is created w/o all that. I think audiences appreciate and admire this. For this reason I don't even like to consider Halloween a \\"slasher film\\", since that designation conjures up all the low-quality flicks that followed in its steps and were built around little more than visually grossing out the viewer with artless scenes of sickening violence and gore. Too bad so few filmmakers seem to emulate this quality of restraint. Regarding the acting, I have always enjoyed Donald Pleasence's quirky screen persona immensely (be sure to catch the Columbo episode he's in, for example), and Jamie Lee Curtis' sort of unpolished style (at this starting point in her career) worked for me and fit in with the film's natural overall feel. On a final note (bad pun intended), that signature, unforgettable musical theme is fantastic! Haunting in its simplicity and sounding much like a child poking around on the keys of a piano, it is perfect for a film about a night when children take to the streets, naive to the unspeakable horror lurking in the shadows.<br /><br />Dramatically there are some weaknesses. Some dialogue is terrible (extremely amateurish), and at times the supporting acting is poor. I also thought the very, very last plot twist - especially - crossed regrettably into the realm of the (overly) unrealistic -- one turn too many. However, these criticisms do not make up the main reason for my muted enthusiasm over this picture. So where did the movie let me down? Well, I realize that by later standards Halloween is 'tame' when it comes to the sex and violence department, but it still disappointed me that it contained what it did in these areas. Not that I was expecting it not to, but for me (a committed Christian) it was a shame that a movie which had many cool aspects working in its favor nevertheless threw in these touches (stuff like the stupid bed scene, or the guy being stabbed into the wall - & suspending him off the ground, which I don't even think is possible, btw, & more could be cited). While it is true, as has been pointed out by others, that almost all who meet their end in violent death are those engaging in sinful behavior (and thus it has been interpreted as a cautionary tale of moral recompense), it just went over the line for me. AndI saw only the TV version (they may have cut out some of the most explicit material).<br /><br />So, to summarize: It's not hard to see why legions of fans like this classic in the horror film genre. I certainly liked some of its attributes too (stated above). And it was NOT the fact that real and scary evil was present and effectively conveyed in the story that resulted in my own mixed review & rating. Rather, for me it was the inclusion of certain (needless) elements that bothered me enough morally that it ultimately tipped the scales against its viewing value. Perhaps such concerns are non-issues for many, but are not trivial matters for the discriminating Christian.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.I saw only the TV version (they may have cut out some of the most explicit material).<br /><br />So, to summarize: It's not hard to see why legions of fans like this classic in the horror film genre.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I purchased both the stereo box set and this mono box set from Amazon. My review is purely a subjective \\"liberal arts\\" assessment, as I neither possess the technical knowledge base nor any proclivities for same. Other reviews provided here provide such a comparative technical assessment for those who find this important.     While the stereo box set contains everything the Beatles released during their relatively brief time together, the mono set clearly distinguishes itself from the former in what it does contain and is simply the best recorded compilation I have ever heard from the Fab Four!  The fidelity and sonics are simply magnificant. Each of the 10 LPs along with the two past masters cds sound better than any other version I have heard, including ALL of the stereo box set versions.  The highlights for me are Sgt Pepper, Beatles for Sale, Help, and A Hard Day's Night. The stereo versions that approaches the fidelity and sonics of the mono version are Revolver, The Beatles (white album) and Magical Mystery Tour.  The mono set's packaging is far superior to that provided for the stereo box set, which is unfortunate. Given its high price, the stereo box set should have been afforded the same premium packaging as the mono box set.  While I do not regret purchasing the stereo box set, the fact remains that both box sets are quite expensive, and I could have secured the collection I wanted by purchasing the mono box set and then purchasing the remastered stereo versions of Let It Be, Abbey Road, and Yellow Submarine (all originally recorded in stereo and are not in the mono set. Also, I would probably have picked up the stereo versions of Revolver, The Beatles white album),and Magical Mystery Tour as well. For anyone who really appreciates the Beatle's music, the mono box set is a must buy!

B000A0GYD2|4.0|Before the magnificent documentary `[[ASIN:B000XJ5TPE In the Shadow of the Moon]],' HBO's `From Here to the Moon' was a multi-faceted miniseries that encapsulated the Apollo program for the near decade America prepared and went to the moon.  As a reenactment, the show illuminates the challenges, logistics, relationships, dangers, and interpersonal strife found in the experiences that shaped the precious time when man actually reached and explored the lunar surface.  Tom Hanks, who is a main sponsor of the project, is the consummate narrator and a good writer, but his helm as the director of the first episode is comparatively lackluster, which should not deter anyone from seeing all twelve installments, each bringing a different piece of the trajectory of the missions, and most recreating an exciting adventure with an unpretentious look at some lesser known controversies, problems, and issues behind the headlines.  The combined talents of many make for excellent viewing.

044654146X|5.0|There is a growing literature which speaks of the distinctiveness of Israel and its unique contribution to global culture. I think most recently of George Gilder's outstanding 'The Israel Test'. No doubt one impulse for the creation of such books has been the worldwide campaign to delegitimize Israel, as prelude to physically destroying it. Thus the very pro- Israel books come in a way as contributions to the justification of the Jewish state, and as defense of it. What is of course distressing about this, and the need for paeans to Israeli exceptionality is the fact that Israel is the only country in the world which is required to 'justify' its existence in this way.<br />In any case this present book focuses on Israel's scientific and even more technological achievements. It speaks about the Israeli reaction to the Arab boycott, and the special situation of 'confinement' Israelis feel at not having normal access to  neighboring countries. Israel is a very small country physically and thus many have a certain claustrophobic sense , especially those youngsters who have served in the Army. After the Army many young people adventurously use their new - found freedom.<br />Two forms of this are the trekking Israelis do throughout distant regions of the world, with special emphasis on South America, and the India- Nepal region, and the 'tech-ing' Israelis do in creating start-ups at a rate all out of proportion to their numbers in the world. Israelis have hooked into high- tech communications and rode on the wave of a world economy which is increasingly electronic.<br />The start- ups too come in part because of an encouraging government policy, which devotes a high proportion of funds to research. But they also come because Israelis are a people continually forced to find non- conventional answers to very difficult and unusual problems.<br />For any supporter of Israel, and I assume that this is the real audience of this book, this book will be a real pleasure. It will provide yet more evidence of how one small state manages to make real contributions to the global economy, and the scientific and technological progress of mankind.e evidence of how one small state manages to make real contributions to the global economy, and the scientific and technological progress of mankind.

Not only was it great background music but I think I was actually more motivated to complete the tasks. The cd was a great mix of old favorites and some songs that were new (new to me at least). Also, I thought the cd provided nice variety with each song bringing something new to the experience.

020161622X|5.0|I found the book to be worth a read (which doesn't take long).  Filled with lots of lessons most programmers learn with time/experience.  It's not a book on design patterns or anything.  It's more of a book explaining things like planning, how to be most productive, the difference between a prototype and tracer bullets, why code generation is powerful/how to do it, the benefits of decoupling...etc.  It's quite a little gem in many ways... and best of all, easy to read.

I was hoping for a bit more depth and for it to be a bit more technical.  It is a great book for those people that comment with \\"if we came from monkeys then why dont some monkeys talk,\\" (which is an actual quote from somebody I work with).  It certainly will help those not familiar with evolution to see this stunning marvel at work.

6305972591|5.0|\\"Children of the Corn\\" is one of those movies that leaves a connection with you after you've seen it. I remember when I was 11 or 12 and this movie was on TV, right in the beginning in the coffee house massacre scene. I remember being so frightened I had to switch channels! Being older, I can say that the movie's not as terrifying now, but \\"Children of the Corn\\" still has an eerie atmosphere that entices you all the way through.<br /><br />If you can get past what may seem silly aspects that climax towards then end and enjoy the movie nonetheless, then \\"Children of the Corn\\" will definitely be a great watch. It's one of those '80s classics that's still just as entertaining, eerie, mystical and captivating now as it was in its own time. The setting in the abandoned, little Midwestern town is the perfect setting for this sort of movie, so that beefs up the quality of the film right there. In addition, the acting is quite good, and Isaac is one of the most sinister little punks I've ever seen on screen! Malachai too, plays an awesome villain, but whereas Isaac plays the darker, more evil villain, Malachai plays the more nuts-out, kick-a## sort of villain. The two of them work great together and lead the evil flock of children...gahh, it's starting to take its effect on me again!<br /><br />Although \\"Children of the Corn\\" doesn't really have the humorous breaks in it that a lot of other horror movies do, it's certainly a great and enjoyable movie, that's most likely to captivate you with its dark, mysterious atmosphere. Pick this up in time for Halloween, too, to give yourself an extra reason to be scared and to love this time of year! Thanks for the time, and peace.
0345479092|1.0|The author mistakes her own preferences, projections, fears and family experiences for facts. For example, her statement about \\"starting as you mean to go on\\" makes me wonder if she recognizes that we don't breastfeed forever and our babies do grow out of diapers. Baby's are different from adults and how she can believe that by meeting our babies needs leads to \\"demanding babies\\" is beyond me. I believe many of her statements say more about her control issues than about babies.  I truly hope those that read this book see it for what it is, one woman's opinion.

B00005JGI6|5.0|The Invisible Band is Travis' commercially most successful album, and many would argue that this also applies in artistic terms.<br /><br />Three tracks from the album reached the top twenty, and the songs \\"Sing\\" \\"Side\\" and \\"Flowers in the Window\\" requires no further presentation.<br /><br />Among the other tracks the album \\"Follow the Light\\" is a favorite, this song undoubtedly had the potential to get the album another hit. The strongest track of the album, though, is for me the closing track \\"The Humpty Dumpty Love Song\\" - which begins just like it was just a bonus appendix for the album; nothing could be more wrong which you will realize as soon as the overwhelmingly moving chorus first is sounding.<br /><br />All in all a really strong album, where some of the songs might suffer from having been played too often.

AIC simply could not have done better under the circumstances in my opinion.  Don't listen to the people who say that this is simply another Jerry Cantrel solo album... it is anything but.   It has the unmistakable feel of the old AIC... something the JC solo was very much lacking (but still good in it's own right, mind you).  If you liked AIC before you'll like this album, simply put.  After a few spins this disc is at the top of my collection.  Buy it.

One of the red flags is the publisher of the Ray Comfort forwarded version, the Bridge-Logos Foundation, which also publishes such hits as \\"After The Rapture\\" and, peculiarly, \\"Scientific Facts in The Bible\\".

B001AQTWF2|1.0|Plummeting to number 15 this week is no surprise to me. Whitney has waited and procrastinated far to long for audiences to take her seriously. I was a true fan of Whitneys when she was so very good. Then Bobby came along and the bridge just collapsed. She sank into a dismal haze of darkness. Clive Davis was generous enough to give her a chance, and it was a big mistake. Even digital studio tinkering could not save this or her. It is unfortunate that she simply does not have the voice she once had and even more unfortunate that her 'comeback' is a fallback. The big mistake,among others, her interview with Diane Sawyer stating and I quote \\"I don't need Diana Ross, I had my mother and that was enough.\\" Diana Ross made it possible for many artists to emerge and to snub her was a huge error. This CD is just a waste of our time. Perhaps there is something good on the horizon for Whitney. I truly hope for this to become a reality.
B000VZPCN4|4.0|Yeah, yeah, disco, selling out, getting too big.  Let's use a little hindsight here.  So, \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\" and \\"Sure Know Something\\" are disco.  So what?  The Stones did disco, too.  It worked, and these songs do, too.   Actually, these Paul Stanley tracks are more convincing than some of his harder rocking efforts.    Dynasty is a solid album from KISS.  I first heard it when it came out thirty years ago; it was the first of the KISS reissues that I bought.  I think of it as the album that Ace Frehley truly came into his own.  It was the first KISS album after the much-lauded, poorly-selling solo sets.  Ace's album was almost universally applauded as the best of the four, and he had the only substantial hit of the four, with \\"New York Groove\\" (not even the best song on the album, but, I digress).  On Dynasty, Ace was ready to be heard.  He takes lead vocal duties on three tracks.  Two of the songs were written by Ace -- \\"Hard Times\\" and \\"Save Your Love.\\"  \\"Hard Times,\\" a reminiscence of Ace's rough early years, is okay, but not great.  \\"Save Your Love,\\" though, is a damn fine (and Damn bitter) break up song that still holds up thirty years later.    Ace's shining moment, and the shining moment of Dynasty for that matter, is his cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"2000 Man.\\"  In the Stones' capable hands, \\"2000 Man\\" was one of the few redeeming tracks on the 1967 mess Their Satanic Majesties Request.  Ace (and band) turns this song onto a rock 'n' roll rager.  It rocks.  It kicks.  Ace Frehley makes this song his own.  The Stones are my favorite rock 'n' roll band, but Ace Frehley, in my opinion, OWNS this song.    I do feel that Gene and Peter are both underrepresented on Dynasty.  It's not a classic album, but it's worth hearing and re-hearing.  And, if you are a fan of the Space Ace, you must hear his work on here.  Fans of rock, you GOTTA hear \\"2000 Man.\\"  It will enrich your life.  Really.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|If there's one thing I've learned by watching \\"Mad Men\\", it's that apparently NO ONE was happy in 1960. The men weren't happy and didn't know how to express it because they had to Be Men, and the women weren't happy because they were expected to be little more than mindless serving women. No one could talk about what they felt or what they really wanted, morality was subjective, and freedom was something you had only if you were a WASP, and even then it was the freedom to ONLY be a WASP and nothing else.    \\"Mad Men\\", as you doubtless know, tells the story of a group of advertising executives at a New York ad firm in 1960. The men, and they're almost all men, are kings of their domain, but are starting to sense the early stirrings of a peasant uprising. It's this - the conflict around the upcoming rise in freedom and equality for gays, women and blacks - that forms the basis of a lot of the most interesting stories in this show.    The acting, directing and cinematography are all suberb. The plots are intelligent and well-written. You'll even pick up a thing or two about advertising!    I hadn't seen this program on TV, nor seen any episodes of it. I bought this DVD set purely on the strength of what I'd heard about it. I was not disapointed. It may not be the best TV show of the last ten years (\\"Battlestar Galactica\\" wins that prize), but's supremely excellent and highly recommended!

B000K1P66W|4.0|This book, if taken to heart and put into practice, can ABSOLUTELY change your life.  It has changed mine, and so much so that I continue to buy additional copies and give them away to others.  Buy this book, and then live it.  You'll be glad you did.
B00000JMOF|3.0|Frankenstein: 5 out of 10: Frankenstein is a hard film to review. So much that was shocking in the film when it first came out is muted today. (Desecration of the grave ect.) As a standalone film rather than an American Classic Frankenstein leaves much to be desired.    The film is very stagy with people exiting stage left and posing theatrically. The fight scene between the monster and the bride on her wedding day is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material. The movie is quite short (running about an hour) and character development is minimal. If you real Shellys original work you are likely to be appalled by some of the changes.     The brain is in the film is one of a criminal (Abby Normal) as opposed to an everyman. This changes a major component of the novel. In the book, Frankenstein became evil because he was rejected by man not because of some predestined nature. The destruction of Frankensteins family by his experiment that goes against Gods will is barely touched upon and the romance between Victor (excuse me Henry; they changed the name to Victors younger deader brother) and his fiancée is barely touched upon.      While the vastly superior Bride of Frankenstein surprised with its effectiveness and advanced film techniques Frankenstein surprises with its brevity and staginess. But in its defense it is a classic and Boris Karloff is great as the monster.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|While I think the remastered audio sounds top-notch, I was disappointed in the mini-documentary and was glad that I didn't get the stereo box for the DVD, because these docs aren't really much.  With Let It Be, I was expecting to hear the bitchy stories that we all know and love.  I think the harshest thing said in this doc was that Twickenham was too cold and that Apple made for a nicer atmosphere.  Then there was a comment from Paul about the Spector mix, but it didn't get any further than mentioning Glyn Johns' mix wasn't up to par and that Spector was brought in.  Just enjoy the album, as it is very enjoyable, but don't expect much from the mini-doc, or from any of the mini-docs, for that matter.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|I was expecting \\"The Proposal\\" to be a weak rehash of [[ASIN:B00008977F Green Card]]which was just an okay film in the first place. I wasn't too excited to watch this one even if it meant some snuggle time with my sweetheart, frankly I was more interested in watching my NCAA football game yesterday.<br /><br />Well I watched my game, and we got trounced, so I really wasn't in the mood for a bad movie...<br /><br />Luckily not only is \\"The Proposal\\" not a bad movie, but it is in fact a good movie.<br /><br />Here's the deal, for a Romantic Comedy, the acting is all top notch. The story is well written and well nuanced. All of the back stories made at least a certain amount of sense, and the comedy was really funny. I actually sat through an immediate replay with my wife and laughed again. So... for a fun movie night with your sweetie, \\"The Proposal\\" is a good bet!<br /><br />4*
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Child 44 was a really well written historical fiction. It really captured much of the everyday problems that one could face in communist russia while moving that perspective into the larger perspective of catching a serial killer whose existence, if admitted, makes you a criminal. The ending was a slight disappointment, but still very much worth the read.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Bottom line: worth the price, and the sound quality is better than I expected. I've used these for a few extended-hour sessions, and I have no major complaints. They are light and relatively comfortable even after several hours. I wear glasses, so this type of headphone can be a problem, but these work fine. The sound quality is really fantastic and I found myself using these to play games even when I didn't need the microphone; I can hear things I didn't know were in the game in great detail. They don't compare to my audiophile headphones, of course, but they sound as good if not better than any other headphone I've tried in this price range. I usually despise \\"bass boosts\\" because they just serve to muddy up the sound--the function actually works fairly well on these (you can also tell someone at Turtle Beach cares about music listening, as they rightfully suggest turning off the bass boost while listening to music). The independent volume controls for game and chat audio are really fantastic, especially when you get \\"that guy\\" that doesn't seem to realize he is yelling into a really sensitive microphone. The chat monitoring (hearing yourself through the earphones a little) is also great.    I really wish everyone used this style of headset, because they don't cause the echo that earpieces do, which can get really annoying.    There are a few minor flaws I can live with. First, there is definitely a hiss with these on my setup, although it isn't terrible and I don't notice it during play. Turning on the \\"stereo expander\\" makes it worse, but I don't really like gimmicks like that anyway. Second, the controls feel a little cheap and are a little finicky. The volume controls are really easy to bump, so it is easy to accidentally turn the volume way up or down. The switch for the mic mute is a little inconvenient, and I wish it was a button you could press rather than a plastic switch that is a little difficult to use on the fly (at least without bumping the volume controls). And there is a \\"pop\\" when turning the mic mute on/off (I don't know if it is audible to others in the game).    Overall, the flaws are actually very minor and I can definitely recommend these.

0525421033|5.0|\\"If I stay\\" tells the story of Mia, a gifted cellist, who appears to have everything - a handsome talented boyfriend who both gets and loves her; a fun, hip quirky family, good friends and a bright future.  She faces a tough choice: whether to stay home with her friends and family, or whether to pursue her musical studies in the new world of New York City.    Then, one day, everything changes.  And Mia's choice becomes a lot harder, and a lot more elemental.    This book is amazing, showing, rather than telling how fragile life and happiness are, how everything can change in the blink of an eye.  It neither sugarcoats, nor minimizes tragedy.  No matter what, things are not going back to the way they were.  Music is also woven throughout the book, playing an especial role in the ending (which had me in tears).  \\"If I stay\\" also shows, rather than tells, how powerful love is, whether it's through a private conversation Mia's grandfather has with her, or watching her best friend and boyfriend, who previously hadn't all that much to say to each other, pulling together in this time of crisis.      This short (170-page volume) is simply and beautifully written, and packs a tremendous emotional punch.  It's going on my shelf, for me to pick up when I need reminding of just how precious life is - and it's going on my gift list.  Highly recommended - probably the best book I've read this year.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|This movie made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  IT's not perfect by any means, but the cast make up for the imperfections of the script.  Each actress is so engulfed in their role in this film it's not even funny!  After watching it for the first time, I ordered it online to have in my collection.  I truly enjoy this film.

1416562605|4.0|Aravind Adiga was born in Madras in 1974. Although he has written for Time Magazine, and has had articles printed in the Independent and the Sunday Times, \\"The White Tiger\\" is his debut novel. Impressively for a debut, it won the Man Booker Prize in 2008.     The book takes the form of a letter - dictated by Balram Halwai over seven nights, and intended for the desk of China's Premier, Wen Jiabao. Premier Jiabao, apparently, wants to discover the truth about Bangalore and meet some genuine Indian entrepreneurs. As Balram believes he ticks both boxes, he figures he can help the Premier out. However, since his firm won't figure on the politicians' lists, he decides to contact the Premier's office directly. His plan is simple : by telling the Premier his own life story, the Premier will learn the truth about Bangalore. While he admits to being somewhat lacking in his education, he seems convinced that his methods are the way forward and believes the 21st Century will be the Century of the Yellow and the Brown Man.     Balram's life hasn't been entirely easy : he was born into poverty, in Laxmangarh - a one street village with no sanitation, no electricity, broken water taps and where the most important family member was the water buffalo. People from the lowest classes are expected to serve their masters with absolute devotion and loyalty and, in return, are abused and blamed. Corruption and bribery are widespread, with (naturally) only the rich and the powerful benefitting. Laxmangarh had four exceptionally rich landlords : the Stork, the Buffalo, the Raven and the Wild Boar - and they taxed the villagers according to their livelihoods. Balram's father, Vickram, was a rickshaw driver and he had to pay the Buffalo for using the roads. However, it's the Stork's family who have the greatest impact on Balram's life.    Balram has had several names over his lifetime. He was originally called \\"Munna\\" at home, but - as Munna means \\"boy\\" - it was his schoolteacher that choseBalram as his \\"official\\" name. The book's title, \\"The White Tiger\\", also refers to Balram - it was something of a nickname for Balram, chosen by a school inspector. A white tiger is something special, something that only comes along once every generation. Although Balram's education was incomplete, he had been the best reader and writer in his class. The inspector figured Balram was an intelligent, honest, vivacious fellow\\" surrounded by a \\"crowd of thugs and idiots.\\" Given that - by the end of the book's first chapter - Balram has admitted to cutting his boss' throat and stealing a bag of cash, his honesty obviously didn't last. In fact, while he introduced himself to the Premier as one of Bangalore's most successful but least known businessmen, that claim wasn't entirely true. Three years before the book opens, his wanted poster had been pasted the length and breadth of India.    Overall, \\"The White Tiger\\" is certainly worth reading...it just wasn't quite the book I'd hoped for. If it was good enough to win the Booker Prize, I honestly can't understand why Kazuo Ishiguro has only won it once. (I thought \\"Never Le Me Go\\", especially - which was shortlisted in 2005 - was much better than this).

0470449748|4.0|This book, as it promises, is loaded with GMAT questions. I like the answers, they are well organized and very detailed. I only wish that the book included couple of real GMAT tests.
1400063515|5.0|Though this book is not an easy read, it nonetheless must be read.  The author explains that history is not as predictable as we think it is and it does not move linear but in fits and starts from startling events.  The title is used as a metaphor.  Everyone thought that all swans were white until the black swan was discovered.  His most dramatic visual is a simple example of a two dimensional graph showing on the y axis satisfaction from a turkey's perspective and time on the X axis.  It shows the y axis growing with time until - bang the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Taleb than asks the rhetorical question, \\"do you want to be a turkey\\".  Risk is not an exact science, the author was a quant trader, and came to study why all of the risk formulas sometimes don't work and in some cases are disastrous  - everything from the Stock Market Crash in 1987 to 9/11 - are examples when the \\"black\\" swan appears.  This book was written before the Great Recession.  After reading this book the reader can see that the \\"black swan\\" was an unraveling of a \\"white swan\\" - property values, though prone to local bubbles, would not go down for an entire country - in other words the \\"white swan\\" was a macro-economic model and when it burst everything changed.  The rest of the book is very instructive in thinking about risk and again not being a turkey.  Don't read it to your own detriment.

0307474275|4.0|OVERALL: If you want a classic thriller, this is it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Fast paced, page turner.<br />- Nice weaving of art and history, but....<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Brown doesn't tell you when he is making stuff up, and sometimes presents it as fact and this can be dangerous if you read it believing everything is true.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: It's a fun, entertaining yarn. Nothing more, nothing less.
B001IN7Q28|5.0|This is an excellent book that helped me identify negative relationships in my life.  It explains the relationships and possible manifestations of such.  This book really let me know that I do not have to remain in these toxic relationships and can take a different more rewarding path in my life.  I am 54 and learned a great deal.  I am changing my life at this age and feel good about it.  I feel confident that I will be able to look back at these changes without the regret and heartfelt thanks to M. Scott Peck
0385504225|4.0|OVERALL: It's an entertaining repeat of the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" formula.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Fast paced, thriller<br />- Educational<br />- Entertaining<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Like Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown blends fact and fiction, which can be dangerous because some readers might believe everything they read.<br />- It's a predictable repeat of the Da Vinci code in almost every way.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Unlike some people, I read Brown's books with modest expectations. I read them for entertainment. I hope it will be a page turner, but I don't expect it to be a classic in English Literature. If you have such expectations, then you'll probably enjoy this book.

B0000DYKET|5.0|I hardly ever write reviews of products, but I just had to take a couple of minutes here to say that these are incredible shoes.  I'm about to order my second pair here at Amazon, because after two years of wearing these on a daily basis I am finally in need of a new pair.  And when I say daily, I mean that have likely worn these more than 600 days since I bought them for my trip to Europe in 2007.  They are handsome and unbelievably durable.  I wear them while renovating my home in Costa Rica, throw them in the laundry, and they seem to come out like new every time.  And even after two years of daily abuse, I'm very comfortable wearing them with jeans and going out.    Negatives?  Personally I hope they don't change a thing.
B002M3SOWO|4.0|Well, the moment has come.  Kronos/Luke is making his big move in this book.  He has gathered the Titans, hordes of ancient creatures of evil, the Minotaur (yeah, he's back), as well as a horde of rebel demi-gods.<br /><br />Percy, on the other hand, finds the numbers of campers greatly reduced.  And on a personal level, his attention divided between Annabeth and Rachel.  I won't say too much more --because I loath spoilers-- only that Nikos is still urging him to undergo a terrifying journey to the Underworld in order to give them a chance to defeat the now physically invincible Kronos.  (Remember, weapons just bounce off the evil guy)<br /><br />Talking Points:::<br />The Final Book ties up all the loose ends.  We finally get to find out what the prophecy means, and just exactly what sacrifice Percy will have to make.<br /><br />The writing is just as wonderful as in the previous books.  There is lots of humor as well as insights into the characters lives.<br /><br />Personally, I was hoping for a little more 'pathos'.  Death has always been treated lightly in the series, but I hoped this last book might change that perspective a tiny bit.  There was one other plot element that I thought weakened the overall effect of the story, but generally it was a most gratifying read.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this series to young readers who love adventure.  It's one of my favorites.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and reviewer at BooksForKids-review
B001GAPC1K|1.0|After recently upgrading both my DVD players (a Samsung 1500 and a Pioneer BDP51) this disc will no longer play.  Interestingly not only will it not play, the Pioneer can't even identify it (unknown disc error).

0670215821|5.0|I have read this book, half a dozen times, never tire of it, a very powerful story, graphically written.
0061122416|2.0|While to the uninitiated this book might seem inspiring, it is in fact largely a rip off of various world religious/spritual view points packaged up in a moderately inspired story.  The writing is fairly weak by literary standards.  The book reads more like a self-help manual with little to no evocative description or creative imagery inspiring you to truly care or identify with the characters.  The lessons are rather simple.  Follow your dreams, don't let other people tell you you'll fail, listen to your heart, blah blah blah.  Hallmark cards and Dr. Phil spin the same cleanly packaged inspirational messages.    Like most hippy influenced new-age religion, in the end you get to have your cake and eat it too.  Santiago gets the gold, the girl, and Paulo Coelho gets your money. Rather ironic don't you think?    Read Siddhartha instead.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I loved this movie! I usually choose movies by the actors/actresses that I love. Meryl Streep is one of my favorites. She does a wonderful job in this film and I am sure that she is far from this type of person in her real life. Her acting was incredible!<br />What caught my attention the most was the struggle that Andy had while deciding if it was worth her keeping a position that she really didn't want but did keep it in hopes that she would eventually get her dream job. She went above and beyond to try to please this woman she worked for.<br />I was kind of surprised that Andy's boyfriend eventually left her because he could not deal with her being married to her job. I don't think there are many men out there that are happy with an ordinary woman. I haven't come across too many! I thought he would have stayed by her side, understanding all along that she was just trying to reach her own goals.<br />I know this is Hollywood but in many ways I could relate to Andy and the life decisions she was making, while playing this part, as I too have worked for a few Amanda Priestly's and could have climbed the ladder of success but instead I chose not to live an artificial role...playing a part in life just to have \\"a better life\\". By the way, I like her last name PRIEST...ly! I took a moment to look up the word \\"Prada\\" because I really didn't know what it meant or stood for. I'd have to sell my soul to be able to afford this line of clothing. I'd have to say the Priestly name fits!<br />I will watch this again

0198326769|3.0|First Line: One afternoon, when Bruno came home from school, he was surprised to find Maria, the family's maid-- who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet-- standing in his bedroom, pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates, even the things he'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's business.<br /><br />Bruno is the son of a high-ranking SS officer in Nazi Germany. He and his older sister, Gretel, are growing up in luxury in Berlin when Hitler promotes their father and they find themselves moving to \\"Out-With\\" in Poland. Neither of the children have any idea what sort of place Out-With (Auschwitz) is, and they wonder what in the world all the people dressed in striped pajamas are doing on the other side of that tall fence. One day Bruno goes exploring and meets Shmuel, a young boy wearing striped pajamas who lives on the other side of the fence. They become friends.<br /><br />I had heard many good things about this book, and I looked forward to reading it. If it's read at face value and as if it's a fable, it can be a very powerful book indeed. However, I had problems with it. 99% of the time I have no trouble with my \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\" I can turn off my judgement and let the writer tell me a story, and I'll believe it... as long as nothing throws me out of the narrative. I kept getting tossed out of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, and I still have a few scrapes and bruises from the experience.<br /><br />The character who kept kicking me in the shins was Bruno. I found it impossible to believe that the nine-year-old son of a high-ranking Nazi would be so totally naive about Jews, Hitler, and almost everything else going on in the world around him. Putting that aside, Bruno was a spoiled, petty little brat who-- on rare occasions-- showed a glimmer of humanity, but when push came to shove, he did and said anything in his power to save his own neck. His air of entitlement made him impossible for me to like. (In fact the only character in the book that truly came to life for me was Pavel, the prisoner forced to peel potatoes and wait on the family at table.)<br /><br />The ending of the book is indeed powerful. Since I normally try my best not to give plot details away, I won't say anything about it here. I'll only mention my own reaction:<br /><br />You reap what you sow.<br /><br />Although I did have problems with The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, I am glad that I read the book.

Thomas is jeered at as the newcomer as he struggles to find any explanation at all for his new surroundings and his lack of memory. Alby, the leader of the Glade, intimidates him, but Newt, Alby's second-in-command, is much kinder. Regardless, neither have the answers to his frantic questions. Newt hands Thomas over to young Chuck, who takes him under his wing, showing the \\"greenbean\\" around and explaining as much as he can.    The Glade, Thomas discovers, is an enclosed space surrounded by stone walls. Outside the walls is an enormous labyrinth known simply as \\"the Maze.\\" The Gladers (all of whom appear to be equally clueless as to why they are there and who they truly might be) work hard at different jobs: some garden, some raise livestock, and some butcher animals for meat. And a number of their positions are less than quaint: some take care of the injured and the ill; others handle the dead.    The job that instantly intrigues Thomas is that of Maze runner. Maze runners race through the Maze every day, hoping to reach the end that might lead them home. But they return before dusk when the enormous stone walls surrounding the Glade slide shut, cutting off the Maze entrances from the Glade. This wouldn't be too bad, but once night falls, the savage creatures known as Grievers begin their hunt. These beasts have been known to kill Gladers or, even worse, injure boys and cause them to go through a time of torture called \\"the Changing.\\" In spite of the dangers, Thomas still yearns to become a runner.    Another mysterious group entrenched in their lives is \\"the Creators,\\" those who have placed the boys in the Glade. Every week, the Creators send food and supplies to the Glade, and once a month they send another teenage boy. But the day after Thomas's arrival, a girl shows up in the box --- and although Thomas does not remember how or why, he knows they are somehow connected. The girl speaks only one sentence before lapsing into a coma: \\"Everything is going to change.\\" Also, in her hand is a note that reads, \\"She's the last one. Ever.\\"    Despite being in a coma, the mysterious girl manages to communicate with Thomas in a most unusual manner, but Thomas doesn't have much time to dwell on this strange development. Things are changing within the Glade: Thomas's aspirations to enter the Maze have come true in an unexpected way when he makes a split-second decision to rescue another Glader, which lands him in a controversial position within his new community. Additionally, he discovers that danger is coming, and the Gladers must choose either to perish or to fight despite nearly impossible odds.    THE MAZE RUNNER is an irresistible page-turner of a thriller that should appeal to any fan of suspense and adventure stories. Its intriguing premise is somewhat reminiscent of (although not at all derivative of) the TV show \\"Lost.\\" Author James Dashner manages to give us not only plenty of plot at a great pace but also well-rounded characters to root for (Thomas is particularly well fleshed out, but even the secondary characters are quite believable). The tension rises steadily in the Glade's dark and ominous atmosphere. Hats off to a bombshell that is the cliffhanger ending, which leaves us with one urgent question: When does the next book in the series hit the shelves?       --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B000NA28I4|1.0|I watched this in the theater with my son. The first 20 minutes of it are pleasant and wonderful.    Then the shift comes in tone, scenes are edited quickly. Episodes from the second book are introduced to fill gaps. The story becomes one great big mess. Whole other episodes go unfilmed, unexplained.      My son who had such glee for the first two reels walked out of the theater fairly angry.     He ticked off several things wrong with the picture's framework, and large gaps in the story line, missing important elements.     PS: he doesn't want to even think about owning a DVD of the feature.
0070511136|4.0|Over two decades have passed since Neil Rackham's revolutionary sales treatise spun the business world upside down.  Since its publication, Rackham has gone on to become known as The Professor of Selling, reaching millions of eager sales people searching for a better way to practice their craft; this book lays a nice foundation.<br /><br />Rackham's scientific research has produced a winning formula for helping sales people maximize their potential, using four probing questions when trying to close that high dollar deal---Situation, Problem, Implication & Need Payoff (SPIN).  The clever acronym is a nice bonus, since it helps us remember what questions need to be addressed during the sales process.<br /><br />For any sales professional seeking an effective strategy to implement, this book is a great place to start.  The material covered is still quite relevent, and Rackham's engaging style of writing makes this all very easy to digest.  Certainly, this book belongs in any sales professional's personal library; perhaps not at the top of the list, but very close, nonetheless.
B000002KOQ|5.0|I love Joni's early stuff. Her voice is brilliant and the clean, minimalist instruments shine through the mix. Big Yellow Taxi is the hit of these tracks, but the haunting Woodstock and upbeat Conversation are my favorites. A great album produced by a great artist.
0061914177|5.0|Right of the bat, Gary tells the reader that you are free to disagree with what he is saying. That said, Gary has some great advice on growing on a niche market with your passion. He outlines it with three rules: Love your family, Work superhard, and Live your passion. It's aimed for entrepreneurs, but I believe this book talks for many people of all professions. Gary shares his own background, and then builds on how to make a brand for yourself and monetizing on it, though if it's all about money for you, then you've picked up the wrong book. It's more about pursuing happiness and launching a business that would allow you to be happy ten years from now. If anyone's read Time Ferris' Four Hour Work Week, some of the concepts are similar, yet Gary touches on how social media and the internet do help business grow.     Gary loves what he is doing and tries to answer everyone, like he said in the book. So I tweeted him that I loved his book, and he tweeted back to me within an hour, suggesting me to write a review. And I did just that. That's just how dedicated Gary really is, and how \\"real\\" he is to his audience.     It's an easy, quick read, definitely in one night or less. Gary's words are motivations and very conversational. At times, I heard his voice talking instead of a mindless British person reading. Gary adds an Appendix in the back that includes five ideas that could be a great brand on the internet, but apparently he's so busy, he's giving these ideas to the readers. I definitely felt more inclined to crush it now.
0385504225|4.0|Without ruining any small detail , all I will say is that the book was 'Well Worth the Wait!' Though, I never understood that saying, as I would much rather not have waited!    Again, Brown makes reading fun, stimulates the imagination and challenges the intellect. The Lost Symbol is every bit as good as any of his previous novels.    I have only one question for Mr. Brown, \\"When is the next book coming out?\\" ENJOY!!
971082483X|4.0|This book is short & easy to read.  It is written so that a 5th grader can understand the concepts.  If you want a complicated business book, don't buy this one, but if you want a simple read with good real-world implications that apply to managing in a business environment then this is a great one.

B001CZVVV4|5.0|This is the best of the best. Anna Netrebko is superb. The orchestra and chorus are outstanding and the total production typical of the Metropolitan Opera company claim to be the best. If you only buy one blu-ray opera DVD, this should be it. Why aren't more of the Met opera productions released in Blu-ray?
B001QXE0OC|5.0|Kiss & Tell is Selena's first full-length album, and it is a knock-out.  The album has a very upbeat feel, and most of the songs are bouncy electronica-esque dance pop.  Selena has a good range as a vocalist, and while it may not be as impressive as her peers as far as technique, her personality prevails and makes her worth listening to.    Top songs include I Won't Apologize, I Don't Miss You At All, Kiss & Tell, Naturally, and the lead single, Falling Down.

The subject matter seems far out but on the contrary,it does exist, Fringe just showcases the technology and it's workings, just like StarTrek and others. So yeah this is soo worth it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Absolutely love this video.  I have watched it several times and have introduced it to several family members.  The songs are very catchy and the characters will make you laugh
0375842209|4.0|This was a very well written book. The subject of the story and the point of view from which it was written were very different, but it was a good read. After I had gotten into the story I found it hard to put the book down.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|A movie that Is so refreshing to watch.A real classic. This Is a movie I could watch over and over.  Dustin Hoffman, does such a wonderful job playing Tootsie.. I cannot Imagine anyone else doing It... You really come to enjoy the part of Tootsie and can understand why everyone really enjoys her....  The story Is so well done and yet there Is added humor throughout the movie that Is so delightful to see. I cannot say enough about this movie.  I absolutely loved It....A great romantic comedy.....
B001FB55H6|4.0|This film took a couple of screenings for me to really warm up- fantastic cinemetography and special effects. On the '\\"dark side\\" of the light spectrum, wich ads to the dark overtones in the plot. The final hour or so (from when Rorscach is busted out of the slammer, and the Mars scenes with Dr. Manhattan) is real eye candy. I've used it several times as a demo for friends that have not seen Blu Ray yet, and get the dropped jaw response every time! Fun stuff, and a great soundtrack (All Along the Watchtower by Hendrix- too much!!) make for a very entertaining film.
1439148813|5.0|I've always been fascinated with space and technology. Born in the early 70s, I missed the higher nationwide space race hype, but am still drawn to the history of the whole thing. This book really gives an insider's look at the space program - through its challenges and triumphs. Kranz makes you feel like you're sitting at the console with him, and you're transported back in time as the excitement builds.<br /><br />This isn't a complete story about the space program -- it's specifically about Kranz' duties from when he got started with NASA until he left. If you've read other books about the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, this book not only fills out the missing details, this enhances the story and provides an emotional element. I was particularly drawn to personal feelings that Gene speaks about in the book (like when he threatened to quit or when he lost his temper), and when he mentions what else was going in the world which also affected things. As I said, it's an incredibly human story about a huge historical time period.
0547258305|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Loved it so much I read it while I had the flu-LOL  I loved the character development. Very descriptive so it was easy to picture what you are reading in your mind.  I think it ended kind of abruptly.   Katsa & Po are great characters.   Strong female lead.  Reading the sequel which is really a prequel (Fire).  I saw on Goodreads that there is another book called Bitterblue coming out next year. I hope so!

0316069906|5.0|If you consider yourself a conscientious consumer, Eating Animals is a must read. Equally important, it's a *great* read. It's a serious book, that knows not to take itself too seriously. It's the Daily Show of books on the food industry. While keeping us laughing, Foer delves into the importance of the food we eat by sharing the central role food plays in the creation of our memories (who doesn't talk about what you ate after a vacation?). He shows how what we eat not only directly effects the world (environmental issues, animal welfare, etc.), but also effects our understanding of the world.  As someone who appreciates both the nutritional and symbolic value of food, I found Eating Animals a captivating exploration. Read it.
0385504225|2.0|Michael Dunlang had a hunch. The unquestionably brilliant literary professor usually didn't bother with Barnes and Noble, preferring the superior and arcane selections of Amazon, but if nothing else, he could enjoy a cappuccino with the masses at Starbucks.  Suddenly, Dunlang spied an endcap and froze in his tracks.     [ITALIC] My God! It's the new Dan Brown novel! [End ITALIC]    Dunlang knew that hidden within the book was the secret to the universe. Five years of seclusion had brought it all together. Only the most intelligent mind would be able to unravel it. Fortunately, tweed-jacketed Dunlang had such a mind.    [ITALIC] Look at them. They have no idea what's in here. [End ITALIC]    Dunlang grabbed a newspaper from the newsstand and nonchalantly grabbed the novel, quickly wrapping it in the newspaper. He didn't want to be recognized as he excitedly sat down at a corner chair.     [ITALIC] Soon, all be revealed. [End ITALIC]    Dunlang, of course, knew the code rested in the italicized text. It was the keystone to an unbelievably powerful technology.    [ITALIC] The power to read minds. Imagine if this fell into the wrong hands! [End ITALIC]
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|As a fan, I bought this 2 disc release with mixed feelings and it is with mixed feelings that I rate this 5 stars after listening to the album. I went straight to Disc 2 because I've already heard (and own many times over) the other tracks. I suspect MJ is turning in his grave knowing that this first posthumous release is really just a re-release of tracks to match the movie, almost taking advantage of his fans. However, as a fan, I'll likely buy anything that is released in his name after his death.    Having said that, I'm giving this 5 stars because of the demos. The $9.99 that I've spent is well worth what I've received listening to the demo of \\"Shes out of my life\\". It's the first time (aside from Speechless from the Invincible album) you get to hear MJ's voice in all it's purity. It's touching and it's searingly beautiful.     After listening to the \\"new\\" tracks (the demos and the poem), you're left with a sad realization that his life truly ended too soon.
B002J8LVO0|5.0|Having taken their early, bombastic sound as far as it could go on WAR, U2 enlisted the production team of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois for the next studio album, and the result is another masterpiece. The major difference here is that the music is more subtle, sounding like what the Marshall Tucker Band or the Outlaws would have sounded like if they were playing new wave instead of Southern rock. The lyrics, too, are largely about America and its history as seen from across the Atlantic Ocean, with plenty of references to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King. What makes this album striking is that the band became a post-modern answer to the Outlaws by stripping away the bombast and loudness and making a generally calmer record. Some critics savaged this album when it was first released, probably because they didn't know what to make of it's somewhat quieter songs, but it's their loss. If anything, the subtlety actually makes the record MORE intense than its predecessors, in its own way. This remastered version is definitely the one to go for if you're going to buy this album.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This series is awesome.  Nathan Fillion is adorable as Castle and Stana Katic is his perfect \\"fighting partner\\".  There is so much rapid dialogue that you almost have to have close captioned to catch it all.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother trying to catch reruns.  Just BUY THE SERIES!  You won't be sorry.
B002BJCNLW|5.0|No need to write yet another review of THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE. I just have to ask everyone else who bought the 20th Anniversary Vinyl Edition, was there really no insert??? I am very suprised that this seems to be the case. No insert, virtually no information about the band and its history and impact on the back cover or anywhere else, and a completely blank white label on the 7\\" Pearl Bastard single. I have also purchased the huge CD/LP Collector's Edition which is magnificent. I am surprised the label (Sony) would skimp on the stand alone vinyl edition.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|It sadly has nearly been four months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson. While his death was a extremely devistating blow to his family and his legion of fans, his music has shown that as much as what he left as a legacy will always be immortal as the myth he was to being the King Of Pop. Now, with the hype around what was suppose to be the success of his final tour in London simply called, This Is It, arising in the wings with the upcoming concert documentary, and a new reintroduction into his musical odessy into his work on his solo career, and his works with his brothers from the Jackson 5 and The Jacksons to a generation of fans whom had been more interested in the wannabe acts like Rihanna and Jordin Sparks, as well as today's pop giants like Beyonce' and Britney Spears. Well, the week of the film has came around into the light, and the soundtrack is a walkthrough is now here, as a walkthrough to his musical solo works, that says this was Michael.<br /><br />This Is It, the new music soundtrack surrounding the documentary around what was suppose to be Michael Jackson's comeback into the spotlight and around his final shows in London is finally released. The colection of songs is mainly focused on his strongest songs during his successful solo status during the 80's and early 90's, with his works like Thriller and Bad and on his early 90's work Dangerous, and includes a lot of his classic gems from the ear he broke through with the 80's classic MTV generation including Beat It, the somber Man In The Mirror, Thriller, the intimate Human Nature, the deep Billy Jean, Wanna Be Starting Somethin' which was sampled awhile ago by Rihanna on Don't Stop The Music, and Black Or White. The collection also includes the never-before released This Is It, which was added very well by The Jackson brothers blended in smoothly in sync to a song that Michael originally made back in the period around the between Off The Wall and Thriller were made, according to my ears actually, into a simple and somber ballad. Sadly though, even though there are a lof of high notes, there honestly are a few disadvantages with the soundtrack. First of all, if you want to download the title song, This Is It, you'd have to buy the entire soundtrack as a whole, where the song is strong alone as a single song to download but that unfortunately isn't the case. The second disadvantage is that there honestly could've been a few more of his classic staples including Rock With You from Off The Wall and Remember The Time.<br /><br />All in all, if you a hard core Michael Jackson fan, or if you're new to his music, than This Is It would be a great purchase for the hard core Thriller in you. While the soundtrack isn't as diverse as Michael's other hits collections including the 2005 Essential Michael Jackson, it is a nice trip down Memory Lane for those who've loved him down his classic MTV era when he was diversely proclaimed as the King Of Pop. Honestly, it is a must buy for the hard Jackson fan in anyone that says \\"This Was really it, that was Michael!\\"<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-ears actually, into a simple and somber ballad.

Despite the fact that this is a novel, it is the best \\"resource\\" I have ever read in terms of providing insight into the experience of someone with Alzheimer's Disease.

0316069906|5.0|As the author of two books on this subject, I couldn't possibly be more impressed by what Jonathan Safran Foer has accomplished in Eating Animals. It's by far the best book on agribusiness and vegetarianism I've ever read. In fact, had a book half this good existed fifteen years ago, there's no way I'd have written [[ASIN:0935526870 Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating]] or [[ASIN:0975867911 Meat Market: Animals, Ethics, and Money]] --- I wouldn't have felt there was a need.<br /><br />When I started reading this book, I braced myself for a big letdown. I suppose that's a natural consequence of having read [[ASIN:0143038583 The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals]], and watching some of my main concerns addressed in a derisive and superficial manner.<br /><br />Like Pollan, Foer has a gift for fluid and engaging storytelling. But Foer's coverage of the ethical issues associated with agribusiness is vastly superior to what Pollan can muster. Not only is Foer's writing first-rate, the research that went into this book was a massive undertaking. I write on this subject daily, and still learned things on every page.<br /><br />Foer's research takes several forms. It's obvious that he's read all the key books on the subject, and has waded deeply into agribusiness journals as well. He has also sneaked into factory farms, and his accountings of these terrifying and disturbing visits are not to be missed. And, finally, he's done an exceptional job of visiting and evaluating those few animal farms that are sincerely concerned with maintaining the highest possible animal welfare.<br /><br />Eating Animals particularly excels in examining a topic I covered in Chapter 3 of Meat Market: the question of how much cruelty can be removed from animal agribusiness, and how much added expense removing that cruelty would entail. It's clear from his book that Foer deeply admires those few people who are seeking to replace factory farms with a food system in which the animals get a life comparably fulfilling to that enjoyed by a well-cared for dog or cat. Yet, tellingly, even the best of these systems don't inspire Foer to abandon his vegetarianism.<br /><br />Foer's ability to acknowledge and vividly describe the shades of gray that accompany various animal production systems delivers a more detailed and accurate picture of animal agriculture than any previous mainstream book. In my review of Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma, I wrote, \\"Michael Pollan is a talented writer, and had he only put this manuscript out for proper review this book could have been a masterpiece.\\"<br /><br />Well, in Eating Animals we have a book that was put out for proper review, and is legitimately a masterpiece. It's honest, accurate, persuasive, meticulously researched, and beautifully written. This is a watershed book concerning the ethics of eating, and it's a must-read for everyone who cares about the ethical dimension of our food choices.<br /><br />At long last, we, and the animals, have a bestselling book that gives both veganism and conscientious omnivorism a fair hearing.to that enjoyed by a well-cared for dog or cat.

The book is very high uality with a hard cover, slip-case, and sturdy paper with color images. The writing style of the author is a little difficult to follow at first, but adds to the adventure of reading the book.

B0029O08WA|3.0|Right now, there are millions of people awaiting the new film in the Twilight series, \\"New Moon\\".  To sate a small piece of that almost insatiable appetite, the second soundtrack in the series was released on October 16.<br /><br />\\"The Twilight Saga: New Moon\\" soundtrack features songs from a group of musicians who are just as eclecticly arranged as the soundtrack for the first movie in the series, in the sense that some lesser-known and even unknown names were chosen to hopefully piggyback on Twilight's success.  Here, there are tracks ranging from Death Cab For Cutie, (\\"Meet Me on the Equinox\\") to the Killers, (\\"A White Demon Love Song\\").  These two tracks are the highlights of the album, although Death Cab seems a bit tamer here than usual.<br /><br />Some notable tracks on this soundtrack include \\"Friends\\" by Band of Skulls, which has a deep, dark groovy guitar riff, \\"Slow Life\\" by Grizzly Bear which has a Bon Iver-esque sound, and \\"Roslyn\\" by Bon Iver himself, with St. Vincent.<br /><br />\\"The Violet Hour\\" is a new track from the band Sea Wolf, (known by their single \\"You're a Wolf\\").  \\"Satellite Heart\\" by Anya Marina is reminiscent of Aimee Mann with her acoustic guitar and metaphorical lyrics.  Muse has another track, this time with \\"I Belong to You [New Moon remix]\\".  \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" from the first soundtrack was much more impressive.  This track is a bit more bland this time around.<br /><br />Thom Yorke of Radiohead fame appears with \\"Hearing Damage\\" which, thankfully, retains much of the Radiohead signature sound and doesn't seem like a sell-out kind of a track.  Surprisingly, OK Go appears here with a more mellow track from this usually upbeat band entitled \\"Shooting the Moon\\". Other tracks on this CD include Lykke Li's \\"Possibility\\", Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's \\"Done All Wrong\\", Hurricane Bells' \\"Monsters\\" and The Editors' \\"No Sound But the Wind\\".  The album ends with the instrumental \\"New Moon [The Meadow]\\" from the score by Alexander Desplat.<br /><br />All in all, this is a better collection of musicians than the first soundtrack in the sense that they do not have artists repeating here, like they did with Paramore having two tracks on the first album, but the sound itself is, at times, quite boring.  There is a dark atmospheric theme presented throughout the listening experience, which is good in encapsulating how the overall mood of a vampire film should feel, however it seems more like a CD you'd put on to help you fall asleep. The choice of musicians at times makes you want to scratch your head, (OK Go).  Some bands appear to have been chosen because their name would look appropriate with the subject matter, not because they make music appropriate to the genre, (The Killers, Sea Wolf).<br /><br />It's not a bad CD but in comparison, the first soundtrack emerges stronger.  This is surprising, since the first movie/soundtrack did so well financially that the powers that be must have had a bigger budget by now and could afford to be a bit more substantial.tter collection of musicians than the first soundtrack in the sense that they do not have artists repeating here, like they did with Paramore having two tracks on the first album, but the sound itself is, at times, quite boring.

The book has talked about the different behavior and thinking way between the four Chinese mothers and their American daughters. Each individual story in this book is enough with different language and different culture. This book is good at separating the whole book with each individual little story that is very helpful for me to be concentrating. When I was reading the book, I was interesting at reading very small stories. From reading the whole book, I spent a lot of time on fingering out who is the mother and this girl is whose daughter. And also I spent a lot of time on reading the mothers' experiences from their previous time and American time. From this book, I see how each Chinese woman come to America with difficulties and how they faced the difficulties and trading their new life.   This book talked a lot about women and their daughters, I heard many people said this is a woman book, but I think this book is good for everyone because it could tell us what are love and the relationship between parents and children. This book is a very good choice for everyone to read and learn the experiences of dealing with the relationship of parents and children from the four Chinese women and their American daughters. This is a book used four Chinese women as the example of how Chinese people raised their own country by personally during the war and also using their whole life to teach their daughters to do so.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|This is a wonderful collection of music videos that shows the different phases of Madonna and her changes throughout her career up to now. Her videos are all made in different styles and never boring.   Some hard to get videos are included in this DVD such as \\"Justify my Love\\" and \\"Erotica\\". This will definitely become a Collector's Item. Don't miss it!
B000J233SK|5.0|This particular album is more of a 'journey' rather than a story (in my opinion).    All of the music is enchanting and brilliantly crafted -(as is to be expected of Loreena)-     but this album gave me the feeling of traveling in a troop from Persia to Britain.     Spanish influences mingled with Celtic string, Persian percussion and Mediterranean horns.    Sounds deeelish doesn't it !!! Well .... I guarantee you it is.      Truly all you need to travel back in time is this album, a comfy chair and solitude.      ** And as for the negative reviews, all I've got to say about that is - I am SO glad I     didn't take your word for it. !!

0553381687|5.0|It has been many years since I've enjoyed a great epic fantasy/sci-fi novel.  This immersive experience is on par with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.  Yet it brings a gritty adult modernism to it without spoiling the experience.  For any fan of well written epic fantasy/sci-fi - this book and the Fire and Ice series are truly a must read!
0316067601|5.0|I will keep this short. The book is brilliant. You won't want to put it down. It's a great inspirational story that everyone should read. You don't have to be in the military to appreciate this book. Great read.
B000NDES9S|4.0|One reason I purchased the import version of this album was that in the description it states \\"plus the unedited version of \\"The End\\". This statement is not correct. The version of \\"The End\\" included on the import CD is NOT the unedited version. The end result was paying a $10 premium to no purpose.
B002SZXSL8|4.0|Just downloaded it and gave it a listen...I got the \\"deluxe\\" edition - a double album, sixteen songs, same price as the regular version here on Amazon - good value.  I was/am a big fan of the original Wolfmother lineup, so I was a little skeptical about the effect the new guys would have and what they would bring.  At this point I am pleasantly surprised, and now realize that the \\"Wolfmother sound\\" is pretty much all Andrew Stockdale - his singing, songwriting and guitar playing are all very distinctive.  He has said this album would be heavier, and it is, which I like.  Overall the sound is slightly more polished and maybe even a little tighter than the first album.  If you liked the first album I don't thihk you'll be disappointed.
068987474X|5.0|Anybody who's ever put up with or made excuses for your man needs to read this book.  It is truthful and empowering.  In fact, I believe that they need to write a book for teen girls as well.  This one has adult humor in it and although the message is good I would not recommend for young girls.
0385504225|1.0|The Lost Symbol can easily be described as the most highly anticipated book since the last Harry Potter, maybe even more so. Its first initial print run is 6.5 million copies and it is poised to be just as big as its predecessor, The DaVinci Code which sold over 40 million copies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's nowhere near as good (as I recall) as its predecessor, in fact, it's downright bad.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol brings the eagerly awaited return of Brown's hero Robert Langdon. This time he finds himself investigating secrets hidden in our own capital in order to rescue a friend from a deranged madman. This time he deals with the legendary, and oft discussed, Masons. The secrets brown discusses here on their own would be fascinating but for some reason everything we get here is rather bland and well almost boring.<br /><br />The bloated novel runs over 500 pages, most of which seem like the same four or five scenes over and over again. Langdon states that whatever it is they're discussing is a myth or a metaphor, someone else says they can prove it, and Langdon has his mind blown.<br /><br />The main villain seems like he is crafted specifically for the inevitable film adaptation and his revelations are so predictable that I had it figured out almost instantaneously.<br /><br />It's a wildly overblown plot that is stretched out to its absolute limits to give the illusion of an epic when the actual quality is barely better than a $.99 trashy pulp novel. Even scenes that were meant to be shocking were downright laughable.<br /><br />Sure the history is interesting, but the information around it was so heavy handed and poorly constructed that it makes one wonder what the fuss was about. This is what we've been waiting six years for? Such a massive let down.<br /><br />Here is the worst part: The Lost Symbol has the single biggest cop out ending I have ever read. Don't worry I won't spoil it but my reaction was \\"WTF? Are you #(*$#($# kidding me? Really? REALLY? This is what we get?\\"<br /><br />That may be paraphrased for humor. Then again it might not be.<br /><br />I've never thought that Dan Brown was a literary master but I did enjoy his previous works. I don't know what's different now but I can see now that he's just not that good at all. One of the most annoying parts of The Lost Symbol is how much the characters think dialogue. I don't know if he thinks this kind of thing is natural or what but it is downright bothersome in the book.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol will be a massive hit, that is for sure, but it really is one of the biggest disappointments the literary world has spewed out in this critic's recent memory.<br /><br />If you are so inclined, and honestly, I hope you aren't, The Lost Symbol is in stores now.<br /><br />[...]r.

B001V9LPWQ|4.0|As a mother's perspective I must say that my children were very entertained as they saw this movie. Not only once but they played it 3 times the day that it arrived. The musicals were very entertaining. The quality of the movie was really nice and crisp. Only downside for me is that I don't like my children to see witchcraft even if it is a fairy tale(when the queen is making the potion and puts it in the apple). Just my thoughts...
1594488916|5.0|The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is the biggest surprise of the year. I certainly wasn't prepared to fall so deeply under its spell, but by the time I finished, I was ready to fall all over again.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1594488916 The Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession]]The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession. So says the text on the front of Allison Hoover Bartlett's brilliant new book. From page one I found myself captivated by her narrative. It reads like a novel but you never forget that this tale is a true one.<br /><br />It's full of intrigue, laughs, and characters that you find yourself sympathizing for. I'm talking about Gilkey, the man behind the thefts of hundreds of thousands of dollars in rare books, as well as his victims.<br /><br />For someone thinking that a book about stealing books can't possibly interested, I'll tell you now, that's wrong. I was captivated by this book from page one. Bartlett weaves a spectacular tale the allows us to connect not only with those involved, but with her and her experiences in dealing with Gilkey and those he's stolen from.<br /><br />The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is by far one of the best books I've had the pleasure of reading this year. It's gorgeously paced and intricately plotted with charming and off beat characters. We are taking through the same emotions that Bartlett experienced in trying to understand the reason behind Gilkey's deeds.<br /><br />Even as I read this book, I found myself getting the bug of book collecting. I've always kept books but I never really thought to seek out rare books until reading this book. It opened my eyes to a world I never really realized I was interested in until reading about it in this book.<br /><br />That might be the danger is reading this book. You'll fall into it and when you finish, you might find yourself planning a visit to the thrift store and scanning your shelves for a First Edition Stephen King (which I'll be doing this evening!).<br /><br />The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is in stores now and I highly suggest grabbing a copy.

0810993139|5.0|My 9 year old son brought this home from the library last spring. As I was curious as to what could get my reluctant reader to bring home a book with more than 25 pages, and no race car pictures on the front, I picked it up one evening and read it myself. This is a cute story about a boy with all sorts of everyday issues, who is far from perfect, but still a good kid. My son not only finished this, but has read the 2nd and 3rd books since then, and is steadfastly plowing through the 4th one.
B0021L8UQ2|4.0|Obviously a very split crowd out there regarding the content of this film and the messy arguments it has created. Aside from all of that, they made an interesting little twist of a film that moves along at a painfully slow pace. The Blu quality is great in a variety of ways, but they really sunk this with the supplements.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent throughout, and there are plenty of chances for mistakes with the snow sequences, dark clothing, naturally lit interior spaces and night footage. Plenty of contrast testings so if you have a slow refresh rate display this BD might not be a good investment for you. The sound is TrueHD and gets used once or twice in creating a reference (mainly the basketball against the wall while she is playing the piano). The best color test was right at the get-go with that WB symbol illuminating with the fluorescent pigments against the black. The paint ball/snow scene with the bird is the only other palette mix that shows much.<br /><br />The supplements are a farce, including:<br />* A Bad Seeds and Evil Children documentary. Lasts less than 15 minutes and shows the cast talking about \\"Notable Child Psychopaths in Movie History\\". If you are looking for insight into the filmmaking for this movie skip it.<br />* Deleted scenes. 4 minutes of low-def forgettable short clips. The \\"Chilling Alternate Ending\\" (lasts 20 seconds) has no context as to how it could have gotten to that point, so you have to assume. Obviously different than the \\"happy\\" ending of who lives and dies - but there needed to be some extra help as to how they came up with that.<br />* BD Live extras. I did the WB registration (took 5 minutes, including logging into my email and entering the sent code) and was rewarded with nothing extra for the film - (maybe they have not put anything on there yet).<br />* WB Insider Rewards. BD case has a code for entering number(s) - one of five needed films to get a sixth one free.<br /><br />The Blu has some decent reference points (not a ton overall) on what has become a very mixed popularity film, and the supplements - they are not a selling point at all. Four for the film and quality, zero for the extras.what has become a very mixed popularity film, and the supplements - they are not a selling point at all.

1416972242|5.0|The first book in this series, City of Bones, left the readers hanging and begging for more. Cassandra Clare did not disappoint in her second installment of the Mortal Instruments series!    From the very first page, this book sucks you in, and it doesn't let go until the last word. Even then, thoughts of Jace, Clary, Valentine, and the story's plot claimed my mind for days. The characters are deep and realistic, and every one of them will find a place in your heart.     City of Bones' ending had a shocking surprise, and after reading about it, I was sure Cassandra Clare could never surprise me again. Boy was I proven wrong! I found myself squealing with delight at certain parts and gasping out lound in others. With Clare behind the wheel, this book is going to take you on a ride like you've never been on before.    I can't wait to read the third book! And the last one, which has yet to be released.

B001KVZ6FW|4.0|\\"Up\\" is a great movie. I mean really as a \\"movie\\". It is not and should not be regarded as another one for the children. In my opinion, just like \\"Watchmen\\" is not a comic (similar to Wall-e), \\"Up\\" is a genre's step towards maturation.    Pixar has been doing this ever since they came up with Toy Story (probably still my favorite of them all). They knew that half of their audience were the parents that had to sit for 90 minutes in the movie theater with their kids and while trying to not get them bored they started adding bits of adult references to their films. And now, the final step has been taken. In my opinion, \\"Up\\" is more of an adult movie then a children's animation film.    And it is good. I liked it but my 4-year old had less connection to it than me. Probably she will love it when she is 7 or 8. They do grow up very fast nowadays. And what they watch on TV and movies do have an effect.    As almost everyone else said, it makes you laugh and it makes you cry. It is full of emotions. Try it, you will like it.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is beautifully filmed in a dark sort of way and has a real mad scientist and his son, who is the straight man of the piece, and a wonderful heroine who is truly fearless and very capable of handling the many bizarre cases she works.  This new series is great fun and very sly in its humor. It is never dull and is done with a lot of tongue in cheek kind of writing. I highly recommend this series as it is really enjoyable and lots of fun. I hope it will run as long as it stays as fresh and funny as it is today.
0316017922|1.0|This is the only Gladwell book I've read, having been sucked in by its preponderance on best seller lists.  However, despite its commercial success I found it really quite devoid of anything particularly new or insightful.  I'll admit that my outlook was influenced by two events... First, I saw Mr. Gladwell on a television interview where he shamelessly summarized his success revelations.  After reading the book, I realized I had learned nothing beyond what he covered in 15 minutes of verbal Q&A.  Second, I had just finished reading Nicolas Nassim Taleb's \\"Black Swan\\", a much deeper assessment of how our evolutionary and neurological machinery is wired, which among many other insights points out that the more of an outlier the outcome, the greater the likelihood that pure chance vs. skill has been the underlying cause.  Gladwell does acknowledge the role of chance, but his success formula comes down to this.... spend a lot of time doing what you want to be successful at, and be fortunate enough to be born in the right month in the right culture and the right era.  Duhhhh. What makes his \\"research\\" particularly lightweight is that like many other success-formula writers, he only examines one side of the outcome equation.  For example, to believe that the Beatles were successful because of the thousands of hours spent playing together, you must ascertain that the opposite outcome was not equally probable.  In other words, where is the research that proves there weren't just as many rock bands who despite spending 3000 hours practicing and playing together ended up as commercial failures swept into oblivion?  Those who have not already been seduced by the hype would be better served looking for richer thinking on the subject.

The index in the back of this version is helpful for pinpointing specific quotes and ideas.

It sounds just like Transatlantic; so if you like the other albums, you will like this. If you've never heard them, this (after only a couple of listens) is as good as BAF (although it's tough to improve upon \\"stranger in your soul\\") and better than SMTPE. An easy five star rating.

B002OOG6RQ|5.0|If you're a Rammstein fan, you must have this album. However, anyone who knows fans of Rammstein know that there are two different groups: those who love the first two albums (Herzeleid, Sehnsucht), and those who love their last three (Mutter, Reise Reise, Rosenrot). I'm the latter. So if you're kind of thinking of buying this one, think about which flavor of Rammstein you prefer. I say that, because if you're a big fan of the heavy hammering techno style of metal Rammstein started out as, I can definitely see why people may not like this one.    I love this album, and dare I say it may already be my favorite. It's like they took all the great things about the last three albums and mixed them into one. The drumming is amazing. It kind of reminded me of the style of drumming the drummer from Nickelback uses almost. I'm so glad they let their drummer have some free reign in this, and it enhances the songs in this greatly. The guitar/bass is simple yet still heavy and punchy. The vocals in this are better, in my opinion, then they have been on any album of theirs.    I also should add that if you've heard their first single P***y (track 8), don't dismiss the album either. It's their worst song on the album, and after a while it grows on you anyway. Rammstein is about shock value sometimes, and that song certainly gets your attention, but the real great stuff happens throughout the rest of the album. There's even a couple ballad songs thrown in to keep the women happy.    No Rammstein didn't get back to their roots like you may have read previous to this album's release. They released something a little different once again, and their sound continues to be refined and redeveloped, and it still sounds great. ... Ah the heck with that statement, it sounds frickin' awesome!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I rarely recommend anything - or write a review.  This is so compelling that I consider it a duty to recommend it.  Even though the author lets parallel plot lines proceed in the same chapter, one is able to follow it seamlessly.  Although I dont think I could take 10 books, it is a pity there will only be one more.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I watched the season 1 DVDs only now - and it is hilarious. Whether you are a geek or not, you understand science or not, you'll enjoy this. Jim Parsons as Sheldon is excellent and the mainstay. Hang on to every word that comes out of his mouth - or you'll miss a smart joke. Johnny Galecki, as Leonard is supposedly the \\"one resembling us ordinary folks\\". Kunal Nayyar as Brajesh plays the Indian who's tongue tied in front of women. Simon Helbert as Howard is the obnoxious little nerd whom women hate. Kaley Cuoco as Penny who does not 'dig' the geeks.    The whole show is a unique concept and you'll find fresh humor that is not a rehash of old beaten hollywood writing. Very funny.

B000EOTTV8|5.0|FANTASTIC MOVIE!   I was glued to the screen watching this movie - Felicity Huffmans performance was BRILLANT! Though the films encompassing storyline was a bit bizarre for the conservative majority, as I watched this film that strangeness took a back seat and I soon found I was empathizing with the lead character and getting caught up in the journey. This movie wasn't about anything perverse, it was about moral dignity, love and compassion and I truly recommend this film to anyone. It will have you laughing out loud, tug on your heartstrings and will open your eyes to self-realization and what truly matters in life. Prejudices have no Meaning; when watching this movie you will discover that people are ALL the same regardless of looks, we all experience the same emotions and ALL have the same longings for LOVE and ACCEPTANCE!

This is the second time I've bought this book- I regrettably lost my first one when I moved! Great information and pictures on the broad spectrum of carnivorous plant species, and more importantly, lots of good, detailed information on how to grow and propagate your plants once you find the type you're looking for. I have approximately 24 carnivorous plants- tropical and temperate pitcher plants, sundews, utricularia (bladderworts), butterworts, and this book has to be my favorite reference for care and trouble shooting! It even has good information on what insect pests your plants can be susceptible to and how to get rid of them. I highly recommend this book!

0767830555|1.0|I've wanted to see this movie for years, so I finally bought it. It was awful. The acting is great, but the plot line meanders all over the place. Jodie Foster is saved from a life of prostitution by a whack cab driver in an all too bloody shootout. I have nothing against sex and violence when it serves the storyline, but everything here was gratuitous, and the storyline seemed to wander all over the place. There were endless of DeNiro driving his cab, as if we needed to be reminded he was a cab driver. In the end, Jody goes back to her conservative family, and the wacko is hailed as a hero. Better she should have stayed on the street. The world doesn't need more yuppies. I was really disappointed with this story. If you thought Pulp Fiction was art, you might like it. I prefer a plot line that wasn't thrown together on the run.

0547258305|5.0|I often do not read as many books where the main character is a young female as I find them harder to relate being an adult male. But, being in education I try to read some books that would interest my female students and a student actually recommended I buy and read Graceling.     Since then I have actually used it as a book of the month here in our Library and felt that the author used the struggles that Katsa deals with to appeal to both young adult males as well as females. There was plenty of action to keep me occupied and turning the pages as quickly as I could.     While I won't go into details of the book since you can read them above I will say that this is a book that many young people will pick up and have a hard time putting it down.

This book blew me away so ferociously that the next week we went out of town and I stopped at a used bookstore and bought every hardcover Tom Clancy book they had on their shelves.<br /><br />The pace, intensity, and tension were so satisfyingly crafted that I just assumed that I would be as satisfied by the rest of his work, and for the most part I have been.<br /><br />This novel is about Rainbow, and international group of counter terrorist agents who are set against a group of environmentalist terrorists who see human life as the ultimate scourge on the planet and the human race must be destroyed ... i found the book to be fascinating.

Wanting to get those answers questioned is what made it hard for me to put the book down.     While the book title is about the maze I still would have liked to have read a more detailed description of the maze as well as the \\"grievers\\". But, while the book is about trying to escape the maze I liked the underlying story of young adults not giving up in the face of struggles and overcoming death defying odds. Being an educator I see to many students give up at the first sign of struggle. That is not the case here.     If you want a fun book that will keep you turning the pages than this one is for you!!
0307473708|4.0|I truly enjoy the showtime series based on this character. However, when you look at the 1 page per minute rule (on average 1 page in a novel is 1 minute on screen) you realize that this book is far too short for a 13 episode season, they added a lot to the TV version, and this is the rarest of rarity's, the film adaptation is better.<br /><br />If you have never seen the show, then you will enjoy this book more. Otherwise you will be waiting for this scene or that, and it just doesn't work that way.<br /><br />This is still a very good read. The Dexter character is one of the most original and terrifyingly sympathetic characters I have run across.<br /><br />In this novel, we meet Dexter, a sociopolitical monster who only feels alive when he kills people. He would be a vile creature if his step dad hadn't given him a code. Only harm those who harm others. Dex does follow the code, no killing unless he can prove they killed others. An interesting element is Dexter's work as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami police department. This gives him access to evidence that lets him prove his hypothesis, so that this conscienceless monster can carve people up with a clean conscience. Such irony, so well written. So deliciously witty and fun.<br /><br />T
B001DHXT20|3.0|Yes it was 3 million times better than its 2003 cousin twice removed that everyone desperately hopes to avoid at the family reunions.  However, it still fell short of having something called originality.  Sure, Edward Norton sells his role quite well, but watch this movie and tell me where you haven't seen this formula used before.  Super hero obtains his powers and goes through denial trying to keep it under wraps?  Check. Super hero is collectively viewed as the villain while trying to save civilization from oblivion?  Check.  Super hero ends up being called upon to save said civilization's butt from a similar, but much uglier counter-part that has come down with what can only be described as a really bad case of scoliosis?  Checkmate.<br /><br />No, it wasn't horrible, but was not worth watching again.  Michael Bay could have done a better job with script originality.  Heck, monkeys who are so bored they hurl poop at each other all day could have done a better job.  Pretty visuals....lame writing.
B000E0LB8G|5.0|Marvellous fortepiano sound and interpretation, perfect in comparison with all the other best interpretation I know (Radu Lupu, Bredel, Kempff), in spite of the limits of the instrument, outstanding orchestra in sound and rendering, gorgeous balance between orchestra and fortepiano. The sonatas are astonishing too. This work got a charm and a beauty unattainable, that is probably the authentic one. The modern renderings have got a magnificence but they are an other work by an other composer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|A solid film crafted in a unique way that carries a lot of similiar themes to that of Blood Diamonds... not big on replayability, but drives home some very important themes that really open your eyes to Indian culture.  Easy to follow, but leaves you still connecting some pieces at the end, which made it all the more enjoyable.  Great acting, and a plotline that has to be one of the best and most interesting ways to tell a story.  Really makes you feel for the characters, and the country in general.
0767803434|3.0|*** SPOILER in the 2nd paragraph ***<br /><br />I'll be honest: I didn't expect a whole lot out of this save-the-president film; though I like Harrison Ford well enough, I won't say I'm exactly a fan, and the plot seemed really hackneyed.  Why'd I watch it, then?  I guess I was in the mood for this kind of techno-thriller, in which the President's plane is hijacked by terrorists, and our middle-aged President (Ford) who was formerly a Vietnam combat pilot gets to play hero and almost single-handedly take out the Russian bad guys headed up by nasty psycho Gary Oldman and prevent them from returning evil commie Jurgen Prochnow back to power in Kazakhstan.  Complications include the President's wife and daughter being on board, and disagreements between principal cabinet members (chiefly Glenn Close as the VP and Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense) on how best to handle the situation on the ground; the latter element never builds up to anything convincingly suspenseful.<br /><br />Like a great many of these kinds of films, AIR FORCE ONE started out pretty well and went downhill both in believability and interest in the second half, but it never fell apart completely despite one really annoying plot hole that apparently the producers, screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe and/or director Wolfgang Petersen thought we'd be too stupid to think about:  namely that there's a spy on board in the form of a Secret Service agent, we know about him and the people on the ground know about him, but very little if any effort is made to clue the President in about him - and he basically gets ignored by both the terrorists and everyone else until the very end.  And his motives are never mentioned at all - he just turns rogue because, uh, he thought it would be fun, perhaps?  Not good enough, sorry.<br /><br />Still, this was more lively and intelligent than it could have been; Ford is OK and the rest of the cast is game enough, if not quite enthusiastic except for the always manic Oldman - who is playing basically the same role he's played a dozen times now.  Worth a watch if you like these sorts of things; better than DIE HARD 2 or 4, EXECUTIVE DECISION, or the UNDER SIEGE films, I'd say, to name some movies with comparable plots from the era.  Petersen is never IMO less than a competent director, and he keeps things moving along OK.  The ra-ra patriotic Jerry Goldsmith score got old and pretty overbearing after a half hour.<br /><br />A time waster, then, but a reasonably enjoyable one.  The standard DVD doesn't have too much in the way of extras, nothing really of substance besides the director's commentary, which I haven't listened to.asically the same role he's played a dozen times now.

B001U0HBPG|2.0|Felt like a Forest Gump type of movie, without the humor or compelling storyline.  The movie encapsulates every sense of the word dull, and while an interesting concept, the overdrawn length of the movie coupled with a daily regret I now have for loosing 3 hours of my life while watching this forces me to hand it a 2 star rating.  There are movies made so you don't have to think, and movies made to provoke thought and discourse.  This movie promotes a drab, dry in between that leaves you wondering what else might have been accomplished during the time it took to watch the movie.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|To be honest I did not care for it when I 1st heard it. But the more I listened to it the more I loved it. Ranks right near the top with Absolution. I just hate the way ABC is using \\"Uprising\\" in their promos for the new \\"V\\" show however.

For anyone still trying to recover from Dylan's take on the Irish tune \\"Arthur McBride\\", this entire album will leave you feeling like you got hit by a bus. I don't own this. I have a very sick and demented friend who loves pulling the mickey out of sacrosanct pedagogues. He played this for me. Dylan beat him to the punch with this nightmare. Imagine Mercedes McCambridge doing her devil's voice from the Exorcist warbling \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" and you've about got it. It's all in a good cause, but still, did we have to go here?  I'm heading for the Scotch.

B002436WFI|1.0|If you're unfamiliar with Pratchett's work, this adaptation is unlikely to hook you. Instead of the sharp satire of the novels, it's just fantasy rehashed with some CGI and terrible, terrible acting. Sean Astin pretty much ruined this all on his own; there wasn't a single scene he was in that didn't leave me cringing. Worse, Jeremy Irons butchtered the clever and icy Patrician, giving him a lisp, of all things. I was embarrassed just watching this. Some of the storytelling was cute, but you'd be better off with the actual books. Hogfather was a thousand times better, and I didn't even like the original book all that much. Really, if you much be introduced to Pratchett through television, go with Hogfather, which was much truer to the book and to Terry's intelligent style.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This has become one of my favorite games.  I first played it and hated it.  I could not understand the concepts.  Don't get discouraged.  It is worth learning.  This game would be difficult to just buy read the instructions and play so it helps if you know someone who already knows how to play.  This is a must buy game if you enjoy playing for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  There is alot of strategy so you get to actually use your mind.  The game is different everytime you set it up because you can switch all the peices around and number tokens.  You must buy this game! have fun!
B002BIULQC|5.0|At first, I was wondering why my daughter was so crazy about Hannah Montana. I thought that Miley Cyrus is not that really pretty. So, I rented the movie and watched it with my daughter. I was amazed how talented this girl is. I love the songs in the movie. Awesome movie and great for the family.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I love the crap out of this movie. It's hilarious, the animation is beautiful and it takes everything you'd like from new and old Kung Fu movies to make stunning and action packed fight scenes. The voice talent is great too, though of course Jack Black being the most over the top character in this movie stands out the most. There's a nice underlying message about learning to love one's self that I thought was touching. Good for kids AND adults. A must for any kung fu or animation lover. Go buy it nao.

B002C6K7N0|4.0|Endgame is the latest CD from Megadeth, and it is the first studio recording with new guitarist Chris Broderick who replaced Glen Drover for the live shows in support of United Abominations.  I don't know if it can all be attributed to Broderick, but Endgame is a better offering from Dave Mustaine and Co.  Mustaine and Broderick get Endgame off to a blistering start as they trade solos on \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" which leads into the shredding \\"This Day We Fight!\\".  It is one of three that will have fans thinking back to the days of Rust In Peace.  \\"This Day We Fight!\\" is about being fearless going into battle as a soldier.  The other high speed songs are the drag racing themed \\"1320'\\" - a nod to the 1/4 mile length of the race - and the first single \\"Head Crusher\\" which deals with the torturous execution of prisoners of war.  While it is somewhat graphic, it is Mustaine's way of speaking out against the abuse of war prisoners.  Mustaine hits a broader range of topics this time with the afore mentioned \\"1320'\\" and the bank heist tale \\"44 Minutes\\".  The latter is in more of a driven, yet still quite heavy style that permeates most of the other songs that I haven't listed as shredders.  The one notable exception is \\"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss\\".  Broderick gets co-writing credits for the music, and it seems likely that it is his influence that lead to the use of classical guitar for the balladesque \\"Hardest Part\\" that envelopes \\"Sealed With A Kiss\\".  Mustaine's lyrics tell of obsession that winds up as love gone bad.  While not typical Megadeth, I did find this to be very interesting musically.  As a final thought it wouldn't be fitting to skip the title track.  \\"Endgame\\" is Mustaine's prediction of a future where all American liberties have been lost to the point that anyone without an embedded RFID chip is considered an illegal alien.  He calls out the Patriot Act by name, and it is interesting food for thought.  As always Mustaine does not shy away from fairly deep topics.  While I don't personally think this is where America is headed, I can see the trail of logic that he followed to get there.  Finally, I like to give a few thoughts about the instrumentation.  Broderick is an excellent counterpart for Mustaine on guitar.  The two play off of each other in a way that I can't recall since Marty Friedman was still in the band.  I'm not equating Broderick and Friedman, but rather drawing a comparison to how they both pair with Mustaine.  James Lorenzo on bass and Shawn Drover on drums return from prior recordings with Megadeth, and they both do a great job of laying the foundations of the CD.<br /><br />Overall, Endgame is a balanced effort from Megadeth.  Unlike Metallica, I don't think that it is Megadeth's goal to recapture their sound from the late 80's.  However, this is a really good CD that stands on its own merits.  At times it shreds, and at others it drives.  However it is still undoubtedly Mustaine that makes it tick.  I would like to see this current lineup stay in tact for future recordings to see if it is sustainable.y from fairly deep topics.

0060254920|5.0|I was more than disappointed in the movie.  I loved this book as a kid.  For me the jist of the book was \\"naughty\\" rebellious max ends up in a world where he is dwarfed by creatures who help him realize he should be humbled.     In the movie, the monsters had NO motives or plots. They just hung around breaking things and talking like stoned teenagers.  I repeat NO PLOT.  Horrible horrible boring, insult to the book.  The only redeeming quality of the movie was the actor playing Max.  He was an amazing actor.  Too bad his performance was dwarfed by HORRIBLE HORRIBLE writing!!

031606792X|5.0|This is a GREAT series for all ages! I have thoroughly enjoyed the series and really loved this particular book. The only thing missing is the story of Jacob and his love. It leaves a lot for the imagination, but opens up the potential for another series to be written by Stephanie Meyer (hint, hint)!
B000H5TH1Q|4.0|Brian DePalma knows a good film when he sees one.  He has made several excellent films (The Untouchables) and some films that are cultural landmarks (Carrie, Scarface).  His work borrows heavily from other masterworks.  Body Double has plot points and several specific shots that trace their roots directly to two of Alfred Hitchcock's best: Rear Window and Vertigo.  Body Double mixes these scenes with a leading man who exists in a world far removed from the world of Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.<br /><br />Craig Wasson stars as Jake Scully, an insecure actor who has the lead in a D-List Vampire movie and a serious phobia of enclosed places, which is established in the opening as poor Jake is paralyzed in his on-set coffin.  Like Jimmy Stewart in \\"Rear Window\\", Wasson is placed into a position where he views his neighbors through the windows of his apartment.  Like Stewart in \\"Vertigo\\" he is also positioned to become emotionally attached to a woman who is not who he thinks she is, set up as a witness to a false crime that is meant to disguise a murder.  Where Stewart's vertigo paralyzes his character with a fear of heights at key moments in that story, Wasson's claustrophobia does the same here.  Body Double shares with Vertigo extended sequences where our hero trails the woman he is becoming entangled with in lengthy scenes with almost no dialogue, as well as a swirling 360 degree camera shot when the hero kisses the woman of mystery.<br /><br />But De Palma falls somewhat short of the master.  Let's just say Wasson is not Jimmy Stewart, Melanie Griffith is not Grace Kelly, etc.  While most stories require some degree of suspension of disbelief, DePalma puts in a few unbelievable story elements - some add a cheating \\"gotcha\\" and some seem to add no purpose other than to linger in a lurid setting.<br /><br />Here are a few questions if you choose to see this film:<br />1. One character spends a significant length of time in disguise.  Consider how long it would take to put on that disguise.  Then consider the shot of the character without the disguise and the next time you see that character IN disguise.  Without an accomplice this character apparently applies a makeup job in a minute that would have taken Rick Baker hours.<br />2. One of the key plot points involves the hiring of Melanie Griffith's character, one of the top porno actresses, \\"Holly Body\\".  Holly tells Jake at one point that she gets $2,000 a day.  Holly is hired to perform an arousing dance for a private audience for two nights.  Why not just hire some stripper?  Why hire \\"the top porno actress in the business\\"?<br /><br />Plot holes and sub-par acting keep me from giving a full recommendation, but if you're a film director and you're going to steal from someone, you could do a lot worse than Hitchcock and \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Rear Window\\".  On the other hand - if you have NOT seen Vertigo or Rear Window, you'd be an idiot to even consider watching this movie first instead.en consider the shot of the character without the disguise and the next time you see that character IN disguise.

B002C6K7NU|1.0|Sorry, but after having heard this CD and seeing the band recently at the Beacon Theater in NYC I have come away with the believe that this is just a \\"shell\\" of the once great band called it self Lynyrd Skynyrd.  \\"God and Guns\\" is  appropriately titled, as it is no more than a  shallow, clichéd attempt at a record.      There is no real strong song writing or inspired guitar playing on this disk, just an over-produced, muddy production from a bunch of guys who continue to call them self's Lynyrd Skynyrd, even though most of the original band members have past away.  If you are after real, genuine southern rock with covering themes of southern sensibilities in the year 2009, I suggest you listen to \\"The Drive By Truckers\\".    The live show at the Beacon Theater in NYC only has reinforced this believe that there is band's day has come and gone along time ago.  Save your money.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|One has only to screen Madonna's music videos to know why she is hailed as the QUEEN!  Her videos all stand the test of time.  No, she did not invent the music video but she elevated it to an ArtForm!  No other artist has done justice to this medium.  All her videos are inventive and alluring.  Other celebrated \\"video artists\\" resort to the same old dance moves that I guess have become their signature but become tedious and repetitive, that cannot be said of Lady Madonna.  LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!!

However, I still wait for the excercise video which had a portion to explain the motions but then offered a routine which skipped the small talk.

0316017922|4.0|Another excellent book from Malcolm. Truly a non conformist. His approach to use statistics to defend his theories is amazing.Like how Steven Levitt[[ASIN:0060731338 Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)]] tries to demystify economies and opens up new ways of thinking, so does Malcolm. The Korean Air example was like a movie.It had its drama but the core message was amazing. Another thing with caught my attention was his reference to Hofstede's Dimension  on Cultural consequences

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Even if Dan Brown can turn ordinary themes into \\"frantic\\" persecutions and compress events of one single night into a whole book, Lost Symbol is probably not his best work. I got the feeling he was giving too much unnecessary details to try to fill pages and make it longer and more complex. I got tired of \\"running\\" around D.C. and its landmarks with no known purpose. Brown stretches his imagination sometimes to the border of credibility, or just trying to make it interesting for the reader. Most of the time it did not work for me. I will probably buy his next book as well, but maybe if I don't expect as much as I did from this one, I just might enjoy a bit more.

B000GC9NE6|5.0|Eraser head .... It's hard to start a review of a movie such as this. The movie is slow paced and, it's 10 mins and 30 seconds before anyone says anything. It's dark, moody and sometimes confusing. If your mind is open while you watch it you wont rush to judge it negatively.<br /><br />For me, the movie represents a TRUE study in the art form of movie making. Basically the budget was probably 50 bucks and change but out of that came this gem. The darkness and awkwardness of the whole thing is somehow riveting. The soundtrack is just awesome. The sound alone is SO key it is almost another cast member.<br /><br />Henry (Jack Nance) is an awkward, odd guy who finds out he is a father. The father of what ? A mutant like premature baby. He and the mother (Mary X) attempt to live together and raise the child. Mary X is soon gone as the hell of the whole situation just drives her away.<br /><br />Henry starts to drift inside his own mind while attempting to care for the \\"baby\\". He seems to see death as a better alternative to his life. Weird fantasies enter his mind via the \\"girl behind the radiator\\" who appears to be offering him a much better life in heaven.<br /><br />A night of passion with the woman across the hallway seems to bring him around a little but, he sees her with some other guy and only sinks back into his descent into dark depths.<br /><br />From there Henry descends back into his own dark, murky depths and takes care of things the way only Henry can.<br /><br />David Lynch has a mind all his own and hasn't actually told us what this movie is about from his perspective. I kind of appreciate that as we can form our own conclusions and they wont be right or wrong.<br /><br />It's dark, it's slow, it's confusing but you can't look away. Personally I see this as a descent into madness. Henry knows he's odd, awkward and broody and I feel life has beaten him and he needs a way out.<br /><br />I feel if people watch this and jump up here and write critical reviews, then, as an art form, the movie has done it's job which is to provoke an emotion whether good or bad.<br /><br />Note: The 2000 DVD has a narration by David Lynch and one of the things that struck me was that this film took 5 years to make due to budget (or lack of). There is a scene where Henry comes wandering down the hall to his apartment, puts his hand on the door knob and turns the handle. Then there's a cut to inside the room and Henry comes in. Apparently it took 18 months for Henry to get through that door. Ah, let's hear it for independent film noir.s to provoke an emotion whether good or bad.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|The songs were chosen well, and allow her voice to be recognized as vintage Whitney. The selection of songs and the arrangements worked well although they were symbolic of the 80s. That is not all bad since the return of \\"singing\\" (as opposed to rapping) as exemplified by current singers like Ne-Yo, Kem, Mary J, and even \\"Chris and Rihanna\\". I applaud her for the comeback from her trials and tribulations but feel saddened because of all of the talent that was squandered. She could have been one of the greatest singers and on par with Gladys, Patti, and Chaka, but wasted her most productive years being \\"ill\\". She is still very talented and ocassionally I can hear the \\"old Whitney\\" in her voice but one can clearly see that some notes or musical phrases she will never attain again. How sad. Anyway, that being said, I loved the CD and share it with everyone who will listen. The songs are catchy and tend to grow on you and you find yourself hearing them even when they are not playing. I am happy that she has returned now and appears to be \\"cured,\\" so that she does not have to embarass herself later the way many others have done with their \\"oldies but use-to-be goodies\\" revival tours.
0061537969|5.0|What a terrific book for a dog lover, attorney, sports fan, parent, and Washingtonian. This novel appeals on so many levels. But it's the narrative by Enzo, the dog, that makes it the terrific read that it is. I have neither the time nor inclination for novels, but I couldn't put this down until I finished it. It's a painful story with a wonderful ending - as good books should be!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this to fit on my Dream on Me Adjustable Handle Stroller which doesn't have any cup holders or trays.  It fits perfectly and will hold any drink - including a cold coffee drink from Starbucks or a water bottle.  It's got plenty of room and the metal frame really makes a difference in that it always stays open.  I have to attach it on a slanted portion on my stroller handle because of the way my stroller is, so to offest the slant I attached one side by twisting the velcro before putting it on and it stays level with no problem.  GREAT PRODUCT!!
0345495004|5.0|Loved this historical, fictional account of Frank Lloyd Wright's romance with his mistress, Mamah.  Having seen a documentary of his life, I appreciated the detail in the newspaper accounts and other facts that were included in the book to give context to the affair.  Nancy Horan's narrative gave depth to both characters and allowed the reader to attempt an understanding of their relationship.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this show!  Cleverly written and well acted.  Can't wait for Season 2!
B00000J6AG|1.0|lets put it this way: if you want to buy the juggling alchemists under the black light, or IFO by etnica/pleiadians, you can expect to pay hundreds of dallars. probably more if you want it on vinyl, or care about condition. i just saw a mint condition IFO on vinyl up for sale for a fitting $604.00. (goa). it's not a limited edition vinyl, it's not signed, it doesn't have extra tracks, most if not all of their fans have a downloaded version of it on their harddrives, and it's not pressed from solid gold. it's just a regular old IFO album. and people will buy it for that price. they will buy it because the pleiadians/etnica are genius. no one's spending $604.00 on a moby album. at this point you may be thinking that no album is worth hundreds of dallars. if so, that's because you listen to moby, and think play is a good album.
B002IR3PSC|4.0|I bought this DVD for the classic and great footage of Ian doing \\"Thick as a Brick\\" live and wow is it sweet. Takes me back to the 1972 concert I saw them at in Tuscaloosa Alabama. They played the whole album..it was awesome especially since I had not ever heard of them or heard the music before. I've been a Tullie ever since. My only regret is that the whole concert did not make it on air...especailly the song \\"My God\\".  But the DVD is a keeper.

B001P9KR94|5.0|I can understand why some might be hesitant in watching this film, it's not necessarily a movie one just has a sudden burst of enthusiasm and wants to watch. I rented this movie from Netflix and it sat on my dresser for 6 months before I finally decided I wanted to take time out of my day to watch it. This film is quite possibly the most fluent and engaging film I have seen since No Country For Old Men. I honestly cannot conjure up the right words that explains the superiority of quality, direction, emotion, and beauty that this film delivers to its viewers. After the film, you feel like you have just finished a great journey, and the end of that journey was well worth the time.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Aargh! I owned the VHS versions for years and finally broke down and bought the previous overpriced DVD edition last year. Now they've come out with a superior edition which is also cheaper!  I'll have to buy it for the Cleese commentaries alone. If you don't own these programs already then you've come along at the right time. This will be the best money you've spent in quite a while. This is one of the classic sitcoms of all time. Each meticulously crafted episode is so crammed with hilarious lines and situations that when you recall it later you won't believe that so many things happened in one half-hour show.  Cleese was really the first to put such an unpleasant character at the center of a sitcom. It would be tried again with the sadly brief 'Buffalo Bill' and with more success with 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. Like Larry David, even when Basil Fawlty is right, he's wrong.
B00006F2TV|5.0|Spider-Man I think along with Part 2 is the Best, they are tied. Part 1 being better of course, I don't agree with some of the casting, and perhaps other things. But it was Fun To watch on The Big Screen and now fun to own and watch in the living room for any SpiderMan Fan.
B002NPUCP8|4.0|Imagine The Bangles, Joan Jett or Wendy & Lisa with a stellar leadguitarist who knows how to shred in an intelligent way. And you pretty much gets the idea of what to expect from this new star. Risen to stardom of course through her association with Michael Jackson.<br /><br />A serious student of the guitar who has jammed with Carlos Santana and been endorsed by the likes of Steve Vai, she sparkles each song with some really interesting and varied soloing. Her vocal and songwriting skills are also considerable, although a certain lack of originality might be her weak spot. But all in all a very strong set of poprock songs dealing with....romantic troubles seen from a feminine/feministic perspective.<br /><br />This album brimming with hit potential is definitely aimed more at a younger poporiented audience and not at ageing hippies like myself. Which shall not keep me from giving her my heartfelt kudos.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|Poltergeist seeing as A Kid was impressive and downright scary. It's a Movie that you want to see during the day, It gives you the chills! Ghosts, Weird Things, Happenings, They do Exist. It's not Far Fetched as Perhaps UFOS? or Bigfoot. Movie is very Very Good. Great Acting too.A Classic!
B00280LYHS|1.0|My son loved the first book in the series.  He wanted to continue reading the rest of the series but ran into a huge problem.  Because of his learning disability he is not able to read this level book without the text to audio feature.  We are finding out quickly that the text to audio feature on the kindle dx is very limited in the number of books that are capable of performing this function.  Wish we knew this before we bought the dx!
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Part 3?-WTF Happen? What Happen?  Why the Dance Sequence, why Did they mess up the role of Venom/Eddie Brock? Why So Long? It could have been something Better. It could have been a Contender! Lets Hope Spiderman 4 is better. No wonder they gave this movie away when you purchased the PS3! Spiderman 2 Was Better, as Was 1.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I was never a fan of Snow White myself but still have my original VHS from when I was younger. I got the Diamond Edition as a preview and can definitely say that I enjoyed it much more this time around, and whats more is that my kids loved it. It looks awesome on Blu-ray and the songs sound crisp and wonderful. My 4 year old and even the nine year old were more than happy to sit through it and enjoyed singing along to it and even spent some time exploring the features on the extra disk. I am very happy with this set and will definitely be buying more of the great movies Disney puts out in the future.
B0007XT87G|5.0|What can I say ?!?      PORCUPINE TREE has me on a hook here !!!      Each PT album I get leaves me more and more AMAZED !!  I really DO LOVE this band !    This is a powerful album for the PROG-METAL lovers! Starting with \\"Deadwind\\", following with \\"Shallow\\".  Pretty metal, but very, very rhythmic and precise.  You will enjoy these two a lot.  After these fast-paced masterpieces, you'll unwind to LAZARUS, which to my point of view is such a musical gem you will go back and listen it several times just for the sheer enjoyment.      The whole album is filled with sudden and unexpected mood changes (classic to PT's music) beautifully performed and musically astonishing.    Arriving Somewhere but Not Here: Incredible    Mellotron Scratch: what a beauty of a song, with clear-cut choruses and incredible ending (reminds me of some N'SYNC songs, not meaning they are similar in any way).    Open Car: Mind-blowing !    All other songs are SIMPLY INCREDIBLE !!!       Please don't hesitate to get this album, it's definitely a MUST for actual PT fans and  all newcomers !!  You will enjoy it from START to FINISH and will be still begging for more !    PORCUPINE TREE is SIMPLY FANTASTIC, with EXTRAORDINARY TALENT and AMAZING musical accuracy and execution skills.  My BIG CONGRATULATIONS to Steven Wilson, Gavin Harrison, Richard Barbieri, Colin Edwin.    A very big fan from MEXICO.
B000RZGIQ8|4.0|I'm excited to give this to my husb. for Christmas.  Good service, and good price for a Blu ray!
B002NUULNG|3.0|I'm going to break this review down into two parts.<br /><br />The movie itself:<br />This is Ghost In The Shell in HD. It's beautiful, but for a smoother translation into the look of Innocence the greenish colors of the original film have been touched up and made to be more of an amber color like that seen in second film. This isn't really a change that I mind, and it's pulled off fairly well. I assume that several scenes were cleaned up digitally because the line art looks amazingly clean.<br /><br />Sadly, someone felt it would be appropriate to replace some of the most iconic and stunning animation from the original with CG. A few scenes are done well like those where the CG is only helicopters or buildings, but whenever it replaces characters with crappy looking CG models it becomes stunningly bad. If you watch the making of the original movie you can see that their limited use of computer assisted animation was carefully planned and fit in with the other artwork and improved the film. The CG in 2.0 sticks out like a sore thumb in most cases. The only CG part that I liked was the pan over the cityscape at the end of the film.<br /><br />If you have a bluray player and haven't seen GitS yet 2.0 isn't a bad way to see it, but fans of the original will probably be disappointed with the lack of any significant changes and the quality of what was changed.<br /><br />The bluray by Manga:<br /><br />Somehow Manga Entertainment never ceases to screw something pretty major up on their releases. The box lists a commentary with Oshii, an interview with Oshii and a making of GitS 2.0. None of these features are present on the bluray. You get throw away character profiles, glossary, and the old english trailer. The original making of GitS is here in VHS quality along with the unlisted bonus feature of the original cut of the movie. When I heard that I was pretty excited because in all honesty it's the only version I truly care about, but it looks to be taken from non-HD masters and only includes 2.0 audio tracks. If memory serves me correctly I believe that my GitS DVD looks better upscaled than this version does.<br /><br />It would have been nice to do a re-dub of the film with the SAC cast, but I guess most of them were in the original anyway and it's a nice dub in it's own right.<br /><br />This whole release just makes me want the original film untouched in HD. I can't give this less than three stars if only because seeing this movie this way is better than not seeing it at all because it's a one of my favorite films ever, but be aware of the problems with this release before deciding to buy it.memory serves me correctly I believe that my GitS DVD looks better upscaled than this version does.

068484267X|3.0|This book shows someone can go through a lot in life, not have much money and deal with some abuse and still turn out OK. The book had many interesting tales of a life I have never known but have heard about. I have known people who had been through some of the same challenges as a child and grew up to be very interesting people as adults. I felt it got a little long in the middle but after a break of a few weeks I was able to pick up the book again and finish it. It did get better in the later pages of the book and I found it hard to put down.
0783225857|5.0|I had seen the movie MANY years before and decided to check out a copy of the book from our local library.  What a good read!  I was curious about the movie so bought it from Amazon.  The movie is amazing and follows the book very closely.  My husband had never seen the movie and was riveted by it.  Gregory Peck captures Atticus' demeanor to a t!

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Opening this package made me feel like a kid again.  It's a beautifully packaged combo at a very reasonable price.  What's not to get giddy over?  The addition of the DVD version of Snow White along with the Blu-Ray version was such a bonus.  Now I can keep a version in my \\"mommy van\\" while the Blu-Ray stays indoors, safe and sound.  So handy for moms in the run with little Disney addicts in tow! :)
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|In an age when sex sells anything; and I mean anything; it's nice to see a show that has an excellent plot, good character development, humor, drama, dialogue,  sex appeal, everything a good show should have!    I do hope there will be a second season, I think this will be one of the winners; and the great critic in the sky knows ABC can use one.  The best is yet to come, lets hope ABC senses this.  Buy this DVD, its top notch.

B0000C0FJB|5.0|I have been listening to RUSH since 1983, at which time I fell in love with \\"Exit Stage Left\\" and the studio album that preceded it, \\"Moving Pictures\\".  I was in Middle School at the time.  Throughout the '80s I collected their first 16 albums.  In the '90s I continued to listen to the old stuff but I did not purchase any new albums.  This is my first purchase of a RUSH recording since the late '80s and I am delighted.  I saw RUSH in 2003 and most recently in 2005 and this triple cd captures their excellence in live performance.  These guys, after nearly 30 years (at the time of this recording), are still rocking at the top of their game.  And, for those die-hard RUSH fans, there are some great old gems such as \\"Signus X1\\", which you will be delighted to hear.  This is a great recording of one of the best and most innovative bands of ROCK and I recommend it to RUSH lovers and those just getting to know the band.  Even the newer stuff is great to listen to.  Rock on RUSH!
B00065MDS6|5.0|If you thought the first two King Crimson albums were too similar, this should be the fix. With a new band, Fripp made Lizard at the end of 1970.<br /><br />This is a mellotron album if there ever was one. \\"Circus\\" is a jazzy fever dream soaked in the pre-taped orchestra. \\"Indoor Games\\" and \\"Happy Family\\" cut back on the tron, but maintain the creepy, orchestraced jazz of the first track. There is a strange, hillucanatory feel to all this--it is not hard rock or all jazz, but strange little acid cakes with wierd orchestral nuances, Gordan Haskells processed vocals and Sinfield's obtuce lyrics.<br /><br />The second half is all mellotron and jazz, with long improvosations by the horn section Fripp added. These tracks maintain that surreal creep the first side had--you get the feeling you have walked into someone's subconcious, but it is definately not yours. \\"Big Top\\" ends Lizard, reinforcing the acid circus this album is.<br /><br />Fripp had a hot band here: the drummer sounds like Micheal Giles but is even more syncopated, and Haskell is a meloldic bassest. The horns were playedby Marc Cheric and Nick Evens, some of the best jazz musicans in England at the time.<br /><br />Strange, unique and fantastic album.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Buble is a great throwback pop crooner revivalist!  The music is hot, sultry, fun, and swinging!  In today's uber stressful and fast paced world, he is a 'godsend'!  Many people are yearning for substantive things of yesteryear, when America was a better and saner place in so many regards.  Or as the author and futurist Alvin Toffler put it in his monumental (then) book 'Future Shock'... \\"high tech, vs. high touch\\".  Humans are hankering for a bit of \\"high touch\\" these days.  My only complaint, and it is an industry-wide one, is that this CD sounds a bit compressed in the recording and mastering process.  As a music loving audiophile, with serious equipment to evaluate recordings, I am appalled at how record companies put out substandard product these days!  This is true not only of this CD, but most others.  They should realize that many listeners out there ARE using good equipment, and expect much better product sound-wise.  I'm off my soapbox now.

0385504225|4.0|Since the point of most novels is to entertain, this book certainly did that.  Although I agree with many reviewers that it was unnecessarily long, it was a rather quick read (particularly if you speed read through the repetition.  I enjoyed it.
B002G1X350|3.0|I own everything Leaves' Eyes have ever put out, including the maxi singles.  I own both of Liv Kristine's solo albums.  I own all the Theater of Tragedy albums that feature Liv Kristine on vocals.  I once met Alex and Liv and the whole band at one of their shows and stammered like an idiot while saying hello.<br /><br />In my opinion, Leaves' Eyes is the best \\"symphonic/gothic/whatever categorization floats your boat\\" metal band out there today.  They could release an album titled \\"62 Minutes Of Gusty Flatulence\\" (containing precisely that) and I would still rate it 2 stars.<br /><br />That does not mean, however, that every album will be a masterpiece.  And Njord just doesn't seem all that inspired, especially when compared to their previous 2 releases.  Rather, it's merely average, sounding a lot like the more pedestrian gothic metal outfits working today.<br /><br />To be sure, the musicianship is impeccable as always, and Liv's voice is better than ever.  But none of the songs really have much in the way of hooks that reach out and grab you.  Compared to such stunners as \\"Solemn Sea,\\" \\"Misseri,\\" and \\"Twilight Sun,\\" the songs on Njord mostly just amble along, without ever catching fire.  Several of the songs are so gentle that it's hard to believe they're from a Leaves' Eyes album.  Not that every song has to blow you out of your shoes, but this really has a much more toned-down feel overall.<br /><br />This album also features more growling and singing in general from Alex.  Rather than sparingly providing a counterpoint to the sweetness of Liv's voice, he's taking on a much larger role, and I don't particularly care for the results.  Still, can't say I blame him - I suppose he needs something to do at concerts besides roaming around the stage and pumping up the audience when they play songs that he doesn't sing on.<br /><br />Do I recommend Njord?  Yes - you could do a lot worse.  Is it my favorite?  No.  Will I still look forward to their next release?  Of course.

B000068PQ0|4.0|How does a great musician follow an orchestral masterpiece,[[ASIN:B00000JC6C The Soft Bulletin]]and an album you need four stereos to play,[[ASIN:B000002NIQ Zaireeka]].<br /><br />One way is to take a step back, write some really good songs. Then take what you have learned, apply it, but do so on a smaller scale. Make a fantastic rock and roll album. That is what the Flaming Lips have done here.<br /><br />If not for Soft Bulletin, there would be nothing small scale about this album. The lips did not invent melodic pop, but they sure have updated it well. Robots is full of nice little accustic tracks, lovingly dipped in orchestrations, sound effects, wonderful melodies and vocal tracking. This is a wonderful \\"little\\" album, like the best pop, more complex and layered than you first realize.
B000G03Q2S|5.0|This review is for the Pet Sounds 40th Anniversary CD + DVD.<br /><br />- Audio CD: The stereo portion seems identical, but this is the best sounding mono Pet Sounds ever.  Here's why:<br /><br /> - Album in mono: This is a NEWLY remastered mono version from a superior quality master tape.  There is almost no tape hiss audible in this new version, and also there is less tonal distortion.  The vocals don't suffer from high-end distortion that plagued previous versions.  Compared to my 2009 Audio Fidelity mono gold CD, my 1999 Capitol release, and the Pet Sounds Sessions mono CD, I can say that the 40th Anniversary Edition has the best, most truest sounding mono mix of Pet Sounds I've ever heard on CD.  Finally, the album in mono is of the same high quality as the stereo mix.<br /><br />Differences with the 40th Anniversary edition are that unlike the 1997 and 1999 versions, (a) the mono remaster comes from superior original master tapes (see Mark Linett's review) and (b) the entire CD was subsequently remastered in 24-bit format in 2000 using the HDCD process. Although all audio CDs are 16-bit, HDCDs have 20 bits of data encoded in the standard 16-bit audio signal, and thus have better sound quality.  This mono/stereo disc is the only Pet Sounds CD I will be using from now on (I bought a few of them as backup copies), except for many songs on the Pet Sounds Box Set, and I will still be spinning my 180-gram vinyl audiophile Pet Sounds LP occasionally.<br /><br />- DVD: This is another area where the 40th Anniversary edition really shines. There are two components to the DVD: the videos, and the audio.<br /><br />- DVD Videos: There is \\"The Making of Pet Sounds\\" which is a new edit of the fun & informative 1997 promo video. This is followed by \\"Pet Stories,\\" which includes some 4 decades worth of interviews from ALL of the Beach Boys as well as Tony Asher, Bruce Johnston, a handful of the session musicians and other music industry insiders who were there at the time. Next is \\"Rhythm of Life,\\" a 1990's BBC-produced short video segment where Beatles' producer Sir George Martin goes to Brian Wilson's home and the two end up in the studio going through the master tape for \\"God Only Knows.\\" The video segment ends with the original 1966 promotional films for \\"Good Vibrations,\\" \\"Sloop John B,\\" and \\"Pet Sounds.\\" These original films are worth a watch. The \\"Good Vibrations\\" promo film is the only one in color, and is brings to mind the \\"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\\" 1966 recording sessions from the legendary \\"Smile\\" album when Brian brought out the red fire hats. The other two are more campy, black & white videos featuring Halloween masks, Mike drinking percolated coffee out of his boots, and The Beach Boy's playing an a pool.<br /><br />- DVD Audio: This is the best part of the 40th Anniversary package. For the first time, listeners can hear Pet Sounds in either (a) High-resolution 96 kHz, 24-bit PCM stereo, or (b) Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Hi-Res stereo sounds even better than the audio CD, especially when using good-quality headphones, but again there is not a monumental difference between the different stereo versions. The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound version, however, really elevates Pet Sounds to the next level. In the technical notes, Mark Linett says of the 5.1 mix:<br /><br />\\"In placing the sounds in the mix, we have taken a very \\"wide\\" approach to the music, and attempted to surround the listener with sound. Note that the center speaker is barely used since the phantom center created by the left and right speakers is a much more accurate way to reproduce the desired imaging and reverb in the front channels.  So don't be surprised that almost nothing is coming from the center speaker; it simply isn't needed.\\"<br /><br />This is immediately noticeable, and as Linett says, the end result is true to the original sound while surrounding the listener with a wide-spectrum aural experience. Just as the stereo Pet Sounds was a revelation to those of us who grew up listening to the mono all those years, the 5.1 mix brings out instrumentation and vocals that were even downed-out in the stereo mixes. The percussion is crisper and I can hear things I never noticed before, and yet when turning back to the stereo or even the mono version, sure enough those sounds are there too, just buried a little deeper. Because of the broad sound spectrum and sparse use of the center, it's best to turn the volume up a few notches when playing the 5.1 Surround mix.  Lyrics are provided on the TV screen, so it's a very pleasing opportunity to sing along with The Beach Boys!<br /><br />- Pet Sounds booklet (liner notes): This release has newer, expanded liner notes, including more sections, added detail and even updating some of the information from the previous version. It's really nice to see the thorough notes on the remastering and remixing processes - this information is lacking and in some cases not even included with so many remastered albums today (Led Zeppelin's \\"Mothership,\\" for example).<br /><br />- Conclusion: Of course Brian Wilson did the original mix of Pet Sounds in mono, and that will always be the true reference, the benchmark, the final authority for how Pet Sounds was meant to be heard. Because the mono Pet Sounds on this CD is far superior, I have mothballed my 1999 CD, 2009 Audio Fidelity Gold CD, and the mono bonus disc from Pet Sounds Sessions and now strictly play the 40th Anniversary CD. The previous remastered mono versions were flat and compressed and suffered from excessive tape hiss and recurring distortion, but those problems have been remedied here, and the results are stunning. The quality of this mono version is finally comparable to the quality of the stereo remix.<br /><br />Having a Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound DVD audio mix is a rare but welcome option for classic albums such as Pet Sounds. The only other DVD 5.1 mix that comes to mind it The Beatles' \\"Love,\\" but that seems somewhat less significant because it is not one of their original albums. With this release the bar has been raised for future remasters and anniversary editions - hopefully technology such as Dolby 5.1 and even 7.1 Surround Sound (not to mention Blu-Ray and HD video) will continue to be employed for projects such as these.<br /><br />Brian is a musical genius and it is thanks to him and Mark Linett that all of the versions of Pet Sounds sound as good as they do. We are lucky to have so many options for experiencing the original Pet Sounds (and don't forget Brian's live Pet Sounds DVD - the show rocks!). This 40th Anniversary edition is now out of print, so I recommend buying a copy (or two or three) if you can while they are still available. You won't be disappointed.
B002JTHFV2|5.0|With so many albums getting the so-called \\"deluxe\\" treatment, it's so exciting to see this incredible album finally get the same.  \\"A Sort Of Homecoming (Live)\\" has to be one of my favorite U2 tracks ever and along with all the other bonus material here, it's the perfect addition to my U2 collection.  This one will be on repeat for awhile.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I have been hearing a lot of these songs lately on the Sirius XMU indie rock station I listen to religiously. So imagine my shock when I finally learned that they were all part of the New Moon soundtrack. I was blown away. Considering I listened to the Fleet Foxes album on repeat the whole time I read New Moon, I find that this soundtrack is also a perfect compliment to the story, and I look forward to hearing how each song will be used in the movie. That being said, too bad there's not a song on here by Fleet Foxes, but the songs by Thom Yorke and Grizzly Bear more than make up for this. Bon Iver AND Editors too? SOLD. I give this album 5 stars. I am really enjoying it.
1416595546|4.0|This review was written by Tatyana M. Uporova, the recipient of the book I purchased for her. She is a native of St. Petersburg.    \\" I liked the book in general but it was a pity that such a good book had a number of serious mistakes, especially since the author introduced himself as a Russian historian. Examples:    1) Students of the Smolny institute were sewing clothes for Russian soldiers at the front (this was taking place in 1916 during WWI). They were attaching zippers to breeches (page 7). Zippers were invented in 1913 by Gideon Sundbeck of the Universal Fastener Company. A patent for the Separable Fastener was issued in 1917.  They were first used by the B.F. Goodrich Company on rubber boots and renamed zipper. Zippers were not used on clothing until the 1930's and in the Soviet Union they did not become part of common peoples' clothing until the 1970's.    2) Sashenka, the main heroine was arrested by gendarmes when she exited Smolny institute and taken to Kresty prison. One would think that gendarmes have to use the shortest possible route to deliver the arrested person to jail. But not per Mr. Montefiore. His gendarmes perhaps decided to give her a scenic tour of St. Petersburg before locking her up. They passed the Taurida Palace on Shpalernaya street, then somehow brought her to Nevsky prospect (it's not clear from the desription)but obvious to everyone who is familiar with St. Petersburg. There is only one way to get from where they started their trip along Nevsky: from Shpalernaya turn right to Liteiny prospect, at Liteiny bridge left to the embankment straight to the Palace bridge where they had to turn left to get to Nevsky near the Admiralty. Traveling along Nevsky the were passing Gostiny Dvor, Passazh, then turned left on Sadovaya street. Along Sadovaya they reached Mikhailovsky Castle where they had to turn right on Panteleimonovskaya street to get to Liteiny prospect only to get back to Liteiny bridge where they were almost at the beginning of their tour, making a full circle, to cross and finally reack Kresty.  I'm certain the author used this desription to show how well he knows the historic center of St. Petersburg but it did not serve that purpose. It only showed that he has very little knowledge of the area. All scenes set in St. Petersburg sounded unreal, even funny to people who lived in the city.    3) Sashenka a baroness? The hisrory of Russia knew only one Jewish baron who was sent to Russia as a Hessian diplomat. Horatio Ginzburg was the first and only Jewish diplomat in czarist Russia. Bismarck gave him a baron title and made it inheritable. Alexander II accepted his title and that became an exclusive in Russian history.  Mr. Montefiore portraits Sashenka's father, baron Zeitlin after a prominent Jewish merchant, banker and builder of railroads - Lazar Polyakov. For many years this talented man, who was one of the best known, powerful and wealthy people of his time tried very hard to get the title of baron, but no matter how hard he tried Nicholas II could not accept the idea of making a Jewish man a member of the noble circle, much less with a noble title.    4) Mr. Montefiore uses Russian words here and there, but it does not seem necessary. It looked like the author tried to prove his knowledge of the Russian language and used all the Russian words he knew. They just appear in front of the English version of the same word without puctuation, just in italics.    5) Some of the Russian names used are spelled incorrectly. For example, Panteleimon is spelled throughout as Pantameilion.    There are many more small mistakes that I found and they detract from the story. Some of the descriptions showed that the author had little knowledge of the life he was writing about.\\"
B0002KPIQY|4.0|I bought it for obvious resones, but was surprise at the fact I thought it was a good movie.
B0012DNLXC|1.0|Apparently I watched a different third installment than the previous review.  I was ready to turn it off after about half way through this boring, ridiculously idiotic final episode.  The childish simplicity that they wrap this trilogy of movies up with is something I would have expected to see on the sci fi channel.  BUT...if you still feel the need to watch this incredible borefest, at least do yourself a favor and watch it in HD!!  The visual effects will at least take your mind off the fact that you have seen the WORST final episode of a trilogy ever made!
B002U5EHB6|5.0|Have you ever written a story? Taken that creative writing class? Even an essay for an English class? If yes then you probably know that feeling you get when you don't know where to go from where you are now. That unsatisfactory feeling you get when you connect two events in your story and the connection is weak and flaky. That is what I have found so far with Stargate Universe.     That being said Stargate Universe has an amazing setting. The authors can do anything they want with what they have; a galaxy unknown, a ship full of unknown wonders, 80-something passengers of unknown qualities.. I am looking forward to where it goes.    This episode is about where the others were.. not bad, but not as good as you want from an episode of Stargate.     Looking forward to next weeks episode!
0385340575|1.0|I had tired long ago of the Reacher books.  But then, my local paper here in Phoenix said that after a long hiatus of ho-hum Reacher books, \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" broke the string and was the best in years.  So, I got sucked in...fortunately, only to the tune of a used book price.  This book is so dull and boring.  It takes until after page 200 before anything at all says \\"read on\\" and what you get is just terrible.  By half way through the book, you KNOW who is met in the Afghan mountains.  By the end of the book, you strain for credibility that Reacher alone can kill 19 people holed up in a townhouse.  I regret every minute I spent reading this book and have written Reacher novels off of my list, even $1.00 copies at the local nurses book sale.
B000BZIST4|5.0|The second DVD- \\"Making Of The French Connection\\" really adds a lot of depth the particulars of making this film.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I was really happy with the product, genuine item, top condition and I'm enjoying it so overall would give it 9/10, was a bit slow getting it but thats more the post office's fault.
1573300403|5.0|I have watched this DVD at least 20 to 30 times already and it is worth every dollar, every cent, every penny!!!!!!!     Of course you have to get the volumn 1 dvd to have all the classic music videos but this one has the Motown performance and 95 MTV performance!!!!!!     AND this is the only dvd with the \\"You are not alone\\" angel version! trust me, I have all MJ's dvds and this one is the only one showing MJ as an angel in the music video!!!!!      You won't regret buying this!
0517548232|5.0|This is a great book that hammers home the fact that economic actions have consequences - and that those consequences often travel much farther than the eye can see. The one-sentence \\"lesson\\" in chapter 1 leads to discussions in later chapters to a view of unemployment, inflation, government spending, tariffs, etc.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|One of their best CD's. If you're a Megadeth fan, you will like this one. I would defiantly recommend this CD.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|Fantastic first solo effort from Mr Wilson. You could not expect anything else really.  DVD audio sound is top notch.  If you like Porcupine tree then this is a must have.
B0017ANAZO|3.0|The Bottom Line:    It's not only the lack of any actor with a Y chromosome that makes The Women feel like it should be airing on the Lifetime network: between the ham-handed direction, weak writing, and superfluity of characters in a short film, The Women is a featherlight comedy that might be the type of film to watch on an airplane but that's about the best recommendation I can muster.    2.5/4
0061765236|5.0|This was the first book I read by the author, and the start of a long love affair with the books of Jodi Picoult.  I read all the time, and rarely do I find a book that moves me as much as this one.  Although the subject matter is quite sensitive, and I did not agree with all of the book's premises, I could not put it down.  I cried, I laughed, and I lost sleep.  I've gone on to read everything else Ms. Picoult has written, but this book remains a particular favorite.  She is an author that I find extremely compelling, even controversial, as her subject matter touches on highly polarized issues.  Her character development is first-rate, and I cannot recommend this book enough.  You won't be sorry when choosing this book.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|If you are a true MJ fan, you must get this DVD!!!!!!     granted, it shows the audience a lot, but that just goes to show you how crazy MJ fans are! I love yall!!      I highly recommend this dvd!!!!!!! You won't regret it! It's so worth your money!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Love Micheal so what's not to like? I was disappointed in the DVD because I already had that concert DVD.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I'm glad the Whitney is BACK!  I have the CD in my car and iPOD.  It's great music and the messages on each track I can feel that it came from the heart. Thanks, Whitney. We missed you for far too long. :D
B001TOD92C|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Mickey Rourke and Marissa Tomei certainly embody their characters fully and the film gives the viewer some interesting information and insight into pro wrestling (I particularly enjoyed when the crowd cheered when Mickey Rourke smacked the \\"bad guy\\" wrestler and then booed when the bad guy hit him back) but the general arc of the screenplay is so familiar and trite that the movie consistently holds itself back from greatness; The Wrestler is a good film, but not a great one.    3/4
B001UE27X8|5.0|This is one of the set of best vocal sessions ever recorded and placed into a two album set. I have two earlier CD copies as well as the original LPs. One can never tire of the artistry with which this music is performed. As former music director of WRTI in Philadelphia (1983-1988), I can only say that if you don't own this compilation, you need to order it today :-)
B0015AARJI|5.0|love the remote.<br />its a perfect add on compared to the third party version.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|I just bought this Blu-ray and I would have to say that it is all I could have wanted. I thought that the book was a bit much, but it was still a very nice package. I first saw 300 in an IMAX theatre, and was amazed. Shortly after I upgraded to a 1080p HDTV. The 300 BD has many ways to view the movie. I have now seen them all, and they are each a different and interesting experience. If you liked this movie, and you are looking for the best version, this is worth the price. ***warning*** the BD book doesnt fit most BD holders, so keep that in mind.
1401323820|3.0|This is an enjoyable read in that Castle/Beckett (or Rook/Heat) banter is just as funny as it is in the show. However it's very short (just another episode) and doesn't flesh out the characters at all. The product placement (in a book? blasphemy!) made it hard to focus on the story and the word \\"heat\\" is repeated relentlessly. With that said, I wasn't expecting great literature, just a fun, kinda cheesey read, and in that respect \\"Heat Wave\\" delivered. It just needed more substance and less name-dropping.
B000P5FH3K|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though this version of John Grisham's 'The Rainmaker' benefits from the fact that the book is one of Grisham's best, it cannot be denied that the film resists the temptation to screw things up that strikes so many such adaptations; realizing instead that Mr. Grisham's novels barely need any adapting, Coppola sticks closely to the book's interesting story and produces a film that zips through its 135 minute running length, engages the viewer, and emerges as a pretty decent piece of entertainment.    3/4
B002JODUI4|5.0|Came accross his music while checking out some essential mixes and became hooked to the sounds instantly.  Most of the tracks are very emotional especially on the Random Album Title release.  FLOABN is a bit more aggressive especially with the 1st track, FML.  FML will have your full attention no doubt.  Here is a trick to this album,  play it LOUD!!  Ghost's n stuff  is a great track, and finishing with Strobe starting mellow and picking up pace with diversity at the end.  This second album is as good or better than the 1st.  What are the chances!  Deadmau5 is now one of my new favorite artists to listen to.
0385504225|1.0|This book does not come up to the entertainment of dan Brown's other books. I was disappointed and would not recommend it.  Save your money.       Jim
B002Q4U9YU|1.0|\\"THIS IS IT\\" is so not what I expected. It is NOT the soundtrack of the movie/rehearsal, this is just another Best of with some extras...<br />I really don't mind another \\"best of album\\" as long as it is advertised like one. Having all MJ songs and some unreleased ones, I can make my own playlist.<br /><br />As far as the song \\"this is it\\" is concerned, I guess it's okay, nothing more... Paul Anka is not even credited. I figured they didn't have time to change the booklet<br /><br />The demos are fun, especially Beat It !! It would have been nice to get some more... But they don't \\"save\\" THIS IS IT.<br /><br />Once again, Sony mislead us! It's very disappointing !<br /><br />Will we have a \\"Live Album\\" of the movie? Maybe around Christmas, with some \\"new demos\\"...
B001FB4W16|5.0|This is one super series. I have always been a fan of Vampire movies, but this one takes the cake. Great acting and super soundtrack keep you running till the very end. Now for season two
6305841861|5.0|Whether it's a sequel or a remake, it doesn't matter once the film starts. This is the second installment in Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series, and it's one of the few sequels (or \\"remake\\" if you want to call that) that is equal to the original. It's just as diabolical, with some twisted moments that will no doubt be implanted in the brains of those who watch them. I think the only difference here is that the black humor is more constant than in the original. There is one scene in which Ash (Bruce Campbell) discovers that his hand is possessed by an evil spirit, and from then on, some diabolical hilarity ensues. The entire film is basically a perfect mix of horror, blood, slapstick, gore, and over-the-top edginess. It's actually one of the better horror films in recent decades. Sure, it may not be like The Exorcist, The Shining, or George A. Romero's zombie films, but the entire Evil Dead series stands on its own as a scary & darkly hilarious bloodfest. Kudos to Raimi and Campbell.
B0018TVEAW|4.0|I'm still going through some of the recipies from this book, a few per week.  This is an excellent book. Very easy to read and follow instructions.  The recipies are delicious. Be prepared to use alot of butter.  Some are time consuming, but very worth it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Feature-full, inexpensive and reliable. That's what I think about the H4n after some weeks of use.<br /><br />I use the unit mainly to record audio for video productions. For example, getting direct input from an audio console in a concert. It certanly needs a few tweaks, test audio levels, etc. (don't expect just to plug it and let it set up itself, you have tor work on that) but in the end, it has always given me great results.<br /><br />I use a [[ASIN:B001DKELYC Panasonic Pro AG-HMC150 3CCD AVCHD 24fps Camcorder]] video camera, and have had no sync problems at all. Just drop the video track, then the audio track, adjust them and that's all. No timing errors.<br /><br />Also, it comes with a multi-watt adapter, so you could use it on 110, 240, etc. No problem if going to Europe or Brazil (the prior H4 model didn't have this feature).
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Doesn't matter if you like Motley Crue or have even ever heard of them.  I could not put this book down..  it's that good.  It's real, it's heart-breaking and definitely eye opening.
B001JV5BIA|2.0|I saw this film at the drive-in many years ago and despite its following I have never been a big fan of this film. Watching it now I have confirmed my earlier opinion that this is not a great film. It's a low budget mess with horrible acting and an inappropriate music score that makes this film almost completely un-watch-able! That's not to say that this film doesn't have its moments, it's just too little too late.<br /><br />The film is full of inconsistencies and goes from truly disturbing to ridiculous comedy in the blink of an eye. This is really sad because this film could have been so much better if Wes Craven had kept the tone more even. The rape and killings are pretty brutal for when it was released and it isn't an easy film to watch at times.<br /><br />I also have to compare this film to much better horror films from the same time period such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is far superior and even though it's a low budget film it really works for the most part and the actors seem to be more believable. I realize that this film came out a couple of years before it, but Chainsaw is a much more satisfying horror outing.<br /><br />I give some props for being one of the first films of this nature, but it isn't as good as its reputation. I don't know anything about this special edition nor do I care. If this is your cup of tea then by all means buy it!
0552550299|2.0|Lost interest in it very quickly.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I received this fabulous collection quickly and found it to be in very good condition. Love the series and love the Rambaldi box. Thanks - I've been wanting the entire series for some time now and am very happy that I was able to get such a great and fun collection.
0307408833|5.0|This book has transformed my baking. It's healthy and it's so amazingly delicious!  It did cost quite a bit to buy all the baking products but for the health benefits of the ingredients...it's worth it. I would highly suggest getting this book, especially if you have any food sensitivities to eggs, milk, gluten, dairy etc.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The series is great , different from the books but great nonetheless. I love the actors and their characters. It is a wonderful escape for me. I wish I lived in the Midlands!   It's a ton of fun. Get the books and DVDs they are awesome.
0385504225|3.0|[...]. I enjoyed following Robert Langdon's character, and the story wasn't bad, but this is one of the few times I wish I'd bought the abridged version.
0375826726|5.0|LOVE the entire series.  Strongly recommend reading all three books.  Especially if you saw the movie Eragon because it pales in comparison to the books.  The books take you into the personalities of the characters and their relationships with one another that they couldn't do in the movie because of time restraint.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|Excellent movie. Will Smith does an outstanding job in this movie. Recommend it all day, everyday.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a great TV show that never caught a break from the executives from Fox and from mainstream audiences. Although based on the revenues generated from Serenity, Firefly may have lasted two or three seasons. The movie serenity just barely broke even.
0385504225|2.0|I was very dissappointed with this book. I only trully appreciatred Angels and demons and The Da Vinci Code, both Deception Point and Digital Fortress, and now The Lost Symbol were let downs for me.   I thought since Robert Langdon was back in this book it was worth reading it. I was wrong. Characters really lack development, the story is mainly boring and repetitive. I got to a point where I didn't even care if they killed the characters, Langdon included. What dissapointed me the most was the end, I guess I didn't understand the whole symbolism of it... and I didn't even bother reading the final pages again to try and find out. Im afraid at that point, I didn't care anymore.
1400082773|3.0|It took me (a person who reads a novel a week on average) 8 months to get through this book. I received it as a birthday present from my mother-in-law who thought it would be a good present for her \\"democratic son-in-law\\". It was a lovely thought, and appreciated. This book just doesn't fit the bill.    I did enjoy learning about Mr. Obama's childhood in Hawaii with his maternal grandparents and their attitudes toward race in contrast with the hate and angst coming from his \\"friends\\". I also really liked learning about his Kenyan relatives and their back story. The Chicago part of the book was really hard to get through and seemingly meaningless in relation to the purpose of the book.    Part of the problem here is that he stuck to a strictly linear telling of his life, with what he learned and when. But, what is most interesting and what influences us far more is our upbringing and our heritage (what this book seemingly purports to be about as well). Therefore, most of the last third of the book should have been up front and he should have given much more about his childhood.    Finally, I also felt like there was mostly just telling going on here (insert the infamous show versus tell tirade from English teachers everywhere). In other words, I got to hear about things that happened, but I never felt like I was there, as a part of it. This has to do with language and word choice mostly, but also because I never felt like I was inside Mr. Obama's head. I don't really know how he felt about different things or what connections he was making as he made them (which is kind of the purpose for telling the story linearly).    In summary, I felt like I got a good idea of the frustrations and difficulties of being a black man in America today (or, at least, 30 years ago), but I don't really see how this ties in with inheritance and his father's dreams.    If one of my college students turned in something like this for their own personal narrative, I would have given it a B-(a little above average for some things, but not meeting the needs of the assignment).
B0000012Y1|5.0|Briefly, I do not at all agree with the reviews that found fault with the sound.  On my excellent stereo system, the sonics are nothing short of stupendous.  I also disagree with the many people who have problems with Gwyneth Jones.  To my ears, the voice is gorgeous, dramatic, thrilling.  I do not hear squalling, and as for pitch, there is occasionally a little vibrato, but nothing unattractive.  This is a set to treasure and to hear often.  (Disclosure: I have 9 recordings of Lohengrin, and what I want from this work is beauty over everything else.)
B00005QGAT|4.0|The primal reason for success of Michael Jackson's first solo album, Off the Wall, may be Quincy Jones's precisely calculated light soul tracks; his delicate arrangement for horns and strings adds a sophisticated spice to the late 70s soul/disco sound. Michael's musicianship, particularly his skill in treatment for vocals and percussions with strong rhythmic sense, may be another factor for the success. On his own \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" and \\"Workin' Day And Night,\\" we hear massively layered vocals and percussions weave complicated rhythm patterns with Latin flavors. Meanwhile, Michael's falsetto must have sounded bizarre to most audience back in the time; the tracks' perfection might have made the bizarreness irrelevant and even turned it to people's favorite. Michael's unique vocal would become another major element for his music's popularity, thanks to Quincy's establishment and Michael's own musical talent.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|As the mom of a four year old daughter, I have watched all the Disney princess movies. This one is our favorite hands down!    Beauty and the Beast offers something for everyone.. singing and dancing, comedy, drama, even a little horror.    The only down side of this movie is that very small children may find the beast too scary so use discretion with little ones who frighten easily.
0385737947|5.0|This was a nice, solid read. Definitely, the best I've read of his writing so far.    The whole YA dystopia bildungsroman seems to be quite popular at the moment, with Hunger Games and its sequel, Uglies, Libyrinth, and so forth. I've only read Hunger Games, but Maze Runner is much better and more interesting.    Setting: The story starts off in an elevator and the main character doesn't know who he is (except his name) or how he got there. Once he arrives at his destination, we see a sheltered area where all is peaceful and calm, in appearance. There is a definite undertow of danger and fear and pain. In some ways this setting reminded me of Lord of the Flies, but I think is has more to do with the idyllic nature and the fact that it is all boys than any similarities in actual setting.    Of course, the biggest part of the setting is the Maze that we learn the boys are trying to find their way out of. And it is dangerous. Deadly.     The third layer of this setting is the \\"outside\\" world that we get a glimpse of at the end, and which is hinted at throughout the narrative.    I like all the layers here, and the feel of a story within a story. I didn't realize this was part of a series until I started reviewing it, but I am glad that I'll get to learn even more here. The story felt complete enough as a stand alone story, but there are definitely a couple loose ends.    Plot: Speaking of loose ends. Actually, the plot was good, and the loose ends are necessary for a series. I did want to know more about why they were using the boys like this and what it would accomplish. There were a couple sub-plots too. The romance, the learning to trust (or not), the apparent motives of \\"the Creators\\", and the reality of the \\"Changing\\" dreams. All this behind the main plot of how to get out of the maze. I felt that one reason this was better than Hunger Games is because the plot was consistent and didn't rely on gimmicks to work (people didn't come back as monsters to fight your battles for you). By the way, I figured out WICKED fairly quickly (made me feel all kinds of smart).    Conflict: Definitely lots of conflict. There are the conflicts about wanting to know what is going on, the conflict between crazed \\"Changing\\" boys, the conflict about a girl showing up, the conflict of wanting to be a Runner, the conflict of seeming to know too much, the conflict of the monsters, the conflict of the maze and its puzzle, and the conflict of why the boys are in here in the first place.     Character: There were some interesting characters here. I think that Hunger Games did a bit better here. I wasn't as invested in the characters (especially the ones I guessed would die) as I would have liked. But, these characters were much more complex than in Hunger Games.    Text: There was some annoying metaphoric writing at the very beginning that got in the way for me. But, once I got in 20 or 30 pages, I didn't notice if it was still there or if I just got used to it, because I no longer was paying attention to text-level details.
0385504225|5.0|GREAT BOOK! Can't say enough. A MUST READ for all you Dan Brown/Robert Langdon fans! You won't be sorry. Keeps you wanting more.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|This is a great collection of hits from MJ, and if you take a close listen, you will see that almost all of the songs he selected for his concert have a message.  They are not all number ones, but the majority of them tell us something about his philosophy. The exceptions are Thriller and Billie Jean, which were included of course because they are the bestsellers and great dance hits.    Regarding the demos - worth buying the whole album for these.  I bought both the CD from Amazon for a keepsake and the iTunes unbundled selection that includes only the demos and poem.    She's out of My Life - \\"unplugged\\" version sung to acoustic guitar. Can't wait to get the booklet so I can find out who was playing guitar. It's amazing and so moving.    Wanna Be Startin Something - great to have for the ending, which in this demo has even more energy than the final version because you can hear the individual instruments. What a treat.    Beat It - this shows you the architecture of MJ's song building where he lays down his own vocals to show how the instrumentation should sound.    Planet Earth - gives me goosebumps. It's incredibly intimate, very sensual and unique. MJ had a brilliant mind and this gives you a glimpse. Plus I love hearing his spoken voice.    This is It - I've heard all the critics, but I LOVE this song and even though it was written years ago, the lyrics are like a tribute to MJ's legacy. The vocals are wonderful, especially considering it was an out-take and has minimal production. This is raw MJ.
0385504225|2.0|The initial shipment of this book was delivered destroyed. The package was bent through the middle at about 40 degrees. However, Amazon did ship a replacement right away upon my telephone call.    As to the book I believe this was Dan Brown's poorest novel to date. It seems as if he rushed it to print with a rather disjointed story line and just much less effort than previous novels. Found this book to be mediocre at the best.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown comes through again with a fast moving intellectually fascinating tale of the world of the Masons. Great action,superior characters and an all around excellent story.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|De Niro & Pacino were the movie they were awesome.<br />You people take movies way to serious, instead of trying<br />to enjoy them.<br />Non-stop action, suspence and had you goin one way and at the end<br />you find out you had it all backwards.<br />I give the movie a 5 of 5 stars.<br />If your a true fan of De Niro & Pacino you'll like it!!
0882709194|1.0|Ray Comfort is the last person on the face of the earth who should be writing the forward to Charles Darwin's Origin of Species. He is a Christian propagandist, and he is way out there even by those standards. This version of the book is an evolutionary dead-end. Do yourself a favor and get a version without Ray Comfort's forward.
0385504225|4.0|I definately liked this book better than either Da Vinci Code and Angles and Demons. It gave great believable thriller material to read fast and hard. I liked all the references about Masons and our founding fathers. I can't wait for the movie. He does have a propencity to go on and on at the end though. Hollywood will fix all that in the movie.
B001YV506S|5.0|I have shopped many other sites and had one refuse to take a defective disc back. Still keeo coming back to Amazon for the best prices and gurantees.[[ASIN:B001YV506S Seabiscuit  [Blu-ray]]]
0385504225|5.0|After I read the DaVinci Code, I fell in love with all of Dan Brown's work and I read every book that he has ever written. This is the perfect sequal to his other two DaVinci Code type books. It was too long coming and I hope that he is busy writing another book to keep us enjoying his fantastic work!
031604461X|1.0|I've never felt compelled to write a book review until I read this book. Before reading it, I skimmed over a few reviews, but stopped myself before I got too far. (I was going to read it anyway, right?) Now, I wish Meyer had stopped herself before SHE went too far.    I was late to the Twilight table, but, like so many others, I flew through the first three books in a matter of days and couldn't wait to get my hands on the last installment. After, I just wanted to go back and reread the original \\"Twilight\\" to reignite my love for the story and delude myself into thinking there could have been a different ending.    I may be looking at this the wrong way, but I always viewed the series as a love story first and a vampire story second. For me, it was always about the unshakable passion of these star-crossed lovers who, despite the obstacles, are determined to be together - dead or alive. A Romeo and Juliet story to be sure! And, like others, I am tempted to write my own ending to this story - the ending the story, Bella and Edward, and the readers truly deserve.     First, Edward. What happened to Edward? I think I speak for many when I say that I was just as entranced with Edward, and the very idea of Edward, as Bella was. Seeing Robert Pattinson's portrayal of this tormented character only cemented my (love? attraction?) fascination with him. But in this book, he is no longer central to the story. Sure, he's there - for sex, for brooding over Bella's condition, but his \\"soul\\" is missing from this book. I enjoyed hearing Jacob's narrative, but wouldn't we all have loved to hear Edward? He reads minds, for crying out loud! What a treat it would have been to get into his mind for just a few moments. And what happened to saving Bella's soul? Am I missing something or did this not torture our lovely Edward for three whole books? Bella's transformation comes too early - and without enough resistance from Edward.     Then, there's Bella. A very believable teenage girl whodoubted herself throughout the saga is now a revenge-hungry supervampire of epic proportions. Her greatest achievement - other than chugging blood and flexing her superpowers - is keeping all the names straight of the hoards of vampires that descend on the Cullen clan.    Renesmee? Aside from giving a child a name that makes me stumble every time I come across it, her introduction into the story is the ultimate jumping of the shark. She doesn't belong in this story. Period.    Jacob. I have to admit I wasn't crazy about Jacob's larger role in New Moon at first, but having once been a teenager in love myself, I understand the void that Jacob fills in Bella's life. Besides, her experiences with Jacob make Edward's return all that more satisfying. Although, by this book, Jacob seems to be just hanging around. Why? To \\"imprint\\" on Renesmee! Of course, as I said before, Renesmee simply doesn't belong in this story.    Alice. One of my favorite supporting characters - she simply up and disappears only to return at the very end?    Leah. Why was she even in this book? Her story is left dangling - couldn't Jacob have imprinted on her?    While it is too late for a rewrite, I imagine a very different ending to this story - and may have to write it down one day. I'm not sure how I would fill 700+ pages, but I can say without a doubt, Bella's transformation wouldn't have come around page 375. This moment is what the readers - what Bella - was waiting for. Why give it up so early?    Meyer had such a gift for getting her reader invested in this couple - and hope for their own, unique, happily ever after. Sure, they get the happy, but at what cost? It is a tarnished ending to an otherwise wonderful series.
0385504225|3.0|It had a good beginning. My grandfather was a Free Mason and I remember the stories of secrecy,so I was fascinated by the topic of this book. However, I quickly got bogged down until the end. It seemed so far-fetched, sensational and wordy, that I got impatient. It was not the page-turner I expected.<br /><br />Finally, I skimmed through to the end which turned out to be redeeming. The ending brought it all together - finally! It just took too long to get there.<br /><br />Based on other reviews, I deliberately read this first, before the DaVinci Code since so many of those reviews said it was hard to top, and that this one didn't.<br /><br />I shall see whether I agree!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The Blu-ray release of the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of the slickest releases in Blu-ray history so far. It excels on every count: packaging, visual and audio presentation, the amount and depth of extra features and and all of the above at a retail price below most much less ambitious Blu-ray titles.<br /><br />I will briefly justify why I believe that this is a 'must have' 5-star for anyone who who watches or has kids who watch Disney animations.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br /><br />Once you remove the 3-D sleeve, the solid plastic (unlike the more recent 'cheap' Blu releases, this case does not have holes punched in it to save a penny or 2) you will find a Blu-ray guide attached to the inside front cover. The 'navigational overview' tree of the 2 Blu-ray disks is actually needed do to the almost baroque layout of features with some, such as the Hyperion Studios extra found on the Bonus disk with dozens of subfeatures within the feature. The inside cover itself lists the 27 movie 'scenes'.<br /><br />There are 3 disks:<br /><br />- The Feature Disk has the 84-minute movie plus a host of extra features.<br />- The Bonus Disk has even more extras including the already mentioned 'Hyperion Studios'.<br />- The DVD Feature Disk has the full movie once again.<br /><br />VISUAL AND AUDIO PRESENTATION<br /><br />Obviously, the original is greatly cleaned and enhanced to take advantage of Blu's 1080p superior resolution but that's not all.<br /><br />The optional DisneyView mode would make watching more enjoyable by filling the right and left side bars (the original is in a 3x4 format) with a static filler that changes with each scene matching the scene's own background, creating the impression that one is watching a 'wide screen' movie.<br /><br />Most of the extras are shot in uncompromising 1080p resolution.<br /><br />The highest audio resolution is 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio with 5.1 surround available for French and Spanish. The original soundtrack is also included for reference.<br /><br />An audio commentary track is available on the Feature Disk.<br /><br />EXTRA FEATURES<br /><br />They run the whole gamut. The Feature Disk has the expected and inevitable - but in this case with a twist - 'deleted scenes', several 'remote control games', a music video of 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' and a 'Princess and the Frog' sneak peak.<br /><br />The Bonus Disk has two main section.<br /><br />There's the 'Classic bonus features' that has content we would normally expect on a bonus disk - Heigh-Ho Karaoke sing-along, Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, Disney Through the Decades, Animation Voice Talent.<br /><br />And then there's the absolutely amazing Hyperion Studios feature. It must be the most innovative 'bonus' making this purchase worth it for anyone who may already have the movie on DVD. Architected more or less like a hypertext document, it allows the viewer to freely jump in and out featurettes dealing with the history of Disney, the animators, the making of various aspects of the movie, the cultural impact of Snow White and of Disney. And the above are put together with historians and some of the original animators talking, original story boards, full-length, uncut Disney 'shorts', reconstructed and re-enacted Walt Disney and animators commentary to specific scenes and their thoughts and views as the scenes were developed... like I said, simply amazing if you add the never-before-used interface and you consider the extra-crisp quality of the entire presentation.<br /><br />MY CONCLUSION<br /><br />I already stated it in the second paragraph of this review: if you are into animation and Disney, get it without hesitation. It's a steal.EXTRA FEATURES    They run the whole gamut.

B00005UKKF|5.0|Thanks for sending this so quickly! It came in perfect condition and I am very happy with how this transaction was handled.  thanks again!
B0029O08WA|1.0|I loved the Twilight soundtrack!  Even bought two copies so I didn't have to move it from car to house!!  New Moon soundtrack was a big disappointment.  I don't see how any of the songs relate to the story.  Wish I hadn't spent the money.
0307474275|5.0|I read this a few years back and decided to write a quick review, now that the movie has been out for a while. First and foremost...of course the book is better than the movie.<br /><br />Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is one of those books that keeps you interested all the way through. It's both exciting and suspenseful. During and after you read it you will want to re-search the paintings and locations of the book, out of sheer curiosity. I very much enjoyed it.
0385504225|3.0|I am a fan of the Da Vinci code and Angels and Demons. This book tries to follow the same \\"solve the puzzle\\" formula.  Overall the book is a good read, it moves well and there are twists and turns. However, although most of the book hints at a dramatic conclusion  similar  to the Da Vinci Code, I found the conclusion to be not very dramatic. Overall I  still enjoyed reading the book but  would not put it in the same class as the Da Vinci Code.
0385504225|3.0|Certain parts were much better than the Da Vinci Code, but overall it was not as good.  The book is fiction, yet I kept feeling Brown was trying to pass certain parts of it off as non-fiction. That turned me off.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|When I don't like a movie or book very much, and many others do, I try to think of why.  In this case I concluded that this movie was made for middle aged women who are trying to remember their youth, who remember it as more glorious than it was.  Amd whenever any such work is so narrowly aimed, it is bound to be sub-standard.      I realize that this was a successful play with music by a popular source.  Maybe the play was okay--but not for me.  The plot of the movie, however, is lame, lame, lame--one for all the prospective fathers of the bride.  The casting was grossly inappropriate with few exceptions.  I just saw the movie and can't remember a single song.  The scenery was nice enough, but most varied, according to IMDB.  It was shot at a couple of places in Greece--and partly in a London studio--and on California beaches, probably because there sere no nice beaches on that Greek isle.  So the producers couldn't even be honest or coherent with the background.  If you want to visit that Greek island after this, you'll need to include the Pacific Ocean, etc.    Now, the movie felt interminable.  It was very poorly edited, with meaningless scenes and dialogue.  People were jumping all over the place, or falling off roofs, or dangling from this or that--all in an attempt, perhaps, to lend life to something that was DOA for me.  \\"Hair\\" it is not.  As an update for the hippie participants, it's a wash.  I liked \\"Hair\\" but not \\"Mamma Mia,\\" which, by the way, is Italian, not Greek.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is a must have film for Kevin Spaceys fans. Well done with all actors in good rolls.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Three escaped convicts in circa 1940 Mississippi go through assorted adventures before finally gaining their freedom.  Entertaining caricature of Jim Crow-era South, presenting some of the colorful (and sordid) characteristics of life at that time.  Some of the characterizations are over the top, but overall an amusing portrayal--Clooney almost steals the show.  Occasional profanity and violence.
1615230823|5.0|This book should be read by everyone who wonders why some people succeed without apparent effort and others make great efforts and get nowhere. It helps to identify the hidden factors that affect everyone in their quest for success. Some cannot be overcome others may be but knowing of their existence helps salve the pains of the downtrodden.
0385504225|1.0|I plowed through Brown's \\"DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\"...great page turners both! Which makes me sad to say the following:    This much anticipated follow-up to the wildly successful DaVinci Code was intermittently sleep-inducing, the characters never fully fleshed-out (I never gave a hoot about any of them), predictable from beginning to end...and, speaking of the end....phlbttt.phlbttt.phlbttt.  Unbelievably, spectacularly sophomoric dreck of a finale (this was, at least, consistent with the rest of the book).     The research conducted, I'm sure, was a mountain of work...so kudos to whoever did that...but in terms of Mr. Brown spinning that research into something that resembled an intriguing, believable (or unbelievable in a good, science-fiction, way), page-turning story that I could buy into on any level or care about in the least...not so much. In fact, for this reader...not at all.     It did feel as though there was an assignment given and, in lackluster fashion, completed. Nothing more, nothing less.     A complete and total waste of my time.
0802798225|5.0|Read this book straight through. Stayed up all night for it. Absolutly could NOT put it down!
0307473465|5.0|It is 3am on Monday morning and I can't sleep.  \\"The Reader\\" has been haunting me over the past few days, or I should say, over the past few months.  I watched the movie and read the book at the beginning of this year and I just re-read the book and watched the movie again.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Michael dreamed about Hanna on his way from Boston to New York.  Hanna had been dead then, but in the dream, Michael's longing for Hanna was so intense that it hurt.  I knew this type of longing - it often hurt even sharper than a physical pain.  Last night I dreamt about my recently lost love.  I couldn't remember what happened in the dream, but what stayed with me was the pain of longing and not belonging. I have dreamt about my first love many times and woke up in tears more than once over the past 20 years. Michael had spent only a summer with Hanna, but he could never get over her.  I know I would have similar difficulties to let go.<br /><br />Hanna's longing for literacy was as strong as Michael's longing for her.  Hanna's shame of being illiterate was as strong as Michael's shame of having loved her.<br /><br />I have been thinking a lot about Michael's conversation with his father regarding dignity, freedom and happiness.  Yes, even a child can take no comfort of knowing his mother is always right. Every adult should have the last word on his own matters. Nobody has the right to force his opinion on other, to take action behind other's back, even if it were for the good, the happiness of the other person. It isn't about happiness - it is about an individual's dignity and freedom.  Yes, dignity and freedom, those are the things I have cherished most. I once fought my parents for my freedom when I was fresh out of college.  I strongly desired to take control of my own life.  I made my own decisions and ate my own mistakes. I don't blame others, and I want nobody's control in the name of \\"protection\\". Dignity and freedom are more important than \\"happiness\\". At the end of the day, happiness is a personal feeling: nobody can tell you how you should feel. Only you feel how you feel, and you know how you feel.<br /><br />So many conflicts among family members and between couples are caused by lack of respect to other's dignity and freedom, lack of respect to other's right to make his own decision, or lack of courage to make his own decision.<br /><br />Yes, I agree that Michael has no right to tell the judge about Hanna's illiteracy; even it could help Hanna's case. Yes, I agree that Michael should have talked to Hanna and persuaded her to admit her illiteracy.  However, I understood why he couldn't bring himself to face her.<br /><br />Courage to face the reality, courage to dig out the potentially very ugly truth, no every one possesses that kind of courage.<br /><br />Another detail touched me was the picture of Michael's graduation that Hanna clipped from a local news paper and attached on the wall of her prison cell.  Michael finally realized that, under the disguise of a cold surface, Hanna was as deeply attached to him as he was to her. I would have done and I had done similar things before. Love is an obsession and an addition that you couldn't/wouldn't/shouldn't get rid of.  You can squeeze it to a \\"niche\\" for a certain period of time; but eventually it would flood you unexpectedly.<br /><br />I am not trying to write a review of the book/movie.

0736041850|4.0|This book has very good information on the muscle group that is used when doing a particular exercise. It works every muscle group you have, from the neck to your toes. The only downfall I see about this book is that its ONLY a informative book. Meaning, it doesnt tell you how many sets to do, the schedule you should go with, or how intense the exercise is. But it will be useful for the experienced lifter, but for the rookie like me, I would need a little more guidence. Im sure it will be more useful when I know what exercises and sets I have to work with.

0670033049|4.0|Critics of this novel will tell you that it's a heavy-handed, melodramatic, bloated example of literary self indulgence; and frankly these are valid complaints.  And yet I enjoyed this novel - quite a bit actually.  Steinbeck, for all his shortcomings, is an accomplished story-teller and I found myself consistently reading `just a few more pages' instead of putting the book down.  What can I say?  The novel's flaws are maddeningly apparent, and yet I genuinely looked forward to each opportunity to pick the book up again.<br /><br />To address the (perfectly valid) criticisms of this novel:<br /><br />1. It's heavy handed:  It's hard not to argue with this criticism.  Steinbeck is about as subtle as a sledgehammer with his use of themes in East of Eden.  We get it.  Cain and Abel, Good vs. Evil, Free Will vs. Destiny.  At one point Cal (aka Cain) is asked if he knows where his missing brother is and Cal replies \\"How do I know, am I supposed to look after him?\\" (aka `Am I my brother's keeper?').  Personally I would have liked to have seen Steinbeck use a lighter touch and let readers interpret the novel for themselves.<br /><br />2. It's melodramatic:  I can't argue with this criticism either.  Frankly, it's a big sprawling multigenerational soap opera; more guilty pleasure than literary masterpiece.  But the fact that it's a Steinbeck novel gives you a rare opportunity to indulge in a guilty pleasure (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) and read a `classic' at the same time.<br /><br />3. It's boated and self-indulgent:  Did this novel need to be 600 pages long?  Of course not.  The central story with its Good vs. Evil theme, centers entirely on the Trask family.  But the novel tells the story of two families; the Trasks and the Hamiltons.  The Hamiltons are Steinbeck's own family and in fact John narrates much of the story as himself.  True, real Hamilton family members play pivotal roles in the fictional Trask family saga, but Steinbeck dedicates a considerable portion of this novel to telling his family story (that's the self-indulgent part).  The result is that the novel meanders, lacking focus, particularly during the middle portion of the novel.  The Hamiltons are mostly absent from the final quarter of the novel and the momentum picks up considerably as a result.<br /><br />East of Eden, particularly in its final quarter, is remarkably entertaining and compulsively readable.  To this, I attribute Steinbeck's gift for story-telling.  The bottom line: despite myself, I really enjoyed this novel.  I can't give it five stars because of the novel's shortcomings, but if you are looking for a guilty pleasure that you don't have to feel guilty about (on account of it being a classic novel written by one of the 20th century's eminent writers) look no further than East of Eden.  This is a far cry from Steinbeck's best work (although I understand he is most proud of this novel, probably because of the self-indulgent telling of his own family story and its celebration of his beloved Salinas Valley) but it is still well worth reading.  4 stars.ling his family story (that's the self-indulgent part).

B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Taylor outdoes herself again!!! Some of the new songs have actually been out for a while such as Come in With the Rain, Forever and Always, and the Luna Halo cover Untouchable.  It was nice to hear these done in studio other than just acoustically.  The forever and always track is a nice contrast to the original version.  Jump then Fall is probably my favorite and is very catchy.  Superstar and the Otherside of the Door are also good songs.  If you like Taylor Swift this CD is a great buy.  If you already have the original Fearless CD just buy these tracks, but you will miss out on extra videos and pictures.  Taylor Swift is amazing once again and I cant wait for her next CD to come out.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|This could have/should have been so much more. It is a good \\"hits\\" package, though as other reviews noted the songs were not all #1's. But all are well known. Then you get This Is It in 2 versions, and disc 2 a skimpy 3 demo set with one poem (all good).<br /><br />I knew these were not actual recordings from the rehearsals for the show. As it says on the cover - music that inspired the show. But I did expect more on disc 2 and this is the disappointment. There must be troves of alternate versions and demo's that could have been included to fill out the second disc. Sure wish they gave us more, but this is made by Sony - aka \\"we are only in it for the $$$\\" - not Rhino or Shout Factory and other labels who do things like this right.<br /><br />So if you want 14 truly great songs that you probably already have, plus This Is It (I read that Paul Anka is suing?) and the short second disc  - well... this is it. Otherwise, this ain't it by a long shot. I give it three stars since the tracks on disc 1 are great, and the demo's are cool.
B00008EY7H|5.0|I think this was a wonderful DVD.  The music and acts are spectacular. My grandchildren watched it 3 times. I would suggest this for everyone. I just wish I could see it in person. I have loaned it to a few people and they also think it is great.

B000002UVZ|4.0|'Lifes Rich Pageant' is one of those unfortunate \\"transitional\\" albums; the type that is almost always under-rated, or even overlooked. It captures REM as they move from the quirky jangle pop of their first three albums to the more polished commercial breakthrough of 'Document'. It is more accessible than any previous REM album, particularly its immediate predecessor 'Fables Of The Reconstruction', yet it retains the rawer, less polished feel of the band's early work.    On the surface, the album sounds like a cross between 'Reckoning' and 'Document'. REM return to the more upbeat jangley sound of their second album, yet there is also a slightly harder, direct edge to 'Pageant'. The riffs on several tracks are heavier, and Stipe articulates his lyrics properly for the first time. Perhaps not coincidentally, Stipe began seriously dabbling in social and political commentary, although at this stage they are mostly observations rather than the barbs seen on 'Document'. 'Cuyahoga', 'Flowers of Guatemala', and 'Fall On Me' are the clearest examples, with the latter becoming the band's biggest hit to date.     Yet there is a surprising amount of variety here. A more fun side of the band is evident on the slightly ragged singalongs 'These Days', 'Just A Touch' and 'I Believe'. There are also elements of the old-men-around-the-campfire-telling-tales country feel of 'Fables...'; most notably on 'Swan Swan H', but note also the ringing banjo intro to 'I Believe', the first verse of 'Cuyahoga', and the lyrical concerns of songs like 'Begin The Begin'.     It may not have packed the commercial or artistic punch of some other REM albums, but this is certainly no throwaway either. There are plenty of strong songs and interesting ideas, and overall a much more upbeat feel than the unsettling 'Fables..'. And since 'Document' showcased a more polished REM sound, 'Lifes Rich Pageant' is also the last album to showcase the more independent, free-spirited side of the band. You can tellthat REM really enjoyed making this album, and that feel comes through to make the album an enjoyable experience.    Four stars.

This movie is very graphic, with sex, S&M, and torture etc. If your not ready for really sick stuff....don't watch this movie.
B0021L8UXU|5.0|I was at first doubtful about spending my movie money budget for the week to see Zombieland on the big screen, but<br />several friends with similar tastes convinced me to go. I'm so glad I listened and will be lining up to<br />see it again on the big screen. Not only is this comedy/horror funny, but it also has a<br />meaningful message at the end (how many horror flicks can say that?). I also enjoyed the appearance of one<br />of my favorite comedians, the mysterious 'B.M.' (I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet). When a virus hits the planet and turns fighting the walking dead into a daily routine, a small group of<br />zombie haters band together for survival in a world gone 'dead' in more ways than one. Things fall apart quick when the group starts fighting each other as well as the zombies. See it on the big screen first. I'll be adding this one to my comedy/horror shelf as soon as it's available.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay[[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead [Blu-ray]]]

0385504225|3.0|Having read several other Dan Brown books, this one keeps pace with the others.   It's a good book, and it keeps you reading along anxiously awaiting the next revelation.      I would definitely recommend it, but it's nowhere near as satisfying as some of the prior books.    The whole book leads you up towards some huge revelation, and then it just drops you off with one of the worst written endings ever.      It's worse than a cliffhanger, as you get an ending that is just sadly disappointing.   It's as if Dan Brown had this great idea for a book, and how to build the suspense, but couldn't think of any big mystery to solve.      Again, I'd still recommend the book, but was hoping for something more.
0882709194|1.0|This is not the actual 150th anniversary edition.    The 50 page intoduction by Ray Comfort (creationist) is nothing but a blatant attempt to discredit evolution,    but a great place to start ..., learning about logical fallacies and psuedo science.
B000ZI8E5K|2.0|I absolutely recommend the book version of it. It gives good and practical information about how to use your subconscious mind in every area of your life. The CD is only a super fast (seriously) summary of the main points of the chapters. It is spoken at the speed of light. I am used to a more detail CD of a book where the reader speaks calmly and more slowly so you can actually get the information. It sounds like a an option sale to the highest bidder.

0553384775|1.0|At one point, I stood far away from the trash can, ready for my free throw. \\"If I can toss this book in, I don't have to finish it.\\" I missed. Sigh. On the plus side, this book helped me endure a boring shift at work.<br /><br />If you want to read well-crafted literature that's similar in its subject matter (an actual Wall-Streeter, as opposed to boiler room Wolfie, and his dabblings in misogyny, drugs, excess, crime, etc.), try \\"American Psycho.\\" Much more worth the time and a real bang-for-your-buck shock value as opposed to this schlock. Brett Easton Ellis is a bona fide writer, Belfort is a clown with a laptop.<br /><br />Negatives. Where to begin?<br /><br />I don't believe half of what is in this book, and the half that is true most likely got left out. Am I sniffing a million little pieces -- I mean -- rats? The \\"piles\\" of coke on his desk into which he crashes his head like hitting a pillow? Gotta be lifted from Scarface. Hilariously, Belfort claims that the book serves as a warning to prevent others going down the same debauched path. This would be a miraculously caring and selfless feat given the fact that his self-awareness level lurks somewhere down around Dante's ninth circle of hell, if not directly in it.<br /><br />The \\"prose\\" -- loosely termed -- invokes a vision of Belfort yelling this \\"true\\" story over thumping sound system to one of his cretinous little friends as they get simultaneous lap dances during a binge-fueled night at Scores. Perhaps a creative writing course might be in order for the next sequel, \\"Wolfie's Capers in White Collar Camp.\\" You know book number three is inevitable.<br /><br />He claims that the captain of his yacht referred to the starboard side as the \\"right.\\" Even at gunpoint, no captain would call use that term, much less risk the lives of guests and crew by sailing out into gale force winds and twenty foot waves, so I wonder what additional sinking-of-the-Nadine info he's lying about/leaving out. He refers to his wife as his most prized \\"possession,\\" always a nice thing to read as a female. Our Miller Lite heroine does little more than shop, [...], throw water at his face and withhold sex or give him sex, depending on which way the wind doth blow, endowing her character with as much dimension Barbie doll.

Why does she put up with his crap? He guesses she likes the \\"Life\\" he provides her (duh), but I would have liked more depth when it comes to Nadine. Actually, more depth everywhere would be nice.<br /><br />There is simply no resolution to all the conflict in this book. He speaks nothing of amends to the hundreds (thousands?) he's screwed over, yet he claims to love The Program. Although now sober, he has not become a new or improved person, and even brags about taking advantage of others in rehab with bribes and motivational speeches to gain unearned privileges. He's still a despicable self-enamored bull artist -- his writing this book proves it. There's no remorse or lesson, it's a 500-page brag session. And it's dedicated to his children? Sad. I hope his children never have to witness how depraved their father portrays himself, or the poor things will need intense therapy and heavy psychotropic meds for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />I could go on and on but why waste our time?

B002TC9TEA|1.0|I assume this is the newly released Diamond Edition.  The price is too high.  And why is Amazon not selling it direct?

B002Q4U9YU|2.0|I'm a pretty big Mr. Jackson fan, musically.  Considering there is only 1 new song on this album, and a total of 4 demos (17 minutes worth) on the ENTIRE 2nd disc--this album isn't worth a dollar.  For real?  An entire 2nd disc was dedicated to 17 minutes worth of material?   Where's the real new music?  What's the point of releasing this when we all know that Sony is going to release at least 1 or 2 \\"new\\" MJ albums every year until the end of time?    I appreciate that all his old material has been remastered, but it's just not worth adding this to your collection right now.    I think I'll wait and see if a huge all-encompassing Box Set for MJ is ever released.  *sigh*  I don't expect to ever see a box set, though.  Shame on the record labels releasing such crap as this Michael Jackson CD to the public.  No wonder album sales are dropping so dramatically.

B00007KMOX|5.0|Great technical arrangements by conductor and emotional delivery by musicians. One of the best. Sound quality is very good.
0141439475|1.0|It's been almost 30 years since I've detested a book this much. I didn't think anything could be worse then Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\". Seems I'm never too old to be wrong. This time, I don't have the excuse that I was forced to read this for high school lit. class. Oh no, this time I read this of my own volition and for fun. Yeah, fun. Kinda like sticking bamboo shoots between my fingernails type of fun. Watching paint dry fun. Going to an Air Supply concert fun.<br /><br />OK, to be fair, I need to tell you what I liked about this....<br /><br />Well, Mary Shelley was a teen when she wrote this. Color me impressed. At 19 I was just looking for my next college boyfriend, not penning the great English classic. Kudos to Mary for that.<br /><br />Otherwise, I can't think of anything to admire in this book, apart from the fact that it's the only book in my reading history where I actually noted EVERY SINGLE PAGE NUMBER and mentally counted down the time I'd be finished.<br /><br />Why did I persist, you may ask? Well, at the point where the pain became mind numbing, I decided to channel my inner John McCain and just survive the torture. Figured it would make me a better, stronger reader. Might even make me enjoy a re-read of Breaking Dawn....(well, no it wouldn't, but you get the idea).<br /><br />Frankenstein is a classic alright. A classic melodrama. Complete with a wimpy, vaporish, trembling prima donna main character and a pseudo monster whose only sin is being uglier then Bernie Madoff in cell block D. After the upteenth tremble/jerk/gasp/faint/start from our mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, I could only sign in relief that he wasn't a Rabbi about to perform a bris circumcism - oy vey!<br /><br />Were we supposed to be outraged at the monster's killing spree? By the books end, I was merely miffed that the creature murdered the wrong Frankenstein sibling. He would have saved himself a good deal of traveling (and saved me a good deal of suffering) had he snuffed out his \\"maker\\" before he could high-tail it out of the \\"birthing room\\".<br /><br />I'm sure that the fans of this book will say that I didn't understand the deeper, symbolic nuances of this book, and I'm sure that they are right. At this point in my life, all I know is what I like and don't like in a book, and as far as I'm concerned, this book is unadulterated, mind-numbing crap. But that's just me. Your mileage will vary!<br /><br />In conclusion, despite what I've written, I am glad I read this. I've been looking for a better punishment for my 14-soon-to-be-15 year old, and now I can easily say, when she gets sassy and goes all teenage-postal, that she is grounded for a week AND must read and write a report on Shelley's Frankenstein.....that ought to keep her on the straight and narrow until she leaves for college!it out of the \\"birthing room\\".

1558908382|3.0|As you can see by the picture of the product it doesn't clearly say Widescreen.  somewhere in the print in the descriptions on the page wide screen was slipped in and when I received my DVD VERY CLEARLY on the front of the DVD Case is printed WIDE SCREEN in Huge letters.  Unfortunately I didn't want wide screen as I can't stand watching DVD's that are enveloped but that is what I got.  So Be VERY Very CAREFUL to make sure you get what you want.  Other than that all I can say is that it came to me in pristine contition.

B002NPUCP8|4.0|Ori's new CD \\"Believe\\" is worth every penny! She has incredible guitar skills, an amazing voice, and a broad range of appeal. If you like pop, rock, or country, you'll like BELIEVE. BELIEVE leans more toward pop than her first CD \\"Violet Journey\\", but has something for everyone. While I would have liked more latin and blues flavors on BELIEVE, the label was going more for the pop audience- and that's fine. Her first CD, Violet Journey, gets 5 stars because it is one of the best albums ever made- it makes the hair on my neck stand up! It is ALL Orianthi- vocals, guitar, drums, production- she put every ounce of her soul into it without compromise because Ori produced it! Buy both CDs- they're that good!
1558908323|3.0|When Mira Sorvino and some other irresponsible scientists get together to mutate/mate a cockroach with a praying mantis, they create a Judas cockroach, and the results are bloodthirsty, eight-foot tall beasts that can make themselves look like tall, gray men in trench-coats, or every other drunk flasher typically found in the New York subway.  Somehow the Judas evolves to mimic its predator (i.e. humans), which is natural considering there isn't a person alive who doesn't enjoy stomping bugs (Would you like to know more?).<br /><br />To be quite honest, this movie is not all that interesting, scary, or appealing.  If there is going to be a movie about massive bugs or animals, I'd rather it be a cheesier, B-level version like [[ASIN:B00000JN2O Mosquito]], [[ASIN:0792846885 Frogs]], or [[ASIN:B00004Y6A5 Slugs]].<br /><br />The production values are there and the musical score is actually quite impressive, at times it's even foreboding.  The pacing and lighting are excellent as well.  In fact, the fear created in this movie is done solely through claustrophobia and the dark, because it sure doesn't come from elsewhere.  It's just that the idea of giant, genetically altered cockroaches is so ridiculous, and Sorvino's acting is so unconvincing, that the entire movie needs an economy sized gallon of Raid from Sam's Club.  The emotional investment is completely lacking, and I found myself actually rooting for the cockroaches.  F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin no doubt want to exterminate this from their IMDB page.  Charles S. Dutton, on the other hand, should proudly put this on his resume, because he murders every scene.<br /><br />Unless you want to subject yourself to a bad Alien rip-off with a predictably moronic ending and a heavy handed \\"don't play God\\" message mixed with some garbage, pseudo-science about pheromones, I suggest you skip this and watch a better \\"people battle giant cockroaches\\" movie in [[ASIN:B000OVLBHG Starship Troopers]].
B001U7B4T8|1.0|I don't know, maybe there are rights issues with some of the performances that keep the suits from releasing the entire concert.  OK, I can deal with that.  But if one Eric Clapton song can be included, there must not be a rights issue.  So why did they leave off what I consider to be the finest cover of a Dylan song in the history of Dylan music.  Clapton's cover of \\"Don't think twice, It's all right\\" is a masterpiece.  Clapton takes a pretty good folk song and turns it into an stunning blues song. I will never buy this DVD.  I will watch my VHS copy until the oxide falls off.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|When a movie basically starts off with a writer retiring to a remote cabin, and one of the first things she does there on her first visit is skinny dip, you know you are watching 70s horror.  When the entirety of the remaining minutes fall into the categories of gruesome rape or brutal revenge for the rape, then you know you're watching the controversial classic, [[ASIN:B000009O8A I Spit on Your Grave]].<br /><br />Director Meir Zarchi's produced this assault on human decency in the late 70s, and it's as resonant now as it was then.  Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton) secludes herself to a small wooded Connecticut town to write her newest novel.  When she attracts the attention of a few local deviants and their retarded friend, however, she ends up with a life altering experience that dwarfs any possible story she could write.  When she plans her revenge, however, the story, specifically the second most disgusting bathtub scene in cinema history (the first is with a naked Kathy Bates), celebrates revenge that knows no boundaries.<br /><br />From beginning to end, this movie transfixes the viewer with an indelible image of betrayal, rape, and revenge that is seared into memory.  Seeing a group of four men, one of which is mentally handicapped, brutalize an innocent women multiple times - all with a harmonica performance from one of the criminals - is something that never leaves one's memory; and I'm surprised the harmonica in this movie is not compared to the infamous banjo in Deliverance.<br /><br />It's quite interesting that multiple decades after this film, the Western audience has made a movement - good or bad is up for interpretation - making the type of depravity seen in the current torture porn flicks acceptable to view, even on prime time television, yet the filming of a rape is still considered taboo and unwatchable.  The reluctance to air this film, despite the ever-widening audience toleration, truly displays how gruesome and memorable this groundbreaking exploitation film was when released.  Zarchi explains in the commentary that this not about celebrating a crime and inspiring the sick minded.  He wanted to expose the sheer disgust that should be associated with rape, to break the boundaries of tolerance, to disturb all but the sociopath.  Given this film's legacy, I'd say Zarchi succeeded in his quest.<br /><br />This is the pinnacle of the rape/revenge genre, and should be watched by fans of both horror and overall cinema history...just don't expect to feel good when the credits roll.released.

B002OB9KPE|5.0|I pre-ordered the CD and was thrilled when I received an email saying it had shipped. Any prog-rock fan will love this CD. The mix and production are excellent. The music takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. It is well written and moving. And the musicians, what can you say, 4 of the best. I just hope they don't wait another 10 years for the next release. However, I will enjoy this one for a looooong time.
0205313426|5.0|I was told about this textbook some time ago.Because its revised edition dated from 1935 with following editions in 1959 and 1972 I became intrigued about the quality of this book.Finally after having tried other textbooks for the same purpouse of learning the language and following recommendation from my daughter who teaches English as a second language in Colombia,South America I purchased a copy.I am delighted with this book and I will get more copies for my grandchildren now in school.It will make a perfect Xmas present and a valuable addition to their studies.
0385504225|5.0|Good job, Dan Brown! I know you put a lot of thought into this book, and I appreciate it! I was hooked all the way through. And there were plenty of hooks! You did a good job of walking several tightropes when writing this book. You treated the Masons, Religions, Searchers of Deeper Meanings, smart readers, and not-so-smart readers equally well. And once again, you've educated me in areas in which I've been ignorant, or too casually informed. Thanks for an exciting read!
B000JLSM00|5.0|This is the best John Wayne John Ford!  If I had a son I would have named him Ethan Edwards.  Each time I watch this classic I see more definition in the characters...their prejudices, their motivations are fascinating.  The movie was casted perfect without exception.  The Blu-ray version is an absolute must, it makes you feel like you could just walk into the screen.  I envy people who have never experienced this movie.
0312330537|5.0|When the first person told me to read Shantaram I ignored it.  When the second person told me how great it was I kept it in mind.<br /><br />It wasn't until I went scuba diving in Sydney Australia and was told a third time by a guy over beer and chips that I decided I have to read this book.<br /><br />I bought it for $35 Australian Dollars, which is a lot.  But it was worth every penny.  Shantaram is the best book I've ever read, and sadly it may be the best book I'll ever read.  Nothing else compares to this book.  Nothing.<br /><br />I'm tell you three times, read Shantaram.  It is a MUST.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|Much better drum and bass sound than the original. But like many other people, could not see the point of the edits. I would love to hear the whole concert unedited but alas never will. Celebration Day which was one of the best songs on the original along with No Quarter has been butchered as has the latter. The second solo is all over the place and obviously a cut and paste job.<br /><br />Rainsong is great as is The Song Remains The Same and The Ocean sounded really good. But the sound has been cleaned up too much. Lots of the crowd noise and interaction with the band is gone. I mean it is supposed to be a live disc ! I don't really know what Page was trying to achieve. People liked the original for it's roughness even though the performance overall was not one of their best as even the band admitted but it was an honest live record. I am glad I didn't get rid of the original, ordinary sound and all ! Great band but weird release. Oh well...............
B00000IZOR|4.0|I bought this at a local clsoeout store chain in the NYC/Northern NJ area, which allowed me to get it for $4.99.  Fisher Price, even their lower end toys, can usually be counted on for durability.  The main reason to purchase this was I had the earlier model when I was a child in the 1970s.  I loved it and I thought my son would too. Of course the one I had was wood or something stronger than the plastic model of today.<br /><br />Be careful with the cord.  I'm assuming it is long for older kids who are walking already.<br /><br />While we don't have rotary phones today, it is still fun for pretend play.  The kids will alos excercise their finger dexterity by dialing.<br /><br />I recommend the toy, even at $10, but I'm sure glad I paid half.
B002TC9TEA|5.0|I received this dvd- blu ray disc set as a gift..  The quality is superb.  The content is so clear and crisp.  I did not remember the whole Snow White story and now I have this classic in the best high quality edition ever made..

031606792X|5.0|People, this is a book for teens. I am nearly 60 so definitely no teen.  This is a great story and had no other option in an ending.  If you want dark endings, read Ann Rice or Chelsea Quinn Yarbro (which I do).  If you want blood and guts, read the other vampire stories out there...there a gobs.  This is a really good story written in a refreshingly clean style.  Loved it.
0385341008|5.0|Several years ago my husband and I met two dear women from the Isle of Guernsey<br />at a Peace Conference in Caux, Switzerland.

B0024FAG6M|5.0|Twice in the theater in 1969. Had to wait 20 years for the VHS,then the first DVD, then the 35th Anniversary Edition, and now this SUPERIOR Blu Ray version. Oh, and THIS film is why I invested in a Blu Ray player. Soundtrack...only twice. Original vinyl and the CD. Also have the paperback screenplay from 1969, and of course, a few remaining original posters. The detail of Peter Fonda's face and leather jacket...the metallic paint in that beautiful bike of his...wow, glad I lived long enough to have seen this. I recommend HIGHLY.
B002MW50KO|1.0|We have never laughed so hard at a Christmas CD!  It sounds like karaoke at a nursing home (or bar).  Or a choir with one bad lead singer.  I am glad I bought this CD only because it made me laugh so hard I cried.  The music is beautiful, but unfortunately Bob's voice sounds terrible and cracks a lot.  Good luck making it through all of the songs without rolling on the floor!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is sad or lonely this Christmas and needs to be cheered up.  I'm sure we will play it in our car when we drive around viewing Christmas decorations. This definitely makes a joyful noise.
B0016NF06O|3.0|This album had me guessing what would be heard before I bought it..I am well versed in New Orleans music styles having played a lot of it in various jazz bands for years..I play the trombone..       The phrasing was ok..the instrumental licks were ok..Willie can read with the best of them...Put it all together and I expected more from Wynton..I recognise him to be a genius. I have seen him play, have listened to his many music shows on XM radio, have watched many specials that he has dome on tv..but I missed the point of the exercise here. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but maybe I expected Wynton to hit a little harder. His band preformed as expected..great Dixieland  point counterpoint..good solos..good phrasing. If only Wynton had gone a little deeper into his bottomless bag of musical knowledge and opened up more. Willie dosen't need any introduction..He carried the ball with flair and style..I hope he plays for another 100 years.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|A brilliant film for the time it was made. A milestone film for its time.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Nothing personal, though I didn't like Pierce Bronson, the four James Bond films with has James Bond 007 are as bland as the Timothy Dalton and Roger Moore films.  All three of these previous James Bond actors had films that never really amounted to much and sorry to say were always forgettable (with the exception of \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\")  Daniel Craig brings back the magic that Sean Connery originally sparked in these films and the choice of the studio to use the very first Ian Flemming book for Daniel Craig's debut greatly helps make you believe that he could have been James Bond before Sean Connery was (in move time line logic).  Quantum of Solace is a different story all together (kind of weak for a follow up).  But in both Daniel Craig proves he deserves to be called Bond...James Bond (with a license to kill and thrill)
B002KSPKRS|4.0|These headphones sound okay and the illusion of surround sound is pretty good. There's no \\"balance\\" adjustment, so if you have hearing loss in one ear, like me, you'll have to purchase an extra set of wired headphones with a balance knob and plug them into the auxiliary port. I don't use the microphone much while on XBox live, but it seems harder to understand other people's chatting with these headphones than with the standard XBox 360 communicator headset. If you have a TV with a USB port (mine has a USB port for the repair man) you can ignore the setup instructions and power this unit while watching TV and not have to turn on your XBox 360 (you'll also need to connect to the TV's audio optical output, but you won't need to buy the special XBox 360 midget audio cable.) This setup also allows for using the PS3's surround sound instead of following the instructions which tell you to connect other devices via stereo cables and letting the X41 remap the surround sound. The instructions say that the X41 is capable of receiving Dolby Pro Logic IIx 7.1 surround, but I have yet to see any game, DVD, Blu-ray, or TV show with the Pro Logic IIx sound track, so the best you can get out of these phones, for now, is 5.1 surround enhanced to mimic 7.1.

B002LK3DUQ|5.0|My family and I are HUGE disney fans and when it comes to the animated films, we've pretty much seen them all. The problem is that as of late, with some exceptions including Bridge To Terabithia, the disney films have seemed to be lacking alot in what made them special to begin with. Up was able to bring back those heartfelt moments that had been gone for a fair amount time and for me, it was a complete throwback to movies like the little mermaid,tarzan and even the most depressing disney film, the fox and the hound, all of which had scenes of sadness,joy,family,loss...that are important for everyone to see and that bring the magic to us. I loved UP, I recommend it to everyone who's a disney fan or even if you're not, go out and buy it,rent, check it out at the library if you to because it's worth and it has quite a bunch of themes in it that you can talk about with your family once it's over.

When we saw this concert, we did not hesitate to purchase it. We saw the entire concert in one sitting despite the length of it, we just could not get up. What is so entertaining is the variety of talented singers and the varying genres of music. From Cheryl Lynn, to Andre Bocelli, to Stephanie Mc Phee to Josh Groban, from Brian Mc Knight to Boz Scaggs, from Blake Shelton to... well the list goes on and on and despite my personal opinion that I find Michael Buble in general, a bit dull, his performances at that concert were excellent. One of the highlights was the two songs literally belted out by the 14 year old Cherise. Such a resonant voice on such a little body is indeed unbelievable. The audio and video quality of the production is flawless. This DVD will surely be replayed time and time again.
0140620303|2.0|I did not enjoy this book. I should have and probably would have if I hadn't seen so many Frankenstein movies. I knew that the movies veered pretty far from the actual plot of the book, but still expected something more. While the book was probably very scary and very controversial in 1818, it didn't really translate through the centuries. At least for me it didn't. I rated this book based more for being a horror classic and for basically inventing the creature feature horror genre and less on actual entertainment and merit.
0061537934|5.0|I bought this book looking for an easy read to take on vacation. I found myself not wanting to put it down and giving me a higher appreciation for my pet. It has made me wonder what my pup is really thinking when he looks at me with his loving, big brown eyes. I've let a few friends borrow this book and now they want copies of their own to read it again!
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I had seen the 1993 concert when it originally aired on HBO and was thrilled it finally became available on DVD.  This was the last live concert with Streisand's voice at it's peak.  Sorry it was edited, however.  Equally thrilling was the insert of The Making of The Broadway Album.  I have this on VHS and now can enjoy it on DVD.  Geffen and Pollack's reaction to standing near Streisand in the studio as she belts out Putting It Together is priceless.  What a treat!
B000BJS4TO|4.0|This soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. I watched the Special Features on the DVD and John Williams had said that one of the reasons why he wanted to do it was for a challenge. I think he met and surpassed it.  It really captures the mood of the movie for me.       One complaint though, I was hoping the \\"Winter\\" or \\"Snow\\" dance music would be included.  Other than that I loved it.
0810983915|4.0|Greg is back and as obnoxious than ever. Though this is not as funny as the original it is the second best in the series. His older brother plays less of a role here, which is good, but Greg's best friend Rowley is here--and he of course is the wimpiest of kids. This is good stuff. (There's even a thinly veiled swipe at Family Circus, which is also very funny!).
0743454537|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  The characters are easy to relate to and the story was very moving.
B000089RV6|2.0|I'm sorry, but I fail to see the praise and accolades that this album (and band, for that matter) constantly receive.  There is no musical ingenuity, nor is there lyrical ingenuity.  The entire album is centered around three chords, a guitar solo, some lyrics about sex and rock 'n' roll, and....that's it.  While technically Angus Young is an excellent guitarist, he has no creativity when writing riffs or solos.  And Brian Johnson just can't stop singing about sex in the most mundane fashion possible.  For ten songs, he can't come up with one couplet that is anything but unimaginative.    Now, I did give the album two stars, because I obviously realize it's an Important Album In Rock And Roll History and all that.  And Angus Young does turn out some pretty catchy licks with \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\".  But overall, the album is just plain tedious.  It is AC/DC's best album though, which isn't saying much.  I mean, the guys released a song entitled: \\"Mistress For Christmas\\".      Ultimately, the album falls into the category of mindless hard rock.  Look, I enjoy rock and roll as much as anyone, and I do realize the album's significance as one of the top selling albums of all time.  But, quite frankly, it does not deserve the status it has attained.  Aerosmith, for God's sake, was able to come up with more interesting music than this.  And it's not like I'm trying to sound like some musical snob by deriding the album for using (largely) three chords, I'm one of the biggest punk fans you can find.  But on this album, the music sounds tiresome, bloated, and uninspired.  This band is regressive in every way possible.
0385504225|4.0|This book combines all of the elements of his other books in a new setting and with mostly new versions of secret societies and ancient symbols and architecture designed with hidden meanings targeted for those in the know. Dan Brown uses the same techniques to keep you reading and these work well as the book went quickly for me without any lags in interest. Professor Langdon with his eidetic memory and exhaustive knowledge on ancient symbols makes a heroic appearance once again and finds himself pitted against a very crafty villain willing to use the greatest evil towards his ends. The setting is Washington, DC and there is interesting information about the city throughout. Dan Brown tries to touch on major philosophical issues such as the soul and life after death and his reach might be a little too broad. Maybe he should save some of these themes for another book. The only criticism (a mild one) is that I kept wondering how in the world the villain could pose a grave national threat or an international one. When the reasons came out I can't say I was particularly convinced. All in all this is great entertainment though.[[ASIN:1931391912 The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)]]
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Fringe...what can I say.  How about: The greatest television program that I've had the pleasure to watch in my short 42 years of life.  It is reminiscent of X-Files, but so much better...completely up to date, let's say.  All of the main characters are compelling, the storyline and writing are beyond first class, production values are top-notch - and you get to see it all in glorious HD!  Seriously, I can't wait until Season 2 is available to purchase...I'll be getting it right away!  How rare and special it is that a televison program speaks to those with something going on \\"upstairs\\".  I only worry that may be its undoing...hopefully the program is reaching its demographic and will continue for many more seasons!
0385751893|5.0|Fast Shipping, Easy payment...I mistakenly ordered this same book on the very same day from a different seller, not through Amazon, and received it a whole week later!
B00006AUIG|1.0|I can't believe how many people think this is a five-star scary movie. Too tedious to be a \\"thriller\\" and sooo boring there's just no chance for  suspense. The eeriest parts of the film are actually in the deleted scenes, where it appears as if a scary movie had actually been made and then re-shot with the creepyness (and plot)  removed.  Even the \\"star\\" of the film, the Danvers Asylum itself, has it's potential as a dire and forboding edifice watered down by showing exteriors shot on a beauitful, sunny day.  Some say the director was being 'ironic\\". Irony is not scary.  Neither is Session 9.
B001H122N4|5.0|A great setting and a great concert. A little heavy on the fog machine sometimes but outstanding musically. David Gilmore's guitar mastery and vocals are at the top of the game. A couple of nice surprises in the CDs as well.
B001JNNE64|5.0|I won't recap the movie itself, there is already plenty of that around.  If you don't know the story yet definitely check it out, if you do know the story and have seen it then that's not what you're reading this for.    This blu-ray set is outstanding in every way.  The short book/blu-ray combo is a great way to combine a dvd and a great tangible extra as well as eliminate that unnecessary plastic DVD/BR case waste.  The quality of, and material in the booklet is great.  And the remastering of both the sound and of the video in this blu-ray is absolutely outstanding, you really get to see the quality and benefits of blu-ray with this disk.
0740785508|5.0|[[VIDEOID:38904521]]If you are a regular reader of James Gurney's blog, Gurney Journey, you would expect nothing less. This book is as good as I expected. He dispenses his knowledge as freely as he does on his blog. Here's what he says about his own book from the introduction:<br /><br />\\"This is not a book about figure drawing, anatomy, or perspective. It's not a step-by-step guide on how to draw dinosaurs. It's also not a recipe book for a particular paint technique, although all these topics are addressed in passing. What this book contains is a distillation of the time-tested methods that I've found to be most helpful for achieving realism in imaginative pictures.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't got the hint from the title, this book is about making your art real and believable. In every chapter, James Gurney shares with us what he learned when creating his paintings. There are topics on people, dinosaurs, architecture, vehicles, composition and his step-by-steps (not techniques but process). The tips he gives can be applied on other subjects as well.<br /><br />The importance of research is emphasized and the amount of research he does really shows. While creating an illustration on ship wreckage for National Geographic, he talked to survivors to get an accurate account. He found out there's a drummer boy who used his drum as a float and drew that in. He also acted out the various poses of sailors in distress, rather than drawing them from imagination. The result is a painting that tells its story convincingly. The same goes for many of his other paintings.<br /><br />Another interesting read is the story of him trying to design a Dinotopian fire engine. When he presented his concept art to a professional fire engine designer, it was critiqued to have form but not function. There's lack of heat protection for the dinosaur, lack of understanding on how water hose works and a complicated water pump design. The revised concept is a huge improvement in believability that I thought it actually might work.<br /><br />He has provided lots of photos and his own work in the book. You'll get to see how he stages the props for reference, sketches and drafts, plenty of commissioned work (especially from National Geographic), the bird on his shoulder while he's drawing, the lousy-art incinerator he created from mirrors and other entertaining stuff.<br /><br />Imaginative Realism is an enlightening and fun read. Highly recommended to professionals, beginning art students and those who wish to push their art to the next level in terms of depth.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)rk.    He has provided lots of photos and his own work in the book.

0451529065|5.0|The original book by Charles Darwin is a classic that should be on everyone's reading list. There are ample reviews here which address it, praise it, and I am completely in agreement with them. Darwin's Origin of Species is a true masterpiece.    Unfortunately, this review is to help readers/buyers realize that there is a 'vandalized' version which has been published, and to tell you how to avoid it and get the real thing.    To explain; there is yet another edition also called \\"The Origin of Species, 150th Anniversary Edition\\", put out by Christian Fundamentalist Ray Comfort in an attempt to discredit evolutionary theory and Charles Darwin, and it has some extra 50 pages of unintelligible drivel about creationism, as well as having ABRIDGED Darwin's original text. If you want to read about creationism, find another book... if you want the facts, read ALL of what Darwin has to say, and please don't give any money to Comfort by accidentally buying his ABRIDGED version.     Note that he used the EXACT same name as the 'real' anniversary edition -- \\"The Origin Of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition by Charles Darwin\\". You can easily tell which version you're getting by who wrote the introduction - go with Julian Huxley, NOT Ray Comfort, and you'll have the correct and complete version.    Also, note that Amazon reviews are mixed between the books (normally not a problem at all) - I hope they are straightening this out, but currently that's not the case. Sadly, the negative reviews of the Comfort version are bringing down the rating of the 'good/real' book.     Sorry to have to write about the 'drama', but I'm sure you want to know that you have ordered the correct book, and I know you'll love it.     Enjoy.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Very happy with my dvd; service was just great; wouldn't hesitate to shop for more products.  Have always had good luck with Amazon.
0385504225|2.0|Let me start by saying I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code. The subject matter was thought provoking, and caused a few ruffles in religious circles. I enjoyed Angels and Demons just as much (I read them backwards...wasn't really aware of Angels and Demons until after I read the Da Vinci Code).    I think the Dan Brown streak has ended with The Lost Symbol. The subject matter just isn't exciting enough for a page-turning type of book. It just isn't. I'm not going to give away any of the plot or \\"secrets' here, but take my word for it, it just doesn't satisfy. The only reason I read it to the end is because I was hoping for something more. And I didn't get the satisfactory ending I was hoping for. I was kind of expecting it might not be all it was cracked up to be, so I took the book out from the library (don't ask me how I got it the first week....I didn't reserve it, and walked in that week and was able to take it out).    I recommend doing this so you don't waste your money. I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't take it seriously. I'm not a \\"basher\\" of books; if I like it, I will say so. But this one was hard to swallow. Proceed with caution!
B001C4CI8A|5.0|Leonardo Dicaprio has quickly become one of my favorite actors because of movies like Body of Lies.  The story was powerful and I really had compassion for the characters by the end of the film, this was a great movie.
B000P6XU5G|4.0|This BluRay edition of Rio Bravo gives you so much more realism.  The great individual characters are appreciated much more because the depth of their performance is seen more clearly (facial expressions, etc.).  This is a great fun Howard Hawks - John Wayne western with a spectacular cast of supporting players, with the possible exception of Ricky Nelson, who actually does an OK job.  Once you know that his part ('Colorado') was considered for Elvis Presley (Elvis had joined the army and was stationed in Germany by the time filming began) and that Montgomery Clift turned down the same role; you're left  wondering, \\"What if...\\".  Color, picture, and sound are excellent in this edition.

6305736650|5.0|If you enjoy Bogart films, then you will love this, it is the 4th Bogart film I have seen & I truly enjoyed it. Buy it on blu-ray as the audio is pretty bad on DVD, mind you though I don't know if the Blu-ray is better. It helps if your home theater receiver has a mono film track setting.
1419830619|5.0|I love the series and just started to purchase the season and I was lucky enough to find it on Amazon at a really good price.  All the shows that I have watched so far are great.  However, in watching the show all the time I can see how the Winchester boys have greatly inproved their hunting skills.
0061703257|3.0|This is a very atmospheric period thriller, and, as far as language and style are concerned, it's certainly way above 80% of what finds its way onto the bestseller lists. However, if you know there's a surprise ending (and you do if you've read the review excerpts on the first few pages), then said ending unfortunately doesn't come as much of a shock but is rather predictable. Still, well worth reading. The trailer of the upcoming film adaptation by the way makes it look like a horror story, which the book certainly is not.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|To me this movie is by far the best of all the X-Men movies. I love the character Wolverine and this movie shows a bit more of who he is and how his abilities came about.  Also, the action in it is the best.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|The general perception of 70's prog-rock is that of a lumbering behemoth, staggering drunkenly across the land and spewing painfully \\"literate\\" lyrics.  \\"Red\\" is the antithesis of this notion.  The instrumentation is relatively spare, giving the players lots of room to do their worst.  The songs themselves are raw and melancholy, with a production style to match.  \\"Red\\" delivers extreme musicianship, without all the heady mysticism associated with prog.
B001VPJZCC|3.0|3 of 5 stars for the comedy movie Death Becomes Her. How can you not like a movie where Goldie Hawn walks around with a shotgun made hole thru her tummy--yep, you can see right through it. Oh, and when she sits down on a couch and the long wooden handle from a tool pokes right thru. This is a star packed movie (Willis, Hawn, Streep and Caine). The story line is that Hawn & Streep want to drink a \\"foutain-of-youth\\" potion (from Isabelle Rossellini). They both need Willis to do \\"make-up\\" and body repairs. Ultimately the girls decide the Willis needs to live forever also to continue taking care of them. Well, Willis has other ideas. This is a well written movie. Well acted and richly photographed. Funny and worth watching!
0634089358|4.0|All I can say is that if you are getting started, et this book. Remembering that the Blues are the basis for many other styles I would almost say this book is Essential for your library.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I'm so getting this movie! After I saw it a coupe of times, I realized I have to own it :) It's about a cute boy, his cute crush and their story. It's about becoming a man and staying true to yourself. It's about dreams, failures, hopes and that trip called LIFE. The movie is that much more adorable because it was a true story, based on the writer's love :)

Now , more then 30 years went away but to see and listen who was one of the most important progressive rock band , is always a big pleasure , even if it's only on a dvd .  Here , the musicians play really with a big transport  .  Finally , a good concert and a good DVD .  Bye bye  Giovanni - Rome
B002MW50KO|4.0|I like Dylan's Christmas album a lot.  I wouldn't argue that this is one of Bob's greatest albums -- it's certainly no Blood on the Tracks or Highway 61 -- but I think it sounds pretty darn good, although I'll admit to being a sucker for most Christmas music.  I guess it's a matter of personal taste.    I'm not at all surprised that Bob did a Christmas album -- it seems very likely that he's listened to a lot of that stuff.  Everyone remembers the pop singers like Andy Williams who've recorded Christmas music, whom you might not imagine Bob listening to, but there's also a long history of old-time country, blues, jazz, and R&B holiday music -- Bob featured some of it on his own 2-hour XM Christmas show.  (Anyone interested in some unusual and amazing traditional blues, country, and international Xmas tunes -- check out \\"Where Will You Be Christmas Day?\\" from the Dust-to-Digital label.)    The Louvin Bros., Johnny Cash, Elvis, Charlie Parker, the Maddox Bros. & Rose, Al Jolson, the Everlys, the Staples, BB King, Miles Davis, Pete Seeger (and his half-siblings), Duke Ellington, and even Bessie Smith all recorded one or more Christmas songs or albums.  These are artists with whom Bob is undoubtedly familiar (and probably likes), and if I had my Christmas CD collection here, I could name dozens of others.      And let's not forget Bing Crosby, the Voice of Christmas.  Bob's recent Modern Times album shows very strong influences of Crosby (with Bob actually re-writing some of Bing's 30s hits), so I'd guess that Dylan not only grew up hearing Bing, but has listened to him a lot since then, including his large Christmas catalog.  Is it any surprise that Bob would follow Bing into the Christmas genre?    Then there are Bob's musical contemporaries, like Chuck Berry, the Beatles (together and individually), Aretha Franklin, Phil Spector, Booker T & The MGs, Leon Redbone, and many others, all of whom have recorded Christmas tunes.    So it makes perfect sense to me that Bob is joining this long line of  musical artists in recording some Christmas music.  He obviously knows  the genre well and has melded the polished \\"traditional\\" holiday musical arrangements with his own style -- including some pedal steel guitar, accordian, and other elements of his recent recordings.  It sounds fine to me.    I kind of wonder if he was going for a sound like the Louvin Bros. Christmas album, which has polished arrangements that still have a strong country flavor.  I've always liked that album a great deal, and I think Bob has captured some of that sound.    One big difference, of course, is that Bob doesn't have the vocal purity that the Louvins did, so perhaps he would have done better in a rougher style, drawing more on blues-, country-, and R&B-based Christmas songs (including the Louvins' own holiday song \\"It's Christmas Time\\"), rather than holiday standards.  One possible alternative model might have been Ben Keith's Christmas album \\"Seven Gates,\\" which had less polished but well-played arrangements and featured guests like Neil Young and Johnny Cash (not that I would have wanted one of those cheesy \\"guest star\\" albums -- which Ben's is not).  Ben, who is a longtime steel guitarist for Young, did include well known Christmas standards on his album (overlapping some with Bob's selections), but he also used some less known holiday songs, and the arrangements give them all a consistent style that works well, in my opinion.  Bob has done something similarly successful.    Christmas songs can be hard to do right unless the artist chooses the right songs and right arrangements for his/her personal style.  So I understand that some folks might not go for this album, esp. those who don't think Bob should record other songwriters' tunes or those who don't like the more polished arrangements of much holiday fare.  But I like holiday standards, and I like unusual versions of those songs in unexpected styles -- and that's what Bob has given us.  (Plus I actually wrote to Bob's XM Radio e-mail address about a year ago to suggest that he record a Xmas record -- no kidding.  I'm absolutely sure that I had nothing to do with him doing so, but even if not, he gave me what I wanted.)    And it's very, very cool that he's donating the proceeds to charity that feeds the hungry.  Maybe he's emulating Dickens now, as well as the old bluesmen.    Good job, Bob, and Merry Christmas.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I normally do not care for this type of show but this is an exception. It has drama, comedy, and action, and great chemisty between the actors. It is very nice to sit down and enjoy a show and actually look forward to the next one.
6301174240|4.0|I had this VHS tape years ago and it was part of a family tradition to show it on a regular basis and to all who enter our home. Then it was lost...and I've been trying to replace it for a while. It has been wonderful to view this awesome synopsis of Michael Jackson's life, again. We love it and always will!! The tape came exactly as described and plays as well as any other VHS tape  :-)    Thanks!
B001MS7IBS|3.0|I won't comment on the show, which is amazing, ot the picture/sound quality, (both outstanding, especially picture quality).<br /><br />I only want to complain about the edition Warner Bros. has put together. On the official Warner Bros. site, they mention this Bluray features the following languages:<br /><br />Subtitle Languages: Danish<br />Subtitle Languages: Dutch<br />Subtitle Languages: Finnish<br />Subtitle Languages: French<br />Subtitle Languages: German<br />Subtitle Languages: Japanese<br />Subtitle Languages: Norwegian<br />Subtitle Languages: Spanish<br />Subtitle Languages: Swedish<br /><br />This is plain WRONG, it only contains ENGLISH subtitles. This is annoying indeed, because I bought this on Amazon.com based on that info, which SHOULD BE RIGHT, because it's the OFFICIAL SITE. Why they left all the subs out on the Bluray, I cannot imagine. Apparently, the DVD does include some subtitles (as specified on the back cover of the set; check the scan on the Frige DVD page here on Amazon[[ASIN:B001C4CI8U Fringe: The Complete First Season]]):<br /><br />Subtitle Languages: French<br />Subtitle Languages: Portuguese<br />Subtitle Languages: Spanish<br />Subtitle Languages: Thai<br /><br />So, subtitles on DVD, none but English on the Bluray. Disappointing and annoying.
1593974744|5.0|Long time fan of Ender's Game, I was delighted to get this audio production.  The voice talent was spot on.  Stefan Rudnicki and cast capture the pain, the stress, the struggle through voice.  They tell the tale so well that it added a depth to an already outstanding story that I didn't think was possible.
0446618306|4.0|I am not a a romance reader. I have never liked the plots or stories of romance novels. I got this book b/c I saw a preview of the movie on the internet. I liked his past movies but never really read the books, even though people kept telling me i should. I wanted to start with something different from him and I figured I start with this one. I really enjoyed this book. I realized at times I was mad at Savannah for her personality but then again I guess I know what it is like to have to deal with someone who is far away. Being a military child I have seen so many couples go through all kinds of stuff. My mother is a lifer and my father had retired both from the army. So I have seen my parents leave at times and sit there and wonder when they will come back. Or when they are home dreading the phone call that will send them aaway. It takes a strong person to be able to wait for that person to come home. Some people don't have it in them. None the less, it was a moving story and I cried at the saddness of it and at the joy of the understanding that John learned, not only about his father but from his life in the military and in love. I guess I kind of filled in the gaps b/c I remember what it was like to see people you love and care about leave for long periods of time and watching and helping the ones that are left behind.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|If you're going to buy this album, you MUST buy this 2-CD edition.  This is truly one of those rare times where the extra songs meet or exceed the songs that were included on the \\"real\\" album.  Fuehre Mich and Donaukinder are both classic Rammstein, Halt is also very good.  The other two songs are the only true \\"extras,\\" being alternate versions of Roter Sand (the first being an \\"orchestral version\\" with the same lyrics, and the second having completely different lyrics), though these too are not throwaways.    Ironically, the absolute worst track on the album (and really the only just plain bad one) is the first single, Pussy.  When I heard it streaming on its launch date, I honestly thought, \\"Oh, great.  Rammstein have just completely given up even trying.\\"  Just a really, really bad song, musically and lyrically.  They could have improved the main album immeasurably by replacing it with any of the extra tracks.  It's like they painted the Mona Lisa and then said, \\"Nope, needs something... more.  How about throwing some bird droppings on there?\\"    Schneider's drums in particular have never sounded better, evidenced by any of the heavier songs (though especially Rammlied, Waidmanns Heil and the title track), but a real gem for me is the softer Fruehling in Paris; it's really quite straightforward, without much musical complexity or lyrical depth, yet nevertheless simply a very pretty, melodic and evocative song.    The main album gets 4.5 stars (\\"thanks\\" to Pussy), while the extra tracks bump it back up to a full five.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|I bought this album after hearing his hit 'Day and Night.'  The rest of the album is just as catchy, fun and playful.  It's also really different than all the other hip-hop out there. I highly recommend it.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|This two CD set showcases Michael Jackson's talent although it's not a true retrospective of his best hits--but then again it doesn't try to be that. Keep in mind that the tracks on the first CD are not new; but the remastering job is excellent. There are many highlights here anyway; and of course with a genius like Michael there's not a dud in the bunch!  The sound quality is awesome and I like the artwork as well. Another reviewer remarks that a lot of these songs have a message theme to them--and they are right. This makes this two CD set meaningful and it's a really special treat when you get disc two--there's nothing but rarities there!<br /><br />\\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" is one of my favorite MJ tunes; he does this with so much electricity it's bound to make up jump up and start dancing practically wherever you are! The beat is excellent and the music fits just right with Michael's vocals; this is one excellent number with which to start the album. \\"Jam\\" has incredible percussion and Michael does this wonderfully--and another good number would have to be \\"They Don't Care about Us.\\" What percussion--and those musical effects make this number powerful. Michael never skips a beat, either!<br /><br />Other terrific numbers include \\"Human Nature;\\" the remastered radio edit of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and the remastered \\"The Way You Make Me Feel.\\" \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is another one of my very favorite MJ tunes; he sings this faultlessly and it's just so clear that he's a masterful entertainer! The remastered single version of \\"Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground)\\" impresses me also.<br /><br />\\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat It\\" are two of Michael's best known masterpieces; I could never tire of hearing these songs as only Michael could perform them. The remastering job shines on \\"Black or White;\\" Michael delivers this with a lot of genuine energy and I love it! \\"Earth Song\\" is also wonderful; I predict you'll like this if for some reason you haven't heard this before. Listen also for two more stunners, \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror.\\" \\"This Is It\\" is very well done; Michael is squarely in the spotlight and this song is one of the best reasons to get this and add it to your collection! There's an orchestral version of \\"This Is It,\\" too.<br /><br />Of course, it's disc two has treats that we haven't heard too much of ever before. There are demos of \\"She's Out of My Life;\\" \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"Beat It.\\" \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" has a great guitar arrangement, too. These are worth more than the price of admission alone! The second CD ends with Michael reciting his poem entitled \\"Planet Earth.\\" \\"Planet Earth\\" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael whose excellent diction enhances this poem quite a lot.<br /><br />True MJ fans would do well to get this; the track set on the first CD is quite good and the remastering job is fantastic. The second CD is nothing short of excellent with those \\"goodies,\\" too. Even people just getting familiar with Michael Jackson's artistry would do well to add this two CD set to their collections.tunners, \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror.\\" \\"This Is It\\" is very well done; Michael is squarely in the spotlight and this song is one of the best reasons to get this and add it to your collection!

I bought the 2nd edition of the 'K&R' book back when it came out in the late 1980s and it still serves as a great C language reference. At the time I first read the book, I had already spent several years writing BASIC, Pascal and 8086 Assembly language. C language and the K&R book (and Borland's Turbo C) took my programming experience to another level.    The C and C++ languages remain popular today and are still used to write nearly all major operating systems, database products, game engines, etc. Even in an object-oriented world, it's good to know some fundamentals on a lower level. Of all the books I have seen and read on C language over the years, the K&R book is still king.

0307386171|3.0|This book  describes when times were innocent, how things were left unspoken and why people trudged on without clear understanding. Written in 2007  not 1957. When most women were still virgins when they wed.  They were frightened of their husbands on their wedding night!!!!!<br /><br />Such an old fashion story which doesn't seem to get anywhere. His other book ATONEMENT was excellent.  But this really should not have got to the printer should have stayed in draft stage.<br /><br />Ian McEwan writes very well but the subject matter this time was a failure. This story is just an OK.<br /><br />I bought this on audio.  CD1  1 star, CD2 2 stars, CD 3 & 4  3 stars.<br /><br />Ian McEwan himself narrated the story and he did a wonderful job of that.<br /><br />At the end of the audio there is an interview with the author and I enjoyed that more than the story.  I started to feel sorry for him he sounded so lovely in the interview and I wanted to give him a 2 star before I heard the interview. So  4 star for Narration  4 star for the interview.  average final stars are 3 star.<br /><br />Please don't waste your money on this audio,  go and buy ANTONEMENT instead far superior!!!
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown can write a good book.  He has proven this thrice now.  After two weak early efforts, he came back with a vengeance with Angels and Demons.  The Da Vinci Code followed and caught the public's imagination.  I thought the Code was a lesser book than Angels, but both were very good reads.  Symbol again shows a lesser effort.  Brown has found his audience, and they should be pleased with his latest work.  It has the imagery and faux historical provenance that made Da Vinci Code so readable.  Accept this as mind candy and you will enjoy the read.
B0029O08WA|2.0|I bought this Soundtrack online today and was eagerly awaiting the time to relax and listen to it. When the Twilight OST came out, it blew me away. Needless to say, I was expecting the New Moon OST to be HUGE. Well, it was a huge FAILURE.  Out of the 16 songs I only remotely liked 5. I didn't even finish listening to some of the songs, I had to skip them.  Maybe after seeing the movie and getting its mood I will be able to appreciate the OST but the song selection seems highly indie, and not in a good way. The songs don't work together and the sound is confusing. I sincerely hope the OST will grow on me after watching the movie.    I would advise anyone pondering on buying the OST to listen to the previews first and then buying it.

The DVD is great too because you can see what the singers look like and how passionate they about what they are singing - some songs are so beautifully done it brings tears to my eyes.  I wish \\"Hallelujah\\" were on the CD but for some reason they substituted a song that wasn't part of the DVD.  Still, it's a great CD!

I already owned the two towers on dvd befor buying the extended version, so I knew that the movie was good. It is even better now that I can watch it with the tons of scenes that were not included in the first realeses. I reccomend this dvd to anyone who wants the entended edition but not all of the extra features in the multidisk sets.  The only con I can think of, is that, the disk is double sided so you have to handle it carefully. Other than that, this is a really good deal.

The second disc has barely anything on it , they could have filled it with out-takes and other stuff from the past ... clearly a rush job , I expect a more definitive cd collection with rarities and remixes that never made the other albums will be available but this cd really has nothing to do with the movie ... not one track is from the actual rehearsals before his death..... they could have made the second cd the rehearsal while the first cd the masters and I would have been ok with that as well... but this is just a get something out there now disc and really brings nothing new other than the Paul Anka stuff.<br />I was expecting a little more from a two disc set.

B0000AI45P|4.0|Came across this band when discussion punk online. Somebody recommended this album, and I saw them listed on Australian Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 essential albums, from a few years back. Two positive recommendations in other words, and since I've lately been exploring punk, I thought I'd check it out. Have to say that I really struggle to see how this band/album get viewed as punk. Being cynical, I'd have to say that the bar is set very low for being labelled \\"punk\\"...I'm guessing that playing at the music venue \\"CBGB's\\" would suffice, sadly. Anyway, if you are buying this album expecting to hear some pioneering punk, I think you will be annoyed. Being kind, the vocals are mildly/vaguely punk in style. Don't really listen to any progressive forms of rock, but I think this album may qualify. Or maybe you could it, ironically, \\"post-punk\\" music. Why ironically? Because it was released in the year that punk exploded around the world, with The Sex Pistols and, earlier, The Damned, The Saints, Radio Birdman and The Ramones, of course.  Television seems post-punk before punk had even really started!       What to expect: mildly punk vocals, simple complexity of sound, alternative type pop/rock, wordy lyrics, squiggly melodies and simple riffs. Lyrics are poetic and literate for the most part. Songs can be epic pop/rock constructions, and you get a dual lead guitar formation. The cd has a crisp sound and the music is mostly mid-tempo. If this is really punk, it is of a bohemian sort. Vocals are strangled at times, but I do have to say that I found the drumming on the album interesting, as were the guitar work, which got varied. Initially, on first listen, I was looking to score this album 65/100, but on second listen I liked it better, so am giving it 70/100.          Best song:        Torn curtain - the lushest song on the cd and slightly gothic too. Runs 7 minutes long. Occasionally the guitar sounds like a distressed kitten, and the piano features as well.           Next best songs:        Guiding light - a mellow track with melodic lead guitar notes. Bassy, piano features. Pleasant track.     Little Johnny Jewel - the guitar sounds strangled in this track...highly tunes, perhaps, though I don't play any instruments. 7:09 running time. Quite jazzy at times. Has some of those poetic style lyrics I mentioned before.  Has a nice guitar solo.           The rest:        See no evil - has an AC/DC style mini-riff and Kylie Minogue's song \\"Clever girl\\" (I think that is the name of the song) is also brought to mind.  The other riff in the song brings to mind the kind of stuff Thin Lizzy does.  For some, this dual guitar thing could be catchy. One of the guitars sounds 'throaty' and the other guitar has a circular thing going.  In this opening track, the vocals sound a bit punk, and there is a not bad guitar solo in this song. Sound quality very good.    Venus - there's a harpsichord kind of sound on this song and I'm not sure if it's not created by a guitar, somehow. The lead guitar has notes that ring out. A wordy song with a nice mini-melody to it.     Friction - a bassy track which brings to mind Australian band The Ferrets' song \\"Don't fall in love\\" as far as the guitar bit in the intro and throughout goes. Drum solo outro, and vocally Television do to the word \\"diction\\" what The Sex Pistols do with the word \\"problem\\" or \\"vacant\\" in two of their songs from their debut album. I.e. make the word strange and sort of obscene!    Marquee moon - one of those songs with a squiggly lead guitar lick, which bookends the song. Runs at 10:47. The intro notes reminded me of Joan Armatrading's classic song \\"Me myself I\\". There is a simple rhythm guitar, and bass is noticeable. The middle part of the song is mostly an instrumental, with a 3 minute guitar solo in it. One part of the song is similar is Led Zeppelin's classic \\"Kashmir\\".      Elevation - bassy, nice note picking on the guitar (which has a nice tone to it) .  The guitar'stone and melody, at times, puts in mind \\"The break up song\\" by The Greg Kihn Band. Think my notes are saying that this song also has a guitar sound like a yowing cat, but tweaked or something (old notes, been a while since I listened to the album).     Prove it - nice bass guitar intro, 1960's style guitar lick...seems familiar, but I just can't place it. I like the drumming and the tone of the drums in this song.    See no evil - has a Thin Lizzy rhythm to it. Don't listen to Thin Lizzy, but they may have been another band with a dual lead guitar set up.        The cd I have has got a few bonus tracks on it. There are variations on three of the tracks on the original album, \\"Friction\\", \\"Marquee moon\\" and \\"See no evil\\", as well as an untitled instrumental. \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" is the last bonus track on this cd. The bonus track version of \\"Marquee moon\\" also has a good guitar solo to it, but it runs around half a minute longer than the original version.  As for \\"Untitled instrumental\\", well, it has a driving bass guitar and solid drumming. It gives a nod to 1960's surf rock and has a vaguely Shadows style lead guitar.  The rhythm guitar has that surf sound to it and it sometimes gives a wink to that famous guitar effect of a breaking wave sound.  Not sure which song first introduced that...\\"Wipe out\\"?         Recommendations:        Radio Birdman - Radios appear.  Australian pioneers of punk. This album came out around the same time as Marquee Moon. If Television really were punk, they might sound like Radio Birdman. Some of their tracks are nice and pleasant too...a bit jazzy.  Patti Smith - Horses. Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten called this album \\"Horseshytte\\". Not very punk. Like Television, Smith is arty and literate. Probably called punk because she performed at CBGBs too...as did Blondie.   The Stooges - Fun house.   The second half of that album is quite jazzy, noisy.  The Velvet Underground - either their 1st album (with Nico), or their self-titled 3rd. They also do 'pleasant' well.

1594488916|5.0|If you are reading this, you are very likely a bibliophiliac. What's that exactly? Well, allow me to explain. Avid book readers fall into three general categories. The first is the aforementioned bibliophiliac, those who are defined as people who love books and gobble them up for the qualities of their content for the mere joy of reading. We tend to feel anxious if our bedside table is not stacked with several to-be-read books. I've heard fellow bibliophiliacs joke about marking off their book stacks with yellow crime scene tape in fear of their toppling and injuring an innocent passerby. Next are the bibliomaniacs. This obsessive-compulsive disorder is closely related to hoarding, which compels its victims to collect books just for the sake of having them. Reading is not the goal for bibliomaniacs; they just feel the need to possess them.    John Charles Gilkey is one of a (fortunately rare) class that falls into a third category called bibliokleptomaniac, one who possess a pathological disorder that results in the senseless stealing of books. In Gilkey's case, it starts with a desire to own a copy of each book on the \\"Top 100 Best Books\\" list, preferably a signed first edition. Encountering his prize in his almost daily prowls through rare book haunts --- perhaps a rare bookstore or fair, a garage sale or Goodwill --- he pounces. Gilkey's lust soon exceeds the Top 100 list, and any rare book is fair game.    Allison Hoover Bartlett, a San Francisco freelance journalist, learns of Gilkey after a chance meeting with rare bookseller Ken Sanders, known among his fellow rare booksellers as the \\"biblio-dick\\" --- the book detective. A 400-year-old book with an uncertain provenance has come into Bartlett's possession, and she visits his store to learn more about it and how such books were circulated. She finds out that a spate of books has started disappearing from rare book fairs and dozens of rare book boutiques on the west coast. Sanders tells her that when booksellersreported the thefts to the police, who had no concept of the significance or value of an old book, little was done as they were disinterested in tracking down an elusive petty thief.    Sanders chairs a committee in the rare books industry whose task was to track down the huge numbers of stolen rare books and documents that are filched from members of their association. He tells her that there were many culprits, but that a man named John Gilkey stands out as a prime suspect. In the vein of Victor Hugo and Les Miserables, Sanders becomes Javert to Gilkey's Jean Valjean. But in all fairness, Jean Valjean stole a loaf of bread to feed his family; he didn't make off with thousands of rare books and stash them in basements. Sanders is almost as possessed by the hunger to bring Gilkey to justice as Gilkey is in stealing books. Nailing Gilkey and finding the lost books turns into his obsession.    When Bartlett finds Gilkey, he is in jail, doing a short sentence on a bad check charge. Gilkey, apparently in his vanity, freely divulged his methods to Bartlett. Completely amoral in his \\"collecting,\\" he was a prime example of unbridled entitlement. Once out of prison, he leads her to some of his favorite haunts --- the rare book stalls at book fairs, the bookstores with the rarest of merchandise, and even to the phalanx of pay phones where he would order the books on stolen credit card numbers for later gift wrapping and pickup. No tawdry skulking about and tucking a book under an overcoat for him. He blithely wrote bad checks and charged with abandon, all the while convincing himself that he was actually buying the books. The fact that there was no money to back up the purchases was brushed aside because \\"booksellers are insured\\" or \\"those rich people can afford the occasional hit\\" on their plastic. He had his books and everybody won in his twisted mind. Bookstore owners had insurance, right? Credit card theft is insurable. So who gets hurt?    His motive? To be admired asa man of culture and erudition. The accumulation of rare books and impressive titles is to him a sign that he belonged among gentility --- a position denied to him by his humble beginnings. The irony is that, in his eyes, his pages-long rap sheet had no bearing on his self-generated aura of respectability.  Jail time was merely an opportunity to do research, to dream up new schemes to \\"buy\\" more books.    THE MAN WHO LOVED BOOKS TOO MUCH does not elevate Gilkey to anti-hero status. What it does do, however, is lead us into the strange and wondrous world of literary obsession. Bartlett, herself a book lover, worried that entering the vast collections of rare books would expose her to some contagious mania virus she might contract in the musty, dusty marvels of collectible books.    Like a mystery unraveling, Bartlett introduces the reader to the minds of two interesting men playing a real-life game of cat and mouse.       --- Reviewed by Roz Shea

B002CMLIJ6|4.0|Ok, while it may not be the best in high drama, for what it was, this was a pretty decent movie. Then the other shoe hits...<br />\\"Deadpool\\" aka Baraka was wrong on virtually every level for the character. Now don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds did a<br />FANTASTIC job when he was just plain old Wade. Fantastic to the point that I was really looking forward to the Deadpool<br />movie, right up till they turned him into Baraka from Mortal Kombat... with laser eyes... and teleportation...<br /><br />Yeah. That part really sucks. But that's like the last 15 mins of the movie. Up till then, it's filled with performances<br />that range from decent to pure win (did I mention how spot-on Ryan Reynolds was as pre-Deadpool Wade Wilson? Yeah, he's<br />just that good to need mentioning again...)<br /><br />Now x-men/wolverine \\"purists\\" aren't going to like this movie any more than they did the last ones. They do change things,<br />some of them for no readily discernable reason. So to those people, I say rent/PPV it.<br /><br />Wolverine & Deadpool (comic version) fans definately need to buy it though. Hugh Jackman literally becomes Wolvie for the movie,<br />just like he did for all the others. And yes, more mad props for Ryan Reynolds! \\"Ok... People are dead...\\" Priceless.

0316010669|4.0|Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is Gladwell's book of accurate decisions made rapidly. Gladwell uses examples throughout the book to support his thesis of something he calls \\"thin-slicing.\\" This term is the snap judgement that crosses a person's mind at a spontaneous moment. The book is laced with interesting and unusual topics of rapid cognition.    Although the topics are unusual, they reflect every day life situations for the reader. This gives his audience a connection to the examples that he uses. In the first few hundred pages of the book he uses first impressions in the eyes of an art connoisseur, a car dealer, politicians, and doctors. Each example the person is forced to make a snap judgement. Gladwell's examples make these snap judgements based off years of experience and knowledge. These examples link to the thesis that Blink is based upon.    Gladwell gives interesting examples that focus on the unconscious. In the priming experiment a student was given a group of tangled sentences that all give the state of being old. After the student was done reading the sentences, he walked more slowly like an elderly person. This experiment goes behind what Gladwell calls it as the \\"locked door\\" in your unconscious. This example in the book was unpredictable, unlike some of the other examples that Gladwell gives.    After getting further into the book, the examples become less relevant to the thesis. In the beginning, the stories appeared more interesting, but the book sidetracked to other irrelevant topics. One example in particular made me want to skip the section entirely. The topics ranged from a blind taste test of Pepsi product verse Coca-Cola to a singing artist named Kenna who was cheated out of making it big.     While reading, I had this feeling that if I were to just randomly pick up this book and start in the middle, I would already have a sense of what the book is primarily about. Although Gladwell is a very good storyteller, his stories didn't seem to have any sort of structure. The book  began to lose it's interesting connotation by being repetitive. Gladwell took the \\"thin-slicing\\" theory and traveled off on a tangent.    At the end of the book, there wasn't much of an ending. It ended with another story. If thats the case, then the book could have ended after the first chapter of thin-slicing. Toward the end of the book the people in certain examples are sketched with less experience. For instance, the taste testing challenge and the song artist wouldn't have as much experience as the two women who were professionally taste testers. They have had years of experience and knowledge of understanding their tongue pallet.    Overall, the book had a very good point. The author was saying that the more education and experience a person has, the more likely they are to make a better snap judgement. It seems like the author wanted people to be able to slow down the thinking process to control their responses to the event that is taking place.

It is a perfect companion piece for \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" -- especially for readers who enjoyed \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" but thought Michael Pollan's treatment of vegetarianism fell somewhere between specious and insulting.  But \\"Eating Animals\\" is also a great introduction to the strange, intricate food system that we live in, Michael Pollan or no Michael Pollan.  Indeed, Safran Foer even includes his own alphabet of food production-related terms (hello, \\"bycatch\\") with perceptive and frequently hilarious definitions.  Most importantly, however, \\"Eating Animals\\" is one writer's intimate, compassionate, compelling examination of his relationship with the natural world.  A truly thought-provoking read.

0385504225|3.0|In defense of Dan Brown, can anyone out there think of a plausible ending for \\"The Lost Symbol\\"?  What could the secret of the Masons possibly be, hidden somewhere in Washington?  After all, we have already found the Holy Grail, and Indiana Jones located the Ark of the Covenant.  The only problem I had with the book was the apparent family trait of the Solomon family to endure unendurable amounts of pain.  Creating your own tattoos is one thing, but removing one's own testicles is quite another.  Surviving a home hand amputation sounds like Civil War medicine at its worst, and yet Peter Solomon is remarkably good humored after a few days.  Of course, Langdon is fine minutes past his own experience; clearly people in Brown's universe are tough customers.  I really enjoyed all the research and information on the history of the Masons, although much of it has been used before in things like \\"National Treasure.\\"  Could another author have pitched a story line so similar to \\"National Treasure\\"?

0061730327|4.0|This book describes a young man's efforts to build a windmill to generate electricity for his family after a drought and the resultant famine brought the tenuousness of their existance painfully to the fore. Growing up in Malawi, William's life consisted of subsistence farming, trying to get good enough grades to pass exams that would let him further his education, hunting for birds, and tearing apart radios so he could learn to repair them. When he could no longer attend school for lack of tuition money, he spent his time at a local library devouring every book on applied science and electricity they had. By observing pedal powered bicycle lights, and with access to a scrapyard, he experimented with bits and pieces of junk until he finally had a working windmill that powered a single car headlight lamp. That later led to a homemade switch, a circuit breaker, a mobile phone charging station, and a chance at a higher education through the efforts of professors, bloggers, and technological innovators from the United States and elsewhere.    This true story makes me truly grateful for what I have. William's ingenuity in recycling what I would normally think of as useless junk reminds me of the universal attribute that true survivors have to adapt to incredible adversity. An inspiring story that our young people need to read. The poverty in Malawi provides a stark contrast to American wealth; even those in America who consider themselves poor would have to reassess that perception. The environment that William grew up in makes his achievements that much more astounding.    Parents could use this story to discuss the importance of education, the value of hard work, the necessity of environmental balance, the riskiness of subsistence farming to factors such as weather/political subsidies, and persistence in the face of overwhelming odds.
0143038419|5.0|This is such a fabulous, inspiring, funny and insightful book.  I love Gilbert's writing style.    I have read this book probably over 5 times now.  My copy is so beat up from carrying it around, it has page corners folded over, notes written in the margins and sentences highlighted.    There is so much that you will gain from reading this book!
0061914177|5.0|I judge a business book by the number of ideas and useable advice I pull from it.  Based on this criteria Gary Vaynerchuk's \\"Crush It\\" was a sure win for me.  Let's face it, social media is changing the face of business, both how it is done and how it is promoted.  If you fail to get in front of this train you will be run over by it.  Having done well for himself by leveraging the new and evolving internet technologies, the author offers sage advice and the outlines of a plan for others to follow in his footsteps.<br /><br />The book is short, easy to read and written is a conversational style.  He emphasizes the need to tell stories and follows that guideline through out the book.  More motivational than technical, this is a good primer on leveraging the internet for existing businesses and for people just starting out.  The number one thing I took from this book is that you need to get your name out there, follow the trends and just do what works for you.  I would add that you need to be willing to make a lot of mistakes.<br /><br />I have read some criticism that because the author started with an existing business, his father's $5 Million liquor business, rather than from nothing his advice should be taken with a grain of salt.  I completely disagree with that view.  While growing a business from $5 million to $50 million is impressive, I am sure that most people would be more than happy to earn an extra $50,000 to $75,000 annually from their online efforts. In fact, with today's uncertain economic climate and the looming failure of social security and medicare everyone would be well advised to take Gary's advice and start building a coffee table business online following his advice. I can think of no better place to start online than by talking about your passion, that thing that most motivates and drives you.<br /><br />One thing this book isn't is a cookbook for instant success and riches with no effort, although the few negative reviews I have read here fault him for not providing such a guide.  He advocates hard work, long hours and study, the same things that have always led to success.  The methods haven't really changed,only the medium used to promote yourself and your passion.  I would add to his list of things need to be successful a good deal of luck as well, because oftentimes it's not talent, knowledge or skill that wins out, it's being in the right place at the right time.  Gary is just asking you to use social networking and marketing to be in more places at once.<br /><br />Have a business, want a business or simply looking for more economic security in your life?

B002JIOQCO|4.0|Here's a band that pays homage to the \\"rock god pose\\" all along  Wolfmother comes back after the nonstop touring during 2006/2007 and after some lineup changes. The only one remaining from the original power trio members is their front man/guitarist; Andrew Stockdale.    Cosmic Egg delivers just as much power as its predecessor self titled \\"wolfmother\\"; it contains instant rock staples as the debut album did, but proves that during all that touring his main composer endured much more as a song composer and not just as a riff genius.  What this means is that the \\"filler\\" of this record is way better that the first album.    Standout cuts are: \\"California Queen\\", \\"White Feather\\", \\"Pilgrim\\" and \\"10.000ft.\\"    Sure you get all the myriad of sounds from the influences that plague this band: Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Yes, Free...you name it. But for a change and a boast of freshness sure \\"old feels good\\"     Long live to Arena Rock and all the good rock from 1975 through 1979

B001VPJZ36|5.0|This movie is very well done. A couple of minor scenes were created for dramatic effect but for the most part, it is historically true. I used this for my class when we studied the space race with Russia. The kids really enjoyed it and learned a lot.

B002ELM5HY|3.0|The only person who got lucky with the latest from Mark Knopfler is Mark. After a string of wonderful releases going back to Sailing to Philadelphia he  has appeared to have hit the wall. As Randy Newman's lyrics from \\"I'm Dead\\" so aptly state,<br />\\"Everything I write all sounds the same<br />Each record that I'm making<br />Sounds like a record that I made<br />Just not as good!\\"<br /><br />The result is a mixture of songs only a few of which are really worth hearing. I could easily listen to the first cut and then skip to the last 4. I realize there has been a lot of water under the bridge since the early 80's but I still long for another Sultans of Swing..
B00204AA0O|5.0|I am hooked on lyrics. I had not heard much of her work other than an occasional play on the radio.

0061673730|1.0|I read three hundred pages of the four hundred and thirty or so between the front and back cover.  There is only one other book I can recall so vehemently closing for good and that was Prozac Nation.  There may not be a direct connection, but both narrators seem to whine a lot.  At least in Prozac Nation we know the narrator is a self-indulgent nymphomaniac drug abuser.<br /><br />I understand this book is philosophical in nature, and my review may come off as unlearned and ignorant.  I am neither, as I have had academic exposure to the material before picking up Zen and the blah blah blah.  This book is neither about zen nor philosophy.  It's a whole bunch of whining about some prettied up existential crisis the narrator suffers.  The author inflicts his issues upon the reader without a sense of reason, though he attempts to explain reason over and over and over.  I thought for a second, around page one hundred-fifty or so, he might be on his way to eastern philosophy on the Gita and doing one's duty for its own sake but he lost me again with more whining.  I put this book out in the trash.  If I want someone's existential crisis foisted upon me, I'll settle for my own.

0786868724|5.0|I've read all of Mitch Albom's books. I must say that I really love all of them and I really enjoyed reading \\"have a little faith\\". Couldn't put it down. The author brings two different religions, one from the rabbi (who want the author to do his eulogy) and an inner-city convict who found faith and was saved (his faith brought the best in him). This book makes you reflect and see what is really important. I was very moved by their stories. It made me think of my own beliefs and see people in a different light.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I always thought that Dan Brown would retire to some deserted island after the success of \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" There he would sit on the beach and sip pina coladas. I'm sure the favorable response the film received and some prodding from Tom Hanks got Mr. Brown back in writer's mode. You might compare \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to Indiana Jones meets \\"National Tresure.\\" Years ago Mark Frost wrote a novel titled \\"The List of 7.\\" In it Arthur Conan Doyle pursues the Freemasons in London. Coincidence? Another fascinating read if you enjoy the genre.

Yea, we all wanted revenge, the rape scene as long and vivid as it was did not add to the hard justice delivered in the end and only demonstrates the level of depraved morality we are expected to believe.

B000001EKX|4.0|This is a interesting kiss cd.  There are many classic songs on this disc but they are alowed down and thicker than they played them live.  In fact it's a grungy type of sound on some songs and others not so much.  It's not as accessible as the first disc 'kiss\\" or 'dressed to kill'  either. It would be great to have the band re-record this disc and give us a faster more punchy style. But this is still alot of fun to own and have and it's a gold record because it's a good record.
B00062IVKS|4.0|Raging Bull is for the one who loves boxing and all that boxing is about.  Raging Bull portrays the sport in all its gory detail and aspects that affect a boxer.  Robert de Niro is an excellent actor.  This movie is highly recommended for boxing fans...

0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was one of the most delightful books I have read in a long time.  Written from a dog's perspective, he is more human and unstained than many of us walking on earth.  While all human conditions have been written about, and there seems nothing left to be done, the author presents the story in a truly unique way.
0739319175|4.0|This newest Dan Brown is well crafted and exciting.  I've read the book and my wife and I are listening to the unabridged CD version.  While there many parallels to the Code, the Lost Symbol is exciting and Brown's images of D.C. are excellent.  A good read!
B00133KFGW|5.0|From beginning to end this movie is wonderful, charming, sad, sweet and all around a feel good film. The film follows the path of a very talented young boy who only wishes to find the parents he knows are out there and two people searching for love and returning to what made them so happy from the beginning: music. It's a true fairytale in every sense of the word and written in a way that will take your breath away. It did for me and I am left in tears everytime I watch it.<br /><br />August Rush is indeed a work of art and heart.
1448647169|5.0|I learned that the Orthodoxy of the Catholic faith is what keeps it (and the world) sane.  It calls to us from our fairy tales while at the same time appealing to our logic.     I also learned why so many people, like C.S. Lewis, Scott Hahn, and J.R.R. Tolkien have made reference to G.K. Chesterton - he is brilliant.  His mastery of the English language is second to none.     The only difficulty of this book is that it may come off as \\"high-brow\\" because it was written in the U.K. (and their English is different from American English) at the beginning of the 20th century.  Once you can get past that, you will see how the words of our language make plain the Word of God.
B001VPJYZK|3.0|I found that this season was not as enticing as the first four seasons, but with the slow build up in the begginning by the end of the season it turned out to be pretty decent.  If you have the other seasons, then I would reccommend buying this one as well because it shows the growth of the characters and the difference with age with the ladies on Wysteria Lane. Wonder what they are going to do for the eye catcher in season 6?
0765348276|5.0|I read this after reading [[ASIN:076534825X Spin]], because the 2 titles kept appearing together in various Amazon.com lists. What a world of difference between the 2 books! Where Spin is somewhat dry and very focused on the science of what is going on, Scalzi's books do not get bogged down in the \\"future science\\", and instead focus on the premise (what if old people could become young space-soldiers with enhancements?) while tracing a larger story arc (the nature of war; why we fight; what it means to be human or even alive).     And the humor! This book is hilarious - so many things, from the juvenile to the intellectual, are just laugh-out-loud funny!     I heartily recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun (and funny!) \\"space opera\\" adventure trilogy (read [[ASIN:0765354063 The Ghost Brigades]] and [[ASIN:076535618X The Last Colony]] as well - you won't be disappointed). The only caveat I would add is that there are some sex scenes, but they are more implied and not nearly as graphic as your average \\"bodice-ripper\\" romance novel.  (Apparently, this is something that was remedied in the other books of the series.)
B002T9H2L0|5.0|What can I say about Inglourious Basterds? Unique, inventive, smart writing and excellent acting throughout are what first comes to mind when thinking about this film. Be warned, there is a lot of talking (the first scene is a 20 minute conversation), even for a Tarantino flick, but the dialogue is excellent and the characters are memorable. The only negative is that some scenes do drag just a little, but not enough to bore the life out of you. There are also some well crafted action scenes that are brutal, though they played a much more minor role than I expected.<br /><br />Brad Pitt turns in a fine performance and provides most of the comedic moments. Just don't expect him to be on the screen all the time. Unlike what you see in the trailers, he and his \\"Basterds\\" play supporting roles. There is no real leading role here, but one does take a commanding presence over all the rest. New to many people who will be watching this movie, Christoph Waltz delivers a performance to remember and will at minimum get nominated for an Oscar. He is clever, charming, slimy, unpredictable and evil. Expertly acted evil dudes seem to be cleaning up the supporting actor categories every year now. Javier Bardem won it for No Country for Old Men in 2007 and the late Heath Ledger did the same for the The Dark Knight in 2008. Why break tradition this year, especially given the complexity of Waltz's acting here. He already won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor award. The two main female actresses, Melanie Laurent (nomination worthy) and Diane Kruger, were both captivating and added the right elements this film needed. In fact, every person on screen seemed right for the role they were given. Well, horror director and buddy of Tarantino, Eli Roth, was a little off at times, but thankfully he has a smaller role and lets his baseball bat do most of the talking for him.<br /><br />Don't expect any historical accuracy, just get ready for a wild fantasy WWII movie that only Tarantino can pull off. His signature music and song selection is also some of his best. One thing is for sure, Quentin Tarantino is back on top in a BIG way.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 starsnature music and song selection is also some of his best.

0882709194|5.0|I believe you'll find the intro most refreshing.  However, the actual Origin of Species is such a far fetched dream, it is impossible to take seriously.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|The reasons why the Mono mixes are important have been described thoroughly by others. I agree that they could feasibly be called the definitive versions of these albums. They sound uniformly excellent and the packaging is first rate, though I would have enjoyed some extra essays, similiar to the booklets included in the stereo reissues to help place the music in context.    With that said, based on the reviews that I read while awaiting my set, I was expecting the differences from the stereo versions to be more obvious. A lot of reviewers emphasized that Sgt. Pepper, Revolver, and the White Album were entirely different listening experiences in mono. I've was raised on the '87 CDs, and could honestly say that I knew every detail, so it wasn't that I missed the differences. I was expecting guitar parts that I'd never heard, new sounds and effects. But, to be honest, the differences aren't so overwhelming. They are the same songs, sounding more or less the same, though there are details that come up from time to time, like different fades or certain instruments pushed up in the mix. As noted, there are a few tracks that play at a different speed, \\"Help!\\" has a different vocal, but other than that, its mostly small details that distinguish it from the stereo versions.    The main difference - and what makes this set essential - is that the stereo mixes are sometimes pretty sloppy. For instance, I was appauled by the stereo mix of \\"If I Fell\\" - John's double tracked vocal is off in the beginning and there is a voice crack by Paul in another part. I never knew how bad the stereo mix was for \\"All You Need Is Love\\" until I heard the mono; It was pretty obvious that this was how the song was meant to be heard...stereo sounds hollow and dinky in comparison. \\"I am the Walrus\\" sounds excellent in mono, as does \\"Revolution.\\" To summarize, after listening to the mono set it became clear that much more time was spent on making the mixes right, and the stereo versions were rushedand at times careless. Since you can only get these albums in mono as a part of this set, it becomes a necessity.     Should you get the set? Absolutely. Mono is the only way to hear the early stuff, and even the later albums sounds much more solid and cohesive. \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is probably the best example of this. But be realistic in what you're expecting. Had I known two months ago what I know now, I wouldn't have bought so many of the stereo versions, because now they just sit there. I can't see a time when I'll reach for the stereo \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" when the mono sounds so right. But, I will say, \\"Strawberry Fields\\" for whatever reason, is much better in stereo. So, get the mono set, add the White Album, Abbey Road, Let It Be, and Magical Mystery Tour in stereo, and you'll be set.
0385504225|5.0|I bought this book despite the negative reviews here and I'm glad I did.Here are two reasons why reviewers were so tough on this one.<br />---1.)<br />It seemed obvious to me that the negative critics of this book<br />would not have been satisfied unless Dan Browns next book<br />described (in detail) how Jesus never really walked on water.<br />Failing that of course,would mean that Brown had failed in this his latest attempt.<br />---2.)There is also the aspect that,<br />everyone gets their t*ts in an uproar when it comes to religion<br />and everyone has an opinion on religion.The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons gave everyone a platform on which to vent.<br />  Consequently the ability of this book to stand on it's own<br />merit didn't have a chance.<br />Jusy my opinion.<br />P.S.since when does information(if it is interesting)that is not<br />directly related to the plot mean that it can't be inserted just for it's informative worth?

B00006G8K0|3.0|Great movie of its type, but there is a problem with the transfer. In many shots the tops of the actors' heads are cut off, and in some shots it seems their legs are cut off as well (less noticeable). IMDB says the original aspect ratio was 1.66:1, which is about 15:9. Amazon says the aspect ratio is 1.85:1, which is about 17:9. I saw this movie on a 16:9 monitor. Did they get a 4:3 print, then cut off the top and bottom to make it 16:9? I would have preferred to see the entire movie. Audio commentary by a movie historian would have been nice as well.
0307408833|2.0|I have been baking vegan and gluten free for a long time now, so I was excited to see that the famous bakery owner (who's baked goods I never had a chance to try since she is only in NY) released a book with all her \\"secrets\\". I was very very disappointed, after trying several recipes they never turn out the way they suppose too, even though I followed everything exactly. All the recipes need adjustment, and the taste does not compare to other GF-vegan baked goods. My advice don't waste your money, and time on this book...
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I am, it must be said, only a casual fan of \\"Star Trek\\" in that I thoroughly enjoyed watching the original series on TV, and the films which featured the original cast, and largely despised the \\"Next Generation\\" and the rest of it's tedious, politically correct ilk. That said, lest I sound like too much of a curmudgeon, let me state for the record that a big-screen reboot of the original series made with intelligence, style and affection - say along the lines of a [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)]] or a [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]] - would have been most welcome.     Unfortunately, that didn't happen and J.J. Abram's \\"Star Trek\\" is such a catastrophic misfire of a film that it's almost impossible to begin sifting through the wreckage in order to ascertain where it all went so horribly wrong. Suffice it to say, if you want a textbook example of how NOT to go about reviving a television and film franchise, then this film is it.    So how did he screw it up so badly?    Well, for a start, He completely disregarded the canon of the original series; decided to film a script with so many plot and credibility holes that it could double as a hunk of Gorgonzola; and, by his own admission, embraced a film-making sensibility that was the polar opposite of the franchise concept in order to try and hook an audience that apparently suffers from attention deficit disorder and a low IQ.    Largely though, you can ascribe the failure of this film to a case of misguided intent and having the wrong director at the helm.    After all, when the first question on a director's mind when attempting to reboot \\"Star Trek\\" is \\"what can we learn from Star Wars here?\\" (as is established in a behind-the-scenes extra on the DVD) then you've pretty much instantaneously established that you've got the wrong man for the job.     \\"Star Trek\\" is not \\"Star Wars\\". People do not want \\"Star Trek\\" to be \\"Star Wars\\". If they want to watch \\"Star Wars\\" thenthey can go and watch \\"Star Wars\\".    I could go into myriad incidental details about what is bad about this film - the nauseating product placement; the irritating \\"camera flare\\" lighting; a \\"Death Star-esque\\" planet killing Macguffin that looks like a giant ball of Edam; the fact that the deck of the \\"Enterprise\\" looks like the interior of an iphone shop and that the engine room looks like the floor of a brewery - but they are not really the problem.    The fundamental problem with this film is that, cosmetic similarities aside, it is not \\"Star Trek\\" in any way, shape or form.     Avoid this one like the plague.     My other half and I paid all of $3 to rent this DVD and still felt ripped off the following morning.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Nathan Fillion plays a top selling mystery author, Rick Castle, who finds new inspiration in homicide Detective Kate Beckett. To help his new novel, Castle uses his connection to stay close to Beckett to create a character \\"Nikki Heat\\" in the book \\"Heat Wave\\". The two some sort of a partnership that's very different. While Beckett's a tough cop, she's also a big fan of his. After solving many crimes together, chemistry's starting to react. I once heard \\"She's armed and he's dangerous\\" to describe Castle and Beckett's relationship and it works incredibly well. They are ying and yang. The picked perfect actors to fit the characters so well.    If you really want to complete the Castle experience, check out the first Nikki Heat book that was actually published to read titled \\"Heat Wave\\". It's available through Amazon. It made the New York Top sellers list!    I give this show 5 stars and hoping for a third season! Oh and totally looking forward for the 2nd season to come out on DVD!
0345495004|3.0|The author's journalist background is evident in the fine way she presents history and facts.  The weakness of this novel lies in the sophomoric, romance novel treatment of the characters and their relationship.  It was like trying to know someone by looking at them from a distance.
0385504225|1.0|4 words: Screaming. Piece. Of. Garbage. Glad I got it for free from someone else and I could skim this junk. He writes like a pulp fiction author- obvious cliffhangers, leaving out details to overtly make you 'want' to continue . . . it's like it was written for a 9th grader. Then there's the subject matter, claiming scientific 'fact' for concepts that are purely conjecture and the lore of pulpit Bible-thumpers. Please consider this as a review for Dan Brown's 'The Lost Symbol'- it should stay lost.
0679746323|4.0|From the outset, it is clear that the authors' are not fond of Mao. He is cast in an extremely negative light as somebody who does just what is in his own best interest, with no respect for others, or even his own legacy.  Many of his \\"accomplishments\\" are passed off as the works of others.  (For example, the victory in the Chinese civil war is predominantly seen as a result of bad moves by the nationalists, often due to external factors.)  This overly negative view, however, does serve to paint a picture of Mao as a person, rather than the deity that arises in Maoist propaganda.  Unlike fascists of his era, Mao was able to die in is sleep.  Also, unlike other major communist countries, China's communist government still remains in place today.  Thus, the balanced view of Mao still remains a great challenge.  This book may swing the pendulum a little too far to the negative, but remains an important step in understanding an important historical figure.  In spite of the book's length, I did find it lacking in Mao's early history.  He seemed to suddenly arrive in a key leadership position in the early communist party, seemingly without any strong qualifications.  From the book, it is unclear why people would have such song support for a seemingly unqualified schemer.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This was an excellent movie. My new favorite romantic comedy. Hilary Swank is a two-time Oscar winner who proves that she can do romantic fluff as well as the next leading lady. She has incredible chemistry with Gerard Butler, who has not been getting the best roles of his career. He is far underestimated, in my view, and I hope to see him in more romantic comedies.
B0010X745K|4.0|Watching the movie I felt like a little kid watching \\"The Crawling Eye\\" for the first time.  It's not Oscar material of course, but it's great within the horror genre. Some of the characterizations and dialogue isn't great, but who cares?  It's a horror movie and the best one of it's type, i've seen, in quite a while.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|Hey Music-Lovin' Folks!    Now I have been a fan of Sting's for 28 Yrs Now...BUT C'MON!!    Has anybody heard STING's new christmas CD entitled \\"If On A Winter's Night\\"??  Not the festive & joyous yuletide stuff of lore that you would normally   associate with the holidays!   It sounds like a bunch of moody dark medieval chords and is   even in some cases, sang in the dialect of that time!   This might have went over well in the court of King Charlemagne   or maybe even at the big Knights Templar Christmas Bash of 1166 A.D.,   but it's not cutting it for me in the slightest! (-:  As I listened more and more, I could see visions of my holiday guests   leaping from my 28th Floor balcony to their deaths and having to put down   sawdust to catch the blood from others who either slashed their wrists or   plunged the dessert slicer into their chests after being seduced by   the melancholy spell of Sting's dark & detached Christmas ramblings!     Had this CD been released as just an album of Sting exploring folk ballads   & moody medieval troubadour type material, I would've said \\"Okay, that's just  Sting exploring other musical paths--Good for him!\\"    But for Christmas?, this is just not the vibe I enjoy for that time of year.   Ultimately though, the decision is up to the individual whether to buy it or not.   One person's pretentious drivel is another person's idea of artistic brilliance!  For what it's worth, though I admire and respect Bob Dylan for his songwriting  talents, I have always hated his voice and think his Christmas CD is   quite atrocious!--So it's all a matter of opinion.     Also, for all the people who've been sending nasty comments my way for   my review of this CD, please take into consideration the tongue & cheek   tone of my review! It amazes me that some people today have absolutely   no sense of humor and cannot distinguish the difference between when someone   is being sardonic and saying something in a joking way instead of taking it verbatim!STING IS A GENIUS for sure!--This is just not my cup of tea for the holidays.
1416594787|4.0|I enjoyed Richard Dawkins latest book. I have read his early books and found some of them a little on the technical side for those who are not well versed with many biological terms. Although, I think the average reader who is not well versed in science may need to read a little more background material, I think most people will not struggle with his latest release. However, I did find that a couple of the chapters still get bogged down in the technical aspects of some species.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it and I like the analogies that he uses to explain many evolutionary concepts. I feel the book does offer conclusive evidence for evolution and demonstrates the ancient age of the Earth. It has a good overview of geological processes and biological processes in addition to historical context. It is without doubt that Charles Darwin was an absolute genius and a person who in his thinking was revolutionary. The book covers scientific dating methods well and lucidly exposes those who like to deny the historical antiquity of Earth and its life. It is frightening that over 40% of Americans still believe that the Earth was created by a supernatural being who lives in the sky! I feel that Richard Dawkins is only getting better as a writer and I eagerly await his next book!
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|This album is like listening to Taylor Swift's dairy open up and sing to you....the new songs and DVD Content are well worth it! Among the songs, the especially soothing 'Untouchable' is unbelievably melodic, which is beyond words. Once again Taylor shows her versatility as one of the best songwriters of this generation.  The songs are simple, but meaningful. So meaningful, in fact, that you cant help but 'Jump then Fall' in love with this bright, young artist.  So, like i said....what are you waiting for?
B00135EUPC|5.0|I love this movie. I also love the soundtrack. Mel Gibson is an awesome director, and so is James Horner, who is the Music Composer. Listening to the CD, it feels like I'm in the movie set, fighting with William Wallace against the 'bloody' English army. Thus, we're driving them out of Scotland. I'm glad that I get to own this CD.
1594488916|5.0|Great book. I really enjoyed AHB's work here.  I am especially appreciative that she taught me the word \\"incunabula,\\" which I'm trying to use as often as I can now.  Ms. Bartlett did a really fine job discussing the book on Bob Edwards' NPR show as well.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Honestly worth every single penny, being a constant listener to the steroe versions, this is something new to my ear, if you are a true beatles fan you must buy this
031604461X|1.0|...a lot. People's infatuation with these books and the messages they convey - boyfriends, love, sex, and motherhood being a girl's whole world, to name only one - really concerns me. Particularly the young girls who read these and think they're cool.    And then there's the fact that they're just *bad.*     I mean. Come on. Reneeseme? Please.
B00000K3UU|5.0|my parents got 5-6 copies of this movie because its my dad and I's favorite. I HAD to get a copy for myself! its my alltime fave! I LOVE adam sandler and the twin boys do a great job!
0679720200|2.0|The book is very short and very simplistic; I felt that not Camus, but the one who translated it did not do a good job. It is a bit confusing because Meursault starts out as not caring about anything, but then he seems so infatuated with Marie. So it was a bit hard to decide what kind of character Meursault was supposed to be, although it does in a way show us that humans are not logical beings. On the intellectual level this book was not very appealing at all; most of Meursault's experiences were generalized. I have to say that the book only gets interesting in the last 20-30 pages, that is where the action starts to happen. Everything else before that is vague and garbage, it only talks about this guy who does not have feelings, but wait he does have feelings, or maybe he doesn't.  If I were you, I would save the time and read another more interesting book.
B00275EGTW|5.0|I haven't read a whole lot of reviews for Moon but I do hope they haven't spelled out one small part of the plot that makes the film interesting. One of the best things on the film was that the marketing from Sony was thankfully good at not ruining the films plot. Some people didn't like the films twists but to me they made certain aspects of the film mostly its hard science fiction plotline. There isn't a whole lot action in the film, just a good story in my opinion buoyed by a writer/director who's eager to explore ideas.  One of the main things that works for the movie is the work of Duncan Jones. I'm sure the was independent to a degree but theres a lack of flash that made it feel more interesting compared to a more effects driven film. Sure there are some effects but the reality of the model work for things like lunar rovers, or moon bases keeps the film buoyed in a certain reality where the visuals aren't overpowering the storyline. Better yet the interiors of Sam Bells spacestation have that lived in quality that existed in a film like Alien, wherein you're astronauts aren't scientists but a salvage crew looking to earn a living. I'd be remiss if I also didn't give a word on Gerty voiced by Kevin Spacey, a creation that in my opinion sits along Hal 9000 in the anals of science fiction film history. Here instead of some overly intricate robot though you have a console that glides around on a rail system voiced by the serene Spacey and visually showing emotions using emoticons. I have to admit that in some way this creation of the film won me over.  Sam Rockwell is one of those actors who seemingly can fly between goofball to nuanced character in his films and He's very good here. Rockwells always been good with his acting with the way He gives a line or looks during a shot and here He's very good at playing two very different characters who in the end, end up eliciting the same emotional response with an action and a scene.  As for the story which is the coreof the film like I said there are a lot of different readings you can come away with on the various themes explored over human ethics and corporate greed. There are some problems storywise with an ending that is very obvious even though the film tries to push it another way. And the whole endeavour of the secret is a bit hard to fathom with the reality the film projects. But on the whole I bought the story, and the character of this sad little soul, Sam Bell only striving to return to Earth and his wife and Daughter. Sure personally there was bit much at the end of the film with audio bites that could have been axed with a more ambiguous ending being preferable. But still this is a solid film, in a genre where sound and light shows often overshadow films of merit.
0316001821|5.0|I haven't read a book as satisfying as The Lovely Bones in years. I read it on my Kindle and loved it from the first page. It was brutal and lovely and all the things a great book needs to be. Sebold, herself a survivor of sexual assault, poured much of her aching anger and disbelief into Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\") who, being dead, can dispassionately observe and narrate the story she has departed. It is worth every one of the 5 stars I gave it.
0385504225|4.0|Although the story line is a little repetitious and similar to Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code, I enjoyed reading much of the research that Dan Brown does before he writes a book.  Of his five books, I enjoyed Angels and Demons the most, followed by The DaVinci Code and then The Lost Symbol.    Having been fortunate enough to visit many of the sites mentioned in his novels, it makes the story line much more interesting to read.      Like most of his books, they should be re-read, so that some of the finer points which may have been missed the first time are enjoyed in the second reading.    I found that when the \\"bad guy\\" in The Lost Symbol when finally revealed was not as surprising as some of the other books.
B002AT4K9G|4.0|For movies that have sequels this one had 4.  The first and the fourth are the best.  This movie is worth watching.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|fantastic, very catchy music and happy ending.  The movie is great and I really enjoyed watching it with my kids. They will watch it over and over again, just to learn the dance moves.
B002OOG6RQ|5.0|I love it, I have been a Rammstein fan since they first came out with Mutter being my favorite.  I have been waiting to get a new Rammstein fix since Rosenrot and got one with a vengence.  I only wish they would tour the US and not just Paris, Tokoyo, Berlin, London, Madrid etc....they recorded here why not tour here?  Number one Rammstein Fan!!!!!!!!!
B002JTHFUS|5.0|The original vinyl was always better than the first CD, which was poorly mastered and left this listener sorely disappointed.  The Rolling Stone review from 1984 made significant mention of the loud guitars.  I felt, at that time, that selecting Eno/Lanois was a mistake over the raucous production of Steve Lillywhite, famed producer of Big Country, who eventually produced much of How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.  25 years of passed, the album has finally been remasterd, and we've been given something wonderful in this Deluxe ed.  I am so happy that U2 are giving each of their older records the special treatment starting with The Joshua Tree and them moving on to Boy/October/War in one set.  We can only hope that Rattle and Hum, Zooropa, and Actung Baby will follow.
0307341569|3.0|I was excited to get started reading Dark Places after finishing Sharp Objects.  Gillian Flynn is a talented writer and this second novel is no exception.  In comparison to Sharp Objects, however, I have to say I was left feeling slighted.  Don't get me wrong, Dark Places is very interesting.  I finished the entire book in about 2 or 3 days.  The story really grabs your attention from the beginning and leaves you wanting to know more.  Upon finishing, however, I felt like the whole thing was just too far-fetched and frankly unrealistic.    Also, a lot of reviews said this book was much more twisted and dark than Sharp Objects was.  I definitely disagree with this statement.  In comparison, Dark Places was pretty tame.    If you are going to read this novel, might I suggest buying used or even borrowing from the library.  I definitely wouldn't have any desire to re-read this book.
0882709194|1.0|Ray \\"Bananaman\\" Comfort, the famous YEC, took one of the most remarkable scientific tomes ever written, chopped it up, and scrawled a forward for it full of creationist crap. Buy the real Origin.
0385504225|1.0|Recognizing it is tough to follow his two prior hits, but this fell flat. After ~300 pages, I was bored, but kept hoping for an exiting turn. @400 pages, hope was fading, but I thought, surely it will end well. @500 I found myself reading what seemed like an explanation of the \\"Lost Word\\" thinking: you have got to be kidding. Way too thin a connection. It would be unreasonable to ask Amazon to refund me my time spent on this, but really it was annoying.
B002KVSJ64|3.0|People who are thrilled with this album are obviously fans of BB's more melodic, touchy-feely songs rather than the harder-edged tracks found on their earlier work. There are a few good hard-hitting tracks on this album, but a lot of it is the softer melodic stuff, more than in previous albums, which is just not what I'm interested in. I like straight up hard rock (Chevelle, Rise Against, Silverchair, RATM, etc.) and this album barely fits into the genre. Some of the tracks sound almost pop-rock with a hard-rock twist. This album was mostly a disappointment to me for this reason. People say they have stayed true to their \\"style.\\" Well, if this is true then Breaking Benjamin is just no longer my cup of tea. The new Chevelle album, on the other hand, met and exceeded my expectations. Now there's a band that is still going strong, maybe even getting better. Breaking Benjamin, on the other hand, appears to have fallen into mediocrity. 2.5 stars is my final assessment.
0439023483|5.0|I really loved this book. The characters are well developed and I admire the author's style of writing. The plot is really interesting and I can not wait until the next book.
6304936303|5.0|This review isn't about the movie. I had seen it before and I knew it was a good movie. This review is about buying a pre-owned video. I was a little fearful about purchasing a used DVD but I was pleasantly surprised. The quality was great, the movie came much faster than they had promised, and it came with the original case with all the movie info. I have since bought other pre-owned DVD's with similiar success. Great work Amazon.

B002M3SP28|1.0|Really, I tried!  As a great Archer fan, I thought I would love this book and was really looking forward to reading it.  But I just couldn't get into a book about mountain climbing, try as I might!  Gave up at page 80 and fast forward to last page.  Looking at the last few pages, I see Archer did much research based on real lives but nope, not for everyone.  Sorry!
B002KREVE2|5.0|This is a an album that has been waiting to be released for 40 years. This is Leonard Cohen at the peak of his first phase ending with the album 'Live Songs' in 1973. This album fills in the gap from 1969 and 1971 - two crucial years that Cohen had no equal and yes including Mr. Dylan whom I also like and admire. The songs are all the early classics and a generous portion is included as well. The sound is superb and at times it feels and sounds like a studio album. This is how good the sound is. You don't have to be a die-hard fan to enjoy this album. It's good at any level of fandom. Now that I've been listening to it for a number of times, I am thinking of this album as if it's always been part of my Cohen collection. The album found its right place very quickly and snugly. The short poems fit in perfectly too as does the small talk: 'Marianne, hope she's here, hope she's here!' My last word is if you have even a slight interest in Cohen, you want this album. Thank you Mr. Cohen.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The scenes in this video series are absolutely breathtaking!  You'll see things you've never seen before in ways you can't imagine!  I recommend it.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I can't improve about how Sting describes this album except to say that all the songs work.  There isn't a weak spot on this album (compared to the spotchy lute album). If you like winter you'll definitely like this album. Though I save 4 dollars by purchasing it at a electronic merchandise box store, I forget the name.
0385504225|5.0|Boy did I get sucked into this book.  Sure, there are some implausible things going on in the story but hey, isn't that why they call it fiction?  I am a very avid reader of many genres and a writer as well so I can very often predict the plot path of a story.  However, Dan Brown snuck up on me several times in this one which made the book all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />I'm sure part of the reason that this book was appealing to me is that I am so interested in Washington D.C.  It will be fun to look up some of the locations when I return to D.C. in the fall.<br /><br />For those who were derisive about this book and implying that it was inferior work and \\"all about the money\\" for Dan Brown and his publisher I'd like to offer that perhaps the detractors are simply jealous of previous and current successes.  Any book that keeps me reading until 2:00 a.m. two nights in a row is worth the money.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|The Matrix fandom is heavily divided between those who loved the entire trilogy and those who regard the first one as a true classic with two sub-par follow-ups. Whatever side you support, there's no denying that the first Matrix is indeed a classic that revolutionized the industry and raised the bar on many layers (from special effects and sound to editing). It's a well paced, action packed, philosophical science fiction master piece.    If you already own the collection on DVD, this is the one \\"must\\" to upgrade to Hi-Definition. It looks and sounds superb on Blu-Ray and it has all the special features (related only to the first movie) that come in the collector's set plus a color booklet.    The digibook package hasn't been received with unconditional love by everyone, but it does give a \\"special edition feel\\" and provides decent protection to the disc.     Some people will prefer \\"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\\", but for those of us who loved the original the most and are unwilling to pay upgrades for everything, this is the edition to get.
6305428042|4.0|I am always skeptical when it comes to ordering anything online just because I don't know how truthful everyone is but, I recieved the DVD earlier than expected and the product was in good shape. I would buy again from this seller.

B001FB55HQ|2.0|People who have grown up with the Terminator franchise go to see these movies not only for the action, but for storyline.  In all Terminator movies (yes this includes number 3) except this one, the action is not the driving force in the story, rather a compliment.  Perfect example of this is in T2, this movie is not about an awesome liquid metal robot (he is awesome).  T2 is about how a machine at times can be more human than us, so this is a character study.  That is my big criticism with T4, it is a good action movie but thats it, there is no story.  I did not care if John connor lived, and if you don't care if the \\"saviior\\" of mankind lives, than there is something wrong here.  I felt as if I was watching someone playing a video game.

0786838655|5.0|It's been years since I've read a kid's novels, and now I remember why I like them so much. This series is fabulous! I am so impressed with Rick's creativity, the way he has transported the Greek Gods and their myths into the modern age. He has created fine characters in Percy, Annabeth, and Grove, and reveals information about parentage and what's what in wonderful detail. The story unrolls in a way that keeps one captivated, and the book is full of action.<br /><br />I'm on the second book now, The Sea of Monsters, and it's every bit as good as the first. I'll read the whole series. Well done, Rick! Thank you for these wonderful books. I am so much enjoying them. They may not have been intended for adults, but hey, awesome read for us too.
B000RIWAVW|1.0|As a teenager I was enamored with films, particularly sci-fi and good horror. Everytime I saw a horror film and hated it, it was none other than directed by Carpenter. I don't care about the transfers, or the 1080 or the HD, I am basing this review on the film itself. Save the amazingly talented Donald Pleasence, perhaps in its day, this was terrifying. But when I saw it as a child, perhaps not too long after it was out, I was laughing at most of the film, on really how ludicrous it was. Absolutely terrifying to me is 'The Shining' or of course 'The Excorcist', this is just uniform B horror, and even that is giving it accolades it doesn't deserve. You can argue till the GOP find's a talking head not full of themselves that this was a unique approach to horror films which showed what you can do with a extremely minimal budget, a great score, and awful acting...use really grade school, first person type camera shots, and audience edge of your seat trickery...mehhh...give me 'Blair Witch' anyday....<br /><br />Ridiculous. How many times is he going to come back to life, over and over and over and over and over and over again. The ending showing still shots of the house, some of the rooms in the house, MM's old house and heavy breathing......oh please...I know 14 year old's who make better cut films on their Hi-8's.
B002S0OBFK|5.0|It has been a long time since a movie has scared me, but Paranormal Activity has stepped up to the plate! This is an extremely suspenseful ghost story that really takes it up a notch because the \\"mockumentary\\" style puts you in the characters' shoes. This movie is definitely not for everyone - let's face it, if you were not a fan of the subtle creepiness of the Blair Witch Project, you will not like this movie. If you do not like ghost stories, or tales of the supernatural, you will not like this movie. If you can't appreciate a story with suspense, and tension buildup as opposed to in-your face jumps, then you will not like this movie. If you like ghost stories, suspense and don't expect to get scared in the first 5 minutes of the movie, then check this one out.   This may not be THE scariest movie ever, but it is certainly in the top 10 (at least in my opinion).
B001TODCII|5.0|All young adults need to see this. This happens in america as well as overseas.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Persuasion is my favorite of Jane Austen's novels, and thus far this is the best movie version of the novel that I've seen.  It's still not perfect, but no movie adaptation can be.  I have some issues with a couple of the scenes; such as when Anne runs all over Bath to catch up to Captain Wentworth (which is ridiculous), just to plow into him in front of her father's home.  However, I'm very happy with this version of Persuasion and I watch it often. Most of the other versions of Persuasion that I've seen are incredibly irritating, and so I seldom watch them.  I highly recommend this version to any Austen or period film fan.
B000YGFGD6|5.0|I happen to have a multi region DVD player so this DVD played like a gem!  What is there to say?  It's CLASSIC Michael at his highest popularity.  He was EVERYTHING and I love thinking back to that time of wonder, surprise, awe and true showmanship.  One of the reasons I decided to buy this DVD is not so much for me, being as the \\"special effects\\" and storyline are pretty 80's (haha) and was a lot more exciting when I was little :).  I bought this for when I have kids.  I want them to see what a gem we had on this earth and I want them to be exposed through me, and not through the media that depicts him in such a dim light.  I want them to be as inspired by him as I was and continue to be!  His music, vision and art will never die with me or those around me.  Anyway, I really recommend this especially as a collectible. Enjoy!  Rest in love MJ!
B001JFZ118|5.0|I received this product in a timely manner and in the condition it was advertised as.  I would purchase from Amazon again.
B000N3ST3Y|2.0|Genesis are one of those groups that it is darn near impossible to assemble a good career spanning retrospective for. Especially on a single disc. Some have come really close (2005's 'The Platinum Collection'), some have provided great samplers (2007's reissued version of this release, 'Turn it On Again: The Tour Edition'), and others have been great for the really hardcore fans like myself (namely the 'Archive' box sets).     But, in 1999, Atlantic Records had an idea: to assemble a package for the casual fan of Genesis. The result? 'Turn it On Again: The Hits.' It has certainly plenty of strengths and it is LOADED with five star material, but yet, it's only deserving of two stars.    Why, you may ask?    Well, the music is great. Almost every song here ('Congo' being the notable exception, from 1997's 'Calling All Stations') is worthy of five stars. But the problem is, Genesis switched genres so much. 'Turn it On Again' tries to collect all of Genesis' stylistic changes over the years onto one disc. From Gabriel to Collins to Ray Wilson (of Stiltskin fame, he was Genesis' lead singer from 1996 to 1998), Genesis changed very much.    Now, to the music.    Everything here, as I stated above, is great. 'Invisible Touch' is EASILY one of the best '80s pop songs you can find anywhere. 'Mama' still sends chills down my spine every single time I hear it. It's just so haunting. And it's hard to find a better pop rock song than the title track, from 1980's masterpiece 'Duke.' And, the good news is A PETER GABRIEL TRACK IS REPRESENTED! Yay! 'I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe),' from their 1973 classic 'Selling England by the Pound' makes an appearance here (although I will admit, it is somewhat out of place).     The rerecording of 'The Carpet Crawlers' (called 'The Carpet Crawlers 1999' here) is great, with Gabriel and Collins trading lead vocal duties, and marking the return of guitarist Steve Hackett, who was a member from 1971 to 1977 ('Nursery Cryme' to 'Wind & Wuthering') to Genesis.     There are plenty of negatives, which is why this gets two stars.     First, WHY ARE SO MANY GREAT SONGS EDITED?!? 'No Son of Mine,' 'Tonight Tonight Tonight,' 'Abacab,' 'Mama.' You get the picture. The way to listen to Genesis, regardless of the era, is to hear the music in their full length album versions. 'Turn it On Again,' however, cuts them down -- and on some, massively -- so all of these songs could fit on one single Compact Disc.     Sure, this package has the 'Hits,' but lacking so many. I'll just name some. 'No Reply At All,' 'Behind the Lines,' 'Undertow,' 'Afterglow,' 'A Trick of the Tail,' 'Home by the Sea,' 'Anything She Does,' 'Man on the Corner.' I could go on and AND ON. And that's not even touching on the Peter Gabriel years of 1969-1975.     These statements are further proving my point. TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE GENESIS COMPILATION, IT NEEDS TO BE TWO OR THREE (maybe four) DISCS. You cannot condense 26 years worth of material (1973-1999) onto a single disc without having major flaws. That just can't be done. And 'Turn it On Again: The Hits' proves that point.    I recommend any of the box sets ('1970-1975,' covering the Peter Gabriel years, with the exception of 1969's debut 'From Genesis to Revelation,' '1976-1982,' covering the early days of Phil Collins, 'A Trick of the Tail' through 'Abacab,' and '1983-1998,' which covers Genesis' dominant MTV-era years, plus the album with Ray Wilson, 1997's 'Calling All Stations'), or 'The Platinum Collection' will satisfy any casual Genesis fan's needs fine, devoting a disc to all three eras of the band (making it three CDs long).     Overall, this just isn't a good set. For a casual fan who just wants to hear 'Land of Confusion' or 'Misunderstanding' in the car or at work, it'll do fine. But for the fan that really wants to get their money's worth, stick with 'The Platinum Collection,' which is FAR more comprehensive.     Unfortunately, I hate to say this, but this is not recommended.
B000S88JTS|5.0|Anyone who rides a motorcycle or wishes to learn about the history of motorcycling would likely enjoy this movie. In fact, anyone who is amused by watching older movies and shows that depict how some things have changed and other things never seem to change over the years would have fun watching this. I recently had the distinct pleasure of meeting Malcolm Smith, one of the riders who was featured in this movie. He is now in his late 60's and still enjoys riding. I can highly recommend this movie!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I don't know why, but I have read all of the Dan Brown catalog and every time I finish a book I think \\"Why is this man so famous? And why did I bother to finish this mediocre book?\\" Sure Mr. Brown does his research and develops some good story ideas - but his characters are so one dimensional and plots have become rather formulaic.<br /><br />I can't say I would recommend this book. If someone really wanted to read a Dan Brown book I would say read Angels and Demons and move on to a better writer.
B00005JLD4|5.0|This is a terrific story about 2 girls who are plucked from their aboriginal families by white people who were intent on educating them and teaching them \\"culture\\" -- it's about ethnic cleansing really.  The little girls have other ideas and take off on a long journey following the rabbit-proof fence.  It is their journey and it is a true story.  And at the end of the movie, don't turn it off!  Stay tuned for a gem of a surprise ... and have a tissue handy.
B001152TL6|2.0|The film quality is excellent and the DVD transfer didn't lose much.  The actors are top notch, but the storyline is just weird and difficult to follow.  I found the first half boring and was ready to pull the plug, but it got better in the second half.  If there was a plot in there, I could not find it.  If you are looking for an easy to follow, entertaining movie, Lost Highway is not the one for you.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I love the Twilight soundtrack and could not wait for this one. I got it in the mail and put it straight in the cd player and it was absolutely horrible. I couldn't believe it was so bad!! I just hope the movie is not as bad as this. Can you return cds?
B000093FLA|4.0|I didn't know Brad Pitt had it in him!!  This movie is a merry-go-round of laughter going toe- to -toe with your common sense.  I still thought it was funny!
B001FB55YE|3.0|After a disappointment like revolver, the spirit of lock, stock and...is back  in this buddy movie with lots of good actors.  But we're still far away from the sharp sense of humor of Snatch!  Quality of the bluray is good but not exceptionnel.
