1439102813|5.0|A MUST READ FOR ANYONE DEALING WITH THE CARE OF SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA!  This books was recommended to me as a book that I should read since I am dealing with a parent with Alzheimer's.  It's about a fictional person who has early onset (age 50) Alzheimer's and how it drastically changes her life and the way others near to her are affected by her disease within a couple of years of being diagnosed with it.  It's written as being told by the person who has the disease which is rare because as the disease progresses those with it no longer can function mentally on a level where they would understand what is happening.  It has given me a new understanding about what happens as the person slowly slips further and further from the person they once were.  They are still the same person physically but can no longer maintain life as they once knew it.  But eventually they are incapable of even performing basic daily activities and need to be taken care of like a young child with a will of their own.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|The show is amazing...I am not a regular TV show watcher. I normally watch TV shows for the first time on DVD but I have watched this show, every episode, from the beginning. Alex O'Loughlin is HOT and his role for Steve McGarrett is perfect! And the perfect complement to his character is Scott Caan's Danno. Their bantering and sarcasm back and forth is so enjoyable and elevates the show to a whole new level. I have never seen the original Hawaii Five-O episodes so I am not able to compare the new version with the old but I, for one, cannot wait for each week's episode and am anxiously waiting for the DVD seasons to be released. Aloha!
B003YWUTJI|4.0|This album is comprised of tracks recorded throughout Jones' career, and each track is a duet with a different famous vocalist. The songs span all kinds of styles of music. While I didn't enjoy all of the songs (I'm not a fan of rap music), it was amazing to hear Norah Jones' vocal ability in so many different genres.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|The assassination of Austrian Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo directly set into motion an incredible  chain-reaction. That single moment in 1914 may properly be called the one event of the past hundred years that most profoundly changed the world.     But for it, one tenth the adult male population of Europe would not have been killed, Lenin would have been an obscure footnote in history, powerless to ignite to a Bolshevik revolution in Russia, and the seeds that gave root to the National Socialist Party in post-war Germany would never have been sown.    Ken Follett has elected to explore the social, political, and economic history of World War I. In Fall of Giants he focuses on English, German, American and Russian characters. These actors, by reason of fate, birth, or ability are trust close to the epicenters of power and conflict. We follow an English earl, his socialist sister, a Welsh miner, and his politically brilliant sister as the old order starts to crumble in England. Meanwhile in Russia, the harsh reality of the Tsarist regime causes one brother to escape to America and other to draw near the fiery revolutionary Vladimir Lenin. In America a young lawyer from Buffalo works at the side of President Wilson, while loving the daughter of successful Russian emigre, in a dangerous liaison. Two cousins, one German, the other Austrian, struggle to serve their nations even though their hearts and loyalty lie elsewhere.    These are excellent characters to tell this complex history. Follett, in these pages, he takes an almost inexplicable war and makes it sadly real. This is the first installment of a trilogy so these protagonists shall likely return to give new understanding to the next war to end all wars.
B003DZX3US|5.0|Very good quality.  The remastering is great.  I look forward to trying out the Blu-ray disc when I have a player but the DVD is good enough for right now.  Definitely a great addition to any movie collection.
6305291446|4.0|\\"Halloween H20\\" is the 7th film in the Halloween franchise, and the sixth to tell a story of the relentless killer, Michael Myers. The H20 in the title makes reference to the 20th anniversary of the original film, and this also means the film is set 20 years after the original. However, this film ignores all the previous Halloween sequels, creating its own new continuity. That's actually a pet-peeve of mine, but it's hard to complain about it when they finally get back the original star, Jamie Lee Curtis, to continue the story of Laurie Strode. In fact, the bonus features on this DVD imply that this was a pet project of Jamie's.<br /><br />So, 20 years after Laurie Strode was traumatically stalked by her brother, Michael, in the first two Halloween films, we pick up with her life as a private school headmistress using the false name of \\"Keri Tate\\" to prevent her brother from finding her once again. Laurie has seriously been disturbed by her past though, and she is now an alcoholic with a dependency on medications as well, struggling to go on and raise her teenage son who feels she is overbearing and overprotective. Laurie is also trying to have a romantic relationship with a school counselor who seems quite perfect for her, but ultimately, things are going to fall apart, because you know Michael Myers has finally picked up her trail, and Laurie is finally going to have to face off with her monster once and for all.<br /><br />\\"Halloween H20\\", should have been the dream sequel for hardcore fans of the original two films. Unfortunately, I often only hear negatives about it. Personally, I feel people are determined to judge these nostalgia sequels extra harshly. This isn't a bad film, it's just got some issues that are instant turn-offs for many. Probably the biggest problem is that it screams 90's horror. Watching this, you could easily be convinced you were watching a Scream, Urban Legend, or I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel. Now, I like those movies myself. Most are not as good as seventies and early eighties horror, and they're more dated too, but the best of them, like the original Scream, are very good. Much better than later ones, like the Black Christmas or Prom Night remakes. However, it admittedly is a little weird to see a Halloween film that looks so much like a Scream film. I think a lot of people just have a real problem with that, as a lot of horror fans just hate 90's horror stylings. Frankly, probably the biggest problem for me was the poor comic relief in the form of LL Cool J's phone conversations with his cartoonish-sounding wife (yeah, LL Cool J is in this as a school security officer). That and the fact that you never warm up all that much to the teen characters, who are late 90's uber cool and don't really grow on you, not even Laurie's son, played by Josh Hartnett (who is always kinda hard to like). But, overall, this Halloween installment/reboot (which I remember feeling very short when I saw it in the theater) is actually pretty good, I feel, if you can get past all the 90's stuff. The point of this story is Laurie Strode dealing with her demons, and I think the ending would have been a better ending for this run of Myers all together before the later reboot. What a shame they felt they had to make one more. Anyway, I can understand how there are many reasons to not love this film, but it still is pretty enjoyable and it's great to catch up with Laurie Strode again. Definitely a must have for fans of the original two films. Well, a must-see at least. The DVD holds a behind the scenes featurette, a trivia game, and a music video. Kind of light for a \\"Collector's Series Deluxe Edition\\". Oh well.as seventies and early eighties horror, and they're more dated too, but the best of them, like the original Scream, are very good.

B00386EZJU|5.0|When you love a movie, you always want the movie score to be just as wonderful. To take you \\"back there,\\" to the moments that made you love the movie without thinking.<br /><br />Well, you dragon-lovers, here you go. For a delightful film, we got an equally delicate and lovely soundtrack.<br /><br />The score by John Powell matches that delight step for step. I was blown away. He manages to use faithful instrumentation, including early instruments like dulcimers and uillean pipes, etc., and these really add to the movie's beautiful look and feel. (For those scoffing at the idea of pipes and Scottish reels in a 'viking' story, it wouldn't hurt to remember that the 'Vikings' became 'Northmen' famed for their exploits in Scotland, the Hebrides, and surrounding lands. So the accents were fine with me.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, this was a soundtrack I loved and immediately knew I had to own. I'm a film music buff and this one was just lovely. It's by far John Powell's best, incorporating the lyricism and romance of his previous scores for DreamWorks with the ferocity and drama the story demanded.<br /><br />And (to echo past partnerships), or those who enjoy the film's percussive strange beauty, I'd HIGHLY recommend Harry Gregson-Williams' score to \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" which incorporates similar and far more 'glassy' or 'icy' sounding instruments for a beautiful nod to the winter theme pervading the film.<br /><br />Kudos to all involved. A beautiful and moving film, and a lovely score that I bought as fast as I could after seeing this wonderful movie. The music helps you fly again, back up in the clouds with Toothless and Hiccup. Certain moments still bring a lump to my throat.  Hope they do for you as well... in your flights with dragons...
B0044KU7KU|5.0|My Chemical Romance (MCR) is definitely my favorite current (still together and making albums) band.  While not a long time follower I checked them out after hearing Welcome to the Black Parade on the radio in a diner while on vacation.  I liked the song so much I remembered some of the lyrics to look it up when I got home.  Needless to say I love The Black Parade and Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.  I do like a few songs off of their first LP, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, but it wouldn't have hooked me like their other two albums.    Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is MCR's first album in four years and has been highly anticipated by fans.  I can honestly say I like the direction that they're headed here with a lighter tone than the past three albums.  Those are excellent albums and I still love listening to them but I'm really glad they've changed things up some.  I'll go through the track listing and give my personal opinion of each track.  Note that I'm no critic and these are just my own feelings on each of the songs.  Tracks 1, 7 and 14 are Dr. Death Defying talking so no ratings for those.    Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na) - 3/5 stars.  The first single and the song that most of us heard first as well.  It's a pretty straight forward rocker with a chorus that just begs to be sung along with.  I wasn't crazy about it at first but it's grown on me a little.    Bulletproof Heart - 5/5 stars.  A superb track that I loved the first time I heard it.  I wouldn't call it a power ballad but it's not far off.  Carries a fantastic chorus that really showcases Gerard Way's voice.    Sing - 4/5 stars.  Another song I that has grown on me since my first listen.  A slower tune that's different from anything else I've heard before from MCR.  I love the strong bass line along with Way's soaring vocals during the chorus's.  Some critics have made comparisons to Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" but I don't see it.      Planetary (GO!) -3/5 stars.  Way had gone on record saying that he wanted this song to get people to dance and I think he'll have no problem accomplishing that.  Definitely makes you want to jump up and down.    The Only Hope For Me Is You - 5/5 stars.  Like Bulletproof Heart I loved this one the first time I heard it as well.  The slow and beautiful intro reminded me a little of The Beatles \\"Across the Universe\\" till it blasts into a hard hitting techno beat and then to a [...]rocker during the chorus.    Party Poison - 2/5 stars.  Pretty straight forward punk rocker.  No soaring vocals or catchy chorus's here.  Not one of my favorites.    Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back - 5/5 stars.  My favorite on the album.  This totally awesome song reminds me of a classic 80's arena rocker with a chorus as incredible as Famous Last Words from their last album.    S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W - 4/5 stars.  Influences from Led Zeppelin and Sgt Pepper era Beatles are certainly present here.  Gerard's voice is distored in an almost dreamlike way.  Very psychedelic indeed.    Summertime - 4/5 stars.  The Cure's influence can definitely be heard on this beautiful ballad.  The instumental solo is wonderfully uplifting.  The first time I heard I couldn't believe MCR had wrote this.  You could just pluck this beauty out a Billboard list from the 80's.    DESTROYA - 4/5 stars.  An incredible drum beat punctuates this song.  Much faster with a Beastie Boy meets Rage Against The Machine sound.  While driving I just want to pound on my steering wheel to the beat of this tune.    The Kids From Yesterday - 4/5 stars.  I feel a little U2 in this one.  Another slower song that makes me just want to sing along.  And you gotta love that cowbell!    Vampire Money - 2/5 stars.  I've heard a lot of people who have voiced their love for this one but I just couldn't get into it.  Like Party Poison this one's feels like a punk rocker as well.    Well, that's the album and my feelings on it.  I have heard the two B-Sides, We Don't Need Another Song About California and Zero Percent, that were released around this album.  I really like We Don't Need Another Song About California and felt that it should have been included on the album.  Zero Percent wasn't bad either but can see why it was cut.  Definitely felt like a throwback to their earlier stuff.    I said in my title that variety was what made The Beatles so great and I feel that MCR has pulled off something that many bands try and don't succeed at.  It's hard to write outside of your niche and be successful at it.  While many may argue that MCR hasn't done anything new please remember that The Beatles had also been influenced by other music when writing many of the songs that have been embedded into our brains.
B000024D4R|5.0|I, as many other Pink Floyd fans in the beginning, had disdain for this album.  Five songs, two under two minutes and three over ten? What IS this?  And so, I like everyone else loved Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle, etc.  Never giving Animals a second thought.<br /><br />I recently listened to this album out of boredom and was absolutely blown away.  From the beginning chord of Pigs on the Wing Pt. 1 to the similar ending chord of Pigs on the Wing Pt. 2, you are in for a treat.  The first two songs serve as bookends -- both musically and lyrically.  The album itself deals with the shortcomings of capitalism.  The Pigs on the Wing tracks serve as the glimmers of hope in the darkness of our world -- the song Dogs talks about how people are selfish and only work for themselves.  Pigs (Three Different Ones) has to do with three types of the three social classes to which society is confined to.  Finally, you come to Sheep, which deals with people ignoring all the problems of the world and blindly following a leader or leaders. The two bookends, as I said, serve as a beacon of hope in the dark of a man singing a love song to his wife amidst all of this confusion and sadness.  If the lyrics didn't do it for you, at least try the music.<br /><br />Dogs is a 17 minute epic -- not as long as some of the other Floydian epics, but that does not mean a thing.  For me, it is the greatest Pink Floyd track.  Blistering solos, singing by both Gilmour and Waters, Richard Wight solos in the last half.  It's everything that is Floyd.  And if you hear the song, you know what I mean -- 'Stone! Stone! Stone!'<br /><br />Pigs is another big song that opens with one of the most WICKED keyboard sounds I've ever heard in my life.  It chills me to the bone.  It then follows with Roger Waters singing and one of the most catchy choruses I've ever heard -- 'ha ha, charade you are!'  The song is dominated by guitars and keys, it's an amazing track.<br /><br />Sheep is the finalepic on the album.  It opens with the sound of sheep bleating and a catchy bass line, ala Money.  The bassline dominates the track.  However, as before, everyone else shines as well.  Gilmour has some of his best guitarwork in this track, especially the last two minutes.  The last two minutes are the best on any Pink Floyd album!<br /><br />Finally you have the Pigs on the Wing twins, which are two purely acoustic songs.  Very haunting and catchy melody on these guitars.  But also different from the rest of the album -- more hopeful, happy.<br /><br />So, there you have it.  With Animals, you have Pink Floyd's darkest album, musically, and also their most daring lyrics wise.  This all calls for a great album, but because it's done by Pink Floyd, it's simply their best album, far outshining both Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.
0230013880|5.0|The illustrations are gorgeous and the students and I love to pour over them. The writing is poetic, lyrical, and I love reading this aloud.     I would use this book for multiple purposes in the classroom (or at home). It would be excellent for a read aloud related to science. Some of the discussions could be related to ethics (the whale is impacted by human activity on the waters, he is beached by the changes in tides), discussion of what happens when one person/being fights for another and takes action, also highlights raising awareness on good citizenship. Also the wonderful adventure the snail and the whale go on, I can see this impact children's imagination and it comes out in their journaling and pictures.    This is one of those gems that has all students enthralled in the story and reading over and over.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki Minaj's debut album Pink Friday is Bad A$$. She sure brings her game, she proves everybody she is the one. This album is just amazing. Some of the collaborations on this album are the best of the year. I hope she goes far in her career. Pink Friday is one of my favorite albums of the year. I suggest you get the best buy exclusive deluxe edition with 2 extra songs.<br />My favorite songs on Pink Friday are:<br />1. Roman's Revenge Feat. Eminem I think this is one of the best songs on the album.<br />2. Fly Feat. Rihanna<br />3. Moment 4 Life Feat. Drake<br />4. Check it Out Feat Will.I.Am<br />5. Did it on 'em
B0046UGSNS|2.0|A few thoughts ---    1.  Excellent cast and casting.  The three leads were so good they could inspire a TV series from this film.    2.  The writer wrote herself into a corner.  A 'kiss' opens a Costco sized can of worms -- leaving us two undesirable paths of resolution.  The piece must manufacture a fall guy to end the story, but by doing so renders THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT pointless and unsatisfactory.      3.  To me, this tale should have explored something more obvious:  what happens when two lesbian parents must confront the true 'man of the house'.  I'd pit patriarchal beliefs on one side, progressive matriarchy on the other side -- and let them go at it -- finding a fresh and interesting harmonious resolution.      Otherwise -- you''re left with a witty and touching but pointless soap opera, which grinds the wellworn lesbian theme of, \\"Women good, men bad.\\"    4.  The title has absolutely nothing to do with anything.  It's a marketing trick.    5.  Because of the botched ending, I can't recommend this otherwise promising piece.
1595141979|4.0|The third installation of the Vampire Academy Series has proved to be more enticing and more juicy so far. With the tantalizing descriptions of Rose's love for Dimitri to the cumulative first time with her one true love,it will send you into a frenzy and wanting more page after page.However upon realizing Dimitri's fate in the end you are left speechless and heart-broken yourself wanting nothing more than to be there for Rose and go with her on her next journey hoping and praying that the news Mason gave to her is somehow,someway...not true...
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Waited awhile to see how others felt about SOLDIER OF LOVE. Finally picked it up and has not put it down since. I'll be waiting for her next album no matter how long it takes.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I've written scathing reviews on a few of Nora Roberts' recent offerings (and I'm one of her biggest fans), but this book is excellent. THIS is the Nora Roberts I grew to adore. Writing is excellent; characterization, excellent. Plot line, excellent. It's good to have her \\"back\\" after some rather bland offerings the last few years. Buy this book. You'll love it.
B001993Y2C|5.0|The quality of the video and all of the DVD extras are great! No complaints. I love some the extended scenes.
B003ZHQVJO|2.0|I was driving in my car with this cd playing in the background and my fiance asked if it was John Mayer. No joke.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|The quality of picture, sound and extended footage were all excellent, perfect.  Just wish I could had gotten it full screen.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|I never knew of this movie before hearing of it from Netfix. It was listed there in the \\"Movies You Would Like\\" category so I put it in my Queue. My husband and I watched 'Khan' last night, and were very moved by this thought-provoking story. It caused us to laugh and cry and ponder the human condition. It is not a short film but held our attention throughout. All the actors give superb performances. There's not a 'dud' in the bunch!  I seldom buy DVDs or videos, but every now and then come across one that I want to have as my own to watch over & over again. \\"My Name Is Khan\\" is one of those. P.S. I wrote the previous \\"review\\" in 2010! Now in 2013 I still watch 'Khan' every now and then & still enjoy it very much.
B00006JDU9|4.0|I had to return the first copy to be replaced. And the second copy the sound was ok, but not excellent. The picture quality was excellent on both.
081297381X|1.0|When considered as a literary text, author's style is very arrogant and pretentious. In areas other than finance, arguments are superficial, reasoning is weak. Author is fond of talking about history and politics, without any background, without any haecceity, without any lambency. His expectation for sympathy as a \\"war victim\\" does not contribute to the value of this (astonishingly) popular and (really) hollow book.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I just cannot seem to understand what the fuss is about this chick. She is not a rapper at all, she is a pop artist who happens to be black so she can get away with being called a rapper. She is as much of a rapper as Ke$ha is. This cd is pop garbage, nothing origional just some loud beats that some DJ somewhere can get away with playing in some club. How the standards of hip hop have fallen so far is beyond me. There is nothing origional here and this chick is FULL of herself. And for someone who hates Lil Kim I find it comical how much this chick trys to be her. Next.
B00445JSX2|4.0|I will start by saying I am a fan of Depeche Mode. I don't own any of the other concert tapes. I have not seen them live since the Violator tour. So it has been a while since I have seen them on stage. BUT -     I really enjoyed watching this DVD. It does start slow but as one other reviewer stated stick around for the ride. It seems that once they sing \\"Wrong\\" everyone is warmed up and ready to have some fun. It does get better quickly.     I also really enjoyed the cinematography. The lighting and the inclusion of the audience enhanced the experience for me. Very interesting take on things. I really enjoyed watching the interaction between the band members which you don't usually get to see in a video much less a CD.    Of course I was disappointed that some songs were not part of the DVD. The selection was not what I would have expected but I am not the band. But the overall selection flowed well. \\"Dressed in Black\\" was a surprise and not originally a favorite but Martin's vocals were wonderful. They ended the party on a slow song which is not something I would have chosen but the duet between Dave and Martin was really a great, great thing to watch.     The CD is also very good. I will also say that it takes a time or two to listen and really get into it.     Enjoy!
0316098337|1.0|I felt compelled to review this book since the fact that it had so many good reviews is what prompted me to purchase it in the first place.  Please learn from my mistake and avoid this book (or at least take the bad reviews into account so you can make an informed decision).      First, let's very briefly go over the good parts of the book... 1) It is a very quick read and 2) the fact that the mother manages to create a fairly normal and pleasant life for her son under the conditions they endure is commendable and leaves readers with a sense of hope.      However, that's where the accolades end.  What I really remember about this book is that the author does not develop some of the most interesting storylines (e.g. \\"Old Nick\\", the abduction, the mother's mental state).  The reason that we don't learn more about these things is because the author chose to tell the story from the point of view of a 5 year old boy.  So we only learn these things from the mother's explanation to her son.  I really disliked reading about the experience from the son's point of view.  I also hated the narrative (do 5 year olds really talk like that???).     But my biggest complaint is that I just did not find the story to be believable. The escape was completely far-fetched, the events leading to the rescue of the mother happened too quickly, and the mother's suicide attempt seemed to come out of left field (certainly the author alluded to certain mental problems while she was in the room but didn't develop it enough to make it plausible once she escaped). And the breast feeding thing - they just wouldn't give that a rest!    Just don't set your expectations too high if you purchase this book.  If you are fascinated with these sort of stories I think you would be much better off reading a real survivor's non-fiction account.
B00428CPUY|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of guitar music. I beleive it is the best version of Crossroads released so far. Every performance is top notch. I especially like the Derek Trucks/Susan Tedeshi/Warren Hayes cuts. EVERY performance is top notch. This is a not to be missed collection of fantastic performances. If you love the guitar, you can't go wrong with this collection.
1594481938|4.0|Ok, I am usually a no fan of Hornby. However, this book was a great treat. Why do I say a book about suicide is a great book. Well, because within the sad tale we see an effort by a small group of people to help one another through depression. They are not entirely successful at their efforts, but they still try and that this is what makes this book a good one. People attempt to overcome their problems rather than simply giving into them. That is a very powerful message and a good one. So get this book and be uplifted, a bit, but not blown away by unrealistic sunshine. A good read.
B000NY17J6|5.0|The five stars are for the music and the value of all these great songs on one cd.  For those of you trying to figure out if you should replace the original cds, though, I would say don't do it.  This remaster has been cleaned up a little and has better frequency response on the highs and lows, but the original cds still sound better to me.  They sound more natural and have a better imaging.  Plus--and this may be a personal thing--the bass and drums on this remaster are too prominent, and it overshadows her voice.  I found it fairly annoying.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|This is truly a good, almost great hard rock CD. Very old school. I'm an old rocker (50) and grew up listening to Deep Purple and very much enjoyed \\"Stormbringer\\" thru \\"Come Taste The Band\\" (the albums that Glenn played and sang on along with David Coverdale). On this CD he sounds a lot like Chris Cornell. I wonder if Glenn was a big influence on Chris, or is Glenn trying to update his sound? There's none of the funk that Glenn can be very good at. Has anyone else notice that \\"One Last Soul\\" sounds very similar to Ted Nugents \\"Stranglehold?\\" Very hard, very heavy. I'm digging it.
030726999X|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  You will wonder at the detail...how could Larsson even think this stuff up?  Wonderful characters, great storyline.  You won't be able to put it down but you won't want it to end either.
0312427999|2.0|I gave her two stars because she has done a good job of researching details in many countries of the world, and so provides valuable information for later researchers.  But she didn't get more stars because she profoundly mis-understands free market economics, and her bias is so crystal clear that it is hard to know what evidence to believe.  I believe she may understand Milton Friedman and the policies he supported based on a few comments she makes in the book, so her mis-understanding is apparently purposeful as a way to push her thesis.<br /><br />Klein has several non-sensical ideas in the books, to wit:<br /><br />1) She associates Freidman's theory of capitalizing on shocks to the economy to build free enterprise systems to electric shock torture.  It's the same word, but it doesn't mean the same thing.  I can understand if she just uses it as a metaphor, but she goes on for pages about electric shock as if there is truly some connection to Milton Friedman.<br />2) She consistently implies that Friedman would cause economic shocks to societies on purpose, whereas Friedman's concept was to use these catastrophes to bring some good out of the misery.  I heard that Klein herself made some comment in the last couple of years about using the Great Recession as an opportunity to change U.S. society, so she is guilty herself of what she accuses Friedman of doing.<br />3) Somehow she has gotten the idea that Friedman advocates using totalitarianism as a means to enable the free market, as if that is even possible.  This is one of the areas where I believe Klein is purposefully ignorant of what free enterprise is.<br />4) She calls the all the economies she disfavors \\"corporatism,\\" but does not point out that corporatism is not the same as free markets, nor is it what Freidman advocates.<br /><br />The one time that Klein's bias was most obvious was when she discussed Argentina.  She claimed that Argentina became totalitarian and its economic system was in the full grasp of the Friedman group, following all free market precepts (in the '60's?).  But she later says that the Argentinian government still had many state owned properties in 1990, such as the national airlines and many oil properties.  She brings this up to discuss how the Angentinian government then sold off all these properties.  But this discusion destroyed all my credibility in what she said in the past, since she claimed that Argentina had been in the clutches of free marketism for many years up to that point.  I started to wonder if any of the other countries she discussed had much of any free market at all when she claimed they did.<br /><br />I think what really happened was that the brutal Argentina regime invited Friedman to come to his country, \\"privatized\\" a few firms (by selling them to associates for peanuts), and proclaimed to all that Argentina was following free market policies.  Argentina has always had a high level of government control of business, whether it was run by rightists or leftists.  This is why it fell so far from its heights at the beginning of the 20th Century to where it is today.  Perhaps Friedman was naive in working with the country, when the main result was propaganda for the government, but he may have nudged the government a bit towards the free market path.<br /><br />Klein's book has raised a few questions in my mind.  Has the free market improved Chile?  I think it probably has, but I have more doubts in my mind than before.  I also wonder if Brazil and Argentina have mostly embraced the free market, or do they still retain the historical Latin embrace of government control.  Many of her criticisms of corporatism have the ring of truth, even though they relate little to her thesis.sp of the Friedman group, following all free market precepts (in the '60's?).

B000000WHC|2.0|I have lately purchased a number of cds that are advertised as \\"the blues\\". I want to establish the boundaries of exactly what I like in the field of \\"blues\\" music. Amazon classifies Still Got The Blues as \\"rock blues.\\" My opinion is that this classifcation of Still Got The Blues is not correct. Although many of the songs on Still Got The Blues are indeed blues songs, Gary Moore is actually a heavy metal musician who is playing blues music on this cd. Still Got The Blues should be properly classified as \\"heavy metal blues.\\" I am currently finishing listening to Still Got the Blues for the second and last time that I will ever listen to it. This is heavy metal music, which I do not enjoy. The overbearing guitar work on this cd gives me a slight headache. I like songs that employ the electric guitar, but not to the piercing degree that Gary Moore accentuates screaming guitar licks on his Still Got the Blues cd. Neither is Gary Moore's singing voice all that appealing. He is very obviously a very skilled guitarist. A final and important limitation of the Still Got the Blues cd that I received is that there is no listing of the song titles anywhere to be found in the cd package. I would only recommend Still Got the Blues to someone who really enjoys heavy metal music. I don't.    John
B004BSAEQC|1.0|Come on I was so disappointed with this mess I instantly gave it away. She is not a real rapper she had only two hot songs and they should have been singles the rest of this album was ALL filler this is truly not worth the money that I paid for it Nic you need to try harder and come better and as far as her being like KIM please not even close BIG FAIL TRY AGAIN
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I first heard about Leonard Cohen while watching PBS in early 2010 when they featured Cohen's Live from London DVD. His performance is dazzling and addictive to the point that I have wondered where he's been all my life. My most recent purchase is his combination CD (audio only)and DVD (video)known as Songs from the Road which features some of his best hits from venues all over the world at different times. Both albums are simply fabulous. I intend to review and purchase many more of Leonard Cohen's albums; he is that good.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I am thrilled with the originality of this television show. I can watch these episodes repeatedly and still find myself singing along and excited over the musical numbers. Also, Sue steals the spotlight over and over again with her wit and sarcasm. Mr. Schuester is easy on the eyes for us older generation of women who are no longer in high school. My kids and I love watching this show together, great family time. The series also touches on subjects that effect society today and make people think about how being judgemental can affect others. If you havent watched this show, you are missing out. I am almost certain they will sing a song you also adore. Glee!
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I've had an interesting time reading the reviews of this new CD by Josh Groban.  If people who say \\"this isn't their Josh Groban\\" paid attention to the press leading up to this CD, then they shouldn't be surprised.  This isn't David Foster's Josh Groban.  The grandiose, perfectly mastered songs aren't on this album.  Josh and Rick Rubin have clearly stated that this CD was recorded \\"old style\\" and in a somewhat different vein that prior CDs.  I can see where people say that he doesn't sound good on the CD.  To a point I agree.  The \\"less couffed\\" stylings are much more raw, and at times he does sound like he's working too hard or pitchy.  But that's how Josh wanted this CD to sound.  That said, I have recently heard Josh sing a lot of these songs live, and on stage they have a much better sound.      As for those that say the songs aren't good, well, for the most part we part ways.  There are a few songs that I am not enamoured with.  \\"Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi is not a favorite of mine.  \\"Galileo\\" is another that I tend to pass on. (Both songs Josh did not write)  Sounds too much like songs Josh did early in his career that I was never fond of.  This album will have a different feel.  Know why?  Josh wrote/co-wrote the majority of the songs.  They are personal to him.  As I saw in a review somewhere else, depending on the prior CD Josh songs you love will dictate how you feel about \\"Illuminations.\\"  There were songs that did take me several listenings to appreciate, but I do think they are well written, and well orchestrated.  Many of those songs are my favorites on the CD.  \\"Bells of New York City\\" is amazing, and \\"Love Only Knows\\" is a Groban love song at it's finest.    My best advice, give it more than one listen.  It might win you over the more you listen.
B002WTOXUK|3.0|This was a movie with very good, and believable, special effects. However, the plot was horrible. Why didn't these Aliens just restart the Space ship over the city when they were up there? Why did it take the Alien father and his son 20 years to build a ship on the ground to fly up to the large ship over the city? Afterall, it was their technology to begin with. The Aliens looked like Insects. All of this short comings are forgivable. I think the producers had a good morale-line of the story, I think they tried to tell us about the \\"what does it feel like to in the other shoe\\" story. I gave it 3 stars because the Aliens looked like the FLY from the movie, THE FLY, etc. I brought this movie from Amazon's pay to watch. I have to admit the internet has changed since 1995. There was no lag in the movie, and on my 1080p Monitor, it was very sharp and crisp and clear.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I'm in love with this album. Even though we've all heard most of these songs due to Kanye's Runaway movie and various internet leaks, this album feels like a new chapter for Kanye West and hip-hop. A+ Kanye, A+.
0439023521|3.0|It was an okay read, but I don't get the hoopla over this book. The prose was clunky at times, and it has a disturbing, but very simplistic, storyline. It never really punched me emotionally given the darkness of the story. There were very few 'on screen' deaths, it the ones that were there weren't very emotionally charged.    Overall, it's an okay campy read, but nothing special.

B0036EH3X4|4.0|I don't want to wade too far into the bog of controversy on Lost's 6th season except to say that in the end the lack of answers and number of left-over loose ends was a bit unsatisfying. I do recognize that Lost was character driven and that the show created some of the most three dimensional, best fleshed out characters to ever be on television. It would have been nice, however, to see a more comprehensive set of answers in the finale.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert*** After all, one of the creators very early on rejected speculation that the characters had died and the island was some sort of purgatory, when that indeed was the direction they took it, though well beyond the most simplistic interpretation along those lines.<br /><br />I even had crafted a detailed speculation that the island existed just to corral a living evil dust-creature brought back by accident from the Moon in during the Apollo flights. So much for my powers of deduction! This was based on an odd zoom-in shot of an Apollo candy bar during the second season, which apparently did not really have much meaning after all.<br /><br />In any case, most people know the story or watched it already and they are here looking for reviews on quality of picture, etc. From a technical standpoint, these discs are excellent. The picture quality is terrific - as with most modern blu-rays it can be too good - often if the camera operator is just a hair out of focus (pun intended) you will notice this whereas you would not be able to see the difference in standard definition.<br /><br />My wife and I also enjoyed many of the extra features but hands down our favorite was \\"season play.\\" This feature allows you to establish a \\"save point\\" which lets you to go back to exactly where you left off even after playing other discs in your player. This is an absolutely terrific feature for parents who might be able to steal just a little time once the kids are finally asleep - searching for just where you left off would otherwise be quite painful especially when stopping mid show.<br /><br />Anyway, whether you liked and want to re-watch the 6th season or if like us you realized a couple were missing from your TiVo so you just waited to get them on disc to watch commercial-free then this set is a good buy.y when stopping mid show.

B0044KU7KU|3.0|My Chemical Romance have been in my cd player constantly over the past 6 or 7 years. The Black Parade was hands down a great album, every song great and very catchy. So my expectations and anticipation were very very high for their new album, Danger Days... And then I saw their music video of Na Na Na and was instantly hooked. So yes, the album came out today. And too my utter dismay these songs are mediocre at best. Maybe 5 out of the 15 tracks are good and wouldn't you know it, the Na Na Na song happens to be the best song on the album. I understand they wanted to diversify themselves from the usual norm that goes with their genre. But when one song reminds me of a cheap knock off of Zebrahead's music and another a wanna be Beastie Boys I get disappointed. So all in all save yourself the money and just download it for the $3.99 amazon has it right now, and don't waste the extra $5 to get the cd and artwork. 4 years.... definitely expected more....this album should have only taken 1.5-2 years to come out. Oh well, maybe in another 4 years, I can hope these guys will go back to their vampire roots and put out their usual best like the first 3 albums.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Though many are not enthused by Kanye West's actions within public (especially at award shows and personal interviews), but you must give credit where credit is due. His latest CD, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" has been one of his best works since his Graduation CD. The cover sets the tone itself by showing the abstract-ness of the album. Its full of music that will have your head bobbin, feet tapping, and possibly singing along. Kanye West first single \\"Power\\" set the tone of the album and it goes hard! Its a strong tune that will have you jamming. Then as you listen along, there are some great songs. (Personal favorite is All of the Lights). Kanye West, you have outdone yourself this time. Kudos to a great album!
B004B8RWX0|5.0|Very well done.  The people are believable, the zombies seem real (without being over-the-top gory), the cinematography is outstanding, and even the score is great (ala 28 Days Later).  I just can't say enough about how well this is done.  Finally someone did it right!
B00382S9N2|5.0|Watching this brought back all those great feelings.  The chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey is amazing! When I watched this time, it was cool to think about the new stuff I learned about the movie from the book \\"The Fans' Love Story:  How the Movie 'Dirty Dancing\\" Captured the Hearts of Millions!\\"  The DVD is awesome, especially in light of some of the inside information I know now from the book.
B004B4J7H8|2.0|While the music fits the movie well enough while watching the film itself, the score really doesn't stand on its own for outside listening.
B004498KPU|3.0|I love MJ, but if i want to watch a MJ music video. I will go to youtube! Now to my main point if you were to add commentary (new footage)from MJ or other significant individuals associated with MJ. I will buy this product(5 times it retail price)!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Danger Days, the Fourth My Chem' record, is part of the best things you'll hear this year !  It mixes several kinds of rock, but all of those tracks are made with so much talent !  Definitively one of the best rock band since the beginning of the '00s !!
0451169514|4.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said. One of the few books to actually creep me out. Good book, had to skim some of the filler material but overall excellent book. My first Stephen King book too btw. Can't go wrong with this book.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|I like so many others saw \\"ultimate edition\\" and having bought the first two expected the extended edition of 3 and 4.  Well dummy me for thinking that way.  if you have already purchased these movies on Blu ray don't bother with the same movie again.  There is no extended version in these sets.  I was hoping that 4 would finally make sense but alas I am left with the travisty that was Mike Newels vision.  It is sad that Warner Brothers let us down.  They, and Amazon, should do the right thing and send us all the extended editions like we all expected.  I have read several reviews that noted an advertisement stating all ultimate editions would be extended.  If this is true someone please post that ad.  We can get Warner brothers for false advertising.  Come on Warners and Amazon.  Do the right thing for the fans.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|If you were wondering why a $55 disc is sold here for $25, wonder no more.  It does not play in most players.  After spending almost two hours finding a thumb drive, updating the BD firmware, it just wouldnt load.  I am guessing that you have to pay up the wazoo for an expensive BD player that would play this.  I have a Samsung  BD-C5500 and this is the only BD I have had problems with.  I tried it in my friends Pioneer Elite BDP-23FD and it played wonderfully.  Never mind that the Pioneer costs $400 more than my Samsung.  So if you have a new (less than a year) BD player and paide $400+ for it, go ahead and buy this piece of worthless...
B00006FDCD|3.0|IT makes for a good viewing, but probably just once or twice. It's good but read the novel if you want to be really scared.

B003U0AHBO|2.0|Robin Hood was just too dull, in my opinion. I appreciated the drab colors and decor but could not get into the movie. The acting all seemed fake and the story was too convoluted.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|New Composition a long time in the making for fans, but well worth the wait. The CD is a nice blend for people who have come to know how the Brothers stretch their music beyond just plain rock with songs that have great lyrics and songs that have meaning for all who listen. Mike McDonald joins in one song with his signature sound, as well as a very nice collaboration with Willy Nelson on another. The Doobies are currently touring in support of this effort and as a fan I encourage young and old to see them--they will not dissappoint.
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|While a lot of people are calling this album an instant classic and its receiving high praises all over the internet, I was not as impressed. It's a solid effort, with some absolutely standout tracks and overall great production. However, I have some issues with the album: there are way too many features; too much use of the vocoder; an overtly satanic/occult/hedonistic message throughout the entire thing; nothing impressive lyrically; several throwaway joints while I feel that there were many G.O.O.D. Friday tracks that were better than those that made the album.<br /><br />The positives:<br /><br />The best thing this album has going for it is its outstanding production, and for a lot of heads that don't pay attention to lyrics or care what he talking about, its enough to garner high reviews. Even though some of the production is more Hip-POP than Hip-Hop, its grade A all-around. All tracks were co-produced by 'Ye with help from the likes of RZA and No I.D. I was disappointed that Pete Rock and DJ Premier didn't make the album as originally promised.<br /><br />While the album didn't work overall for me, it did indeed have some amazing joints.<br /><br />The stellar tracks:<br />---------------------<br />Gorgeous ft. Raekwon and Kid Cudi - This is my joint right here. Along with Devil In A New Dress, best beat on the album. I also felt it was Kanye's best lyrical performance and Raekwon was the absolute best guest feature with a terrific verse.<br /><br />So Appalled ft. Jay-Z etc.  - While the subject matter doesn't appeal to me, the production and guest features all work very well here on a track that will get a lot of repeat listens. Originally a G.O.O.D. Friday track, thankfully it made the album.<br /><br />POWER - The production is this song is NUTS. So much energy and so infectious. Again, the lyrics do not appeal to me, and this is very occult in nature, but the production is so strong, it really is a can't miss song.<br /><br />Devil In A New Dress - This would be my favorite joint on the album, but the simple fact is: The G.O.O.D. Friday version, which is a solo version with just Kanye at under 3 minutes, is far superior to the auto-tune interlude and Rick Ross 6 minute version on the album. So just download the G.O.O.D. Friday version and delete the album version.<br /><br />Honorable mention - Dark Fantasy was also pretty dope, the RZA production was nice.<br /><br />Regardless, even though I enjoy these songs, as mentioned at the very top: The subject matter takes a lot of the enjoyment away, even on these great tracks.<br /><br />Now to my issues with the album, that make it far from a classic:<br /><br />Firstly, I think there were way too many features. Only 2 songs on the album do not have a feature. And every song is co-produced at the least, so in the end, not a single SOLO production from Kanye either. When I buy an album, I don't want to hear from a bunch of other artists. This is more like a collaborative effort if you ask me. Most of the features seem unnecessary, especially, as mentioned, the Rick Ross appearance on Devil In A New Dress.<br /><br />I also did not enjoy the frequent use of the vocoder/sound fx on Kanye's voice (and guests at times). I could not find a single instance in the album where I felt like it added to the song, and it always detracts from the experience for me. While he didn't use auto-tune, it is mighty similar.<br /><br />An important thing to me, and a huge detraction of West's work are his many satanic references and super egotistical lyrics that is his theme throughout the album. He has done this throughout his career (egocentric lyrics), but he has never romanced the devil and the occult more than on 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'. Much of this goes over the head of the average listener, but in a album with only 11 songs, the devil is specifically mentioned/talked about in 8 tracks. I am not Christian or religious, so that is not the issue here. For those who will say that I just 'Don't get it', I think it you all who don't get the underlying and overt messages Kanye is poisoning minds with.<br /><br />Beyond its content, the album did not impress me lyrically either. 'Ye never has been lyrically impressive but for a few verses/songs, so its not surprising. He has never used a multi-syllabic flow and complex metaphors. I'm simply not nearly as impressed as other people are with his lackluster punchlines that I personally believe are ghostwritten for him.<br /><br />For those who have been following his G.O.O.D. Friday tracks, the question has to be asked: How did some of those not make this album considering the several sub-par songs that did?  'The Joy', 'Don't Look Down', 'Lord, Lord, Lord', 'Chain Heavy', 'Christian Dior Denim Flow', 'Looking for Trouble' and  'Don't Stop' were all quality tracks that could have replaced the several mediocre pop joints that made the album.<br /><br />Quite frankly, his first two albums blow this out of the water. Whether or not you agree or disagree (most disagree from what I have seen), there it is. Those are my thoughts on the album.<br /><br />OVERALL -- 6.5 / 10<br /><br />I'll leave you with some real contenders for Album of the Year that REAL Hip-Hop fans should check out:<br /><br />The Roots - How I Got Over<br /><br />Big K.R.I.T. - K.R.I.T.

B00000G3I2|5.0|THE BIG CHILL is a recurring reunion: with every viewing it brings back memories of where we all have been in a period of time that seems so distant yet so important.  The film written (with Barbara Benedek) and directed by Lawrence Kasdan has reached icon status: it is as quality a memoir of baby boomer post college life that remains as poignant today as when it was released twenty seven years ago.<br /><br />Brought together for the funeral of suicide victim Alex, eight friends gather for a weekend of remembering and reliving the times when they were all students - Alex being the most promising of them all - and wondering what drove their little hero to kill himself.  Each of the friends, through self produced play with a video camera. Through intimate conversations, and through the psychology of group 'therapy' explains where they are now in comparison to where they thought they would be.  The only member of the group who is 'new' is Chloe (Meg Tilly) who had been Alex's girlfriend.  The group - Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, and Jobeth Williams interact philosophically, over food making in the kitchen of the Close/Kline home, share frustrations and fulfill expectations in both friendship and physical interactions.  Surrounding this film is a selection of popular songs from their time that extend into the memories of the viewers.  It is a funny film. a tender film, a tour de force of acting by some very fine actors, and a memory trip that is wroth repeating with some frequency, like opening the old photo album.  It has staying power.  Grady Harp, November 10
1439181780|4.0|The Power is...wait for it...wait for it...well, I guess telling you would be a spoiler.  Rhonda Byrne takes the idea of The Law of Attraction discussed in The Secret and boils it down to the source of power in The Power.  The general premise of the book makes sense.  The idea that we receive what we give rings true.  When we feel positive and project good feelings out into the world, we're more likely to notice the good things in our lives.  When we spend our lives focused on the negative, then life feels negative and bad all the time.  Her descriptions of using imagination to manifest our desires in life is intriguing and encouraging if at times a bit difficult to wholeheartedly believe.  The Power loses me when it talks about our responsibility for other people's behavior towards us, but even more so when it talks about using the Power to heal one's physical ailments and injuries.  The book is written in clear language if a bit redundant at times.  While frustrating at times, The Power provides some wonderful insights and moments that are bound to lead to personal growth.  Overall, The Power is an interesting study in the effects of positive thinking.

0385512058|2.0|I got the audiobook, not printed book, so my experiences are with that.    Like reading a boastful autobiography full of name dropping? This might be the audiobook for you. No? Skip it.    Rather than demonstrate thanks to his blue collar father for providing his elite high school education, leading the way to Yale, he actually says that his blue collar upbringing helped his future success. What blue collar upbringing? His father was poor, yes, yet he worked his butt off to get his son to a prepatory school. His best friend's parents were rich, he spent all his time there. He caddied, but then also fraternized with those he caddied. His story is NO different than others that have a elite prepatory school education leading to Yale, fraternities, and the good ol' boy network. A real Pennsylvania blue collar upbringing would be someone who went to the crummy working class high school he left behind, had no contacts when 14, maybe went to community college or maybe went straight to Yale. He was not longer blue collar once he figured out what was blue collar. He was already neck deep with the upper crust.    After you get that junk story (well, before too, but it gets worse as it goes on), you get the name dropping. Sometimes it is just a hint of a name, other times he is more straightforward. I really do not care about his exploits. It never educated me on tips or strategies to meet with this person, I think he just wanted to name drop as much as possible.    Skip this book unless you are one of Ferrazzi's friends. And even then give the same fake smile that he gives you. There is SOME good information in this audiobook, too bad you have to go through disk and disk of self promoting fluff to get to it. This is one book I WISH was abridged. Skip it.
0240808452|5.0|This is not a how to draw book, it teaches principles and techniques to draw with purpose,<br />making lively character drawings that don't look stiff and lifeless like beginning artists will make,<br />it is not a fun book with pretty pictures, the book has to be read and drawings studied to understand the writers explanations, the books theme throughout is FORCE, FORM and SHAPE, which is covered to some extent in other books but not as well as this book, highly recommend to serious aspiring artists!!!

You can say nothing except listening to breathlessly when Igor Stravinsky, as both the composer and the exponent, conducts the performances of almost all his own music, to say nothing of the consistently excellent sound quality, which is especially important to the music of Stravinsky. Many thanks to Sony/CBS production team who made not only excellent original recordings but also marvellous CD transfers. A great achievement indeed!     I would also like to recommend everyone Stravinsky's small but meaningful book 'Poetics of Music'. It tells you what his attitudes to music are, illuminates further your experience of listening to his music and lets you know why so much influence he has long had on other composers of the world.     Let's go back to Stravinsky's music and enjoy it...
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|Very underrated show. The Blu-Ray is packed with excellent features and season three is by far some of the best tv you will ever see.
B001HN694K|4.0|At first I thought this was the typical post-modern feminist redux for a classic, and so settled in to simply enjoy the design.  And I wasn't dissapointed.  It's a feast for the eyes.
B003YWUTJI|3.0|Not being a huge fan of Norah I may not be the most qualified person to say this - but this album was just odd.  There were a few songs on this album worth listening to (Love Me, Loretta, Dear John), but many left me scratching my head wondering what she and her producer were thinking.  Definitely not my favorite album of hers.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Just over a year and a half ago, Nicki remixed Kanye's infamous \\"Go Hard\\" and muttered a line: \\"And I'm telling President Carter he picked a winner..\\" A year and a half later, she is gracing every magazine cover in the nation, performing sold-out shows, and completely shifting the world of music: One alter-ego at a time.<br /><br />I've followed her career almost 4 years, and it's amazing to see how much she's accomplished and branded herself throughout entertainment.  She broke major records when she appeared in 7 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2010 alone, all before she unleashed her debut album.<br /><br />To those wishing she would morph back into the \\"old\\" Nicki, it won't happen because she has moved past mixtapes, street DVD's, and remixed compilations. Onika Maraj has evolved into an artist. Her music has flourished along with her outlook on life, this evident on \\"Pink Friday.\\"<br /><br />The album kicks off with a self-declaration by The Harajuku Barbie herself claiming she is undisputedly \\"The Best\\" and welcomes any competition either male or female. Her smash singles \\"Your Love,\\" \\"Right Thru Me,\\" and \\"Check It Out\\" all appear on the album, but Nicki kept her debut single \\"Massive Attack\\" off of the album release.  She receives some star-power assistance with features from Eminem, Drake, Rihanna, Natasha Bedingfield, and Will.i.am.<br /><br />Nicki shows her vulnerability on the catchy \\"Save Me,\\" and acknowledges her power and control as a woman on \\"Here I Am.\\" Her alter-ego Roman Zolanski gives us everything we need on \\"Roman's Revenge,\\" which is quite possibly the most lucratively lyrical joint on the album. Pink Friday is a nice blend of intensity, strength, emotion, and originality. What ultimately separates Nicki from the entire rap genre is her continuous effort to grow. If you don't understand her image or take a liking to her \\"Barbie\\" phenomena, you cannot argue this woman isn't THE hottest, most talked-about emcee on the planet. \\"Pink Friday\\" represents growth, creativity, and ultimately carves a lane in hip-hop Nicki can call her own.  Love her or hate her, she is the best.. And yes, Lil Wayne picked a winner.ultimately carves a lane in hip-hop Nicki can call her own.  Love her or hate her, she is the best..

B0042RUMG4|5.0|I cant do a review of all the songs so I will just give you my own and hope it helps you.  I will first say that the only thing I HATE ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS THE SHORT TRACK LIST.  Besides that I LOVE THIS ALBUM,ITS A CLASSIC ROC-A-FELLA KANYE WEST ALBUM.  The opening track spoken by Nicki Minaj(which is cool that everybody is on each others album in some way) leads into Kanye spitting his behind off on that track.This album really shows Kanye going back to his lyricism that he displayed on College Dropout,and blending it in with Late Registration style,but improved. The instruments,and production is solid with help by RZA,Mike Dean,Jeff Bhasker,Emile,S1,Bink(who also helped create than classic album we call The Blueprint by Jay-Z with Kanye back in the day.  Basically if your a fan of Hip-Hop,music in general(meaning your open to all kinds of music,are looking for a new genre of music to explore,a big Kanye West fan like me,then you should get this album,and if you like the movie,get the Deluxe Version as well its weird but in a cool way. I was saying Drakes Thank me later was album of the year but This might win that vote in the end,sorry but MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY IS BETTER THAN EMINEMS RECOVERY,AND RICK ROSS'S TEFLON DON ALBUM.  Roc-A-Fella Records Since 1996 just release a heat rock for hip-hop to listen to and enjoy. Happy Holidays(if you celebrate them)

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I just love this show so much, I had to pipe in.  I don't own Season 1 on DVD yet, but I saw every episode as they aired.  It's a beautiful mixture of pop culture from my youth (those in their 30s, I think, will appreciate it the most)combined with clever comic writing and timing, all rolled up with a stand-out ensemble cast who all play off each other brilliantly.  I admit I may be biased due to the fact that the group of friends on the show sort of remind me of my misfit friends from college, not to mention the vibe at Greendale Community eerily resembles the one my now-defunct 4-year school did :) But I think anyone who likes funny will love Community.    Watch and repeat.  It doesn't get much better than this.

0316069884|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer weaves together a compelling look at Americans' relationship with animals.  He is inquisitive rather than judgmental, curious and exacting.  Thorough research combined with poignant and often withering observations help to unravel the complex situation of factory farming and being a meat-eater.  Very readable and highly recommended!
B004097IKW|3.0|I'd been waiting on this release for sometime now ... perhaps the anticipation diminished the excitement I was expecting to experience.  On the whole, it's a fine, sturdy production of Bellini's masterpiece - nothing more nothing less.  As everyone concurs, it's Juan Diego's vehicle and that fact never gets challenged during this performance.  He's in fine form, but not exceptional as is often found.  He doesn't take this role as high as in previous outings in this role, erring on the side of caution.  While this takes nothing away, it does punctuate the restraint that seems felt in this performance in total by it's entire company.  It is a very studied performance ... It is my belief that this overall tone comes from too dictated direction, rehearsing and the rigors of filming the work ... it lacks the spark and spontaneity that is essential in bel canto operas ... it is simply overworked.  Visually appealing, excellent sound quality - But, given the promotion of being 'filmed in High-Definition\\" - I'm greatly sorry to see no Blu-Ray edition available, only DVD - thus, that labeling does little good as we cannot watch it in high-def.  In support of Florez, Nino Machaidze provides a technically sound Elvira, slightly dark, yet unable to command the sympathy necessary to believe in her characterization.  Ildebrando D'Arcangelo delivers an unusually restrained performance, never quite hitting the mark.  His duets with Ugo Guagliardo are further marred by the latter's limited voice/vocal technique -  I'm afraid what can often happen in I Puritani, it can become rather puritan - the beauty of it's score is reliant upon exceptional singers, exceptional signing and all the stars in alignment ... it equally takes all four leads to pull it off effectively - while certainly a fine performance, I'm afraid we were a few stars short of alignment.
B0046IGOIO|4.0|Albert King opened for The Doors in Vancouver June 6, 1970, The Doors asked him to jam with them for four blues standards, they were only months away from starting the recording of L.A. Woman in the fall of that year. And from the versions of the songs The Doors played \\"Live in Vancouver\\" it seems they already had the blues on their minds.<br /><br />There was some experimenting going on in Vancouver. The Doors were seemed to be pushing the limits of rock or at least stretching those limits between rock and the blues. At first it sounds like the Vancouver show is more sedate (not sedated) than the Felt Forum shows a few months prior.  Upon a closer listening you can see The Doors were going for more of a bluesy feeling than a hard rock sound, and explains why Morrison, in introducing Albert King gives a quick tutorial to the audience about the two main indigenous forms of American music blues and country coming together in rock `n' roll, he`s tipping the audience off as to what they're doing.<br /><br />The instrumentals in most of the songs highlights the bluesy feeling such as in \\"5-1\\" and \\"Light My Fire.\\" While they didn't change the song substantially, during the instrumental of \\"Light My Fire\\" Morrison comes in using \\"St. James Infirmary\\" as a starting point and slips in some bucolic, blues tinged imagery from \\"Porgy and Bess\\" to highlight the blusier aspects of The Doors usual repertoire \\"the fish were jumping, and the cotton is high.\\" What band today of the same caliber as The Doors would or could risk such onstage experimentation?<br /><br />That's not to say The Doors didn't delve into their psychedelic roots they played \\"When The Music's Over\\" and an interesting rendition of The End.  Early in their career The Doors were interested in dissonance for their experimental journeys, in Vancouver they show that assonance had taken over their experimental interest. The End in Vancouver is a mature rendering of that song, it isn't as frantic as earlier versions, The Doors let it play out like a noir film, Morrison stacking the familiar images upon each other, until the dramatic crashing climax, creating a movie for the mind of the audience.<br /><br />Albert King played four songs with the band onstage, \\"Little Red Rooster,\\" \\"Money,\\" \\"Rock Me,\\" and \\"Who Do You Love.\\" King's solos on these songs, like the rest of the CD doesn't display a lot of unnecessary pyrotechnics but is solid playing all the way through.<br /><br />I've been to a lot of rock concerts and listened have listened to a lot of live albums but none of those seem to have the context or coherence that The Doors were able to imbue into their best shows, and this is one of their best.<br /><br />These Bright Midnight releases are great for fans like me who didn't have the connections to get bootlegs, or weren't' collectors but still longed to hear the shows they've long heard about. The Bright Midnight releases are like raiding The Doors archives without having to worry about the quality, the sound is crisp and clear. The liner notes give you some background right from The Doors' own pens that's more reliable than second generation legend. \\"The Doors Live in Vancouver\\" will make a nice addition to your collection.<br /><br />Jim writes The Doors Examiner.like a noir film, Morrison stacking the familiar images upon each other, until the dramatic crashing climax, creating a movie for the mind of the audience.

B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I've been looking forward to this album for the entire past year, heck probably longer. 808's was some wonderful, bold, pioneering music and I knew that the next Kanye drop needed to be amazing. It's been about 2 years since that. Release date pushed back time after time, multiple name changes, cover art scandal, some controversial singles, and it's finally time.<br /><br />But November rolls around, I take a glance at the track listing. What the hell!<br /><br />13 tracks, not a bad length. I look closer: 1, 2, 3... 7! Of the 13 songs on the album, only 6 will be new music to me! Are you serious? I love you Kanye for giving us those amazing early Christmas presents in the form of G.O.O.D. Friday drops, but I had no idea those were the same tracks that would be making their way onto the album!<br /><br />After waiting 2 years, 3 if you're only counting the classic Kanye, to get my hands on this red-tainted album, I find myself with just 6 tracks? I still love you for G.O.O.D. Fridays, but look at Eminem: A year after Relapse, the guy comes out with Recovery bursting with 17+2 tracks. Please keep that in mind for that next album, Kanye!<br /><br />All that said, I spent the cash without regret, especially with AmazonMP3's release day pricing. Ima let you finish, Apple, but Amazon has the greatest music download prices of all time, ALL TIME!

It has great picture quality and it is long enough for most jobs. Don't be fooled by other brands that says you will get better picture quality. If were true, I am sure the naked eye can even see it or care for. Great cables, a must have for your entertainment system or game consoles.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|I want to preface this review that as much as I am happy to see the quality in Blu Ray, there really needs to be some kind of standard that makes it easier to stop playing guessing games as to if a product will play in your machine or device.<br /><br />The first release [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]] of this product plays just fine in my [[ASIN:B002EE996Q LITE-ON 4x Blu-ray Disc SATA Internal Optical Drive iHOS104]] player. So when I start up this set in my player, I encounter the problem \\"This content Does not support the use of a mouse\\"<br /><br />It seemed to be kind enough to pop up one note about going to a site to figure out if your firmware or device could play it. The problem was, we only got this message once and could never get it to run again. So after sleuthing on the net to find out what to do - a warning for you PC owners who run blu Ray with PowerDVD - version 8 doesn't seem to want to run this disc. You need a later version and need to either be able to get keyboard shortcuts or the virtual remote option in version 10<br /><br />I wanted to post that information in case someone else is looking for a solution or help some people out. As a consumer I feel like we're caught in the middle of this finger pointing game as to what works and what doesn't and why.<br /><br />As for the product. DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY. All the extras and features I waited for. The first release I knew didn't have it and waited for this one. I was watching with a friend and we were delighted by the new footage for this movie. The fact you keep receiving new content with the BDJ Live is interesting.<br /><br />Obviously the story isn't something we're unfamiliar with but the quality of the CG is top notch. All the work that went into rendering the forest, trees and characters set a new standard. However, it wasn't without some drawbacks. I think Cameron can ease up on the \\"slowmo\\" on certain action shots. It actually pulled me out of the experience of forgetting they were CG characters, because it caused those very characters to exhibit movements that were just a bit \\"foreign\\". Oddly enough I found the bipedal mechs too \\"Rubbery\\" compared to the organic creatures.<br /><br />For the quality of the discs, I'm still trying to figure out if it's an issue with PowerDVD the software to watch DVDs or a fimrware issue (I updated to the latest) computer hardware issue or an issue with the DVDs themselves. We experienced some stutters and \\"digital\\" scrambles during the movie. It wasn't where it became unwatchable but it was annoying enough to notice. The picture quality was incredible however. If I get the chance to own a 3DTV I'd definitely buy the 3D version of this movie.<br /><br />Despite this though, as I said it is worth purchasing the extended collection as a consumer who waited patiently for this release.g they were CG characters, because it caused those very characters to exhibit movements that were just a bit \\"foreign\\".

B004222UCS|3.0|All is well with the ongoing reissue program except for the fact that the live disc included here is of HORRENDOUS sound quality and prospective buyers should've been told so in the advertising and packaging. It's no more than an audience bootleg and that's a real shame.
B004DC2WF2|5.0|Finally, a serious treatment of the zombie apocalypse...for Tee Vee!  AMC has decided to put unique, quality entertainment on the small screen, and \\"the walking dead\\" is a great addition.  Very intense, great zombie action, but also great characters; you have more to fear from the humans than the undead in this iteration.  Awesome!
B003L20ICE|3.0|I was digging everything about this movie, the two female leads and their kids are very believable as a family and I liked that. It was the plot twist, made to blow everything sky high, that really bothered me and my wife. We couldn't really believe what was happening and that really pissed the whole movie for us. I guess it says a lot about the actors' abilities that we almost couldn't even watch when the so called twist developed into something more, it felt a little too voyeuristic and it saddened the whole experience of the movie. So I guess it's a big 5 stars for the actors but the movie's contrivances really left little to be desired.

014241543X|5.0|I usually don't expect much literature from young adult genre writers, but this book has proven me wrong. It is a wonderful and poetic look at this world and the decisions we make...also, the decisions that are made for us. I have recommended this book to anyone who will listen. It is very endearing and appropriate whether you are a teenager, twenty-something, or going through a mid-life crisis. Without giving away too much, I found myself yearning for one ending and then switching to root for the other possible ending. On the surface, it's about life and death, but goes much deeper than that. This is definitely going out to every reader on my Christmas list. Also would be a good book to get a shy or inward teen into reading. But please read it even if you're not even a teenager.  Also odd for me to comment on a cover, but the photo is as souful as the book. my favorite book of the year!
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie in the theatre laughing with my girlfriends and had as much fun the second time around at home alone.  This movie is about extremes of all kinds - places, styles and emotions.  Throw in some opulence and many unrealistic lifestyles and you have great escapism from a hard fought daily life. This film will never be a classic, but it offers a chance to disappear into a different world for a few hours and get lost in fantasy.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|With today's music that's either overrated, over produced & just plain garbage, there are a few artists that rise from the ashes and record amazing music. Since his debut in 2004, Kanye is one artist that's never boring artistically & personally. Kanye also doesn't half step with the music & he expect other artists to do the same as well. That should also goes to record executives who sign artists that have mediocre or zero talent. With that said, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" is 2010 Album Of The Year. While other rappers talk about the women, alcohol & money, Kanye talks about the dark side of that life & then some. Each track is beyond amazing. The production on this album is top notch & musically Kanye has top himself. Instead of sticking to the same formula, he's take rap/hip hop to a different direction & a new level. Thank you Kanye for sharing your gift and making the best music for the past seven years. Right now, you're the only artist that matters.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|When Sting originally announced that he was going to tour with a full fifty piece orchestra and perform his best known songs I was a little sceptical. How could that possibly work? Well, five months in, it is apparent just how wrong I was to harbour any doubts. The 'Symphonicity' shows have been spectacular successes since the tour launched in Vancouver earlier this year and have since garnered glowing accolades in the media. When I attended several of the shows, I was totally blown away by the whole experience and quickly realised how short-sighted my initial scepticism had been.    'Live in Berlin' is produced by Jim Gable and Ann Kim who have been responsible for previous Sting releases such as 'A Winter's Night... Live from Durham Cathedral', 'The Journey and the Labyrinth', 'Inside The Songs of Sacred Love', and '...All This Time' as well as 'The Police: Certifiable'. They have successfully captured the feel of the 'Symphonicity' concerts and while there are obvious limitations to the presentation of a show of this size given the sheer number of musicians on stage, the clever use of three large light boxes above the stage - which occasionally provide live and video footage - light the show superbly and provide subtle, tasteful lighting throughout the concert. The DVD also includes Sting's spoken introductions to several songs, where he explains the inspiration behind a song or offers some other biographical background, and while this would be distracting in a faster paced rock concert, here it works well.    The highlights are numerous. Take for example, the unmistakable sound of special guest Branford Marsalis who adds his saxophone to 'Englishman in New York', 'Mad About You' and 'Desert Rose'. The word genius could have been coined for Marsalis who adds class to everything he touches, but the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra also has their stars. 'All Would Envy' spotlights Chris Cotter's stellar trumpet playing, and Concertmaster Gerald Gregory's violinintroduction to 'Whenever I Say Your Name' is so exquisite it sends tingles down your spine.    Sting's core group, consisting of Ira Coleman (bass), David Cossin and Rhani Krija (percussion), the ever present Dominic Miller (guitar) and Jo Lawry (vocals), are outstanding, but it's worth singling out the talent that is Jo Lawry. Two tracks in particular showcase her superbly and both are duets with Sting. On 'Whenever I Say Your Name' she comfortably fills the part originally provided by the powerful Mary J. Blige - and on 'You Will Be My Ain True Love' the combination of her voice with Sting's provides a sublime result.    The 'Symphonicity' tour offers something for everyone. The hits? Check. The obscure? Check. The never before performed live? Check. Personal high spots have to include 'Why Should I Cry For You?' with its' intro borrowed from 'Island Of Souls', 'All Would Envy', 'The End Of The Game' and 'She's Too Good For Me'. But do you know what? Watch 'Roxanne' and be stunned at how Sting manages to reinterpret and refresh one of his oldest and most classic songs with cello and clarinet solos. Simply breathtaking.    Rounding off the DVD is 'A Conversation with Sting', an interview segment where he explains how the idea for the tour developed, his philosophy that songs are not museum pieces and how he constantly tries to reinvent his music. The footage where he is joined by Branford Marsalis is especially enjoyable - their easy friendship and mutual respect is immediately apparent.    All in all, this is an excellent reminder of a highly memorable tour. In our household it will also serve as a reminder not to jump to conclusions and to keep an open mind!
038572179X|5.0|Atonement is one of the best novels I have read, in  a long time. The fact that it was nominated for the Booker Prize was not a surprise but the fact that it lost was!<br /><br />This book is a haunting and beautiful work of literature that will move you. Tears are a definite in the end. Apart from being a very well-written book, Atonement is also an intricate study of the human psyche.<br /><br />Its 1935. Briony Tallis, 13 years old attempts to stage a play she has written. She lives in a world of imagination. Every simple thing  assumes gigantic proportions in her mind. This fantasy world wreaks havoc when she comes upon a scene with her sister, Cecelia and Robbie, their servant's son.Briony's overactive mind creates a meaning that is completely exaggerated. In her innocence , she accuses Robbie of a crime...and it changes everyone's lives forever. Atonement is about Briony's search for forgiveness , for what she did.<br />The character development is very well-done.One of the major points of the book is how everyone perceives differently. I may see something as being completely different from what the other person sees. This very difference in perception can change , even destroy everything.<br /><br /> The love story in the book was beautiful- this coming from someone who despises romances!The intriguing plot of the novel will stay with you, will linger in your mind. This was a very emotional read for me.<br /><br />One mistake , made in complete innocence, can wreak havoc and destroy lives. We continue to pay the price for that mistake forever and no matter what we do, we can never fully atone for it. Regret..guilt..nothing hurts more than that. It seeps into your very soul and is worse than physical pain. Ian McEwan has captured this beautifully.<br /><br />The author forces the reader to ponder upon themes of innocence, passion, love, truth, guilt, wrong/right or black/white. If the world was just black and white, things would be so much simpler, but its not that way.<br /><br />The author also delves deep into the \\"irony\\" of human nature - our hypocrisies, our idiosyncrasies, our weaknesses...

B00288KNL8|4.0|After very disappointing \\"Monkeybone,\\" Henry Selick, director of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach (1996)\\", has returned with \\"Coraline,\\" a delightful stop-motion animated fantasy tale - a bit dark one as based on a Neil Gaiman book. This is a modern-day adventure of Alice-like spirited heroine encountering these eccentric characters in another universe, some of which could be as terrifying as the head-chopping Queen of Hearts.    Coraline Jones (voice by Dakota Fanning) has recently moved in the 150-year-old Pink Palace Apartments. The 11-year-old girl has no friends to talk to, except a slightly nervous boy \\"Wybie\\" (Robert Bailey, Jr.). And Coraline's parents Charlie (voice by John Hodgman) and Mel (voice by Teri Hatcher) are too busy.    But Coraline, an independent, intelligent and curious girl, finds a strange door while exploring the old house. She then discovers a big secret about it. Through the door, only at night, she can go to the \\"other\\" world, where she meets the \\"Other Mother\\" and the \\"Other Father.\\" The other parents are caring and loving - and the Other Father, always delightful, is an incredibly gifted pianist!     It is only natural that Coraline starts visiting the other world frequently. But there is another big secret about the wonderful world and its inhabitants Coraline has not known yet.      The storyline itself may not b exactly original and Coraline's adventure (or \\"game\\") is not really an adventure to some, but like many classic fairy tales \\"Coraline\\" is most intriguing and disturbing when it suggests the fate of those who have made a wrong decision. With colorful and imaginative (and sometimes even creepy) visuals, strong voice acting from Dakota Fanning giving life to the heroine, \\"Coraline\\" is an engaging fantasy with some dark edges.
0743424425|5.0|First time reading from Stephen King and I must say I'm amazed. I don't usually books but this one kept me going.  I cannot wait until I get my hands on another title.
0028643151|2.0|Giant asteroids are about to smash into the earth.  Terrorists are on the verge of releasing deadly pathogens into the air that will kill everyone. Bioengineering blunders will create new forms of life that will destroy all that came before them. Earth will be unlivable in any event as a new ice age will cover much of the earth in glacial ice sheets. And Moran tells us again and again that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that can be done about it.<br /><br />There are some redeeming features here.  The disaster scenarios at the start of each chapter are fairly good; some scientific discussion does take place.  The chapter on the coming ice age does give the reader some good food for thought, laying out some of the leading theories. But ninety percent of this book is sensationalized scare mongering.  Take the chapter on insect invasions.  We know some species are migrating to new locations and causing costly problems. But Moran insists it is all much worse.  He describes Army ants from the tropical jungle invading American homes and devouring babies.  Killer bee colonies in the Southwest become so bad that Las Vegas becomes a 'glittering ghost town'.  Really?  Cyberterrorism, he notes, may succeed in killing thousands upon thousands in the midwest, freezing people in the winter following a grid shutdown.<br /><br />The biggest problem here isn't that the author is trying to shock or scare us. These scenarios are indeed scary.  But the author's hyperbole and hysteria make the subject more comical than serious.  Why not a more balanced report?  Which dangers are the most likely?  What are we best and least prepared for?  Moran is certainly wrong in concluding that there is nothing we can do about any of this. We might be overwhelmed, but we certainly won't disappear quickly without a fight.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Just finished watching it. Great love story. In the gay genre it's at the top of the heap (the gay movies out there are really not so good). In the non-gay genre. It's still at the top of the heap.    It's a fantastic film. Great acting. Great cinema-photography. Great direction.     I wanted to fall in love and surf after seeing this movie.    One small problem is at the end. They didn't tie up the loose end of who will look after a certain someone with back problems.    --------  Jan 2011. Since I wrote my review, I've viewed a bunch of gay-themed movies. And it's really hard to find a nice, well-acted, directed, gay love story. This is more a coming out/love story but it's still sooooo nice. And tops the list of gay movies. I feel it's up there with Latter Days, Just Say Love, Thirteen or So Minutes (a short film), All Over the Guy and Antartica (I liked how straight forward the movie showed gay relationships).     Thinking of Shelter and certain moments in the movie in particular, gives me just a nice feeling of warmth and love.

B0029XZODY|5.0|Dexter is always fascinating, but this season was quite a bit different from the first two seasons...in an odd way.  There is much more sexual content, so if this bothers you, you might not want to view this season.  [[ASIN:B0029XZODY Dexter: The Third Season [Blu-ray]]]
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|So here it is...Mr. West back at it despite all the hate and disdain thrown around from the media. His work speaks for itself on this album, and this is def. his best produced album to date! Lyrics are some of the best of his career...ex. Dark Fantasy first track is ridunkulous lol and he gives a big shot out to my 2nd fav. rapper Nas! Fav. tracks: Dark fantasy,so appalled, Runaway, Blame game, hell all of it is great so i suggest everyone buys this classic album pronto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enjoy the great music everyone!!

B003ZHQVJO|3.0|I found this album to be a bit disappointing compared to the past work of Kid Rock.  The writing is good and I appreciate the lyrics, but the music just isn't there.  The band simply has no style which gives the songs a very generic feel.  I have been a huge Kid Rock fan for many years and have always enjoyed his shows.  Unfortunately, nothing about this album makes me want to see it live.<br />Kid Rock knows how to rock and so does Twisted Brown Trucker.  This album took away TBT and added Rick Ruben.  In my opinion it just fell flat.
B003XTUZIM|1.0|First off, the 30th anniversary issues of Wake and Islands were just awful. Larks a crime. Lizard was passable. The 1st was about as good as it will get. Red I was afraid to touch after all this. So now we have a re-mix and a bunch more in a format that most people have no use for. As far as I'm concerned it's 2010 and there is still no good issue of Wake and Islands. I really don't know what Fripp is trying to sell here? DVD audio players? I won't be buying this. I sure hope he is going to release ALL this material on regular CD. It's really a shame that this great material is not properly treated by responsible marketers. And I am tired of hearing Fripp whine about bootlegs in all his liner notes but is no better at it....hey, I have a better idea, why not release it in SACD.......(days later) Anyway, I am glad my review caused such a stir. To the guy who said, \\" 5.1 reissues also come with a Red Book Compact Disc (RBCD),\\" I assume he means the one disk that can be played on a regular CD player. No? I looked up RBCD and made what I could of it. Yes?, No? but that is the 2010 remixed version, no?, and if it is anything like the 2010 Court Of remix, I would not be exactly thrilled. And why should I be forced to buy the rest of it I cannot play just to get the one good disk? The idea 'you can hear things that were buried in the mix' should not be. This means it was re-mixed and altered in some way. The Doors did a whole 40th anniversary series bringing up things in the mix that were buried, and they are not really the same recordings. However, the Doors acknowledge this. In Fripp's case, this is altering history in a way I find disturbing. Well, without a DVD-audio, I cannot hear it, or most of it. I will not go out and buy something just to listen to this one issue. Besides, I do not feel I need to hear it in order to knock it. It is the format I am complaining about. Look, music can only sound so good. It cannot be made to sound 'better and better', it can only bealtered, and once it is perfected rightly, it can only be altered for the worse. Fripp chose not to perfect it, but to alter it. And to strangely promote DVD-audios for his corporate boss, Universal. Thanks, for the advice, y'all, and I will take it  with good will, etc. But I see others now sticking DVDs in with CDs, forcing them on us,  and I see it as a result of the mergers between the electronics industry, the movie industry, and the music industry. This is what they called a monopoly in the past, and it has been deemed illegal at times because it limits choice, and that is exactly what Fripp has done and what I am complaining about: my choice being messed with......oh yea my comment about issuing it on SACD was actually a joke as it is a dead format, as I hope this trend becomes...(Later) it seems some people have suggested that the DVD can be played on a regular CD player. It can't.  I tried it with the DVD in the Court Of box. If they mean it can be played on any old DVD player, but without `the resolution.'  I only use mine to rent from the library as so few good movies come out these days. And so few Crimson recordings, too. When I look at Fripp's whole history, from the lousy 30th issues, to those rare live ones from the 90s that went in and out of print and now go for big bucks, to his sensitivity about people taking his picture in the audience, to his attitude towards `bootlegs' and all the way down to this strange issue, he seems to delight in making his stuff not easily available. There is a cynicism and spite around so much of what he does. It would not surprise me if he issued those lousy 30th issues deliberately. Virgin usually does a good job.  -   Oh, by the way, I noticed my Who Tommy Deluxe is a 5.1 surround disk. But it is a single layered disk and can be played on both. So, it was totally unnecessary for Fripp to release this in this way: EXCEPT FOR ONE THING:  5.1 audio only players are obsolete now. I guess no one wanted them. So, he released this on DVD in order to accommodate the DVD  player. If 5.1 layered audio was not obsolete, he could have satisfied everyone and released the bonus material on the Islands DVD in regular and surround and could have saved people some money on Wake.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Anne Elliot is the quiet, tractable daughter of a widower to whom rank and consequence is of first importance in his life.  She's never gotten over her first love, Frederick Wentworth, whom she was convinced not to marry, as he lacked both status and wealth.  Now, at 27, she's fated to be a spinster for life, passed back and forth between her father and equally status-conscious elder sister and her hypocondriac, self-centered younger sister.     Frederick Wentworth, on the other hand, did not pine away, but joined the Royal Navy and made a not-inconsiderable fortune.  A series of strange events forces them into each other's company again, but Anne is reluctant to show any favoritism for fear of looking like a fortune hunter, and Captain Wentworth has no desire to be burned again.    This is one of Jane Austen's quieter novels.  We know from the beginning Anne and the Captain will fall in love all over again -- the enjoyment is in getting there.  Not quite up there with her other novels, in my opinion, but if you're a fan of Jane Austen or just the genre, it's worth a read.
0143034901|5.0|I read this book in spanish which is the language it was written.<br />I enjoyed it a lot and strongly recomend it.
B0043RSIUK|5.0|Without a doubt this is one of the best books I've read. Couldn't put it down and can't wait to read the next one. I highly recommend it.
1439163146|1.0|I'm Franco's age and grew up in Palo Alto, and though this is fictional, I find the entire book insulting. It is not representational of families, teens and children from this city. It's Cather in the Rye dribble.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I enjoyed so much to watch the DVD. To see how they were having a great time while playing super guitar blues! Of course the CD was also great, but must admit that I specially was having a great time watching the two guitar heroes!  Just sad that they both died short time after...
B003W5C0VM|5.0|I first saw this film when it first came out. Amazing there was a total white 20 minute introduction that went right into the movie at its first release. The critics panned it badly. I like this film because it showcases Mick Taylors true guitar form. Sadly it was his last tour with the Stones, being replaced by Ronnie Wood for the '75 tour.

It was even more suspensful than the first book, my heart was racing throughout most of this book, wondering what would happen next. I couldn't stop reading this one, there were a lot of great twists. I cannot wait until the third book comes out!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great transfers, more features than i can shake a stick at. I've owned a few box sets in the past, Alien Quadrilogy being one of them and i'm blown away by the effort that has gone into this anthology.    Best Blu-ray buy yet!

B0039WHKD6|5.0|If this movie had not been released the same year as Patton it quite likely would have garnered the Best Picture Oscar as well as several others, including sound,cinematography,special effects and Direction. Outstanding production values. That being said,however, I firmly believe $53 for this BluRay dvd cannot be justified. I have the standard dvd and unless someone comes to their senses I guess I will have to be happy with it unless the price drops below $30.
0375842209|4.0|Marketed as a book for Young Adults, Markus Zusak's 'The Book Thief' loses nothing in the hands of an adult.  I enjoyed it a great deal, as did the five adults who read this copy before me.  With Death as the narrator (a perspective that takes some doing over 550+ pages) and non-combatant Germans as its protagonists, it's a rather unique perspective from a writer who hails from an English-speaking country.  Australian author Zusak is the son an Austrian father and German mother.  The stories he heard growing up form the basic touchstones of the book.<br /><br />You have to admire an author with the courage to bring his work to a realistic denouement.  With the Allies' bombers closing in, forced inscription to the Russian front, and Jews frogmarched through the center of town, things aren't going to end well for all of Zusak's characters.  What Zusak gives his young adult readers is a stark reminder on the true cost of war.

1439152780|4.0|Morton's books have a definite plot structure - family secrets that are slowly unveiled through interwoven stories from multiple points of view of the past and present - but it works for her!    Edie Burchill is an only child; she loves her parents but isn't particularly close to them even though she longs to know more about them as individuals. When her mother receives a letter that was caught up in the postal service for fifty years, Edie gets a glimpse of a side of her mother that she has never seen before and is eager to learn more.    The letter, combined with some serendipitous events, leads Edie on a path to discover the events during World War II that caused her mother to be evacuated to a country estate under the care of the eccentric Blythe sisters, the true story behind the classic children's novel The Mud Man, and the dark secrets that they Blythe family continues to hide a half century and more after their occurrence.    Morton has a wonderful way with words, she paints such a vivid picture of the characters and surroundings that I am instantly transported into her world. She is descriptive without be clinical or flowery - and I think that is a hard balance to strike. However, her plots are wonderfully circuitous but fairly easy to figure out; I read for the journey of getting to the end and not for the surprise revelation that is waiting. Even so, there are some minor twists and turns that add to the enjoyment of reading even if they don't spur you on to the next.    If you are a fan of Morton - as I am - then this book will not be a let down! If you are new to Morton, any of her books are a wonderful introduction to her body of work that is small as of yet but highly enjoyable....just don't read them all back-to-back!
B004132HZS|5.0|It was hard for me to think of Sherlock Holmes in the 21st century, BUT I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shows and the way they adapted Holmes for the present day. Great stuff!! Rivals the 20th century adaptations of Sherlock Holmes done by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. I hope they keep them coming!!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|My Chemical Romance. Dark, \\"emo\\", depressing, angry. This is what the mainstream viewed this band as for years with the releases of their albums Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and The Black Parade. However, with Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, I would be shocked and surprised if any one of these words was now used to desribe what this band has reinvented itself to be.    Danger Days is a departure from everything that The Black Parade made itself out to be. It embraces the rough-edged punk rock defiance of the 70's like The Sex Pistols, while channeling the anthem rock bands of the 80's that would make Freddy Mercury proud, while picking up the fantastical science fiction, gun-fighting imagery that nods towards Quentin Tarentio's Kill Bill and Alan Moore's V for Vendetta. The band does not give up the story telling qualities that made Three Cheers and The Black Parade great, depicting the technicolor tale of a group of outlaw-vigilantes called \\"The Kill Joys\\" that fight against the major corporation Better Living Industries and it's evil leader Korse.     Although I would be concerned that the departure might deter some fans off, the artist in me loves everything about this reinvention. What is great about My Chemical Romance is that they continuously recreate what the band represents, and they have never disappointed. I must be honest, I was a bit hesitant on first listen, but the ablum was easy to warm up to. I encourage any listener, new fan or old, to give it at least a run through or two before passing their judgement.     In a music industry that is laden today with self-indulgance and materialsim, My Chemical Romance is a breath of fresh air. Danger Days is refreshing, uplifting, and modivating to listeners. It has thrown down the gauntlet at the feet of what rock is in today's society, challenging the listeners to not take any of B.S. that the industry is trying to shove down their throats, and to make something better for themselves.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, ever.  Though it is not for everyone.  First, it is so long it has an intermission.  And they actually do character development, so unlike blockbuster American movies, there are no explosions in the first few seconds of film.  So if you actually like a good story with interesting characters and something different than a CGI-fest, check it out.    Having said that, it is truly a remarkable production, story, and movie.
B003TML0VO|4.0|Even though there's about 140-odd-reviews on this already, I'm gonna add a few thoughts in defense of this CD.  1 - The first time I heard it, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It was NOT the Carlos Santana that I wanted to hear. However, the CD IS the Carlos Santana that HE wanted to play, and you know what? -- It is excellent.  2 - Poor marketing decisions are the real problem here. The title at the top makes it look like a cheap, 99-cent TV special limited time offer. If you call within the next five minutes, you, too, can have Carlos Santana playing the hits of the decades. WHO designed this thing? Worse, who decided to add that \\"greatest guitar classics\\" line as part of the title? Talk about trashing the effort.  3 - \\"Guitar Heaven\\" would possibly have served by itself as the title, except \\"Guitar Heaven,\\" to me, means long, uninterrupted lead breaks with minimal or no singing in the song whatsoever. This should have been called \\"Rock Heaven\\" or something. Bad, bad marketing.  4 - According to a recent interview, there's potential hope at the studio end for volumes II and even III of this thing. I would hope not. It's a pleasant musical curiosity and an interesting artist divergency, but Carlos Santana needs to sound like himself. THAT'S what we're all waiting for out here. The REAL next CD.  5 - A good thing about the CD -- The pretty orange CD face with the big Santana on it is reminiscent of the Carlos Santana/Buddy Miles Live cover. You almost don't notice the silly title.  6 - RE: The songs -- Every single one on here is very, very nicely done. They all do what I think they were intended to do, which is balance commercial covers with musical interpretation, some more so than others. How much wiggle room is there, really, in doing \\"Whole Lotta Love?\\" You either do it or you don't.  7 - Random comments -- Lead break on \\"Knocking\\" is nice; \\"Sunshine\\" books right along; Anybody who knocks this version of \\"Weeps\\" isn't listening; \\"Photograph\\" rocks nicely; NAS on \\"Back in Black\\" is superb; \\"Riders\\" is more than nice, especially with Manzarek on board; the Jon Lord tone and style organ on \\"Smoke\\" is very well done; \\"Dance\\" is nice; Bolan's \\"Gong\\" is the ABSOLUTE TREAT of the album and worth the price of admission by itself; \\"Little Wing\\" with Joe Cocker is untouchable -- an entire album between the two, now THAT would be interesting; and \\"Superstitious\\" has all the flavor it's supposed to.  8 - Anyway, if you're looking to hear the Carlos Santana \\"OF\\" LEGEND, this is NOT the CD you're looking for.  9 - However, if you're looking to hear what \\"THE\\" LEGEND Carlos Santana is doing these days, this IS the CD for you. I like it.  There's only three minutes left to order. Make that call now. Operators are standing by.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|To me, this series reminds me of the first three years of the X-Files, but updated and without some of the distractions.  It does a good job of character development and the story is engrossing.  Especially given that its competition is reality TV (how did Survivor make it all of these years?) or weak sitcoms.    If you like TV that makes you think, consider this one.
0061353248|5.0|A collection of all the research conducted by Ariely et.al on the euristhic processes that rule our brains. Ariely takes on from Kahneman and Tversky and applies the euristhics to several issues, unveiling the mechanisms that rule our behavior and our (poor) choices, with consequences on our economy, work and social relations. Very well written and entartaining too, for being essentially a book of research. Highly suggested.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|This has to be the worse hip hop album by any female I've ever heard. Mind Blowing in the sense that I can't believe the record company messed up so badly and came out with what sounds like a rushed half hearted Euro Pop / Whack Hip Hop album.  Seriously a joke. To think that Lil' Kim seemed to be threatened by this girl, any one song from any of Lil' Kims 4 albums alone are better than the entire contents of this album.    Almost entirely auto tune, BAD singing and week lyrics that the whole album has no sense of direction after listening to it I was left thinking what was the message or what intention was behind that, it's like the album had no flow relating to each song just random Love songs scattered around with a few hate songs and a sense of what the hell did I listen to that for no single message no big club bangers or even half decent lyrics.  As a true hip hop fan who likes all kinds of music I have no idea what the hell this mess was about, what this \\"Artist\\" is trying to say other than she's Schizophrenic and makes no sense, the worse thing is there's no way she even knows what she's talking about, her lyrics are random words that have no relation to the next word.    Those giving this 5 stars Must be die hard fans they know they're lying and trying to help her sell records, this record is whack anyone who really listened to this knows it's crap, it's hard to believe a record intended to shift large amounts could be let on the shelves sounding like this.  I hope people listen to the reviews all over the net.. the ones that are wrote by non die hard fans or haters just genuine real talking reviewers who appreciate hip hop and music in general.  Total waste of money and time, I listened from start to finish in total shock, truly unbelievable how disastrous a record can sound.  Save your money listen to genuine reviews, anybody saying this is good is talking nonsense and they know it.

(an opinion shared by the music world as well)    A great addition to your library. Among the best 'live' performance CDs I own.   Personally, I highly recommend it to all Kenny Wayne/blues fans.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Received the item promptly as stated. DVD plays perfectly. Very happy with purchase and vendor that I bought it from.    Many thanks
B00402FGE4|2.0|This is a good continuation on the series's concept. Although it seems like \\"Star Trek Voyager's\\" story line of lost on the other side of the universe, it does give an interesting spin on experiences, especially with the capability of \\"trading bodies\\" on Earth for a short period of time.    Can't wait for Season 2 to be available.    Hope the storyline continues to be as good, or better.
0091933684|5.0|I use my Ottolenghi cook book a lot.  It is part of my top 10 at the moment out of 200 cookbooks that I own.  Hence, I was looking forward to their next book.  Please keep in mind that it is vegetarian.  I like the size and feel of the cookbook - which can be used in the kitchen and not left on a coffee table.  Again, the food combinations are inspiring and work.  My husband, who does not eat pasta, loves the tagliatelle recipe with middle eastern spices!  He also doesn't eat fennel, but loves the caramelized fennel recipe with goats cheese(I often keep out the goats cheese and serve it with racks of lamb).  Having cooked some of these recipes, I also feel a sense of freedom to add or leave out some ingredients, and it still works!  Being total meat eaters, this book has inspired us to eat more vegetarian meals using these recipes - and they are satisfying.<br />The only negative about the cookbook is that I was hoping for a few desserts/sweets recipes(which I use often in the Ottolenghi cookbook.)  In any case, at a discounted price from a second seller or Amazon, I would highly recommend this cookbook.  It also compliments my Moosewood cookbooks.  I own all cookbooks by Alice Waters and Stephanie Alexander and would not hesitate to purchase all cookbooks by these authors.
0143118420|2.0|I found this book to be a reasonably well written journey of a completely self-absorbed woman who sounds like most unhappy people who have little reason to be unhappy.  Then, image the woe of being paid to travel for a year and think only of yourself and how hard your life is.  Ugh.

I have  hundreds of DVDs dating back to the 1930's with crystal clear video  quality. For a show that celebrates technology and advancement, why  is this season so badly pix-elated and with digital artifacts around   all of the characters? This is not worthy of TBBT. Sheldon would not  approve! Are you seeing the same thing?

B0040HJNKC|5.0|With every song I listen to, I just can't help thinking that it sounds like someone told Buddy, \\"You're too old to play like you did years ago.\\"  This album sounds like Buddy's response to that as he absolutely unleashes on the guitar. His vocals are there as well.  This cd isn't filled with all star guest appearances that take away from the album.     I read a quote years ago that he played the guitar almost out of control, but not quite.  This cd captures that.  Aside from a few ballad type songs, which are solid in their own right, this is him in the studio absolutely going off on the guitar!      I can't stand people constantly saying that an artist's newest album is their best... but here goes... this really is Buddy's best album ever!
B0040JHWKS|2.0|When I first heard about this release I was so thrilled. I have been waiting for these songs to be released for years. In my opinion Bruce released his best songs during this period.   Words can't describe how disappointed I was when I popped the CD into the player. What has he done to these brilliant songs!?!?!     Many of the songs have been re-recorded with new orchestrations, new vocals and added sounds. It is just horrible. These songs do not sound like Springsteen music from the late 70's anymore.     They have been drowned in Sha-La-Las (Breakaway) or ridiculed by female background choirs (Gotta get that Feeling). The wonderful `Someday, Tonight' is hardly recognizable in the newly recorded `Someday (We'll be together') kitsch. `Talk to me' has been plastered with new sounds and walls of horns. The studio version of `Fire' has been stripped off its beautiful Elvis like vocals known from the inofficial recordings. `The Promise' - one of my all time favourites - is also newly orchestrated. Sadly it is as lame and slow as the version on `18 Tracks'. It is beyond me why he did not release the far superior 1977 Record Plant studio version with its `Backstreets'-like powerful vocals of a young man overflowing with energy. Sadly only little of this is left in the revised songs. The `future of Rock'n Roll' has turned his legacy into background music for pensioners in southern Florida.     Every true Springsteen fan has known these songs for years because they have been available on bootlegs for a very long time. Why didn't he realise that these songs are highly valued in their familiar original versions by many of his fans?    Allegedly these recordings had to be re-worked because they were unfinished. This is partly nonsense because many of the reworked songs can be found in complete and original form on bootlegs. Bruce has changed the songs so that they sound good to him today. Sadly he is nearly 60 now and not 25 anymore. And the songs (and especially his voice) sound just like that.    In addition to that this compilation also lacks other well known highlights from this period, like `Preacher's daughter', `Castaway-The Ballad' or the early brilliant and much shorter piano version of `Drive all Night' without the bass-line.    But I would still recommend this compilation to any true Springsteen fan because it still includes some of the old gems in their original from. Songs like the beautiful `City at night' or the hidden track \\"The Way\\" would be reason enough to buy this compilation.    I just hope that the original versions of these songs will be released officially one day. Until then Bruce has joined George Lucas and Friedkin who also tarnished their legacy of `Star Wars' and `The Exorcist'.     These are not the true Darkness outtakes from '77 as the cover implies. Many are just present day reinterpretations.

B003J27WFW|5.0|This will give you a great idea about the personalities of the members.  Provides historical perspective of the band.  The version of La Villa Strangiato on the additional DVD was really awesome.
B00171NZE4|4.0|Remember when Korn was a band, and not just three guys limping along with some hired guns in the background? With the release of \\"Live at Montreux,\\" you can relive the glory days of the band before everything fell apart.<br /><br />\\"Live at Montreux\\" is a special release because -- as of this writing -- it is the last professionally filmed and released live concert performance featuring Korn with its original five member line-up. Seeing frontman Jonathan Davis, guitarist James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer and bassist Fieldy perform with the estranged members of the group for one last time (before nostalgia sets in and they all wise up to what's good for 'em) provides not only a high volume of nostalgia, but re-affirms that Korn in their current form are a mere shadow of their former selves. With guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch -- who left the band in 2005 to pursue a relationship with God and launch his own [[ASIN:B001CU1RPY solo career]] -- and drummer David Silveria -- who fell off the map completely in 2006  -- in tow, the Bakersfield fivesome rip through a blistering seventeen song set that is heavy on the band's juggernaut hit catalog as well as cuts from 2003's \\"[[ASIN:B0000DYJM7 Take a Look in the Mirror]],\\" which the band was touring on at the time.<br /><br />In typical fashion, Davis goes light on the in-between song banter that usually pads out the usual rock show set, leaving ample time for the band to rock out as efficiently as possible. Unlike 2002's [[ASIN:B000077VQ4 Hammerstein Ballroom]] affair, the band sounds tight and focused, as opposed to loose and sloppy like the previous effort. Silveria in particular shines, opening the set with a drum-solo that leads into the ferocious \\"Right Now.\\" Munky and Fieldy also share an interesting jam leading into \\"A.D.I.D.A.S.\\" which makes one wonder why they struggle to keep the creative juices flowing even without their former band-mates. Welch, on the other hand, seems to spend more time at the side of the stage than the decidedly more animated Munky, perhaps alluding to the fallen guitarist's mental state at the time. No matter, though, because of all of the live shows Korn have released to the public over the years, this is their finest. The set delivers the standard fare you'd expect, with a few deeper cuts such as \\"Dead Bodies Everywhere\\" and \\"Break Some Off\\" to sweeten the pot. The sound and picture quality are top-notch, as the concert is presented in 16:9 widescreen and with a Dolby Surround 5.1 soundtrack. Unfortunately for those looking for a little more, special features are non-existent, which could be chalked up to the fact that the band itself didn't have a hand in the DVD's release. As it stands, though, \\"Live at Montreux\\" is a sleek and sexy snap-shot of a band still in their prime that every Korn fan -- old and new -- will cherish.ated Munky, perhaps alluding to the fallen guitarist's mental state at the time.

B00004T9VY|5.0|Stately but gentle piano and guitar runs lead into Cat's exquisite and very unique baritone lamenting mans' destruction of our planet build to a lovely climax on album opener \\"Where Do The Children Play\\". This is some fine folk rock pop music, folks. The entire album is filled with gorgeous, catchy melodies and smart, spiritual, generous lyrics. Other highlights include the tender \\"Hard-Headed Woman\\"; lone radio hit and sweet/acidic \\"Wild World\\"; the delicate, gentle \\"Sad Lisa\\"; the gospel-infused stomper \\"Miles From Nowhere\\"; \\"Longer Boats\\"; the impossibly beautiful \\"Into White\\" which is one of my favorite songs by any artist and one of a very few songs I've done covers of. The soul-searching rocker \\"On The Road To Findout\\" and the inspired dialogue of \\"Father And Son\\" are good examples of the themes he was exploring on this disc. Released in 1970, \\"Tea For The Tillerman\\" was one of the best of the many excellent albums heralding the advent of the singer-songwriter era. Yusuf/Cat Stevens went on to greater success and popularity with his next album \\"Teaser and the Firecat\\" which featured the hits \\"Moonshadow\\", \\"Peace Train\\" and \\"Morning Has Broken\\" but \\"Tillerman\\" remains the essential and most consistent Cat Stevens album for me.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|It seems that some people have the inability to understand this book and all of Dan Brown's books are fiction.  Why do people continue to say or believe otherwise?<br /><br />I found this story riveting and entertaining.  For the first time in a while I could not put the book down. Dan Brown`s use of a well known city and it's landmarks draws us in to a story that appears to have a considerable amount of truth, but little actual truth.  This is the true sign of both why people enjoy his work and find it to generally be good fiction.<br /><br />I think many have enjoyed this and many more will come to enjoy it also.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this TV show! The story line is intense and very creative! Plus Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are the perfect duo. They work so perfectly together.   This show also has the perfect combination of horror and comedy. Believe me, if you start to watch this show, you're never going to want to stop.    This is the perfect show for both genders!  For guys there is plenty of action!    For the ladies there is always some kind of mini romance story line.. not to mention Jared and Jensen are always good to look at!

B003L77G2Y|5.0|Season 3 really just started and I hear now that Fox is moving Fringe to Friday nights starting in January.  I had high hopes for a Seaon 4 or maybe even a Season 5 but I think that will depend oh how viewers respond to the move to Fridays.  I am a fanatic for FRINGE and usually don't gush that much over a show (not since the first 2 seasons of LOST) but I would like to see this show go to it's potential conclusion and also deliver us some nice story within a story moments on the way.  Catch up with Fringe[[ASIN:B001UU75WK Pilot [HD]]] and know what I know....that FRINGE is the most overlooked and underappreciated show on network TV.  Trust me.<br /><br />A SIDE NOTE:  I was truly amazed and excited to hear that the FRINGE fans helped save our beloved show when FOX announced the renewal even before Season 3 had concluded.<br /><br />I know that this space should have a better review of Season 3 of Fringe.  I was hopeful that enough of the die hard fans could use this page as a way to acknowledge the show and encourage as many folks to start viewing Fringe live on Fridays.  I would ask that everyone read down the list for more in depth criticism of the show. I would be more biased to say that FRINGE is the only show worth my time and even more so, LIVE on a Friday night.  Please watch.

I finally got tired of the hackers, the lack of support for the PC, having to spend hundreds of dollars on upgrades each year, so I am trying to transition to console gaming. I couldn't do it.

B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. After reading the critical reviews I decided to actually get the disc instead of the digital download. Good production and hooks, meaningful tracks and some satirical lyrics. What I really could appreciate about Kanye is his ability to make different albums instead of a repackaged mix. 5 albums in not one bad album. I can't even point out any bad tracks just some not as good as others on the album. Also the features are on point. Short and sweet, I'd prefer a 14 track CD over a 20 track album with half of it being garbage. If you decide to buy it especially digitally (currently 3.99) you will definitely get your moneys worth. Amazon MP3 is the best digital store there is. If your a avid buyer you'll save 5-7 dollars on new releases compared to the iTunes store. If your going to rate the album two things should be true. You actually heard it and don't use personal feelings about him in the review. I could care less what he does in his personal life unless he was a criminal. Neither should you.

B0035G02MW|3.0|I loved Changing Places and so picked this up and wish I had read the subject matter before starting it. I find Lodge's style very easy to read and so finishing the book was not a problem from that perspective but the relentless punning which naturally is a deaf person's nightmare became a bore and so too the self pity of the narrator. The other subject matters brought little relief: an aging 89 year old widower and a 'pseudocidal' PhD student. Finishing this book was a little like how you feel after visiting a distant aging relative who has advanced dementia: a duty rather than a pleasure.

B000003S09|5.0|I've listened to every CD release of this album available. The new 40th anniversary remasters are just too bright sounding. They may have found the original masters, but they botched the job. The one that came out before this is dull and cold sounding. The 30th Anniversary Edition sounds most like the original release, IMO. Nice detail, but not too cold or bright sounding.
0140620109|3.0|This old book sparked a lively discussion at my book club this month.  Although the old English was a little difficult to wade through, we decided that we are really glad that times have changed and that finding a husband should not be a woman's total goal in life, and finding someone else a husband should be totally off limits.

B0018LMZOO|5.0|Love, love, love this album.  I'd argue that it's their best album in that it hangs together seamlessly from start to finish.  My argument is that the Moody Blues had been touring endlessly for nearly five years and here found themselves at their peak AS A BAND.  Listen to them--they are so tight on this album.  All those years of playing gig after gig had really honed their chops, and here are they at their best.  They rock--really and truly--something one doesn't usually associate with this band, especially these days when they tour with orchestras as a much-appreciated but no longer musically adventurous trio.  Listen to Hayward's sharp playing--hard to realize it's the same guy who writes ballad after ballad after ballad these days.  (Even so, thanks, Justin, for the great songs and the great guitar work and vocals).<br /><br />I agree with others that every song is a keeper here.  I think that this may be one of their strongest albums in terms of songwriting--no snippets blown into longer songs or patched together to form a whole song.  I also think their spirituality is flourishing--Lodge's homage to music as a bridge to humanity (\\"I'm Just a Singer...\\"), Hayward's \\"You and Me,\\" Pinder's \\"Lost in a Lost World.\\"  This is sort of the culmination of a series of great albums in terms of content, style, and execution.<br /><br />Even Thomas' lighter \\"For My Lady\\" works, thanks to the wonderful keyboard work and old-fashioned nautical background vocals.  There's a jaunty humor here, characteristic of his \\"Dr. Livingstone\\" or \\"Floating.\\"<br /><br />Finally, one reviewer sees Hayward as the heart of the band--perhaps he's the best songwriter, melodically, but think of how much Pinder brought to Hayward's songs with his mellotron on \\"New Horizons\\" or \\"Land of Make Believe.\\"  When Pinder left, the band lost its sonic coherence, and they just couldn't get it back six years later for the mediocre \\"Octave.\\"  This is the last album of the Moodies as a band, and what a way to go out.<br /><br />In conclusion, the album is perfect in its execution of eight great, longish songs.  The Moody Blues went out at the absolute of top of their game.  This album is a great achievement for which I will always be grateful.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This series is so great I am sending it to some friends who really don't watch TV per se. It is intelligent on many levels and sweet.
0765326353|5.0|I don't normally read long fantasy series - The Lord of the Rings is probably the longest one I've read. Epic fantasy for me has always brought to mind a series of gigantic books written over multiple decades, consisting of a phone-book size list of characters to keep track of. It also seems to be read by a certain type of reader that stereotypically doesn't get exposed to sunlight regularly, subsists on a diet of energy drinks and hostess snack cakes, for recreation, attends conventions dressed like their favorite Star Wars/Star Trek/comic book character, and engage in things like LARPing.    That being said, I love Brandon Sanderson's books. So far he's written two stand-alone fantasy novels and a trilogy for adults. All of them have been fantastic. He's also completing the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, but I haven't read any of that (for reasons already mentioned.) So when I learned that he was going to undertake to write his own epic fantasy series, I thought I'd give one a try. I'm glad I did. The Way of Kings is an excellent book. It is gigantic at just over 1,000 pages long, and according to Sanderson, it'll be the first of ten books in the series. So I feel like I've made a significant commitment that will not end until I'm somewhere in my fifties. But having read this book, I'm okay with that and I look forward to what's to come.     The Way of Kings is definitely epic in scale. It consists of multiple systems of magic that are each original and extremely well thought out. It introduces several key characters, each with a captivating story line. Sometimes when I read books with multiple key characters, I get irritated when the story line shifts from one character and goes to another one because I find some characters more interesting than others. That wasn't the case with this book. Each one of the main characters and their individual story arc was so captivating that I didn't mind leaving one to go to another.    I guess I now need to come toterms with the fact that I'm a reader of epic fantasy. Apparently I'll need to stock up on Twinkies and learn how to LARP.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|Boring in parts.  Souldn't have been since the subject matter is so excellent.  The sequel is sure to be better since they will finally have made it to Sherwood Forest.  When this gets down to a dollar, I might buy it.
0199538115|3.0|It takes a real man, who is secure in his manhood, to admit to reading a book like Little Women. I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them.  It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.     That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|First off, I would like to say that the artwork for this cd is beautiful. Yes, I said beautiful, so what. I like how it has that post-apocalyptic feel to it. Kind of like how the world would be a few years after the Black Hole Sun video ended. I know that is thinking to much into something, but that is how the cd art looks to me.    Now on to the music portion of the cd. I like the choices of songs selected for this release. I do not know for sure, but I think this version of Rusty Cage is different than the actual album version. But I could be wrong. All the times I hear it on the radio, and then when I play the version on this release, it sounds different. Black Rain is a really great song. For the band to come back to a song that was almost forgotten about, and make it sound like it belonged on the Badmotorfinger album was quite impressive. I would like to know how the original recording sounded though, just to see where the changes were made is all.    And for the videos, it has all the ones I love, and videos for songs I never knew they had. The videos I liked the most were Black Hole Sun and Spoonman. After watching Spoonman, me and my brother would try to play the spoons (I know that sounds dumb, and that was not what the song was about, but as a kid, I didn't know that the song was about drugs.) like the dude in the video. He was a mad man on those things, beating himself over the head, and chest with the spoons, was awesome.    So all in all, I wish I could give this more stars. I recommend if you are a Soundgarden fan, to go get it, if not for the songs on the two cd's, at least for the videos on the dvd.
B0013527I4|4.0|Very good quality show.  Have enjoyed it very much, and plan to buy the first two seasons at some point.  Doesn't have quite as many well known actors/actresses as the first two seasons, but many of the schetches stay original.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Another great movie from Studio Ghibli.  The style does a good job telling the story, as well as giving you a feeling for the world itself.  Characters are identifyable for most viewers, and seem to have really 'human' qualities.  Certain parts of the movie can drag near the end, but overall a good movie.  I recommend this if you enjoy Studio Ghibli productions, or Disney 'type' movies.

0143036556|5.0|This book covers many time periods, people and places around the world. He covers many issues with a keen eye, and provides some fascinating science to support his investigations, from the Norsemen in Greenland to the early inhabitants of Easter Island. This book has changed how I see the history of many places, as it brings in the cultural interaction of various peoples with their landscapes, and the long terms effects, for better or worse.  Although the book covers many ecological catastrophes, it is not a tiresome and boorish environmentalist manifesto raging against the machine.  Instead, this book provides a well researched and enjoyable read covering a multitude of people, landscapes and their subsequent histories that yes, often ended in collapse.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Within the past year I have stopped buying physical CDs completely, moving exclusively to digital downloads from iTunes and Amazon mp3. However, when I saw The Beatles Stereo Box for only $129, I had to jump. It is $20 cheaper than the recently-released iTunes version, includes a 51-minute DVD of mini-documentaries, and best of all you have the satisfaction of knowing your investment is preserved in a beautifully-packaged physical format.<br /><br />When I received the box set, I immediately ripped all 14 albums to iTunes using the Apple Lossless encoding format. This is the highest quality setting in iTunes. The 226 tracks, a little over 10 hours of music, came out to approximately 3.8 gigabytes. High resolution images of the 2009 CD covers are available through a simple Google search.<br /><br />I usually try to give pros and cons to my review, but there simply are no cons to owning this box set (unless you hate The Beatles). So here are the pros:<br /><br />Value: Purchasing the box set proved to be the way to go to complete and update my Beatles collection. I already own five of the albums in the box set on CD, but they are not the 2009 re-masters. At $129, each of the 14 albums comes out to less than $10, not counting the included 51-minute DVD.<br /><br />Audio quality: These 2009 remasters sounds amazing. I am hardly an audiophile, but I can indeed tell a difference between these versions and the earlier CD releases. These albums sound rich, full, and clear without coming across as overly-processed. Some might disagree, but for hardcore Beatles fans, when sonic perfection isn't as important as the music itself, this box set is fantastic. In fact, I would argue that because The Beatles were constantly stretching the limitations of recording technology in the studio, these remasters, which indeed make use of the latest technology as of 2009, stay true to that philosophy.<br /><br />Packaging: the packaging is obvious from the photos available. It's very well done and of very high quality. The cardboard sleeves and liner notes have a glossy finish, and each sleeve recreates most of the aspects of the original LP. This makes the box set a very worthwhile collector's item and keepsake. Each booklet contains the original liner notes, along with more recent \\"recording notes\\" from George Martin.<br /><br />DVD: I have not had a chance to view the mini-films compiled on a single disc, but the sleeve says the running time is 51 minutes.ne and of very high quality.

Screen Protectors generally come in 2 finishes: shiny (glare) and reduced glare, as well as smooth vs soft.  This Screen Protector is softer and has reduced glare.<br /><br />3 (1 to screw-up, 1 for you and 1 for your Significant Other) Amazon-branded screen protectors come in an easy to open cardboard envelope along with a screen cleaning cloth and a stiff piece of plastic to \\"squeegee\\" the air bubbles out during application.

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I gave this movie 3 stars ONLY because it's the STC sisters, otherwise it would have gotten 2 stars from me.  The acting is marginal, the setting is questionable - BUT, it's the STC sisters!  With the tumultuous times we are in, I think the Middle East was a poor choice for the setting of this movie, but that's just me.  It was great to see Aiden again - how cute is John Corbett???????????  I will always love Sex and the City - I still miss it every Sunday night on HBO.  Although this movie really isn't very good, I will still watch it over and over.
0780622650|5.0|I Love the movie Lost in Space.  I had seen it before now.  It is a excellent version of the earlier movie.  I wish this movie could be a start to a TV series.
B003X2O6KW|3.0|Ya know, I waited for this album from the beginning, and was so excited as November hit, because i knew the time was drawing closer... As Kanye released those exceptional G.O.O.D. Friday tracks every week, i just knew the world was in for a gem... And then the album came out.... 60% of the album I've heard already, not from leaks, but rather music HE HIMSELF released, and the rest, not really all that impressive. So yeah, I'm very disappointed, and very confused as to why this album is receiving such great reviews, especially the ones stating that this is his best work to date... LATE REGISTRATION easily makes this album look like child's play... I feel somewhat cheated, and angry that people are seriously falling for what i feel is pure laziness on Kanye's part... Maybe I can't do what he does, but he can do better
B003XKPPOU|3.0|I thought this movie was great from the beginning to the end, except one thing the creators just _had_ to slip in.  When Barbie and Ken meet, they're checking each other out and barbie slips out \\"Nice As---cot\\", which is reference to the tie Ken had on, but obviously adults and filthy minded kids would get the underlying meaning.  Just a fyi, an ascot is a 19th century short tie.  I can understand this stuff in Shrek, but this is supposed to be Disney!  I just don't see what the point of slipping in this kind of language in a kids movie serves.<br /><br />Other than this, it's a good movie, had a bit more darker tones, with the toys feeling abandoned, facing death at one point, and ultimately having to say goodbye to Andy.  I don't think I'd recommend it for the youngest ones.
B0000DZTIL|4.0|Real good movie... Love the Goat however according to my local speed shop there is no clutch to go on a 6-71 so as to shut it down when not needed.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|From beginning to end, MCR does social commentary with all the irreverence you'd expect from a punk rock band.  This is not the whiny, mopey band you may be used to.  The new album his poppy and lively and full of energy.  Quite possibly the best rock album of the year.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|Nicki...glad to finally hear your album.   I like the playfulness of this album and her sense of humor rocks.  She is so funny and doesn't take herself seriously at all, that is a brilliant quality for a person to have.  She is a comedian too who knew.  She is going to be huge, (oh wait she ALREADY is).   Haters will hate so what who cares (there will always be jealous haters in the world).  There are MANY that will Love Pink Friday for what it is a fun, upbeat, hilarious (not to be taken so seriously it is supposed to be carefree and FUN)... hip hop/R & B/Dance/Wacky/Techno/Crazy album.  ENJOY!!!
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|This is by far the worse album I've heard in a while. She can rap but what and how she raps makes you not want to listen to her music. All the songs sound like mixtape tracks. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this CD. It's that bad!

B00005JNQA|4.0|Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who works at the United Nations.  Her speciality is southern African dialects, since she was born and raised there.  In the meantime, half a world away, three men enter an abandoned soccer stadium, and after seeing a room full of bodies, are in turn killed.<br /><br />One night she returns to work after hours to retrieve a bag she left there, and incidentally overhears some men over the UN's translater system.  She doesn't know what it means, at first, but the US Secret Service gets involved, because an extremely unpopular leader of a southern African nation is coming to the UN to address the assembly.  Sean Penn plays the officer who leads the team in charge of the investigation.<br /><br />That's the set-up.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was fairly impressed by the series of plot twists and intertwined story lines that were woven together in this film.<br /><br />Kidman, originally from Australia, plays a convincing southern African.  Penn, though clearly aging, does a good job of playing a grieving widdower who believes that working will help him deal with his loss.<br /><br />The development of the story line, illumination of character after character and how they are connected with each other made for a great movie-watching experience for me.  This is not, however, an action adventure film, it is a political thriller.  There are no high speed chase scenes, no spattered automatic weapons fire, but there are plenty of scenes that build significant suspence, and enough other scenes when the tension is released that it worked, at least for me.<br /><br />This film is, all in all, a solid film, and I recommend it, but it won't ever be a 5-star classic in my book.  it is well worth watching a time or two.
B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|It's aite. Meaning, there are a few songs on here I like but I couldn't really be too mad becasue it was only 3.99.

The movie started a little slow, but once it took off I really enjoyed it. Charlie St Cloud is based on an acclaimed novel and follows a young man named Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron). Charlie survives an accident and now he is able to see his little brother (Sam) who did not survive the accident. Sam and Charlie make a promise to meet each other everyday at a certain time, but when Charlie meets a girl it forces him to decide to live in the world he has discovered with his brother or his new found love.

0439023513|5.0|My son read the series and commented that it was a REALLY good series.  He's 17 years old so it's great to see him interested in books and reading!!!
B0026P3G12|4.0|This is a beautiful CD, but what happened to the beautiful soaring notes. It sounds like she is holding back the passion that we were hoping to hear.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|I was already looking forward to the movie and decided to download the music.  It's quite good!  Christina Aguilera proves again that she's got a great pair of pipes.  Her songs are kind of retro bluesy/jazz ala the \\"Back to Basics\\" album.  I especially like \\"Bound to You\\".  Cher has just two songs, one of which \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\", is a power ballad which might just turn into a hit!      So even more eagerly anticipating the movie!
1608870081|5.0|this is an artistic, wonderful exploration of the harry potter world in a fun, pop up kid kind of way. plus the art is incredible
B00428ZRFE|3.0|The disc is uneven which reminds me of the first two discs she put out ages ago.  I think Rihanna should have waited a bit before putting out more material, especially since the previous two discs were well produced, strong releases.  This disc is a bit of a monotonous (snoooozzzzze).  There are a couple of stand out tracks (S&M, Only Girl In The World, Skin, Man Down) the rest sounds like emotionless filler.  I think it's a waste of the style and image Rihanna has created.
B003FSTN6Q|4.0|Great series but by season 5 it was getting a little goofy. The writers tried to keep the show fresh by making major plot changes throughout the 5 seasons the show aired. Unfortunately, they never quite seemed to finish one plot line before plunging into the next. I won't spoil it for anyone who has not watched it but suffice it to say you don't really need to watch the episodes in order nor do you need to watch season 1 before you can understand season 4 for instance. Just watch it and enjoy!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I found this Miniseries very thoughtful, incise, and beautifully written.  I know they took some liberties with the truth, but what historical drama doesn't?<br /><br />I loved the crotchedly Adams who felt that politics were awful unless he was agreed with.  I loved the relationship between Adams and his wife, who in an era were women were not often educated and were never expected to have an opinion, is a pistol and a person of very strong views and she was not afraid to disagree with her husband.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Norah Jones never ceases to amaze me with her wonderful singing talent.  This new album featuring the talents of other artists as well is truly fantastic and a must have not only Norah Jones fans but to anyone who appreciates great music.  This album does not dissapoint.
0811876373|5.0|Bought this book to get ideas for my granddaughter to make things for a craft/bake sale.  It is great.  Its so easy to do and the decorating part is easy,not complicated and needing alot of extras.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I have been a fan of Josh Groban for a number of years and missed his presence in the recording industry. I was really looking forward to this recording. Alas, I was greatly disappointed by the lack of depth and quality. The lyrics are insipid (being kind) and the international offerings are simply awful. For me, this recording represents a need for a return to a exploration of a musical identity. I'm sure that the true \\"fans\\" will support this artist, but they really shouldn't - he is much better than this pathetic ode to woefulness.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  It is relaxing, amazing, and I even bought it for my best friend.  Susan really has a wonderful voice and you won't be dissapointed if you purchase this CD.  I am so happy for her and her success.
B004CAWKXE|5.0|One thing you can't say about My Chemical Romance is they stick with a successful  song form, they keep innovating.  The first couple songs are a throwback to classic MCR from their first two albums.  The next few are an amazing mix of rock and synth, like an 80's powerhouse, but modern.  They do a killer job of implementing synth, I dont traditionally enjoy synth in rock music, but they pull it off beautifully.      After 3 or 4 songs its back to more rock music and then they end it with a killer rock anthem.  This album continues their all killer no filler tradition.  If you like MCR or rock buy this immediately.
044654759X|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and I truly feel this was his best.... I loved the cleaver twist at the end..It made the entire story more meaningful!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Just love Illuminations! Groban goes further, deeper, higher. It took me a few listens to appreciate the evolution of his style. Only took a heart beat to catch the evolution of The Voice. Thanks to Josh. Beautiful!
B00447G29S|5.0|If you are a fan of this movie, there is nothing to add. The 3D quality though, is breathtaking. Someone had asked: yes this is the real thing, done to the new technology. Not to be confused with the pos released a couple of years ago.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|What a great film. Stylish, haunting, and actually very touching.<br />I was so pleased after viewing this. It's not a cheesy CGI filled splatterfest filled with hot guys and cool cars. It is instead an intelligent and captivating story that draws you right in. It's beautifully photographed and it's direction is nothing short than brilliant.<br />This truly is one of the best horror films to come out in several years. It has outstanding performances and it's directorial rythms keep you drawn in to every word. I would really recommend this film to any horror fan or person who enjoys a good story. This is really one of the best films of 2010.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Great movie at a GREAT price! I got the Blu-ray 3 disc pack for just pennies over [...]... I cant complain at that price. Thats including the shipping which was delivered to my house a day earlier than the expected date! If you have never seen this flick and digg action/ adventure movies and wanna be heroes, than I would suggest this movie to any body! surprisingly enough there is plenty of vivid/dynamic cinematic shots in the film which I love to see! There's plenty of action to go around accompanied by hilarity in this film which should leave you wanting more in the end!
B004498KPU|5.0|Im a huge fan of Michael Jackson! To have all 35 videos (short films) on 3 cds plus 10 new ones, including One more chance, blame it on the boogie, can u feel it and why with 3T! The cover itself is so cool, with 18 pictures that move from MJ's videos! This is so awesome! It also comes with a 60 page collectors book! If you ever wonder why Michael was so loved..Just listen to the words in his song, he speaks from his heart. This i will treasure for the rest of my life! Michael had a heart of gold and he was a great humanitarian! He helped so many children, and people he did not even know! This is a must for any Michael Jackson fan! Its awesome! Your always in my heart MJ <3
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This series is the best on TV right now.  After Deadwood left, there was nothing to watch until Breaking Bad showed up.
B0042RUMEQ|3.0|I didn't know what to expect before buying Nicki Minaj's \\"Pink Friday\\". When I first heard her two years ago, I thought she sounded like a young Remy Ma. Then she showed this bubbly, animated side and I thought she was a joke. Then she had the best verse on a couple collabo songs. Then she came out with these R&B songs on the radio. So I was completely conflicted when deciding to buy this album. Not because of the hype, but because curiosity set in to hear exactly who she is. After months of wondering, Nicki has finally dropped her debut album \\"Pink Friday\\"<br /><br />Nicki Minaj and Drake share more than a record label. They both are using the same formula that their prot&eacute;g&eacute; Lil' Wayne used. Nicki has been all over the radio in 2010 and didn't even have an album out.  (Its funny that she raps more than Drake did on his album) Everyone knows Nicki Minaj has multiple personalities and they all show up on \\"Pink Friday\\". The bubbly Harajuku Barbie lets loose on \\"Check It Out\\". Roman Zolanski spits fire on \\"Roman's Revenge\\" with Eminem. Then Nicki shows up on \\"Im The Best\\". I wanted to hear more from Nicki when I heard \\"Blazin\\" ft Kanye West. Of course, you have the current radio hits \\"Right Thru Me\\" & \\"Your Love\\". (I'm glad they left that horrible song \\"Massive Attack\\" off) Drake shows up on the standout \\"Moment 4 Life\\". This album is not perfect by far, there could have been more darker beats which would've brought out her harder side.<br /><br />After hearing this album, I understand now that she is definitely an entertainer. The colorful wigs and funny faces thing is just an act. But it all works for her. Overall, Nicki has mastered her style. This is a debut album but she is no rookie. She knows when to be cooky, when to sing it and when to bring it.<br /><br />Part of me wanted to not like this album. The fact that I usually hold female MC's to a different standard can be considered sexist. But a female rapper has to really bring it for me to even consider giving them my money. I think I only brought 5 female rapper albums in my lifetime. In saying that I must give Nicki Minaj credit where it is due, this album is not half bad.  In some ways its better than Drake's album. It could've used a little more lycisim and a little less corkiness. But I understand now that this is who Nicki Minaj is. So when her next album comes, I wont be as hesitant to grab it.nk I only brought 5 female rapper albums in my lifetime.

0156034026|1.0|The monologue in this novel is one of the most boring things I've ever read. It is meant to represent the chatter of some \\"reluctant fundamentalist\\" as he talks to an American visitor in Lahore. Presumably he means to kidnap the visitor, or at least that's the implication.  Certainly, the Taliban could use this narrator as a tactic. 1)He is so annoying that if properly deployed he could make Western forces abandon any country they've occupied. 2) If he were to simply to keep on blabbing, his listeners would hang, shoot, or poison themselves to get him to stop.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|Kanye West has morphed from backpacker to socialite. Every negative thing that he does or that is done to him, he has unleashed it out in his music.  We felt for him when his mother passed. So he made \\"808's & Heartbreaks\\". When we thought he had gone soft he jumped on DJ Khaled's \\"Go Hard\\". Now after all the things this past year, he has come back with the highly anticipated \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\".<br /><br />\\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\", plays almost like a fairytale. From the beginning you know you are hearing something completely different. Kanye opens up with \\"Dark Fantasy\\", which begins with a dream like intro until the RZA beat comes in.  The joint collabo \\"Monster\\" with Rick Ross, Jay-Z and Nicki Minaj kicks off the best stretch of the album.  The second joint collabo \\"So Appalled\\" features Jay-Z, Swizz Beats and Pusha T. Every Kanye album has a standout gem that eclipses the rest of the album. That gem this time is \\"Devil In A New Dress\\". The song is about his relationship with his ex-girlfriend over a sick Smokey Robinson sample. It ends with a sweet 16 from Rick Ross. \\"Runaway\\" is a self reflective track. Each piano key plays like a tear drop. The only problem with the album version is that its twice as long. The second half of the song is sung over again in auto tune.  Like all Kanye albums they start to wear thin by the end. \\"Hell Of A Life\\" is average. But \\"Lost In The World\\" is a song I cant get into right now.<br /><br />Time heals all wounds. And as time passes we will forget about the antics Kanye has pulled throughout the years and remember him for the high level of good music he puts out. Thrity years from now what will we be saying about Kanye West? Will we remember his music first or his mistakes? Love him or hate him, Kanye West is not going anywhere. Toast to the douchebags.
B000FVNX2Q|3.0|This is a cheaply made calculator, made in China, thank you Carly Fiorini. This was replacing an older scientific calculator which my husband used in college. The on, off button sometimes doesn't come on when first pushed.
B000XR49VQ|1.0|I just purchased this product and it is as others have noted a TOTAL SCAM. I am lodging a complaint to AMAZON as well as this review. The COPY of this movie being sold here is a dub from a poor quality VHS tape...they can't even keep the frame from skewing. Don't even think you are going to enjoy this on a Hi Def monitor...no way. It is all so much more infuriating because I love this film and really want a copy AND I DIDNT CHECK THE REVIEW FIRST...LESSON LEARNED
B000TGJ80I|5.0|I got this from Best Buy but did not notice that it was the unrated version untill I got home.  If your a fan of the Underworld series this unrated version is by far 10 time better with the Special Features and great outtakes
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I watched this movie with low expectations because of reviews I had read.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised!  This movie has it all...action, adventure, humor, and it gets you emotionally invested in the characters.  For a fun movie night, watch Percy Jackson and the Olympians!
B004BSAHLY|3.0|Well, I'm not a huge Kanye fan, but loved 808's and heartbreak and Graduation and what made those albums solid is sorely missing from this album. If you want experimentation- you got it here- and for that- he's good. If you want a solid hip hop/dance/electronic album like he's done on the last 2 albums, you wont find it here, outside of a couple good tracks like Runaway and Power and All of the Lights and Lost in the World. Now maybe, because I like dance music/ electro/trip hop stuff and old school hip hop and alternative, maybe that's why I'm MORE excited to get the new Black Eyed Peas album, \\"The Beginning\\" because what they do well, is keep the party going and keep it simple- sometimes that works fantastic and BEP does that in spades. Kayne makes some great music over the years, but time will tell if this album will stand the test of time.     Just not blown away like I expected to be.
B00417HV14|2.0|I have owned both the DVD and this new Blu-ray.  True:  the DVD is exceptional!!  Awesome video and audio!  The Blu-ray audio is same...Great!  BUT, the video quality on the Blu-ray is WORSE than the DVD!  Especially the white or light sections such as Joe's face....Very fuzzy and pale.  TOTALLY disappointing.  Do NOT upgrade your DVD for Blu-ray in this case....NOT worth it.
0446569895|5.0|I have never been or will I be a heavy metal fan....but this book is fantastic from start to finish.  I initially brought the book for my husband who is a fellow brummy and I lost count how many times he quoted passages from the book or sat there laughing to himself. I couldn't wait for him to finish it so I could read it myself, I read it in two days!  The book is very brutally honest and quite unbelievable at times but it's told in a way that captures the reader.  There are so many stories, the chicken's, the raids, the doctor visits and the prince of darkness with his bubbles just to name a few.  My husband and I still laugh about this book, it's that good I just purchased a 2nd for my Father in law for Christmas.  Whether your an Ozzy fan or not, if you enjoy an amusing interesting look into the rich and famous and wondered how they got there this is the book for you.  Just a word to the wise, don't read in public or on a plane!
B003X2O6KW|5.0|this album is truly a musical portrait of hip-hop's advancement. thank you Kanye for your hard work, this is a gift to us music lovers. Regardless of people's opinion about this guy, he always delivers greatness, maybe we should get off our high horse and remember not to judge a man's work by his public image. i will always support Kanye..and p.s Lupe better drop that cd soon!

The first time I heard \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet,\\" it was sampled from Luther Vandross, who did an excellent version of this song, but it was first Stevie Wonder's- an imaginary love song. \\"Pastime Paradise\\" sounds kinda scary and talks about Heaven and Hell and people's relative choices. \\"Summer Soft\\" is great; has a nice piano, but it talks about departure or fooling of a former significant other. \\"Ordinary Pain\\" was interesting: it starts off with Stevie's lyrics, then changes the beat and allows singing of different but related topic (love) lyrics of Minnie Riperton and Deniece Williams. \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" has a great rhythm with its harmonica, and it talks about the birth of Stevie's child. \\"Joy Inside My Tears\\" is a ballad with open lyrics, but it's basically a love song. \\"Black Man\\" talks about what people have done for this country; it has a classroom discussion where teacher's ask who contributed to what. \\"Ngiculela - Es Una Historia - I Am Singing\\" is a love song, love all over the world; I can't get enough of the beautiful piano and rhythm of this song. \\"If It's Magic\\" is skippable because it has no beat, just a harp, and lovely lyrics, but no depth in voice like other songs Stevie did off this double album. \\"As\\" is a long love song I first heard on the radio. \\"Another Song\\" has an African rhythm to it...it talks about a past love; captivating lyrics; makes you sing \\"La La La.\\" \\"Saturn\\" is an imaginary song with horns about the bad things this world would bring to you and therefore, the want to escape to another planet is urged; I like weird songs like this one. \\"Ebony Eyes\\" sounds like Paul McCartney did the beat; not one of my favorite songs. \\"All Day Sucker\\" sounds too silly; it's another love song, but it uses synthesizer annoyingly. Lastly, you get \\"Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call),\\" a relaxing jazz piece. Overall, this album is definitely worth the buck.

But by page 80, they were still talking about people turning into wolves and then back to human when the weather warms up.  Nothing else was happening, and that's when I stopped reading.

My only negative is, I would like the option of having some before they got folded; since this is a permanent feature for my game table, the fold lines just add a smidge of frustration when drawing on the mats.  Overall, great value adn - finally! - someone sees the value of Dry Erase game mats.  Took long enough! :-)
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|The great thing about it is that he has given all of this for free and we still buy the album. You have to get all Kanye features in the last two years, plus all his [...] GOOD Fridays to get the true story of his brilliance. Note, even as a Kanye fan, I never have, nor will I ever listen to 808s. To gauge his \\"greatness\\" note how his one track, Power, better than Drake entire album which is a great album.
B001O7JHVG|3.0|7 to 8 years ago i used to watch this film regularly on VHS. I must have liked it better than. Seeing it now again<br />in HD, it is not as good as i remembered it. Before i saw it again, i still remembered many scenes and lines. I still<br />remember that criminal with that big chin. He is played by Robert Z'Dar. I think he is one of the highlights in this<br />film.<br /><br />I like that scene when he is hearing the duo coming in jail, he behaves like a maniac and keeps shouting and<br />shaking the jail bars. I just had to laugh at that scene. I seemed to remember this had more action scenes, but<br />it did not. I will not watch this reguarly like before, but i probably see it again in 2 to 3 years.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 4.5/5<br /><br />I really liked the razor sharp picture quality. I didn`t expect it to be this good. Too bad i can`t say the same to<br />the audio quality. I think the colours was pretty good.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 3/5<br /><br />The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 was very disappointing. All of the gunfire effects, except maybe 2-3 times, had hardly any<br />bass. The rest of the times, i think it sounded pretty weak and bassless. So, your subwoofer will not be used so<br />much in this film. Some of the exposions had fine bass, but not all. The dialog at times sounded a bit thin and<br />unclear, but it was not a major problem. The music in this fillm sounded best.<br /><br />I feel it had nice bass and was pretty clear. I think the rear speakers could have been used more in this film.<br />They was mainly used for music, some of the action scenes, raining and prisoners shouting. If they only had<br />made the audio quality as good as the picture quality, it would have been very good. Sadly they didn`t do that.<br />Again very disappointing. Hm.<br /><br />Film: 3.5/5<br />Overall: 3/5

It should have been in the \\"Best Animated Feature\\" Category.  The story is mostly a blend of; \\"Medicine Man\\" meets \\"Pocahontas\\", meets \\"100 Million B.C.\\".   The animation, (CGI) breakthroughs bring hope for future films like this in the future.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This was a great movie!  We love it and good thing too because our son makes us watch it over and over.
B003L77GRO|4.0|I began watching this series after all four seasons were available on DVD. It began with me checking it out on our new Netflix, then my husband sat down and got hooked. We ended up having a Dexter marathon over that weekend, watching episode after episode on Netflix. Unfortunately, only the first 2 seasons were available there. We actually went out for the sole reason to buy the 3rd and 4th seasons on DVD at the Target down the street, so we could continue our marathon. Looking forward to the next season to be available to us!
0517548232|5.0|This review's short, sweet, and to the point. If you don't know much about economics proper, but are familiar with the political buzzwords of the day, then this book is for you, irrespective of what you currently believe about economics. There are countless thought experiments and examples to dismantle and examine economics at its most base roots, all following one simple lesson: The fallacy of most modern economic policy is that they benefit some observed, apparent group A whilst harming directly or indirectly either group B or all other groups in general.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Ok Short but sweet. I have over the years purchased the previous versions of Live At Leeds from the original vinyl release to the updated CD from the 90's. Well this finally has it all. No more cracks and pops and the best part a complete live version of Tommy as well as all of the early tunes from the earlier releases. The talk between the band and the audience between songs is also included so this is as close to a Who concert from 1969 with good sound as you are going to get.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Glad to see this on Amazon, much cheaper than the big box stores...thats why I got it with you...i can get well over 300 pics on my underwater Olympus camera and enjoy getting the extra battery and flash card so I won't have to stop and download pics til I get to my home computer...the only way to go.
B000008JI1|5.0|This was the cd that hit the cutout bin in a hurry. Not sure why. I think mostly that it had to do with the time that it came out, more so then the absence of CC. Lets face it CC was, and is a bluesy player. So it was only fitting for Kotzen. All bands go through changes in the line up and changes in the material. This was there best release in my opinion. Kotzen is a great guitarist. In addition to his flawless playing skills, he brings his voice into the game on Native Tounge and it only compliments Brets voice. Those who like Native Tounge should check out Poison's Seven Days Live DVD. Those who may have glossed over Native Tounge for whatever should check it out as well. I like Poison, more so then when they first came out. I frequently listen to Native Tounge. As for the rest of Poison, I pop in a greatest hits from time to time.

B00364K6YW|5.0|Of any movie ever made!This movie is like watching the book! There's not a single character I would change: Jennifer Ehle plays Elizabeth with confidence, grace, and beauty (and a great deal of spirit!), Colin Firth is PERFECT as the (very!) handsome, but (at first) cynical and haughty Mr. Darcy, Ben Whitrow is a wonderful Mr. Bennet, with his dry humour and ready wit, and - what can I say? David Bamber practically steals the show as Mr. Collins, the ridiculous and devoted \\"slave\\" of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.     Extremely accurate to Jane Austen's original book, fans will recognize line after line as much of the witty dialogue was taken straight from the original novel. Although it's five hours long, the delightful banter, lovely scenery, engaging dances and colourful characters make the movie interesting every minute. To any fan of the book, I would recommend this as the most amazing adaptation you will ever see!    PS: I did NOT care for the 2005/Keira Knightly version AT ALL. Though less than half the length of this version, I was bored the whole time and kept thinking, this movie is all wrong! If you haven't seen the A&E version, but have seen the 2005 and didn't like it, I highly recommend that you watch this - I think you will enjoy it much, much more!
0307474712|4.0|I'll admit, this was a little slow for me at first.  So you may struggle at the beginning, but hang in there because the end is totally worth it & ties it all together.  I got chills a few times along the way but at the end I was surprised to find that when I closed the book there were tears running down my face.  The format is so different - telling this story by just one day (anniversary) every year - you have no idea where Dex & Em are going to be in the next chapter.  It gives you a unique look into a relationship that is anything but typical but still somehow relatable.  It's a romantic, frustrating, sweet, depressing, inspiring emotional roller coaster.  This book touched me in a way I did not expect, and I highly recommend it.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I am completely \\"prejudiced\\" because I LOVE the A&E version.  I did at least hope to find Mr. Darcy handsome. Unfortunately this movie was a very big disappointment.     Elizabeth Bennet: Played by Keira Knightly, she lacked... spirit. When talking with Mr. Darcy at the ball, she's supposed to be enjoying this clever and witty word play, but she just talks like anyone else would. And why does it seem like she's attracted to Darcy before he even proposes? She's supposed to find him insufferable. While many reviewers said they felt they could relate to Knightly better than Jennifer Ehle of the A&E version, I didn't feel any connection at all. She showed very little emotion at all when she wasn't ranting angrily, and I simply didn't find her performance entrancing.     Mr. Darcy: Someone told me that they thought Matthew Macfadyen cuter than Colin Firth, so I may have had my expectations too high, but... I thought Macfadyen rather ugly! I'm sorry, and I think he's very nice-looking in real life. But as Mr. Darcy... ugh! Also, he didn't make a convincing \\"insufferable\\" Mr. Darcy. Darcy is supposed to be rather rude, cold, and arrogant. Macfadyen simply looked either bored or sleepy.    Mr. Collins: Oh, what a travesty! He's hardly even in the movie, and he didn't really seem to care a twopence about Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  This Mr. Collins was incredibly dull, his only advantage being his shortness.    Mr. Bennet: Donald Sutherland lacks Mr. Bennet's dry wit and sarcasm, much too quiet and beaten down to be interesting. Also, it looked like he hardly ever shaved. With his long hair and scruffy chin, I kept thinking he looked like a cross between Benjamin Franklin and a pirate.    Dialogue: Choppy, rushed, and SO watered down from Austen's original. They talked so fast that it was like they were afraid of running out of time and had to spit out every line as fast as they could.     Costuming: Although a bit more attractive to our 21st century eyes than that of A&E, itdoes not feel as authentic. Miss Bingley's dress in particular is ridiculous, having no sleeves and only very thin straps.     Music: The one area in which this movie shines, although the music is not as authentic to the time period as that in A&E.     I had fairly low expectations when I started this movie, but I really tried to like it. Unfortunately, I found the events rushed and chopped, the characters cast quite poorly, and the over-all movie pretty lame. I was more bored in two hours than I've ever been in the five hour-long version. If you're looking for a good one, I would recommend the 1995 A&E TV serial.

Yes, virtually the entire story is narrated by a dog. Yes, his master is determined to become a world class Formula 1 race driver. But those factors are little more than incidental to what is a poingnant, suspenseful, heartwarming, truly marvelous story. in fact two separate but tightly intertwined stories of the man and his faithful four-legged companion.    Let me back off one step. On reflection, the author's choice to have the dog be the narrator was positively brilliant. It gives the reader a truly unique perspective from which to observe the story unfold. But having set that foundation, Stein needed consumate skills to build the story structure thereon, skills which he has clearly demonstrated in this book. Buy it.

B003ZHQVJO|4.0|This is a great crossover CD release by the 'bad boy', Kid Rock, titled \\"Born Free\\". Unlike his usual hard rock/metal sound, he has a mixture of rock, 'countryish rock', pop rock, country (\\"Flyin' High\\") & Mississippi blues (\\"Rock Bottom Blues\\") in this new CD. The album is produced by the legendary Rick Rubin (AC/DC, Neil Diamond, Josh Groban, Jakob Dylan, etc). This 'crossover' is certainly not going to please everyone or all the fans.This great CD opens with the wonderful rocking title track, \\"Born Free\\" (great guitar sounds & great 'croaggy/harsh' vocals. \\"Slow My Roll\\" is a great 'countryish rock' track (great harmonies & great guitar overdrive). \\"Care\\" is a (bit laid-back) solid track : great rhythm guitar & great vocals by Kid Rock & Mary J. Blige. T. I. provides some good rapping as well. Similarly \\"Collide\\" is a solid laid-back countryish rock track : great (vocals and harmonies) by Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow. \\"God Bless Saturday\\" is just an okay track (early 'screaming vocals', some swearing in the song. Guitar sounds are similar to what the band ZZ Top often plays). Great guitar work on great tunes, \\"Purple Sky\\" & \\"When It Rains\\". \\"Flyin' High\\" is a solid country track : beautiful vocals by Kid Rock & featuring Zac Brown with beautiful melodic high range vocals. \\"Times Like These\\" is a solid track/gem : great guitars & vocals. Has a beautiful chorus & melody. Wonderful piano & rhythm guitar combination! This is my favourite track from this great album & hence the title of my review. Just okay tracks, \\"Rock On\\" & \\"Rock Bottom Blues\\". The great closing track, \\"For The First Time (In A Long Time) is countryish pop/rock with Kid Rock providing great high range vocals. On overall, this is a great varied but balanced album with tracks written by (R.J. Ritchie & M. Young) & produced by the ever dependable legendary Rick Rubin, a highly recommended CD listening.
B0000041A9|2.0|I bought this CD on the strength my opinion of Richter's collection of Bach piano music, and was not disappointed upon hearing his playing here either.  However, as my wife said when I first played it, \\"Who's the cellist?  It sounds like my brother learning to play the violin.\\"  Her brother, by the way, became a drummer and then an economist.  I don't know enough to tell if this is typical Rostropovich, but his sound on this CD is scraping and harsh.  I ended up giving it to a reseller.  I recommend Fournier as a greater XX century cellist.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|This is a great CD release effort by Bruno Mars, titled, \\"Doo-Woops & Hooligans\\". This great album opens with the solid track/gem \\"Grenade\\" : a soulful track with beautiful vocals & harmonies. This is my favourite track from this album. It signals the arrival of Bruno Mars with a 'bang' rather well. \\"Just The Way You Are\\" is another solid track/gem : a soul track with wonderful melody, harmonies & simple but yet effective lyrics. \\"Our First Time\\" is an okay/good reggae track. \\"Liquor Store Blues\\" is a great reggae track featuring the great reggae artist & producer, Damian Marley (great vocals). \\"Runaway Baby\\" is a rather poor pop 'racy' track. The interesting track, \\"The Lazy Song\\" : has great guitar chords & drums combination with beautiful matching vocals. Has simple beautiful but very effective/matching lyrics. \\"Marry Me\\" is a solid track/gem : a wonderful pop song, great 'racy' drumming with great high range vocals & lyrics are highly persuasive. \\"Talking To The Moon\\" is a laid-back track : great grand piano with matching vocals. \\"Count On Me\\" is a great pop song : great guitar & hand drums combinations with great vocals. The closing track, \\"The Other Side\\" is a good pop/hip hop/soul track featuring the talented Cee-Lo Green & B.o.B. (he rapping rather well). Their performance at the Grammy Awards 2011 was quite impressive & 'unusual' hairdo of the lead vocalist. On overall, this is an impressive CD release effort by Bruno Mars, a highly recommended CD listening.

B004DC2WF2|4.0|From someone who read the comic books:  I don't really like her being older -- and it definitely changes the story.  I'd like to see how this dynamic plays out, but it saddens me that I'm sure it is because of the TV producers getting squirmy about her romantic relationship (later on).  I think it changes the sister dynamic too much. It changes it from the girls being like best friends to them barely knowing each other.  I liked the 23 year old working in a law office picking up her sister better.  another thing that is gone is the flirtiness and girly girl stuff.  I like them better without it, but at the same time it doesn't lead to the character growth and development as much  -- nor does it lend to Andrea being able to find herself and grow into herself...as being in your 30s and having already settled more with life is different than the girl who was really just getting to start her life before she had to restart it.
1400079144|1.0|I am very curious to know how many other readers found the \\"twist\\" in this novel to be as painfully obvious as I did. This plot element was introduced about 1/3 of the way through the novel and almost immediately I knew exactly where Brown was going with it. It was so moronically obvious that I was actually confused as to whether or not Brown actually intended it to be a surprise. When the twist is finally revealed in chapter 119, I couldn't believe that it was presented as though it would be even remotely surprising to the reader.    Aside from that, I thought this was a pretty lame book. I thought \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\" were fun reads, if not particularly intelligent. This was just stupid and, in the case of the twist mentioned above, offensive. How dumb does Dan Brown think we are? I agree with the reviewers who mentioned that a new editor is needed. There was so much repetition of information that did NOT need to be repeated, that I wondered if Brown bothered to read through the manuscript once he had finished typing it. The Noetic \\"science\\" subplot was completely unnecessary and made it hard to take the characters seriously. The religious yammering was also annoying and preachy and sure to alienate non-Christian readers. (He tries to make the point that the philosophy embraced by the character in question encompasses all religions, but anyone who is not Christian will recognize this it is still a very Christian-centric worldview that entirely lacks perspective outside of a Christian viewpoint.)    I also tired of Brown's obvious fascination with rich people. In the world of Dan Brown, all interesting people are wealthy, and people who aren't wealthy...well there aren't any, so I don't know what they're like. Brown is constantly apologizing for the good fortune of the rich and lamely tries to show how difficult life is for these billionaire, old-moneyed families because they have so many responsibilities that the poor don't have, but I'm not buying it. Apparently if you have a rich brother or friend you can do anything you want, including getting into restricted access government buildings and performing undeniably unethical and secretive \\"science\\" experiments. This book is like the escapist films of the 1930s that presented Depression-era audiences with the trials and tribulations of the super-rich and glamorous completely divorced from the real world, but without all the charm and Fred Astaire.
0756405890|4.0|This is one of those rare fantasy genre novels that focuses strongly on the human element and only a little on the fantasy. For instance, Rothfuss, following in the great tradition begun by Tolkien, provides a map of his fictional continent, complete with cities, kingdoms and oceans; it is to his credit that I never once had to reference it. Magical powers and strange beasts also have their place, but it is subordinate to the memoirs of one Kvothe, the greatest hero still alive.<br /><br />Kvothe is the storyteller, and he is telling the story of himself. From his young childhood as the son of traveling performers, to his Dickensian days in a monstrous city, to his unlikely admission into The University as a mid-teenager, he is certainly not the kind of man who doubts his own strength. If he were not so well-accomplished, he would be justly called a braggart. Indeed, one of the most fantastic parts of this fantasy novel is how easily he learns and grows. An arcanist falls in with the troupe, and the young narrator quickly learns all of the man's basic lessons and even some that he had never considered as possibilities. Kvothe is a prodigy similar to Ender in Ender's Game or Will in Good Will Hunting, and his quick rise is one of the few disappointments of the story. As a teacher himself, one would expect Rothfuss to be more sympathetic to the hard grunt work required to learn anything worthwhile, but Kvothe just makes it look a little too easy.<br /><br />While some parts of the story are of higher quality than others, none of it is bad, and none of it is even particularly boring. The quick movement of the first half of the book grinds down when Kvothe joins The University, but that is only because Rothfuss is carefully building up a world of characters and relationships, not to mention the various sciences being taught and learnt. We learn almost nothing of this world's vast history or its varied geography, but by the end of the first novel it feels like we know the world intimately. That is not a mean feat.<br /><br />Rumor has it that 2011 will finally see the publication of book two, The Wise Man's Fear. Reading this novel will leave you wanting more, and it will be all you can do to keep from writing nagging comments on Rothfuss' blog.ly. That is not a mean feat.

B002JVWQT6|5.0|If you're reading through reviews on the Amazon product page, you are probably familiar with the riotously funny sitcom Modern Family.  The show has been discussed and lauded by more eloquent souls than I, but I would like to comment on the quality of the Blu-Ray, for those interested.    Modern Family was filmed using very high quality cameras in the 16:9 aspect ratio which lends intself perfectly to a Blu-Ray transfer.  For a television show, the quality is simply stunning (for comparison's sake, it blows The Office: Season 5 out of the water).  Colors are very realistic and buck the trend of over-saturation while still offering plenty of \\"pop.\\"  With few exceptions, detail is crisp and contrast is again excellent.  Audio quality and clarity is equally as impressive, although being an ensemble comedy, don't expect much from the rear channels.    The extra features consist of roughly 20-30 minutes (per disc, three discs total) of additional family interviews not aired in the episodes as well as some deleted scenes.  I would have liked one or more \\"making of\\" type interviews with the cast and crew, but the included extras will suffice.  Unfortunately, the quality of the deleted scenes varies wildly between each cut.  The video disparity is understandable and does not bother me, but the audio volume changes quite dramatically between one scene and the next, which is a bit annoying.    Despite any negative comments, what's most important about Blu-Ray is being able to enjoy great films and shows (like this one) in the highest quality possible and believe me when I say you will absolutely floored by the pristine picture offered by this transfer.  If you enjoy Modern Family, Season 1 on Blu-Ray is a must-have.
B0041T52S6|4.0|[This review was written for the theatrical release, and does not reference any DVD features.]<br /><br />Imagine, if you will, a world in which video game fights are very real, and interrupt the normal flow of life much like songs in a musical, sweeping the world along into its bizarre unreality until it is completed, at which point life and the world return to normal. That is the bare minimum of what the viewer will need to prepare himself for as he walks into a showing of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Directed by British filmmaker Edgar Wright, Pilgrim is full of the manic energy of his earlier films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, while adding layers of deftly-wrought magical realism which conjure comic-book aesthetics and video game narrative. It's all so much muchness that upon leaving the theater one might be forgiven for wondering what just happened.<br /><br />Ostensibly Pilgrim is a love story in which the protagonist has to deal with his new girlfriend's previous lovers, but instead of a love-triangle, the story gives us a love-nonagon. Scott Pilgrim, our fearful hero, must battle the Seven Evil Exes of the lovely Ramona Flowers in order to win the right to court her. Each fight is a mix of comic book superhero tropes and old-school (8-bit) video gaming, with some chop-socky martial arts thrown in. Defeated nemeses shatter into a pile of coins-\\"You just headbutted my boyfriend so hard he burst,\\" says the surviving girlfriend of one defeated Ex-or into other common gaming objects like weapons or powerups. All this stuff threatens to overpower the movie and destroy any meaning outside of itself, but Wright manages to keep it under control, if just barely.<br /><br />The weakest links in this story are unfortunately the two main actors, Michael Cera as Scott and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona. Scott is obviously written to be a self-centered jerk who has left his own trail of exes behind him, and who has little empathy for the plights of his friends and family. Sadly, Cera's usual comic schtick is to act almost psychotically self-conscious and aware of everything around him, constantly worried of being taken the wrong way, and whenever Cera tires of acting the jerk in Pilgrim he reverts to the awkward teenager he portrayed in Arrested Development. Winstead's problem is that she seems to have neither the beauty nor the charisma to embody a woman who could both force Scott to leave his current girlfriend and also create an impressive collection of exes who hate her enough to band together in violence against her current beau.<br /><br />The actors chosen to portray the League of Evil Exes, on the other hand, are superb. Satya Bhabha as the first Evil Ex is hilariously creepy and ridiculous. Chris Evans (Fantastic Four) as her ex-turned-action-star Lucas Lee is a good-looking bully you love to hate. Brandon Routh is cast perfectly as a super-powered vegan who can fly and punch people so hard the highlights are knocked out of their hair, and who wears a shirt obviously reminiscent of his breakout role. While the Katayanagi twins seem to fill the shoes of the two exes Ramona dated at the same time well enough, they don't have enough screen time to make an impression. Mae Whitman as Roxy Richter is worlds away from her morally-upright wallflower role of Ann Veal in Arrested Development, which only makes the contrast that much more amusing. Finally, Jason Schwartzman (Rushmore, The Darjeeling Limited) as Gideon Gordon Graves perfectly embodies the self-centered jerk that Scott is meant to be, and then takes it to another level. I suspect that the parallels between Scott and Gideon are supposed to be clearer than they are, with Scott finally overcoming his nemesis by a choice of will, but unfortunately that subtext is lost by Cera in the actor's confusion.<br /><br />The greatest misfortune surrounding Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is that it was released in the same weekend as The Expendables and Eat Pray Love. Most men looking for an action movie went to see the former, and most women wanting a film with romance went for the latter. Little did all these moviegoers know that both could have been found in spades at Scott Pilgrim. If this film continues to do poorly in theaters, one hopes it will at least have a long and rich life on video. It's a breath of fresh air in a room that has gotten far too stale, especially if its box office competitors are to be taken as indicative of the times.ormer, and most women wanting a film with romance went for the latter.

B002ZG980U|5.0|[This review was written for the theatrical release, and does not reference any DVD features.]<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is becoming best-known these days for his Batman movies, but before he was a purveyor of superhero pulp he was reinventing the noir genre for the late twentieth century with mind-bending films like Following and Memento, the latter of which brought Nolan to the attention of American audiences. His films that are not merely adaptations or remakes of the works of others are ridiculously complex and yet still in the end comprehensible and satisfying. (And yes, Memento was an adaptation of his brother's short story \\"Memento Mori,\\" but the two seem to have been artistic collaborators very early on.) Whenever Nolan adapts a foreign work to film, whether that be the remake of the Nordic movie Insomnia or the filming of Christopher Priest's novel The Prestige, the results are always good, but not as great as his fans know they could be. After making Warner Brothers a giant pile of money with the smarter-than-average The Dark Knight, he has been given a budget large enough to free his delicately intricate imagination to what one can only assume are the distant limits of his capabilities. And yet, at the end of it, one is left believing that he could do even more.<br /><br />Inception is the story of Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who makes a career out of invading the dreams of others, usually for the purposes of extracting valuable information from the invaded. As in all good noir films, Cobb is an imperfect anti-hero, surrounded by secrets he doesn't want to admit, and haunted by a mysterious femme fatale. And just like Humphrey Bogart in so many of his films, Cobb takes a questionable job from a questionable man; but unlike Bogart's usual roles, Cobb is actually doing some very bad things for his own selfish reasons. A bad decision he made some years back with his wife led to some very unfortunate consequences, and he escapes frequently into his own dream world to sort out the pain.<br /><br />The conceit of entering another person's dreams has drawn comparison's to films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Matrix. Unlike the latter, Inception does not dumb down the concept at the beginning and then needlessly complicate it as the story goes on. Instead, all of the complicated explanations are laid out in advance, with multiple examples of how the dream-invasion technology works, so that when the time comes for the extended invasion to which all of this is leading, the audience is never truly lost or confused. Dreams are layered within dreams, and those within more dreams. Those lines of Shakespeare come to mind when watching Cobb and his team casually build and destroy entire worlds at will, \\"This vision... shall dissolve, / And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, / Leave not a rack behind.\\"<br /><br />Cobb's dream team--the cast of which includes such interesting choices as Joseph Gordon-Levitt ((500) Days of Summer) and Ellen Page (Juno)--is hired not to extract information from the heir to an energy empire (Cillian Murphy), but to plant an idea within his mind: not extraction but inception. As Cobb and his colleagues point out, inception is extremely difficult if not impossible because people can tell if an idea is being forced upon them from the outside. If a grown man feels that he is being coerced into an idea, he will fight against it. But Cobb takes the job not only because he wants what is being offered as a reward, but because he knows from experience that inception is possible; he also knows from experience that it is very dangerous for everyone involved.<br /><br />If there are any weaknesses in Inception they revolve mostly around the fact that our dreams are never as orderly or logical as those laid out here. To be sure, the film's dreams are being designed by architects and are intentionally given narratives and a certain level of order, but Inception lacks any real presentation of the bizarre randomness that we actually experience when we fall asleep. Eternal Sunshine understood this strangeness much better, although that was a less ambitious film than Nolan's. There is also the ethical question of whether or not we should be rooting for Cobb when he is engaging in such dubious activity. Even so, he is not presented as a moral hero like Bruce Wayne who is only trying to do the right thing; Cobb is dangerously selfish in his desires, even to the point of putting his team at risk in order to keep his own secrets safe.<br /><br />Inception has an overabundance of originality and intelligence, something entirely lacking in most films today. Nolan as auteur puts out some of the best films of our time, and even when he is working with other people's stories he manages to keep it smart and enthralling (unlike some other auteurs we all know). His next slated project is the third (and promised last) movie of his Batman series, after which he will reportedly move on to produce a relaunch of the Superman franchise. My hope, though, is that he can continue as an auteur to direct the kind of films that push the envelope of filmmaking's capabilities.tually experience when we fall asleep.

B002OG5GT8|5.0|I've had this amp for a couple of weeks now and it has been great. I have noticed quite a large improvement in the max volume and a decent improvement in the sound quality (quite impressive for $21)  I bought this primarily because while listening to my Zune in the car through the auxiliary input, even with the car stereo and Zune volume all the way up, I could not really hear most music if my windows were down. I bought this and now at about 75% max volume, I can cruise at freeway speeds and enjoy even the quietest of songs. I also noticed that the sound was...more full...I'm not an audiophile really so it's hard to explain, but it just sounded better in general. Maybe this is a placebo effect, but for the low price, just the volume enhancement was worth it.  I will say that with my Grado SR80i headphones (which I highly recommend as well) there was not as much improvement in sound quality as the headphones themselves seemed to work as much magic as can be squeezed out of the Zune. With the default earbuds, I experienced the fuller sound though, but I hate earbuds so my testing was not very extensive with them.    As for battery life, I use it a couple of hours every day and just charge it when I charge my Zune (every few days) no problems so far, but it's still a bit early for that to be an issue.    Also, due to its small size, it is completely unobtrusive while in a pocket.    I may have found what I'm giving to my friends as a Christmas gift this year.
B00448SE4S|2.0|I started watching this movie expecting more than what it really turned out to be. Some movies exist in a fantasy world where impossible things happen, but you know that going into them and that's exactly what they were made to be, where Scott Pilgrim tries to be a normal movie in a normal world with all kinds of impossible stuff going on in it, and nobody in that world finds it odd. The special effects are pretty good in the movie and the last fight scene with the G-man is pretty cool, but the overall movie was too odd and sometimes boring. The part Michael Cera plays is also old and worn out. It was funny to watch in his first movie, but really didn't help the movie here since its the same basic character he plays in every movie. I guess if you have read and enjoyed the books you will probably enjoy the movie. Those that have not may find this to be not worth watching.
B003VYAVGA|4.0|This review is a copy of the one I posted on a blog I write for (Radio Creme Brulee Blog). I figured I should mention this before I dive into the actual review. Now, that I've said that, here goes:<br /><br />Very rarely is an album these days released in the midst of a strong wave of anticipation and excitement. Ever since British \\"boyband turned manband\\" Take That announced that former band member Robbie Williams had returned to the band after 15 years and that they had recorded their first album as a quintet since 1995's \\"Nobody Else\\", there was a mass hysteria that swept both the international media and Take That fans worldwide off their feet.<br /><br />Ever since the band made their public announcement of their new album \\"Progress\\", fans surmised that there would be a stylistic shift for two primary reasons:<br /><br />a)  Musically, Robbie Williams is a very different entity and his influence was bound to manifest itself in the overall sound of the new album.<br /><br />b) Electropop/dance oriented producer Stuart Price (famous for production on Madonna's \\"Confessions from the dancefloor\\" and Seal's \\"System\\") was at the helm of production.<br /><br />Fans got their first sneak preview of the album around six weeks ago with the airing of \\"The Flood\\" (the album's lead single) on radio stations worldwide.<br /><br />  This mid-tempo track with its soaring chorus features Robbie Williams (lead) and Gary Barlow on vocals. It is hands down the best Take That single since \\"Never Forget\\" (1995).  The somewhat cryptic lyrics suggest that the song might be about the band's new-found camaraderie as a quintet. The song acts as a perfect musical bridge between the music of the 4-piece Take That (sans Robbie Williams) and the rest of the material on \\"Progress\\" - which is markedly different from \\"The Flood\\".<br /><br />After having listened to the album once, the following observations come to mind.<br /><br />a) The overall \\"sound\\" of the album is a mix between that of The Killers' \\"Day and Age\\" and Robbie Williams' \\"Rudebox\\" album.<br /><br />b) Frontman Gary Barlow has taken quite a backseat vocally. \\"Eight Letters\\" is the only song featuring solo vocals by Barlow.<br /><br />c) Robbie Williams and Mark Owen sing lead vocals on most of the album.<br /><br />The album's highlights are:<br /><br />Wait: The track opens with lush string arrangements and suddenly breaks into electronic beats and a catchy verse which slowly blends into a beautiful chorus which features the band harmonizing like they never have.  Robbie Williams dominates vocals on the track. \\"Wait\\" definitely feels like a track that could have been on Williams' \\"Rudebox\\" album.<br /><br />Eight Letters: This is the achingly beautiful ballad that fans have secretly waited for  since \\"Back for good\\" (1995).  Gary Barlow sings over gentle and lush electronic embellishments which slowly lead to the uplifting harmony-filled chorus.<br /><br />The Flood: A lot has been said about this undeniably brilliant lead single - and hence, by saying more, I would simply be repeating myself.<br /><br />The one song that could have been a highlight is \\"Happy Now\\". Stuart Price has outdone himself with the production on this track - one that you can imagine playing as you get ready to hit the town on a weekend night or while driving along your city's main drag with the windows down and the car stereo volume all the way up.  Unfortunately, the boys decided to go with a mildly robotic variant of their voices as opposed to their actual voices on the verses. This is a significant detractor. Unlike most artists of today, Take That does NOT need a vocoder. I suppose even the best artists need to be forgiven for their artistic misfires which are probably just a result of childish enthusiasm - which is understandable given the recent revival of the band and its fortunes.<br /><br /> Given all that has been said so far, one might wonder what my verdict on the album is so far. Well, the radical shift in musical style might have a polarizing effect on Take That fans.  Fans of the adult alternative/MOR sound on albums such as \\"Beautiful World\\" and \\"Circus\\" may not warm up to the album and will almost definitely blame Robbie Williams for his disproportionately large input to the album (although the recent Take That documentary seems to indicate that Gary Barlow is still very much the leader of the pack when it comes to the music).<br /><br />In my humble opinion, Take That has done themselves a huge favor by reinventing themselves. They truly have made \\"Progress\\". A rehash of \\"Beautiful World\\" or \\"Circus\\" would have spelled the end for them. This would be a shame given that the band is easily one of the biggest success stories in pop music history.<br /><br />Some may perceive \\"Progress\\" as a \\"happy ending\\"  but I see it as the start of new beginnings and musical endeavors. With this album, Take That has single-handedly challenged assertions about the limited shelf-life of a boyband. Boybands as fad-based entities fade but strong musical entities will stand the test of time amidst all the negativity of pop music critics.<br /><br />Take That does not run a risk of becoming irrelevant anytime soon and if they choose to release more albums together, I am all ears.\\"Beautiful World\\" and \\"Circus\\" may not warm up to the album and will almost definitely blame Robbie Williams for his disproportionately large input to the album (although the recent Take That documentary seems to indicate that Gary Barlow is still very much the leader of the pack when it comes to the music).

B00005JPMZ|3.0|I grew up on the Ninja Turtles and this movie disappointed me.  Although it was at times entertaining, crap was going so fast I had no idea what was going on.  If it had fight seens in it as Kung Fu Panda I think I would have enjoyed it more.      I gave it three stars because it was entertaining but not what I expected.  Now I have never read the comic books to the Ninja Turtles nor any other comic books but I never heard of April being a ninja.  I watched the cartoon growing up and of course the movies which were amazing.  That kind of threw me off.  But I'm not going to talk much about the story because it might have something to do with the comics that I do not have any knowledge on.    In the end I just expected more from this movie and its not like I hyped it up at all.  I just thought there would be more.  Thanks for reading.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I've had the raw footage of this show for years, but it was great to finally get a commercial release.<br /><br />The chemistry between SRV and AK is great.  It's fun to watch these guitar giants trading licks and chatting about the blues.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />Vince<br />SRVrocks.com
0425188809|5.0|First of all I love reading reviews on here and I went through some of the 1 Star reviews just to see if they had any good points.    In most of the reviews that were 1 Star, they mentioned that the first 300 pages were amazing but it just ended to abruptly.  It did end fast and I was a little disappointed but it wasn't horrible.  So you gave in a one star because the whole book was good but the ending.  If the table was turned and you read a horrible book for 300 pages and then it had an AWESOME ending your review would probably be around a 3 star.  Just because you ended on a bad note the enire novel suffers.      But we are in luck.  Only about %1 of reviewers gave this a 1 star which doesnt really matter that much.  But in the end this was a very good book and I have recommended it to a lot of friends that have enjoyed it as well.      ENJOY!!!
B0049D1TCM|1.0|This ain't rap, this is pop. This record is soooo underwhelming. I was a fan during the mixtape eras of this young lady and it just shows not everybody is a studio album artist. It'll sell due to her big fanbase, but it won't have longevity nor be classified as anyones classic. Minaj's proven she can jump on someone's song -- or idea -- and get the job done, on her own songs, she struggles to make something to call her own. let us pray.
B003UYUQZW|2.0|This was just a big disappointment.  I would rather watch someone play the video game.      When I heard they were coming out with this movie I was pretty excited.  Then I saw the preview and was even disappointed then.  I had no intentions of seeing the movie but it played on a flight that I was on twice and I decided I would give it a chance.  It just reminded me of a B rated movie.  Although I did like the ending just the rest of the movie was terrible.  Thanks for reading.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban - Illuminations<br />Release date: November 15, 2010<br />143/Reprise Records<br /><br />Sometime around September of 2001 I was introduced to a singer that would proceed to impress me in so many ways. Josh Groban was 20. I was older. I remember calling my son and saying, \\"You should listen to this guy named Josh Groban. He has an amazing voice.\\" My son responded, \\"I will check him out, and you should listen to this guy named John Mayer.\\" Nine years later and we are both still listening to and recommending these two artists.<br /><br />Josh Groban is very hard to define or place into a genre. He is a voice, but he is so much more. Illuminations is his fifth release, and all four prior releases have gone multi-platinum. His last release, Noel, was the number one selling CD in 2007 even though it was not released until October and was a Christmas album.<br /><br />The three years since this last release have seen many changes for Josh. He chose to head in a different direction with a new management team and new producer, Rick Rubin. Rubin has a resume that is beyond impressive, and artists such as Johnny Cash, Neil Diamond, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica have trusted him. Rubin tends to do things in a way that was not the norm for Josh or his fans and likes to strip the performer down to what Rubin feels is essential for the music.<br /><br />Change is a bit scary for fans and the `Grobanites' on his fan sites have been concerned about this upcoming release. I shared their concern. I listened to the first three pre-release singles that went to iTunes and his websites and was not a fan of the higher notes of the songs and was afraid that the album was going to be a disappointment. However, after 22 listens over the past three days I can happily say that sometimes change can be a good thing. I was a huge fan of the old Josh. But the new Josh is damn good too. Illuminations will change how Josh is perceived for the rest of his career because it is a game changer.<br /><br />Josh's fans did not grow up with this type of music from Josh Groban. Josh Groban grew up with this CD.<br /><br />Josh is about the vocals. However, on this release Josh co-wrote the majority of the songs and proves that he can also write. After Illuminations I honestly believe he will be considered a talented songwriter and will expand his horizons to include not only theatre, TV and concerts but writing lyrics for others. He is that good. This CD is that good. Just turn the stereo up and listen.<br /><br />The album starts with an instrumental piece, \\"Wandering Kind,\\" that Josh wrote when he was twelve years old. Josh fans are waiting to hear his voice, but this piece will still impress.<br /><br />The first vocal piece, \\"Bells of New York City,\\" makes it clear that this is going to be a very personal release. The lyrics take center stage and paint a very clear picture as \\"the bells of New York City tell me not to go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Galileo\\" is an exceptionally touching song of love. I can visualize this song in a musical and bringing endless applause. Picture the love of your life, put this song on, feel the passion.<br /><br />\\"L'Ora Dell'Addio\\" is the first of four songs that are not sung in English. However, this was a positive thing because I was not distracted by lyrics and could focus on the music and the voice. Josh's vocal abilities shine. The song made me stand up. It made me pump my fists. If anyone, anywhere, has any question if he has IT in his voice still....YES. HE. DOES. At some point I would like to know what the words of the song mean, but for now I am blown away by its power and beauty.<br /><br />\\"Hidden Away,\\" \\"Você Existe Em Mim,\\" and \\"Higher Window\\" can all be heard at [...] or purchased on iTunes. They are very good songs, and I can appreciate them as part of the whole. I give kudos for the way they were released prior to release date as a way of giving fans a preview of what is to come. However, I don't believe that they are the songs this release will be remembered for.<br /><br />\\"If I Walk Away.\\" The lyrics and passion of this song are more than I can describe in words. This song is special. You want lyrics? You want instruments? You want meaning? Just listen. The song builds as instruments and backup vocals are added, but it then fades back away which keeps the song personal and intimate. \\"If I walk away, please follow me.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love Only Knows.\\" A big issue that fans had with the first pre-releases was the falsetto voice Josh used in the two English songs. This song begins with the same falsetto. However, it then begins to soar and all memory of the falsetto is wiped away. It totally won me over and the lyrics left me touched. \\"I can't breathe without you and I know...we need each other.\\" Sometimes words are so much more than they intend.<br /><br />\\"War at Home.\\" This song has made me think and listen again and again and again. Each time I listen I find a different interpretation and each one is poignant. I feel this will be a standing ovation song in concert. Its words are inspiring and Josh's delivery is powerful. \\"You are not alone. You see these hands, they're a billion strong. They are yours now.\\" The song builds with strength and allows Josh to excel at what he does so very well.<br /><br />\\"London Hymn\\" is a choral offering where Josh's strong voice is sometimes overwhelmed by the backup vocals. However, it leads straight into the final song in such a way that I won't be skipping this track because I like the segue.<br /><br />\\"Straight to You.\\" A Nick Cave song that finishes this CD perfectly with a message that is worth pondering.<br /><br />To the all the younger people reading this: buy this CD for your parents if not for yourselves. It. Is. Really. Really. Good.sion of this song are more than I can describe in words. This song is special. You want lyrics? You want instruments? You want meaning? Just listen.

B002BNKQDK|5.0|I bought this for my husband for last Christmas. He absolutely loved it!!! It is a great collectors piece for any Watchmen fan or general graphic novel fan. I would recommend this to anyone!! Its grade A. As for the hidden switch another posted about here, i did not think it was hidden at all. You can't help but notice it right out of the package or so my husband says. Anyone this is just one item in my husbands collection and most likely won't be the last.
1603580557|4.0|If there's an argument weakness that comes up time and again in political debates, it's a willful disregard of systemic effects (something that seems to particularly affect libertarian thought). But systemic thinking is critically important in both science and social matters, and this book, Meadows' unfinished masterwork, is the guide to get on the matter.    It might actually have been better without some of the pictures -- many of the system diagrams are somewhat content-free -- but for the most part, it's a very useful guide to explaining why life isn't made of black boxes.
B002HWRZH0|5.0|I bought this item for my husband for Christmas. He was ecstatic when he received it. He loves things like this and is a collector. It is made in such a way that it is attractive yet enjoyable. I don't recommend it for children. Adults only who truly appreciate what this represents. Well worth the price.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Love the music on this CD. I recently saw the show on Broadway and it was amazing. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves musicals.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I purchased this cd early today, having ignored Kanye's G.O.O.D friday program in an attempt, in this society of leaks and instant gratification, to genuinely approach a work with the possibility of surprise, and I was surely rewarded.  This is a sonically shocking, beautiful album.  I won't go on describing each song or my favorites- it's an album that benefits from an undisposed listener.  It begins with a jarring British spoken word skit attempting to describe reality as removed from perception, and ends with a stoic, unmistakably American (oh, how I wish for italics here) voice telling of the American dream; these two bookend the ramblings of an egomaniacal genius, a work of harmonies and abused expectations, with John Legend's euphony swapped for West's strained warbling, Bon Iver's indie voice wrung through an autotuner, Jay Z giving one of the fiercest verses of his career, not to mention dozens of others that I'll leave for you to find.  The beat from 'Lost in the World' bleeds into the spoken-word of 'Who Will Survive in America' and eventually fades as the album is ended in the same way as it began- that is, out of West's hands, with his life--his materialism, his religion, his dreams which are all of a shared stew--properly contextualized, and the new American (not to mention, the new musical) way, one beyond antiquated notions clearly inadequate for current travails, at least to the best of West's abilities, defined.  A great album, and I say so without comparing it to others, for I don't listen to all too much music, that is aesthetically pleasing, emotionally resonant, and entirely relevant.
B0040YFR1Y|1.0|First I would like to say the picture quality of this blu ray is amazing. The reason why I gave it one star is because when I poped the disc into my PS3 I had to sit and stare at a black screen for about 10 minutes. This is insane!!!! Why the hell is this disc taking so long to load? I have never had this problem with any other blu ray disc, EVER!!!! I googled and found others were having the same problem. I loaded all the extra content like one viewer said to do but I still have the same problem. I am thinking about returning this piece of crap.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Keeping this mini-epic limited to cliché warehouses and exotic islands, writer/director Sylvester Stallone keeps \\"The Expendables\\" lean, lite, and simple while masterfully juggling a giant ensemble cast of convincing middle aged tough guys. While the focus is primarily on the amusing macho banter between Stallone and Statham, everyone is cast to their strengths and at least gets one moment to do their thing and do it well.  In more limited roles, Rourke delivers a soulful rambling monologue like only he can while Bruce Willis drops a bunch of F bombs like only he can. As can be expected, Arnold's cameo is short but sweet.  Lundgren gets a surprising amount of screen time in a memorable but weird even for him performance while Roberts threatens to steal the movie as the arrogant wise cracking villain.     Much like the story, the action is brutish and simple. Don't expect too many complex emotional twists or turns, just the bad guys being a-holes, and the heroes blowing them to pieces with large guns in retort. Of course Stallone uses every opportunity to pour on the gore, but it should be noted that while the violence is graphic it is not nearly as mean and nasty as the violence in his last Rambo outing; it's all in good fun this time out.  There are also plenty of well staged fight sequences cast to the strengths of the performers; Li and Lundgren work a smart kung fu fight, Statham beats up a gang of obnoxious punks, UFC star Raynd Couture breaks limbs with mixed marital arts holds, while the aging Stallone gets his \\"a$$ kicked.\\"  Be warned...there are good looking women in small roles but no 80s throwback gratuitous nudity.

0470185317|5.0|Hi, I have been working with MCUs but I liked to start to play with FPGA to fill the gap I had for some new electronic projects, although I develop application software since long time ago I have no idea about VHDL and FPGAs were totally unknown to me. This book it is very clear and practical so with cheap FPGA boards and free software you can start to work from simple to more comples projects.
1594481717|5.0|This book is a brilliant \\"mind shifter\\" for business leaders who want to stay on the cutting edge of cultural innovation.  Daniel Pink discusses the six essential aptitudes for  sales leaders to master to maintain their leadership as we move from  \\"Information Age\\" (logical, computer based) to \\"Conceptual Age\\" (creativity, empathy etc):    Design     Story    Symphony    Empathy    Play    Meaning    He makes an analysis between R-brain and L-brain thinkers - \\"how the brain works and how to work the brain\\" Gone are the days of left brain dominance of accountants and lawyers- make place for right brain thinkers, artists and designers!     I recommend this book for every leader and every parent coaching their children in pursuing their education and career!     I found this book informative and easy to read. It's in my \\"Dantotsu (Best of the Best) Collection.\\"
141690977X|3.0|..I cant understand why this author refuses to write a sequel.....\\"She just isnt into you\\". Im beginning to think he(the author) doesnt want to believe that chicks have not been that \\"into him\\". Come on dude...it happens to all of us from time to time (no matter how ravishing and good looking one is)...
B001NXDSLG|5.0|More Woodstock knowledgeable people might complain - but it was pretty eye-opening to me & I thought the vintage footage was great.   Learned more about Woodstock than I'd ever learned through history books/news/etc.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is the five disc edition of blade runner.  Many people have discussed the detail, all I need to say is that this is possibly the best video and audio transfer on blu ray and a true home cinema show off disc.  Not only this, you get multiple versions and one of the best making of documentaries that is raw, honest and sometimes uncomfortable to watch, but for any movie fans, absolutely fascinating.    This is a must buy if you have a blu ray player, there is no doubt about it.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Odd and Off at times, it's well worth holding on 'till the end. I cry a lot during the last episode, for my own reasons. But mostly 'cause how it ends... but it's beautiful. You have to see it to understand. And by that I mean start from the begining and enjoy the difference !
B00275EGX8|1.0|As a retired military officer, I agree totally with the negative reviews of this film.  In spite of Jeremy Renner's above-average performance, the film only won awards because it was the fashion-of-the-year for Hollywood -- the group that continually pats themselves on the back with too-many-to-count awards shows.  I knew the Oscars were no longer relevant when Michael Moore won an Oscar for his \\"documentary\\" Bowling for Columbine -- a fabrication from beginning to end.   I hope Renner gets better parts in better movies -- he has the talent.  But this film was unrealistic, pretentious, and an insult to the brave men and women who actually work \\"downrange\\".
0525951652|4.0|Definitely one for lightweight-history buffs. Despite its heft and the amount of historical ground it covers, this book is a surprisingly light (and at times titillating) read. It gives great insight into some of the terrible decisions and movements of the WWI era, as well as some of the triumphs including womens suffrage. My only caveat about it as a read, is that one comes out of it feeling as though such grand events have been trivialized, such that they carry less emotional weight in ones mind than they perhaps should. But that does not detract from what is a marvellous book and I look forward to the remaining two books of the trilogy.
031603438X|5.0|I bought this book because I saw a interview on NBC with the GREAT Keith Richards and Matt Lowher. My husband and I are BIG Rolling Stones fans. I have read books on the group but THIS BOOK beats them all. It really takes you inside Keith's head and his childhood and gives you a true story of Rags to Riches. It is very well written and is funny as hell !! If you like the Stones , it is a MUST READ - BUY IT !!!!! Amazon had the best deal on the purshase...I bought this book as a Christmas Gift for my husband, ha ha I gave it to him early - he has raed it and I can't put it down !!! I have a new RESPECT for Mr. Richards, I just thought of him as the coke head - damn great writer and guitarist - now I know the story of the drugs and how he is now clean and has been for a very long time. Mick will forever be my favorite artist but without Keith , it would have never been as GREAT - There Would Be NO STONES!!!! Thanks, Keith
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|The sound quality is great. To imagine some work done in 1980 could be stripped and re-recorded so wonderful is amazing, you can tell I am old school and love the Beatles back in the day. You will enjoy the experience.
B003WTE886|5.0|Ordered this CD, pre-sale and got it the day it went on sale in stores! Didn't have to worry about the stores selling out and paid a cheaper price! My 14 year old daughter loved it!
B00005J6UP|5.0|One of the best kids movies ever made. It's fun and fast-paced but has a great deal of heart. The entire cast looks like they're having a blast from start to finish. And to all the helicopter parents complaining about the language? LMAO! What century are you people in? The kids in the movie are all 12+ and the f-bomb isn't used once. It's sad that today's kids movies are totally watered down because of all you stifling prudes. No wonder your teens are turning to youtube (and eventually porn) for entertainment.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Can't really complain for the price, you get what you pay for. The movie arrived within a few days and all the coverings looked brand new. The movie skips a little at then end but I bought it knowing it was used. It is what it is. Still happy overall.
0345494768|5.0|This is a must for any Star Wars fan! Get it at a good price and it's worth every page in this book!
B001GAOY5U|3.0|Brendan Fraser. Not much more needs to be said about this film. The name alone makes one think of mediocrity, while not bad enough to be truly offensive, not good enough to be memorable.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|I so enjoyed listening to \\"Bad Samaritans\\" on my daily walks that I would love to listen to this book and learn more about Chang's views on Capitalism.    AUDIOBOOK PLEASE !
B00070QXLI|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and in good condition. Edge of Reason is equally as funny as the first one, if not funnier. If you have an old video player, this will be a great addition to your other favorites. Highly recommend.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|The lyrics will grow on you day by day and the instrumentals will win your heart from the first moment. Never before has a single artist gotten so many other artists to focus and convey the same message they mean to. It's almost like Kanye took their form for a few moments to convey what he wanted to. Truly amazing. It will be ranked up there with the other Hip-Hop masterpieces, but in a different category. Not better necessarily, different.
0670034711|4.0|Great book
0470449748|4.0|This book is very useful for the starters. It helped me for the verbal. If you need help with math then this is not one of the best available in the market. Overall this is a must have for the beginners.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|I loved this movie! Before I saw it though, I had no desire to see this film, and once I did I had quite an enjoyable experience. I even went to see it again in theaters, even though the cost for movies is getting to be ridiculous. Jake Gyllenhaal is quite yummy, and whether you're a guy or a girl there's plenty of eye candy. The plot is a lot of fun as well, and quite exciting! My only qualm is the fact that Persian actors were used almost not at all for it. But still a movie I enjoy watching again and again.
B000002TQB|5.0|The case was cracked in one spot, but this did not affect the quality of the CD, which was excellent. We were glad to get such a great deal on a CD we had wanted for a very long time.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Got this because works on all platforms. I've only used it for Xbox so far but it works perfectly! Sound is great, very comfortable, mic is crystal clear and picks up even soft voices (a must when trying to game while the wife is asleep =)).    All functions work as advertised. Great gaming headset and I would highly recommend to all.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Well written. Enjoyable reading although less \\"CLUB\\" and more about Stone it was very good.  Hope more to come in series.
B0000024JN|5.0|Cant beat old school hip hop. the beasty boys are fun to listen to when you wanna get fired up.
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|AMC is quickly becoming the station to look at for creative new shows.  This show is no exception.  This isn't the same generic junk we've been seeing from the networks for years.  This show is interesting, fun to watch, well made and well written.  This and breaking bad are the only 2 shows I look forward to seeing.      If you like Zombie movies and great post apocalyptic action and drama this is your show.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It took me a few chapters to get into the first book, but what a great series! The second novel throws Katniss right back into the arena on somewhat of a technicality...the arena is even better this time...Collins didn't bother with a rehash here...it's all fresh and exciting. Don't miss this novel if you liked Hunger Games...it may be even better!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|\\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction -- the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale -- the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became \\"the Boy Who Lived.\\" No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.    The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) & Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) is excellent!

The screenplay (based on J.K. Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves (who also did thescreenplay to \\"Wonder Boys\\" (2000) & the screenplays to all, but one of, the Harry Potter films) is excellent!

This is another excellent \\"Harry Potter\\" film that is just as excellent as its other sequels before it. This is a well-made and well-crafted film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. This is one of the best films, if not, the best film, of the holiday season.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I love this CD and all of Melody's music.  I have listened to her over and over, I hope she continues to put out great music .
B0049D1TCM|5.0|The album is great, 2 thumbs up. I have been a fan of Nicki since early 2008 or probably before then.  She is incredible to me, she is like no other person in the industry, I dont care what anyone says. I was a fan before I even saw what she looked like, I think a lot of people get caught up in her looks but her lyrics are even better.  She just makes me, idk about other females just feel sexy, flirty, and fun when I hear her lyrics and her album is full of all of that and more, even singing Romans Revenge and you make the ugly faces while singing you still feel sexy and empowered. :)  True Nicki fans will love the album and the t-shirt with the deluxe edition is too cute (can't wait to wear mine). On a sidenote, I just made my comment on Amazon.com, amazon.com...lol. Im so cute!!!!!
B00004CXT5|1.0|The movie we received was not for the USA and therefore would not play.  This disappointed my granddaughter who was so excited when it arrived only to be sadly upset.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The case is a brushed stainless steel which creates a matte finish that is not reflective, this combined with the black strap and black faced dial create a watch that screams military style, simplicity and functionality.  The watch is extremely accurate for an automatic and the smooth sweep of the second hand is a joy to watch. The fabric strap is soft and comfortable, even the buckle and strap end holder are matte finish (brushed stainless) I have a large hand and large wrist/forearm yet this watch does not appear too small on my wrist.  If you want the Bling of wearing a wall clock on your wrist this is not a watch for that purpose.  When I want the big metal watch look I wear my Seiko Black \\"Monster\\" dive watch which is also a magnificent and accurate watch but for a different end use.  The Seiko 5 SNK809 is a great dress watch while retaining the masculine military look in a time piece that is well constructed, functional and yet not overstated in appearance.  You will love this watch, buy it!! P.S. the dial is unique with the hour markers inside the larger outer radius of arabic numbers that denote the minutes. Seiko has hit a home run with this watch. The watch is available in different colors to match your needs.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|The only thing that was bad about this album was that it has 12 1/2 songs. Should've had at least 3 more. It is classically produced and songs like All of the lights and Blame Game will make even someone who doesn't like hip hop change their mind. A classic is born.
0307454541|3.0|I rarely think movie adaptations are better, but in this case, that's a big fat yes!  The plot is fantastic, character development is great, BUT a quarter of the story could easily be deleted, leaving a faster paced, tighter read.  Far too many lulls, I found myself pushing through much of the Blomkvest scenes--too many irrelevant details. Salander is where it's at--she's the type of character that keeps one engrossed and reading, which is the only reason I finished the book, and why I'll read the next two.
B0049D1TCM|1.0|I don't even know where to start...I should have known this album would SUCK when all of her singles were sounding watered downed and mainstream-ish to create radio spins.  I was hoping that Nicki Minaj would still have the Nicki we all were expecting to hear from the mixtapes on Pink Friday.  The cover and title alone should have told me not to waste my $11.99, but I considered myself a fan and decided to buy it anyway.  I really wish I had my money back, I am left feeling cheated.  I thought I was buying a RAP album not a POP album and it's just not the Nicki Minaj we have heard on mixtapes or even features.  If this her best body of work she could put forth for an album, then she has definately lost alot of fans, including me.  I'm riding with Kim for now on. Her lyrics, and choice of beats all were \\"shiny suited\\" down.  Pink Friday is an example of how people will sacrifice their own ideas and style for money and fame.  Nicki Minaj doesn't have to worry about me buying another album of hers, but I guess she has millions of kids that she decided to target that will, so my little $11.99 means nothing.
1597801585|4.0|The Windup Girl was a difficult novel to read. Not because it took place in the future, with all kinds of futuristic stuff to describe, and futuristic lingo that you have to learn. It's the past that made this a tough nut to crack for me. Specifically, Thailand's past<br /><br />This novel, taking place in a vague future that could be a thousand years from now, or twenty years away, takes place in the city of Bangkok, or what used to be Bangkok, I'm not sure. The novel goes right into the story, and doesn't belittle the reader with a \\"catch up,\\" but rather gets right into it, assuming that you'll get the hang of it as you go along. Normally, I like when this is done, such as in A Clockwork Orange, when you are just expected to pick up the local slang in which the novel is written. It allows the reader to be completely immersed into the world that the author has created, making it that much more vivid<br /><br />In this case of The Windup Girl, Bacigalupi is attempting to immerse the reader into the Thai culture, which in many ways, is more foreign than the frightening future England that Burgess painted in the aforementioned dystopian novel. Many of the pro-words are Thai or Cantonese, and the novel constantly refers back to the past of Thailand, expecting the reader to have a grasp of the history, their gods, their profits, and many, many other references that I had no clue about, making it very difficult to follow the story, since much of the tensions were based on the history of the country.<br /><br />Now, much of it was based on false history. That is, the history in-between our present day, and the unnamed time in which Bacigalupi's world takes place. But I gathered that much of it was even further back, into our shared (ours and the novel's) history, and with no knowledge of the region's history or culture, I just... didn't get it.<br /><br />This is the negative beginnings for me of the book, so now let me give it some praise. Despite the difficult (or at least often incomprehensible) read, I hung in there, and what I got was a good story, with very developed characters, who seemed believable in their motivations and their individual quests. Character development is one of Bacigalupi's strong suits, here. The Windup Girl herself, while seemingly not the main character, is none-the-less pivotal, and though she seems pathetic and one-dimensional at first, over the course of the story, more and more depth is added until at the end, you have a character worthy of rooting and hoping for.<br /><br />You want things to work out for many of the characters in the novel, and in the end, you mostly get just that. The ending, which I won't go into, all clicked together to make it a book worth spending your time on. Should a sequel be written, I hope that it goes further into the Japanese culture only glimpsed in the story.

031603438X|4.0|Didn't know I was ingesting the Stones all these years until I read this as a lark, was prepared to put it down and pass it off.  Couldn't.  Heard every tune in my head as he catalogs them and I never bought one of them.  Apparent now why Muddy Waters sounded so familiar when I got into him in the 90's. He gives big props to those who went before him and I sense a true love for \\"the sound\\" and not the individual so-called star.   I sense truth here, although there is a period during his worse smack addiction that seems a little light in history, but given his self admitted state, no wonder.    Can't believe I am recommending this, being right leaning and all.   More libertarian.  And the Richards better be a member of the NRA after all that talking smack about carrying...literally.      And while some might not like the ending; the recipes--not for the open G tuning but the banger/mash and Shepard's pie--how fun would it be to throw down with Bobby Flay on the pie recipe. Ha, Richards just might be normal.  To me that is an accomplishment.  The music is the triumph.
B003X2O6KW|1.0|ok 1st of all this album is weak wtf this album is so bad the beats r weak jus like the verses kanye west could of made a better album, frm 808 and heartbreak 2 this keeps getting worse frm what i hear.....the only good songs on this whole album is Monster & Power
B002S8AGZG|3.0|I have always loved this movie - it's a modern-day adaptation of one of my favorite Shakespeare plays and stars two of my favorite actors and several amazing supporting actors (Larry Miller and Allison Janney, to name a few).    HOWEVER, I have owned the DVD for years and have been anxiously awaiting its release on Blu-Ray.  Browsing the shelves of Best Buy the other day, I saw the 10th Anniversary DVD available for $9.99.  \\"Not a bad deal\\" I think - \\"Let's check it out on Blu-Ray.\\"  The Blu-Ray edition of this 10th Anniversary edition was $24.99.  Not that I really wanted to spend that much on an upgrade of a movie I already own, but I figured what the hell - there's a new documentary (35 min \\"10 Things I Love About 10 Things I Hate About You 10 Years Later\\"), Deleted Scenes (listed separately) and \\"NEVER BEFORE SEEN HEATH LEDGER SCREEN TEST FOOTAGE\\" (which got its own sticker on the front of the slip cover).    I got the disc home and popped it in.  Didn't have time to watch the film, but I figured I'd watch the special features (notice my \\"s\\" at the end of \\"features\\").  Upon watching the documentary, which is misleadingly labeled - the only recent interviews are with the director and the co-writers - all of the other interview footage was shot on set during filming - I was looking forward to watching the Deleted Scenes which we were given glimpses of within the documentary when the director alluded to them.  When I went looking for them, I realized that there were no \\"Deleted Scenes\\" on their own, or in their entirety.  The marketing team decided to list them as a separate Special Feature, even though they were only shown partially in the documentary - and the \\"NEVER BEFORE SEEN HEATH LEDGER SCREEN TEST FOOTAGE\\", which required its own sticker on the front of the slip cover?  About 20 seconds of the 35 minute documentary.    As I said earlier, I haven't yet watched the film on this disc, but I feel it's safe to say that they probably have not remastered it.  Overall, this Blu-Ray was a HUGE disappointment.  At $25, I feel ripped off.  At Amazon's price, if you're a big enough fan of the film, maybe it's worth it for the new documentary; and I commend Amazon for listing the Deleted Scenes within the documentary, even though the packing on the disc lists them separately.  Bravo, Amazon!
B001992NW4|5.0|Terrifying stuff. To me anyway, the first 20 minutes of this classic are some of the most chilling images and sound effects ever.Great screenplay, acting, visual and sound effects and music too! Well done!
1901464229|4.0|People who write about Bromptons seem to have one quality in common, unexpected for mechanically-oriented authors: they're decent writers.  Even the Brompton owner's manual is clear and succinct, and Henshawe's combination of a history of the company and supplemental hints about managing a Brompton makes for useful and even enjoyable reading.  Did you know, for example, that your partially-folded Brompton can be used as a seat while you're waiting for your train?  Or that the most common mistake made in removing a rear wheel is taking out the set-screw in the chain tensioner?  My only complaint is that neither book stands alone.  Both assume that their readers are cult members, and know a quite a lot about Bromptons already.  I bought Henshawe to get a more thorough treatment than the manual affords of procedures to repair and care for my new bike, but found that he doesn't bother to incorporate information from the manual.  So, I need to have both books open when I do any work.  Still, worth a Brompton owner's time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't wait more than 5 min to get the next book on my Kindle and this didn't let me down. I devoured the series. I can't tell enough people to read this series!
0307454541|3.0|This book had some surprising twists. But it was hard to get through the Swedish politics in the book. Now that I've read the first book I hope the rest of the trilogy gets more exciting.
B003QSHIPS|5.0|I'd heard of Gorillaz before but never heard them until this album. What brought them to my attention specifically was the presence of Mick Jones and Paul Simonon. This music almost seems like a \\"Sandinista\\" outtakes and remix album. All the other guests add very much to the mix: Mos Def, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, Bobby Womack and others.
078322740X|5.0|I don't always care for Steve Martin but I thought he was so funny in this movie.  I have always like Goldie Hawn.  Being older I enjoy this type of movie very much.  Younger people may find it too slow and quirky but I found it delightful.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|this is a good upgrade to my mini mag and it has a good spot light feel to it now the push button makes it a lot easier to use. so if you carry or use a mini mag alot like I do then this is a good little upgrade worth getting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book took on a different tone from the first two. It wasn't an easy wrap up into a shiny box. This book took everything from the sci-fi world and grounded it more into reality. What would you think would happen to a teenage girl in the middle of a war and love triangle? She didn't know what she was really fighting for and everyone around her was changing. Who could really handle all that stress? I'm very pleased with the way this series concluded. Some people are not happy with the way the book ended, but I think a happily ever after, no one goes hungry, no one is sad, Katniss rules the new world ending would have been a disappointment.
0307463745|2.0|I really wanted to like this book and get some great insight, but it just wasn't there. This was a tremendous disappointment for me, given the stellar reviews given by some big-name business writers. While some may have found parts inspiring, it just didn't translate into much useful, actionable wisdom. That's what I came to the book for, and what I left it without. Major bummer.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This series is one of the best ever to come out, I highly recommend the boxed set of the full series. It is a full size screen viewing, and it comes beautifully packaged in the box set. Have not had time to view all of them yet,as there are so many discs but look forward to seeing them all. They are very well packed, and worth every cent.
B000LC3IDI|3.0|this was a good movies and if you like saw 1 and 2 then you would like this one also, just more of the cuts and gore and the riddles. just a good addition to the francise and worh buying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. I was told it was a kids book, but it's more of a young adult book. It has some good violence, suspense and great characters. Not too sci-fi but Collins did create an interesting future scenario. I have already suggested this to all my friends, well all that read... :)
0446195529|3.0|I have read all the Camel Club books, and I enjoyed all of the others more than this one.  The club takes a back seat in this novel, and it is just Stone/Carr against the world as he plods through this overly complicated plot.    Missing is the personality development and the interactions between the various members of the club, which made Baldacci's other novels so entertaining.    If you are a fan of the Camel Club books, you will have to read this one, just so you will know where all of the characters are starting from in the next novel - but, rest assured, this will not turn out as one of your favorites.
B001VNB54A|5.0|From start to finish it was an amazing journey.  I first read the books before watching the series... i must say they were very accurate for the most part.  I am a huge fan of this series!  I loved band of brothers which focused more on the soldiers then the war.. this series focuses more on war... its essentially the main character. Id say if you are expecting another BoB, get that out of your mind!  This is a different perspective!  The marines in this story are an amazing bunch that accomplished the impossible!  Its important to remember these very special people and what they did to win the war!  Some might think its shining a negative light on the marines, i dont agree.  seriously, give the show a shot!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This movie is great!  I highly recommend it if you've never seen it.  It is a class \\"Hitchcock\\" that is one of my favs!  The book is a great collector's item, and the disc was in good condition.  A very nice picture compared to when I first saw this movie way back when on a VHS tape.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Sorry for that uber-lame title, but INCEPTION could be interchangeable with THE GRAND HEIST easily. I never expected the 10 hour mission to be longer than 30 minutes, let alone much of the movie. In fact, my brain will never be the same again. Just like the pretty Ellen Page said: \\"It's pure creation.\\"  In this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a thief. In fact, a dream thief. He knows the tricks to navigate one's mind. To perform a heist, he prepares an awesome team. He is the EXTRACTOR. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the POINT MAN. Ellen Page plays the ARCHITECT. Ken Watanabe is the TOURIST. Marion Cotillard is the SHADE. Cillian Murphy is the MARK. Tom Hardy does a James Bond when playing the FORGER, and Micheal Caine is there for a bit. :)  Now that you know the actors, how did they perform. My goodness, they are first-rate. Best ensemble of the year. Leo is simply awesome. The whole movie rests on his shoulders. Joseph is great; he plays a likable guy and is badass in one of the most amazing fights I've seen. Page and Cotillard look great and act really well. Caine is there for a bit and does a great job. Ken i s great, Murphy is solid and Berenger is good.  Like BLADE RUNNER, this movie shows us completely new ideas and never bores. The talky parts are vital to the story. In fact, just like BR, people will question where the story lies. There is a story in all that visual glamor, and a beautiful one. I knew what to expect of it and got a huge surprise. The story is powerful and touching.  Now to the technical parts. The visuals are beautiful and used well. Not over-the-top at all; realistic as hell. The action sequences are hard-boiled and fast paced. Unlike other movies, you can't count how many there are. It's just so many put together. Since I'm an action-movie fan, the fact that there were so many in one sequence made me cry with happiness. Well, it almost did.  There will also be people that will say it is original, but in years, we'll get better movies that usetheir ideas to full potential. I say:this movie is way ahead of our time, just like BLADE RUNNER was in 1982. To wrap it all up, INCEPTION is BRILLIANT. Christopher Nolan never disappoints. Through his career he has given us a masterpiece after masterpiece. His fans know his true masterpiece will be the one with the intelligent script of MEMENTO and the scale of DARK KNIGHT. INCEPTION is exactly this, but God knows how many times better.  WATCH IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MOVIES LIKE THIS ARE RARE!!!  Rating:10/10(WOW)
B00003CXB4|5.0|This movie is in the \\"valt\\" at Disney and they aren't currently selling it. I was so pumped to find it. My twenty year old LOVES this movie and it will be great to see him open it on Christmas.

B003JTHESA|5.0|I hope I help those with mixed opinions.<br /><br />UN-Like past Maiden albums that kick you right in the teeth on first listen...DON'T be in a hurry! - because this cd needs to be appreciated !  Be patient, listen to it more than once! If you are not impressed at first listen, listen again in a week or two.  It took me months until right now to write this review! - my first impression was confusion, but I knew there was more. It is NOW appreciated.<br /><br />Like a great movie, it may not grab your attention in the first minute or two!  If you are in a hurry, don't listen to this cd and don't bother buying it!  BUT, if you can appreciate a message sent in a slow 2 minute intro that leads into 6-8 minutes of great modern Maiden music, this album could be the best ever!  The lyrics and music are still phenomenal, the beats are precise, and the mature professionalism to that of Rush.<br /><br />Eventually you will see, this may be one of your the best Iron Maiden album ever.  -  I vote it #4 in my top 5 Maiden albums.

B0044KU7KU|5.0|After four [long] years, the boys are BACK. And this time, they've really outdone themselves. I know people have complained about how this CD isn't original \\"My Chemical Romance,\\" but honestly, how many bands do you know of that thrived on making nothing but the same thing over and over? \\"Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys\\" exceeds every expectation I had before I heard it. The dramatic turn this band made with this album really kicks their career up a notch! While I LOVED the raw feel of \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\", the thick, palpable dark rock of \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\", and the rock opera-esque, glam rock feel of \\"The Black Parade\\", \\"Danger Days\\" allows My Chemical Romance's ability to mix things up to REALLY shine. This album will keep you moving!    Overall, I feel this album is My Chemical Romance's most artistic. I remember reading somewhere that \\"Danger Days\\" has been considered a love song to rock 'n roll...and it's so true. Homage is paid in almost every single way possible.    From Dr. Death-Defying's narration, the midway point rock party of \\"Party Poison,\\" all the way to the haunting static following The Star-Spangled Banner, \\"Danger Days\\" is truly a masterpiece. Don't miss out on the ride, Killjoys.    And remember: \\"Keep your boots tight, keep your gun close, and die with your mask on if you've got to.\\"

B000002USN|2.0|This is a collection of sentimental novelties, best used as background music at cocktail parties. I hate giving any Sinatra album only two stars and tried to find an honest way to bump it up to three stars. I couldn't. Still, I admire Sinatra, approaching the age of 80 at the time, for having the courage to enter the studio yet another time. I am also happy for him that this disc sold over 2 million copies. His distiguished career gave him the right to whatever sales he got. A decade before this album he recorded SHE SHOT ME DOWN, which was a commercial flop despite being his best studio album after he left Capitol Records in the early 1960s. The money he got for DUETS is payment that I believe he should have gotten for SHE SHOT ME DOWN.<br /><br />The chief value of these songs is the novelty of the guest singers. Clearly this collection was never intended as anything more than clean sentimental fun. The fundamental flaw is that these are pure Sinatra songs in which guest singers provide contributions which rarely mesh with Sinatra's style -- two exceptions are Tony Bennett and Kenny G. This problem is made worse by the fact that the songs are generally sung as kitsch. Sinatra and his guests frequently ad lib comic asides during the songs. For example, at the end of \\"Witchcraft\\" Sinatra teases Anita Baker by calling her \\"you little witch\\" and she replies \\"who me?\\" This is fun stuff but not memorable. The singing often seems just an excuse for such comedy. I would have given three stars if this basic approach had been consistently successful. Three poor songs made that impossible.<br /><br />Barbra Streisand's singing in \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" totally overpowers Sinatra's aging voice. She belts out the song as though she was singing solo. Perhaps this was simply an attempt to steal the show and be the center of attention, but comes off as being disrespectful of Sinatra's aging voice.<br /><br />Carly Simon sings beautifully in the medley of \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" with \\"In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\\" but the recording fails because this is not really a medley. It's an intertwining of two songs where Sinatra and Simon are often singing the two different songs at the same time. I listened three times and, to mix metaphors, my ears got cross eyed; I almost got dizzy (in a bad way). A person cannot listen to two songs at the same time any more than you can read two books at the same time. If you ignore the words and listen to the music, you will discover that even the orchestra did not know what melody to play; just a bit of tinkering on the piano and light strings. This is an experiment that did not work. It is neither Sinatra's nor Carly's fault. The producer should have known better.<br /><br />Everybody should have known better than to have allowed the inclusion of Bono's contribution to \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\" I can say with confidence that there is no worse recording anywhere in Sinatra's catalog. This is garbage. Bono interprets this song as a dark sexual obsession rather than the swinging love song that it has always been. He sounds like phone sex; even going so far as to include heavy breathing during the finale. Inexcusable.<br /><br />Two good songs standout. Tony Bennett makes a marvelous contribution to \\"New York, New York.\\" He respects it as Sinatra's hit song and sings it that way; sounding like he and Sinatra have spent years together in the Big Apple but that it is Sinatra's town. I wish other singers on this disc had listened to this song before recording their own. It might have changed the whole project. Even better, I wish that Bennett and Sinatra had made an entire album together.<br /><br />Kenny G. surprises me by being almost shy in his performance on the final song of the album. After playing a short instrumental of \\"All The Way\\" he allows the music to segue into \\"One For My Baby\\" and then he becomes almost invisible (musically speaking). Sinatra takes over and sings perhapshis finest version of this song on record. His aging voice makes the song sadder and more real. His impeccable phrasing is present thoughout while Kenny G. only occasionally provides quiet background music to the more dominant piano. A marvelous bittersweet conclusion to an uneven album.His aging voice makes the song sadder and more real.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Seriously one of the best debut albums I have heard in a while. Bruno Mars isn't about one hit wonders. His whole album was pretty solid. I bought this on impulse hoping the rest of the album would be decent but I was seriously blown away. I've had this cd on repeat for weeks now. His voice is incredibly melodic and his lyrics are not bad either.     Of course you have your hits that the public has already loved:    Just the way you are    and now they've begun playing     Grenade    great collaboration:     The Other Side ft. Cee Lo Green    good lyrics:     Count on me    and those are probably my favorites on the whole album. If you're not sure if you should buy it, seriously just take the splurge because if you just buy one of the mp3s you'll probably just end up buying the whole thing in the future. :P Might as well save some money now by buying the whole cd. It was a great purchase. :)
0060523808|5.0|Who was the best manager of the latter part of the 20th century?  Jack Welch lost about $200 billion for his shareholders from 1995 until he retired, while Louis Gerstner turned around and undoubtedly saved IBM.  Today IBM's market cap exceeds GE's and the company did not need a federal government bailout to survive the financial meltdown of 2007/2008, the way GE did.  Of these two Gerstner seems to me to be a true managerial success, as opposed to a media fed phenomenon.      IBM shareholder have been rewarded while GE shareholders have seen a steady decline in the value of their shares.  In this book Gerstner lays out his thinking and strategy and the actions he took upon being named CEO at IBM in the early 1990s.  Even though he had little expertise in computer technology, he had the customer perspective as well as decades of managerial experience and training.  The result is a book that is clear and understandable without the bravado and acronyms.  This is a refreshing description of a major turnaround by the man who led it.      For experienced managers this is a great read.
1400052173|5.0|Really an amazing story and so well written.  I'm not usually a fan of non-fiction, but the pacing and poignant portrayal of Henrietta Lacks' life and family, held up against other examples of other science innovations & similarly shocking experiments and lack of communication to those affected, had me glued to the pages.  Highly recommend this book because it is a good read, but is a story that we ALL need to read!  Giving it to many friends for X-mas.

0618680004|5.0|As an atheist, I was already familiar with much of the material covered. However, Dawkins is very entertaining about presenting his ideas all the way through. Loved Richard's description of the old testament god :) Hilariously offensive, but absolutely true. Useful book to sharpen your teeth on regarding the subject.    If you are a strong believer, I'd challenge you to actually read the WHOLE Bible (or the Koran, or etc) cover to cover instead. I think that will be enough to shatter the faith of any reasonable human being. After you do that - read this book. After all, you should really KNOW what it is you actually believe before shaking it off.
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Have been following Temple Grandin's story since I first heard her interviewed on NPR over 10 years ago.  I thought this docu-drama really helped explain what Temple has been trying to explain for years - how she perceives people, emotions, animals and life around her.  Claire Danes did an AMAZING job and I also really enjoyed watching the portrayal of Temple's mother and aunt in this film and as well as her good friend and advocate - her high school science teacher. I've admired Temple and her work with slaughter houses and this film just reminded me again of what an amazing person she is.  \\"Different, but not less.\\"
B0041EVYVK|5.0|I am not too familiar with Daniel Lanois other than his producing work with U2.  Plus I saw him at the Park West in Chicago open for Tortoise in 06'.  I believe he played his guitar with no backing band behind him.<br /><br />Then recently, I saw he came up with this Black Dub project.  A friend commented after I purchased the album (thanks Sonic Boom records, Seattle!) that the music sounds neither \\"black\\" or \\"dub\\".  A very accurate statement after a first listen.  Also on that first listen, we noticed the purely uplifting message in the songs.  A spiritual, loving nature to most compositions is present here.  A tight band with male and female vocal contributions carry the songs through the album.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Canaan\\", \\"I Believe in You\\" and \\"Love Lives\\" are highlights because of strong, personnel lyrics.  Not to point just those songs out because the whole album plays cohesively.  In short, one can purchase this album and know that their money is well spent.<br /><br />When I picked this one up, I had no idea what I was getting in to.  But the mere fact that I picked it up and didn't put it down is very ironic.  I believe I was supposed to turn on to this and in doing so, found one of my Best Ofs for 2010.  Truly a magical album and experience.  Cheers to Daniel and hope he takes the band out to cities in America.  Excellent!!
0765326353|5.0|I found it took me about half way through the book before I really had a grasp on the story, characters and style of this book, once I did I was hooked. I enjoyed it alot and started to stay up late, forgoing gaming night even to finish the book. My only disappointment right now is that the second book is not yet ready... I suppose I will have to re-read Kings before it is just to refresh my memory.
0316098337|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a fascinating psychological study of a mother and son imprisoned in a garden shed for 7 years.

B002ZG994U|2.0|THE A-TEAM is one of those movies that is meant to be popcorn entertainment: nothing fancy, nothing of high quality, just a good way to kill a couple hours.  It features a few hard-hitters (Liam Neeson, Patrick Wilson, Scott Cooper, Sharlto Copley), all of whom are slumming it (and apparently having fun).  It features a lucrative, by-the-numbers plot; a very pro-violence message (a pacifist snaps a man's neck, and we're supposed to cheer); a lot of explosions and bullets and one-liners.  It's an action movie.<br /><br />Then why the two stars?  Because this film features one of the single worst directing jobs I've ever seen.  This is surprising, as the film comes from Joe Carnahan, who gave us the action gem SMOKIN' ACES.  But Carnahan doesn't seem to know what he's doing here.  There are random cut-scenes and close-ups; the film almost feels like a music video in spots, the directing is so awkward and uneven.  The script is terrible, even by action movie standards; the first twenty minutes of the movie are back story (how the team got together); and the next twenty are spent setting up the overall plot of the film.  That's 40 minutes where nothing much happens.  Even by so-bad-it's-good standards, THE A-TEAM lacks almost anything worthwhile.<br /><br />Then why two stars at all?  Because of the performances.  Some are terrible--\\"Rampage\\" Jackson should quit--but some are surprisingly good.  Patrick Wilson makes perhaps the best smarmy CIA operative I've seen; his performance belongs in a much better movie.  Liam Neeson is the epitome of cool here; his opening scene is fantastic, the drool-on-your-chin kind of awesomeness we rarely get anymore.  Bradley Cooper and Sharlto Copley are hilarious and charming (well, Cooper; Copley is a bit dangerous, in a good way).  These actors all have good chemistry together (again, Jackson is the exception), and deserve a better script and better directing.  THE A-TEAM almost isn't worth your while.  Yet, you're probably going to see it, because if you're honestly curious about it, then you're already preparing yourself.  Just don't set the bar too high.  If nothing else, revel in Wilson's performance, and remember Neeson's opening seen.  Come to think of it, those two things are worth at least the price of a rental.  Which is a shame, because the rest of the film borders on a waste of time.f you're honestly curious about it, then you're already preparing yourself.  Just don't set the bar too high.

1439152780|5.0|A chilled room, a laprobe, a cup of strong, sweet tea and \\"The Distant Hours\\" equals heaven! Elements of the Gothic novel,woven with the imaginative verbs of a talented writer, make for a page turner of intense delight which stirs the imagination into a frenzy, plays sweet to scary tunes on your heartstrings, and keeps your mind working to solve the mystery. You will FEEL this novel. What isn't to love?
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys sounds like the musical component to owning a bookcase fulled with SE Hinton novels, a Nurf water gun, and a large collection of spangled, glow in the dark Silly Bandz. Appropriately angest,adrenaline driven-futuristic rock and roll at its messiest. Swooney, moody, and filled with thrills, pills, and everything else a lackluster broken heart needs to get their days racing past emotional letdown. If music    industry wasen't One Less Lonely Girl past postmortem I would say this is the album keeping all hope alive.
B0036EH3U2|3.0|This gritty re-imagining of a 1970s space opera of the same name is one of the finest TV series of the decade and will likely continue to resonate. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray transfer in this boxed set doesn't do the show justice. Ninety percent of the footage is clear and crisp, but 10% spread throughout each episode contains flashing, sudden drop-outs of color, and equally sudden changes in contrast. The show is still wonderful and I will defend it with the tenacity of a hardened grunt from the flight deck. But as for the transfer... I had hoped that -- at least -- it would match the image-quality of the HD broadcasts on SciFi Channel. And it doesn't.
0525951652|5.0|Much like Follett did in Pillars of the Earth, story lines in Fall of Giants are well written and woven together to create a beautiful story stretching 6+ years. Unlike the characters in PotE, very few of these characters are black and white. They each have personality flaws that make them relateable.     I can't wait for the second and third books to be released!

0439023491|5.0|** SPOILERS for `The Hunger Games' **<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark won the Hunger Games. . . at the expense of the Capitol. Katniss made the grave error of making the Gamemakers and the Capitol look bad - with a handful of berries she effectively ignited a district-uprising. And now the Capitol wants revenge.<br /><br />Outright killing Katniss could potentially add fuel to the rebellion's flames. So the Capitol go one step better. . . under the banner of the Hunger Games `Quarter Quell' they announce that the 75th Hunger Games will include only previous reaping winners. That means Katniss and Peeta are back in the arena. . . and this time, they won't win.<br /><br />A good portion of `Catching Fire' is devoted to creating big overarching bad guys for the whole series. In `The Hunger Games' Katniss's focus was on the immediate threat of her fellow tributes, as opposed to the larger threat of the Capitol. In that first book the real bad guys weren't really seen, only heard. Because Katniss was in the reaping arena, the most interaction she and Peeta had with the Capitol villains was via the booming voice of Claudius Templesmith or Caesar Flickerman, the games interviewer.<br /><br />In `Catching Fire' Collins gives face and substance to the true villains of `Hunger Games' - and the head-honcho baddie is President Snow, who ultimately orchestrates the reaping and ensures that the district never forget the meaning behind the massacres. President Snow is a wonderfully sinister bad-guy. His physical description is spot-on perfection - everything from the smell of roses and blood to his cosmetically-enhanced, puffy lips. He's a bad-guy for the books, and utterly despicable.<br /><br />I went into `Catching Fire' unsure of what to expect. Collins left `The Hunger Games' off on such an emotional cliff-hanger between Katniss and Peeta and their orchestrated, honest romance. . . but as for the plot substance of `Catching Fire', I really didn't know where Collins would go next. Well, my jaw well and truly dropped in this second book. From the `Quarter Quell' to President Snow's threats - I spent a good portion of `Catching Fire' simply muttering \\"omigod, omigod, omigod, omigod!\\"<br /><br />I loved reading about the fallout from Katniss and Peeta's win - the small hints of their survivors-guilt and fractured lives in the aftermath of the reaping. I also loved reading about Katniss's renewed vigour - like a phoenix rising from the flames (for a second time).<br /><br />I also loved the romantic focus in `Catching Fire'. Katniss is caught between Peeta (the boy with the bread) and her best friend, Gale. Katniss and Gale have been hunting partners for years - and that's all Katniss thought they were. But her pretend relationship with Peeta in the arena had Katniss questioning her feelings for both boys. . . and upon returning home, Katniss discovers that Gale was deeply wounded having to watch her and Peeta's `romance' play out on the small screen.<br /><br />I love how deliciously complicated Collins's romance is. It's as edge-of-your-seat as what happens in the Games arena - and like the nuts-and-bolts plot I never knew what to expect with the love triangle. I don't even know who I'm hoping Katniss ends up with. . . Gale or Peeta. Baker or Hunter? I just don't know! But for what it's worth, I loved how much more complicated Katniss and Peeta's relationship got when they went into the arena for a second time.<br /><br />`The Hunger Games' is an epic young adult trilogy. It's such an amalgamation of brilliance - at once a complicated exploration of modern media, darn good thrill-ride complete with an intense love triangle. I am well and truly addicted.<br /><br />I have to admit, any regret I was feeling over not starting this series back in 2008 was quickly quenched when I read the final page of `Catching Fire'. . . even knowing that `Mockingjay' was waiting for me on my bookshelf, I could not crack that final book open quick enough to quell the suspense that Collins leaves us with at the end of `Catching Fire'.ck enough to quell the suspense that Collins leaves us with at the end of `Catching Fire'.
B000007638|5.0|I remember buying this double album vinyl set 34 years ago and practically playing the grooves off it.  Later I bought it on cassette tapes and after many years they just fell apart-the tapes practically snapped in half after constantly playing them.  I am disappointed that this was never re-released on CD and that if you find it, it is way overpriced.  If you can afford it-fine, then buy it.  One of the best Live albums of all time.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Another fantastic album from MCR, riddled with futuristic sounds and trippy instrumentals, as well as more solid rock creations.     Stand-out songs for me include:     - S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W (favourite song in the album and once you listen to it it'll be yours too)     - Destroya (amazing tribal drum beats start off this blow-your-mind track)    - SING (catchy chorus lead by Way's powerful vocals)    - Planetary GO! (if you don't want to get up and dance there's something wrong wit cha)    - The Kids from Yesterday (could be dismissed after hearing the explosive Destroya but this is one song that I think will become a favourite, both for it's chorus that contains some of the coolest lyrics I've heard, as well as the soaring guitar throughout the song that leads into an awesome guitar solo.      Over all a lighter tone album than the previous, with pretty much every song having the quality of sounding better and better each time you hear them (almost too much awesomeness...almost)

I have now read it so many times, I can probably tell the story page-by-page without glancing at the words once!<br /><br />\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" is the story of a boy who does something naughty, gets sent to his room and then begins imagining (or dreaming) a world where \\"Wild Things,\\" or large roaring monsters with yellow eyes and sharp claws, roam.  This is where it gets fun to read with lots of emotion - rolling your eyes and showing your claws and roaring like a Wild Thing.  Max becomes KING of the wild things, but in the end he wants to go home, and when he does, the reader finds out that his mother (or father, who never appears in the story) still loves him despite his \\"wild\\" behavior.<br /><br />This story is filled with emotion and is a lot of fun to read.  It holds the attention of my 18-month-old AND my 6-year-old. There is a section of pages where there are no words and the reader can fill in the story with their imagination.  My 3-year-old loved the story so much we planned a \\"Wild Things\\" birthday party for him where he got to be Max for the day!  As a parent, there's nothing better than a book you love to read that the kids love to hear, especially since you'll probably be reading it over and over and over...
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Looks great on blu-ray. Makes me even more  Scared of Catholics than I  Was before and that's significant
B002ZG993Q|4.0|I felt it was necessary to balance the scales a little after reading the many shallow reviews written by others who were duped by the action-movie marketing. No it's not an action movie, but if you grow up a little & see it as a realistic telling of a man's misspent life then you can come to appreciate how well crafted a film it is. It's not a film for testosterone junkies but if you're an intellectual with a colorful past who can appreciate how a man can \\"grow up\\" after age 40 & learn to love life- then you might get it. As other smart reviewers have noted- it's not for the teeming mass of recent boot-camp graduates(I'm paraphrasing), but those of us who've left that far behind us will look upon it with knowing eyes. Enjoy it for the good acting & the beautiful locations & the polished idea it presents. You can't escape your past & that's what should be understood from this movie.
0374530718|4.0|It's a good read for philosophy.  Asks some pretty good questions that will certainly make you think about where you stand on certain issues.
B004CAWKXE|5.0|It's a shame you can only give this album 5 stars.  This is by far their greatest album, and they really put a lot into making this.  I don't know how it's only 4 dollars for the entire album.  This has a little bit of everything, and even the parents can enjoy this album because it is just pure fun.  Listen for yourself.  Just 4 dollars.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album restored my faith in music.  Original and classic at the same time.  Not a bad track to be found.  They set the bar pretty high for a first release, but I can't tell you how great this album is.
B002NPY7E0|5.0|If you are a Mickey Rourke or a Deniro fan or both this little tale will not disappoint. The blu-ray version was ok but not great. Some of the scenes seemed to look a little crisper than others. All in all it's a great story, I highly recommend it.
0316776963|4.0|This is my third book I have read by Sedaris, and they only get better. He is continuously funny, time after time, I find myself laughing through his books. I just purchased his new book and cannot wait to begin reading it. This book is a must. It does have some crude humor as do most of his books, so keep it away from kids under 16.
B0044KU7KU|1.0|I think this is the first review from someone who likes real rock music. Not the mainstream pop rock put out by the pop music industry. This album feels like a mix of Katy Perry meets Blink 182. I am no purist in music. I enjoy Avenge Sevenfold's newer albums better than older ones, I like Atreyu newer albums as much as the older ones. I feel they changed and not sold out but refined their sounds.   This Album feels like a complete take over from the pop music industry to cash in for some teenage jock culture. The exact opposite that My Chemical Romance was sent to do. I wasn't too emo in high school or anything but appreciated the genre. This is the exact opposite of the genre. Kind of like when Metallica turn from heavy metal to a midlife crisis alternative band but worse. I feel I sinned against rock music by contributing to the purchase of this album. I hope others will follow suite and give this album the rating it deserves. This album may gain much success cause it is catering to the high school pop girl culture which is big money but I hope it does not get one cent from those who really enjoyed the roots of the band and love heavy rock music. If we cannot do it by ourselves I hope previous fans at least boycott the shows.
B003YWUTJI|3.0|It was amazing to me to see just how many people Norah Jones has sang with, and of all genres too. Most of the songs are too slow for listening too while driving in the car, but perfect for a quiet evening at home with my husband.I really liked listening to Dear John and Virginia Moon. I would consider this an album for a romantic evening and look forward to sharing it with my husband.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Well, what can I say about a show that is so family-friendly (estrogen-oriented, especially; ) Gilmore Girls is witty, fun, and exceptionally clean and `pure.' Although the 2 main characters are a clear representation of young/un-wed pregnancy, the show does not `glorify' that point, but re-instates a positive mentality regarding teen pregnancy. It is an fantastic show and I adore the fast-paced dialogue between characters as well!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I was looking for a smaller flash unit to go with my wife's camera.  The SB-400 fits the bill, and it works seamlessly with her D3000.  She only needs to slide it on the hot shoe, and turn it on - all the other controls are managed in the camera.  A very powerful unit for its small size, and perfect for our needs.
0316098337|5.0|Room will engage you. Room will horrify you. Room will help you believe in the beauty of humanity. I very rarely give 5 stars to anything. I reserve the 5th star for works that are better than the best. Room deserves the 5th star. Donoghue nails the voice of a little boy. I believe this boy. This is excellent craft here. Donoghue manages to show us Ma through the boy and Grandma and Steppa and Paul and all the other characters. I was able to understand these characters as an adult even through the eyes of a little boy. I can't even imagine how she did it, and yet, I feel it. I'm having problems letting go of this book. The characters are following me around.
0307456625|5.0|I have read the entire series up to the latest which I have just begun. I love them all. I can't get enough of these stories. After completing each novel of the series I crave more. I don't want the books to end. When a new book is released, I must pre-order the hardcover... no waiting for me. I adore Precious and her dignified, decent approach to life in a Botswana, a seemingly barren land, that is rich with life. These are feel good novels which do not contain foul language, overt sex or grisly death scenes. Instead, you will find tales that are grand in their simplicity told in a beautiful and lyrical prose. I hope you have the chance to read and enjoy them. Also, as much as I love the physical printed book, you may want to sample the audio. You will want to try to get the versions read by Lisette Lecat. Her readings are incredible, and since she is from South Africa, her pronunciation is authentic. After listening to them, I now know how to pronounce the African proper names and terms.  I know this is not profound or great literature.  Anyone who knows me or views my bookshelf can see the great \\"literary\\" novels I have read, as well as the junk.  This is not \\"great\\" literature, but it is not junk either.  I have eclectic tastes, and I try and balance my book selections.  I will read a heavy Pulitzer Prize winning novel followed by a light and breezy work.  With this series, I always feel a sense of contentment.  As much as I love the heavy hitters, it is always a pleasure to sit down and savor a book like this.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|First I have to say my two year old daughter loves this movie and it is equally enjoyable to adults. The music is catchy, the sceneries beautiful and the characters lovable and funny. I have a hard time with the reviewers who rated this movie racist or bad because of the voodoo aspect. Although I also found the voodoo parts a tad spooky for a Disney film but daughter wasn't in the least frightened by it. To say this movie is racist or not PC is just silly. This movie is based off a specific time period in which blacks and whites were segregrated. I'm not saying I agree with what was going on in that time period but it is the reality of our history. Coming from the south and having been to New Orleans they do have accents and specific foods and music to the region. I think its almost comical to the people who refuse to watch this movie do to the voodoo aspect and yet Snow White was poisoned by the Queen who was a witch,Mufasas brother threw him off a cliff,Cruella wanted to skin a bunch of puppies and wear them for a coat,Disnay has always had some scary elements in their movies. This is a wonderful time period movie, it is true to New Orleans and really is not that scary for kids.
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|A simply awesome Leonard Bernstein collection!     This is an exclusively pure symphony music edition and I bought it recently from amazon.de who is the pioneer among all the amazons to release it. My audition is almost completed and the experience has been very pleasant so far; and as you know, it'll take some time to go through all 60 discs in this magic box.     Along with the CDs, there is also a beautiful photo album, which presents not only many working pictures but also some pleasant life moments of this master.     You can find satisfactorily complete symphony cycles from such giants as Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Schumann, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky and Bernstein himself, together with symphonies from other great composers.     The taping spans late fifties through early seventies in last century, an era of analogue recording prosperity. Undoubtedly, Bernstein was at the peak of his career and Sony/CBS also in its golden days when these recording sessions were taken. The performances, mostly played by New York Philharmonic, are excellent; the sounds are equally marvelous: warm, spacious, atmospheric and dynamic, well done in both original recordings and CD transfers.     Only the two cycles of complete symphonies by Beethoven and Mahler are absolutely worth the price, to say nothing of those awesome renditions on Berlioz, Copland, Dvorak, Haydn, Ives, Mozart, Prokofiev, Schubert, Shostakovich, Stravinsky and many more. I would like to single out the 1963 rendition of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique. Bernstein presents this widely known masterpiece in a so unique but charming way that you have an illusion of hearing it for the first time ever. This is a simply persuasive performance.     It's really a steal at this price level on amazons.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|All other vampire or werewolf movies before or since this release, wish they were worthy of being in this series.  In business speak, there are benchmark ideals, the elite best of the best, that set the standard for everything else in this category to measure up to, or be measured by.  \\"Underworld\\" sets the bar for all vampire and werewolf movies.  Kate Beckinsale demonstrates how female leads are supposed to take charge in this 2003 release \\"Underworld,\\" and just FYI, she continues this great performance throughout the Underworld sequels, Underworld; Evolution (2006), and Underworld; Rise of the Lycans (2009).  All three are the very best there is in this genre.  I can't believe you haven't ordered your own DVD yet.  Buy all three in this series.  Right now.  You'll thank me.  You'd have to not know anything about vampires or werewolves not to love this film, or be under 20 years old so you want somebody more your age in headliner roles so you watch the TV-series softer, milder, less scary stuff.  Pooh on that.  Get the real stuff.  This series has all the terror, all the gore, all the legend, and all the antiquity, with Kate Beckinsale.  I almost bought two copies in case one gets damaged; I'd hate to go too long between opportunities to watch one of the Underworld series films.  Oh yes, definitely 5-stars.
B003X2O6KW|1.0|Not feeling the album at all. Kanye's trying to hard and the skills showcased seem minimal at best. Next time let Rza produce the whole joint. And please stop singing - you're voice is sh:tty. Stick to rapping in a delivery like your first two albums
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Just when i thought that auto-tuned voices and bad rap would make the new music scene, i was saved from 21st century musical rut, that lifeline is called Danger Days. My Chemical Romance have shown that not only do they have what it takes to keep going but that they are going to pioneer a new time of catchy pop punk to drive them therer in their trans am. It started with some confusion over which song was their official pre-album release, but never-the-less, there hasnt been an eplosion of the same sort in a long time in the music scene.  From the pedal-to-the-metal catchiness of Na Na Na to the epic emothions of Sing, this album has everything, and they have proven that you do not need to have a story line, or any life-changing music genres to create a fantastic album.  They have drawn their inspiration from the east coast yet given a feel of LA in the 70's, appealing to all, and have done it all by stripping bare and just making great songs. Even critics who have previously hated MCR agree that this album is fantastic, and you can tell that after 4 years of no music that an explosion of this size will only continue to grow even more...Look alive sunshin, as its coming your way and you wont be able to let it go once it does
B000UZNRS2|5.0|This was my first time to read a book by Baldacci, and i was certainly impressed. His writing style is very unique to his genre. You can count on me reading many more books like STONE COLD!!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|This film shows a whole other side to her acting!!<br /><br />The story is wonderful, the supporting cast is great and it's just so nice to see Sandra shine is family film that shows off her talent!<br /><br />The DVD itself is fine. No amazing extras, but that doesn't matter. The real star of the DVD is the film itself!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Unlike most people, I don't have lovely memories from my childhood related to The Sound of Music. My childhood was not filled with live-action musicals (only Disney animated ones) and I just recently discovered true gems like Mary Poppins, Singin' in the Rain, My Fair Lady, The Wizard of Oz and of course this film. I saw The Sound of Music a couple of years ago and while I love the music it did not resonate as much as for example Poppins did. A friend lent his copy and after the first time, I like it but I was not overly impressed with it. Repeat viewing increased my love for the film and while its not perfect (which film is?)is so a joy to watch that now is one of my all-time favorite musicals. R&H songs are one of the many highlights and after watching the film you can't help but sing the catchy wonderful songs from it. My personal favorites are \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"Maria\\", \\"My Favorite Things\\", \\"Do-Re-Mi\\" and \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\". I just love the songs and the scenes in which they are played. Another highlight is the beautiful scenary of the entire film. From the beginning, your spirit is uplifted with wonderful shots of European mountains, the gorgeous city of Salzburg and more. It's pure joy!! Julie Andrews of course is the power that helps the film being as wonderful as it is. Just like in Mary Poppins, Andrews is perfect for the role and does it in a way that does not feel a stereotype. Maria is a full-fledged chararacter that we all can identify with.<br /><br />Add this an array of outstading supporting characters and you have a great film. Many have blamed the film of being too sugary but I think it perfectly balances all the elements and I think we have to thank that to the actors and director Robert Wise.<br /><br />As I said before, I had a borrowed copy of the film and just when I was about to buy the 40th anniversary edition DVD, I found out that Fox is releasing a new 45th edition and in Blu-Ray!! Of course that was the way to go.<br /><br />The Sound of Music comes to hi-def looking absolutely amazing. Fox must be and should be proud of the restoration efforts. The picture looks incredibly detailed and the colors are so vibrant that you can feel the rich European scenaries. All classic films should be restored this way because it looks absolutely fantastic. Likewise, the sound has a lavish new 7.1 DTS-HD sound that's completely gorgeous. You'll just experience the film like never before. Dialogue is cristal clear, the score is great and of course the songs are amazing. Impressive sound with impressive picture, What else can you ask?<br /><br />Well, if want more, Fox has designed a new \\"interactive\\" experience called \\"Your favorite things\\" where you can see the movie with PiP content, a karaoke track and a trivia quiz. Also you have the audio-commentaries form previous editions.<br /><br />In disc two, the bonus features are divided in \\"Musical Stages\\", \\"A City of Song\\", \\"Vintage Programs\\", \\"Rare Treasures\\" and \\"Publicity\\". The first two are completely new in HD and deal with the creation of the songs,R&H partnership, the restoraton of the film, the real Von Trapp family, the Broadway Musical, The producton of the film and the locations that were used in it. The others are carried overs form previous editions but that is great becuase we have a lot of documentaries, trailers, reminiscences and much, much more. I tell you, you will need a lot of time to dive into all this material but everything is fun, informative and make you appreciate the importance of the film.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this can be easily called THE definitive edition of The Sound of Music.<br /><br />The Sound of Music is one of the best musicals in the world, and one of the most (if not the most) beloved one. It's certainly one of my favorite things. With impressive picture and sound, and a wealth of excellent bonus material, Fox has created a edition that does the film justice. If you like TSOM, there is no reason why you should not get this edition. Absolutely recommended!!
B000059XUO|5.0|DVD was brand new, sealed in pastic, played great!!! Glad I was still able to purchase at a low price :)
B0013FYTA8|4.0|This is a pretty good cd. It reminds me of Nickelback a bit, but more edgier and with more language. Heaven(Little by Little), track 7, is a very beautiful song.
B002VECMAE|2.0|This is a really weird film about the investigation by a mediocre reporter, of a group in the army that is trying to develop psychic powers that will enhance the security of the US.  They concentrate to walk though walls, to kill (yes) goats by their vibes, to hear voices that will tell them where terrorism hostages are held.  They are shut down, then gain new life in, you guessed it, the post-9/11 security culture.  The thing about this is, in my view, it is not funny but so pathetically strange that the film is not fun to watch.<br /><br />The one strength of the movie is that the cast is outstanding, including McGregor, who is investigating a group that call themselves the Jedi!<br /><br />Not recommended.  It simply doesn't quite work.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|A few weeks ago, my 3yo grandson asked me to buy him Wally (I thought).  He's never asked me to buy him something, so I pressed for more information.  I assumed it was one of his Thomas engines, but he told me Wall-E is a robot.  His mom and I were surprised he even knew about the movie, but being the over-indulgent grandmother I am, I ordered it as soon as I got home and had it sent one day!  The next day my daughter supplied the back story.  She was out at a meeting the night before I was there.  It seems he and his dad went and rented Wall-E.  They watched it that night and he really watched it - something unusual for an active 3yo.  The next day, on the way to school, his dad stopped to return the movie.  The little guy had a royal melt down.  \\"No! You can't take away MY Wall-E!\\"  His dad tried to appease him by saying they might buy a copy since he liked it so much.  He responded, \\"Grandma will buy it for me.\\"<br /><br />I tell this story so if anyone wonders if it is a good movie for young children, the answer is a resounding, \\"Yes!\\"  I was staying with him today and had my first opportunity to watch the movie.  He's seen it many times by now.  He still sat there wrapped up in the story.  He'd ask a question every now and then, but I had to remind him he's seen it, I haven't!  It is a very well done story.  There is little dialog with a lot of the story carried in the soundtrack.  I enjoyed the use of one of my favorite movie musicals - Hello Dolly.  There are some anxiety producing sections (I'm sensitive to that thanks to Lassie, Bambi, and The Wizard of Oz), but they aren't so bad they might cause nightmares.  No one's mother died (remember Dumbo?).  I'd kind of like a sequel!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I read the book a few years back and loved it.  Watched this series afterwards and it made me love the book even more!  I read it again and it was even more enjoyable as I now had a visual of the romance and passion between Jane & Rochester.  I have watched this at least a dozen times and it never tires.  I have watched other versions, and for me, I am not nearly as emotionally invested as I am in this one.  I actually watched the one with William Hurt a few months ago and could not finish it...it was horrible.  Yes it does take liberties (bedroom scene) and it strays a bit, but as a whole, it is right on!  I can't wait for the 2011 film to come out...I hope it doesn't disappoint!
B0042RUMEQ|2.0|...as the most misguided and most frequently just-plain-bad female rap album that I have ever heard.    I'm neither a Nicki Minaj fan or hater but I checked out Pink Friday to see whether the enormous amount of hype was justified. Judging by how flat-out awful the three initial singles (the abysmal \\"Massive Attack\\" [which is predictably omitted from Pink's track listing]; the lazy Annie Lennox-sampling \\"Your Life\\"; the Drake-sounding \\"Right Thru Me\\") were, I wasn't exactly expecting a classic. Yet, I wasn't expecting something as misguided and shamelessly corny as what Minaj delivers on Pink Friday.    First things first, Pink Friday is a straight-ahead mainstream pop album. Minaj actually sings on most of the album. A great singer, she's not. Most of the songs, which are quite forgettable, feature the current hallmarks of Top 40 pop, circa 2010: the dry 808 beats, wheezing Euro synths, simple keyboards during the verses, airbrushed multi-tracked hooks. In short, nothing unique or individual. In fact, Pink Friday is designed as a crossover diva pop/R&B album; it sounds way more like Rihanna or Lady Gaga than MC Lyte. I say all of this to alert hip hop heads that this is not an actual rap album. It's clearly aimed at teen girls and gay males (who may elevate her to Lil' Kim/Beyonce level of idol worship).    Moreso than production, Pink Friday really suffers lyrically. While Minaj has had her moments of wittiness and invention on a few of her countless high profile guest verses, those traits are strikingly absent from her proper debut album. Minaj doesn't seem to have much to say. Aside from an attempt at introspection on \\"Dear Old Nicki\\", outside of love and/or quirky junk-talking, Minaj doesn't seem to have much of a personal perspective. I understand that she's playing a character but is that what music is really about? Is Pink Friday a musical statement or a soundtrack to a persona?    While Pink Friday doesn't say much about Minaj after its duration, it does saya lot about the state of current mainstream hip hop. It seems that the label suits have found a new way to sell hip hop to Middle America: hide the rapping. This album, Drake's Thank You Later, B.o.B.'s The Great Adventures of Bobby Ray, both of Kid Cudi's albums and all of Kanye West's discography illustrate this. All of those were albums that aggressively targeted the mainstream pop audience who could care (or know) less about hip hop at the sake of the artist's own individuality (or in the case of some of those artists, lack of individualism).    At the end of the day, Pink Friday doesn't assert Ms. Minaj as a solid artist who can stand on her own beyond a quick sixteen on someone else's record. It is a heavily compromised pop record that escapes the (non-adoring) listener's mind second after its completion.     In other words, for a woman who bases her sound, public image and look on Lil' Kim's, Nicki has made her Notorious K.I.M. before making her Hard Core.     So, while Pink Friday suggests that Minaj may not have the charisma and personality to truly survive as a relevant artist sans gimmicky spectacle, it may  stand as a document of what hip hop and black female major label artists became in 2010. Is this a positive or negative document? Is Minaj merely the over-hyped flavor of the month this album suggests she is? Or is she is an inventive pop-raptress who is subliminally feminist? Or, is she ultimately just an illustration of the \\"black lost girl\\" that Nas once rapped about?    Only time will tell.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|Great movie, my little girl loves it and I LOVE that I don't have to worry that anything innapropriate is in it for her young eyes/ears!
B003X2O6KW|2.0|The following sentence will enrage many of Kanye West's large mass of loyal supporters and drive them to click the 'not-helpful' button with alarming speed but it needs to be said.    Kanye West, has achieved an unbelievable level of critical respect and fame, for someone is who not much of a musical talent.    A middling rapper, who at his best makes you chuckle with a cutesy-clever line and at his worst, makes Vanilla Ice or Soulja Boy sound like Rakim and Nas. An erratically mediocre producer with no sense of rhythm, timing or groove-strange for a man who originally based his musical aesthetic on the landmark '90s work of soul brothers like DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Large Professor. A god-awful singer who makes your shower singing sound American Idol-worthy. A gaudy conceptualist with no sense of originality (yes, KW fans, most of your hero's ideas are shamelessly ripped off from much less famous sources) or hell, concept.     All in all, Kanye West has made a career based almost entirely off of a persona instead of sheer musicality. One could call him a black male incarnation of Madonna.    I say all of this to preface my assessment of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West's fifth release.     MBDTF is a laborious, overblown, grandiose, gaudy big-budget affair. It was created by someone with all of the drive, ambition and need for approval in the world. But it's missing one thing: musical talent. Mr. West simply doesn't have the musical chops to pull off what he was trying to do.    MBDTF is designed as an epic listening experience. But the music is simply not strong enough to fulfill its aim. MBDTF, like all of West's previous albums, aims so hard to SEEM inventive, experimental, progressive and visionary that it's rarely any of those things. \\"Runaway\\" marries a laughably lame sung hook, a lazy Pete Rock-jacked beat (listen to \\"The Basement\\" on Mecca & the Soul Brother), and an annoying piano line (that's also sampled without any variation) to characteristically lukewarm effect. It's not even catchy. And like most of the songs on MBDTF, it goes on for way too long (9 minutes long, includling a very unnecessary middle third) for no real reason, other than for West to SEEM (key word here) inventive, artful, experimental, progressive, risk-taking, eclectic. For West, these tactics are to sell a marketable image, not taken on geniune artistic whim. It's too transparent.    Like all of West's other albums, MBDTF does have some brief moments of enjoyability. The opening \\"Dark Fantasy\\" has a decent groove (that like all of West's best musical moments, he didn't produce) yet begins with an unnecessarily sung portion. Nicki Minaj's verse on the otherwise rote posse cut \\"Monster\\" gets your attention and is cute enough: more impressive in its sheer gimmickry and cuteness than pure rhyme skill like say, Foxy Brown's verse on \\"I Shot Ya\\" back in the day. Bink's Smokey Robinson-sampling \\"Devil in a New Dress\\" is a standout. If only for its track, as West's trademark jumbled flow only annoys and guest Rick Ross adds very little.    At the end day, MBDTF is the musical equivalent to a production at Disney World: loud, elaborate, grand, and extravagant yet at its core empty, vapid, hokey and purely artificial. The long song lengths, extensive list of collaborators (over forty high profile names participate on \\"All The Lights\\"; over a dozen producers are credited), attempts at high concept and emotion all come across as stunts and nothing more.    Kanye West has made a six-year career of being mainstream pop-rap's reigning drama queen. Judging by the obviously conflicted mind state presented and the darkness of MBDTF's sound, the drama won't cease anytime soon. But why should it? He's built a strong rapport with the pop audience by playing this role. They all buy into it (check out the large amount of fawning present in the other customer reviews on this site as well as the \\"perfect\\" ratings that many mainstream music outlets are heapingon this album) and his profile's not dropping. So, from a business standpoint, why would West want to switch up the formula?     MBDTF suggests that West may see himself as the next Michael Jackson. Although such a thought on West's part is obviously delusional, it is accurate when speaking of West's ambitions. He wants to thrill, enrage, invent, scare, dazzle, sparkle and shine like MJ. But he's missing the one thing that cultivated MJ to seemingly unreachable heights: supernatural TALENT.     West wants to be the biggest and boldest soldier out on the field but as MBDTF proves just like all of his others album did, he doesn't just lack the weapons. He wouldn't even know how to shoot if he were to be equipped with them.    Building an intriguing (albeit completely unlikeable) public persona can propel one to mainstream pop culture iconography but it doesn't cultivate genuinely amazing music.    While West's ambition in spite of any presence of actual musical talent is admirable on some level, it is not enough to substitute for actual music prowess.     Kanye West, the 21st century's Michael Jackson?: A (laughably) beautiful, dark twisted fantasy indeed.
B000001FDK|5.0|I love this it takes me back to a younger age. I am sharing this with my daughter who also is loving this!
0553805371|3.0|well the initial chapters were not too bad since it was a fairly understandable rehash of basic ancient philosopy moving on into modern physics. And i appreciated Hawkings keeping it simple altho at times i felt he condescended to me..but why shouldn't he...he is amazing and i definitely need a bit of condecension and simplicity in this field!   But as I moved on towards the end of the book i felt i was losing it. It is astounding to think these folks sit around and THINK of this stuff! It left me feeling lofty but a little lost. I will go back and re-read the final chapters and hope for additional clarity.  I did love tho, the concepts of mulitple universes, endless possibilities,and the lack of the need for a supreme being to design it all. I was simultanelously taking a Integral Philosophy course (altho, according to Hawkings, philosophy is dead)and was struck by the similarities to Spiral Dynamics and the idea of the multiple maps of the M theory of everything. The nice thing about physics is that it makes such Sense.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|As the fairly wonderful David Tennant moves on to do whatever, Matt Smith steps thru the door as the new and the eleventh and the youngest Doctor yet. And while I count Tom Baker as my most favorite Doctor ever, this new guy rapidly wins me over. This latest incarnation of the Doctor - youthful-faced (for someone 907 years old) and leany-gawky and so floppy-haired that Conan O'Brien isn't amused - is a bit high strung and yet has that twinkle in the eye. The eccentricity is a given, as is that he still champions the human race. And the Doctor is clearly having fun, welcomes each dawning adventure with open arms, he does. It helps that his new companion - the rather fantastic Amy Pond (a superb Karen Gillan) - is as equally excited. I am loving the new blood. And this Doctor coins the best nickname for himself yet: \\"space Gandalf.\\"<br /><br />This season tells the life of Amelia Pond. The first episode, \\"The Eleventh Hour,\\" sold me on the new Doctor, had me relishing the fairy tale angle. There's an almost mythic archetypal element to the Doctor and Amy Pond's relationship. It dates back to how they met. \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" opens one evening with an earnest Scottish seven-year-old named Amelia Pond praying for someone to come and fix the scary crack in her bedroom wall. And when the disoriented new Doctor appears from nowhere to hang out and taste various foods (fish custard?) and to examine that notorious wall crack, little Amelia Pond understandably takes to him. So much so, that many years later the Doctor still has a place in the adult Amelia's mind (Amelia who is now Amy). Twelve years after the Doctor first met Amelia, he resurfaces, very tardy on his promise. He resurfaces in the bare nick of time. Because while he'd been gone, something sinister had stayed with Amy Pond all these years. Just what is the secret of... Prisoner Zero?<br /><br />A few things to take from this episode. One is the chemistry between Matt Smith and Karen Gillan (both of them are irrepressible). Then, near the end, the Doctor has a moment of sheer asssownery as he absolutely cows an encroaching alien spacecraft (\\"Hello, I'm the Doctor. Basically... run.\\"). Finally, we hear Prisoner Zero's ominous prophecy and realize it to be this season's recurring plot thread: \\"The universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall.\\" That crack is growing ever wider. Oh, snap.<br /><br />A new interior set design for the Tardis. A new retro wardrobe for the new Doctor (bow ties are cool again). A new companion. But the tropes are familiar. The time travel. The alien planets. The Daleks. The last surviving Time Lord applying his smug and his compassion and intellect to save the day. And so on, so on. This season allows us to gaze at weeping angels and vampires in Venice and at the very last of the star whales. We take in an insidious dream lord and a faithful lone plastic Roman Centurion, and let's not forget the attack of the evil geriatrics. And Starship UK. We even see the Doctor brush elbows with Winston Churchill and Vincent Van Gogh. All thirteen episodes are fine and I love the many bits of continuity callbacks, but I've got preferences. \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" is fantastic for the reasons already mentioned. \\"The Time of Angels\\" is creepy, creepy, creeeeepy. The riveting two-part season-ender (\\"The Pandorica Opens\\" & \\"The Big Bang\\") has the Doctor racing against time to solve the puzzle of that crack in the wall which could spell doom for all time and all the stars in the sky. And there's also a wedding and crazy dancing at the wedding. And possibly Karen Gillan's finest moment in this show so far.<br /><br />Oh, and we finally learn why the Tardis makes that noise whenever it begins fading in and out.<br /><br />DOCTOR WHO - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SERIES contains the entire thirteen episodes. It comes in six discs and with the following bonus features:<br /><br />- \\"Meanwhile in the Tardis\\" presents two additional scenes (from \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" &\\"Flesh and Stone,\\" respectively) with Amy and the Doctor hanging out in the Tardis<br /><br />- \\"Monster Files\\" on the Daleks, the Weeping Angels, the Silurians, and the Alliance<br /><br />- A 3-Part \\"Video Diary\\" (split over three discs) as Matt Smith and Karen Gillan guide you behind-the-scenes of the show from make-up to sets to the actors' trailers to crafts services to shooting various scenes of the show<br /><br />- The thirteen informative \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\" mini-documentaries (each @13-15 minutes long) which explore the episodes in Series 5<br /><br />- \\"In-Vision Commentaries\\" have various of the cast & crew (but not Matt Smith) in picture-in-picture mode as they provide commentary tracks for the following six episodes: \\"The Eleventh Hour,\\" \\"Victory of the Daleks,\\" \\"The Time of Angels\\" (in which Karen Gillan and head writer Steven Moffat settle the debate of who would win in a battle between the Daleks and the Weeping Angels), \\"The Vampires of Venice,\\" \\"Cold Blood,\\" and \\"The Big Bang\\" (also with Karen Gillan)<br /><br />- Outtakes<br /><br />- Teaser trailers, episodic trailers, finale trailers, international trailers... in a nutshell, trailers, trailers, trailers<br /><br />- The DVD box set also comes with three lithographs featuring, respectively, an orange Dalek, the Tardis, and Amy & the Doctor, as well as a tiny pamphlet promoting various cool Doctor Who toys<br /><br />The Series 5 episodes:<br /><br />- \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" - Imagine if you learn that your imaginary childhood friend was real?

It never bodes well when a little girl sings a nursery song or says a scary poem. \\"Expect no love from the Beast Below,\\" this little girl recites.<br /><br />- \\"Victory of the Daleks\\" - In wartime England, Prime Minister Winston Churchill has a new secret weapon in his fight against Germany: the Daleks. \\"I am your soldier,\\" harshly proclaims one of Churchill's Ironsides to the Doctor who isn't buying any of it.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|This really touched my heart and reminded me of the joy I used to feel as a child around Christmas. Even the music in movie is extremely good.
0312600844|5.0|So many things have been written about this author and his work, and THIS work in particular! What needs to be said to prospective readers is this: You don't have to like the characters you will meet, in order to appreciate the story, and his rather prodigious talent. Individual portrayals are not what Franzen cares about. He is a master, and in my opinion, maybe THE contemporary American master at capturing how we are shaped, for better or worse, by our parents and our childhood experiences. It is so tiring to hear people complain they don't like the choices his characters have made. He doesn't care if you like them. He just asks you to understand them, and also to see yourselves, in whole or part. With very few missteps he succeeds in showing us that what we seek, is not love, but freedom, and it is a delusion of folly. We Americans pass it on to our children like cowlicks, and freckles.    Mr Franzen, my only complaint would be that every now and then, the strings you are holding up there in the rafters, which are connected to the appendages of those little persons down in the footlights,  clumsily catch the light. Your writing, so tight, so polished, calls attention to your High Art. It seems to ignite a kind of perturbed annoyance on the part of the reader, who doesn't want to see you in the wings, sharpening your pencils and scribbling.For this reader:  It feels as though you have started with the ending, and have written it backwards to the start you needed, rather than a story lived forwards. There is therein a frozen perfection, for all your flawed and beautifully nuanced characters you push around the boards, trying to figure out how to live in an increasingly morally complex world.
B000065K5S|5.0|Our son and family were visiting and they have a 5 year old daughter, she watched all of the movie.  Just wonderful to find something the entire family can watch together.  Not to have to worry about  the language or sexual content.  Wonderful, wonderful family movie.
0307387178|3.0|I admit that I was a little disappointed in this book. While the story of Chris McCandless is very interesting, I think the author could have done a better job with it. I found it tacky that he put his own story in the midst of the book which was not about him.....

B0019NB9A2|3.0|Forbidden Planet is one of my all time favourite Sci Fi movies, so I was very excited at the prospect of being able to view it in Blu-ray with a DTS soundtrack. However, I must confess that I was a little disappointed. Although the image quality is noticeably better than the standard NTSC DVD version, it wasn't quite as crisp and sharp as I had hoped for. I think this is largely due to the graininess of the original film stock. I have noticed the same thing with the blu-ray transfers of other older films including Ghandi.<br /><br />I was also hoping that the soundtrack had been digitally remastered to provide a surround sound experience, but found that this was not the case. To be honest, the DTS soundtrack does sound better than the original DVD version, but it would have been nice to listen to it in 5.1. They were able to do it for 2001, so I was hoping they could do it for this too. I found it difficult to find a truly satisfactory surround sound stage for it on my home theatre system and ended up listening to it in stereo. I found this the most disappointing aspect of this version.<br /><br />I haven't yet had a look at the bonus features and do believe that the disc is probably worth buying for these alone, but have to advise you not to expect the same sort of movie experience we are accustomed to getting with more recent releases. Still a great show though and definitely superior to the standard DVD - particularly on larger screen TVs!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Has come in handy on several occations already. Not only for shapening knives but doing yard work, I tuned-up several different clippers. Good product
B0049D1TCM|4.0|Few things to point out: I don't belong to a fansite, or any type of fan forum, so my review will be based on purely what I heard.    I really like this album. I've replayed it after the first time and I definitely like the different collaborations and different types of beats that are heard. I will say one thing, the tracks on this album are NOT all auto tune, it's actually Nicki Minaj singing. And if you've never heard her real singing voice before, then you'll choose not to believe that. I, on the other hand know better. She's got some interesting collaborations on here, for instance when I saw Natasha Bendingfield's name, I was quite surprised. If you're fans of Nicki's previous works and feel that this was too \\"Pop-ish\\", then you have to realize that her effort to do a song in the same style, didn't top the charts...and frankly it wasn't what people wanted. I do think that among those \\"Pop\\" hits, she does have some tracks where she brings it.    Tracks to listen to:    Roman's Revenge  Did It On 'Em  Fly  Save Me  Moment For Life    For a debut, this was a smart and strong move she made with the direction of her album.
0786955570|5.0|Years ago, during my junior high and high school days, I was a connoisseur of tabletop RPGs.  I had my gang of players and we would spent hours and weekends playing whatever RPG we had in front of us, from D&D to White Wolf to Gurps and beyond.  As I grew older and grew apart from my old friends, my books have gone into storage.  I always want to get back into those games, but my friends, even my geeky ones, don't normally have the patience, drive or desire to really dig into a campaign setting.  And finding the time to both create massive adventures on my part but also finding the discrete amount of time each week or so to sit down and play for a few hours is difficult now.  When I heard about Castle Ravenloft (one of my favorite campaign settings), I immediately perked up.  Here, I thought, was a chance to dig back into the game in a way that wasn't as complicated or time-consuming (or, let's be honest, as geeky) as a full-fledged campaign.  After I ordered it, I became very worried because most of the reviews I've read across the internet have said it's too hard.  I was afraid that it'd turn of my fellow gamers and the box would languish like my 2nd edition D&D books.    Here is my experience after a couple playthroughs:    Castle Ravenloft is a huge box.  It dwarfs all other equally large board games I own like Betrayal at House on the Hill and Last Night on Earth.  It also comes with a ton of pieces (a good thing, considering the price of this monster) for you to punch out.  As listed above in the product description, there's dozens of miniatures, an equal amount of interlocking dungeon tiles, around 200 encounter and treasure cards, a rule book, a scenario book (with about a dozen scenarios) and a 20-sided die that I'm pretty sure is out to kill.  What it doesn't explain is the amount of other punchable tiles to indicate hit points, conditions (like slowed and immobile), traps, treasures, monsters, character and \\"boss\\" stocks (i.e. Strahd) with stats and otherassorted items you'll use in the scenarios. I spent a good amount of time punching out the dungeon tiles and the other tiles, skimming the cards and just admiring how awesomely designed the entire thing is.  It's not cheap materials in this box.  Wizards did a terrific job making this stand out, from a workman perspective.  The only complaint I'd level is that the dungeon tiles are kind of mundane.  The art is pretty typical \\"dungeon tile\\" and lacks flair.      The Rulebook is very slim and sometimes ambiguous.  I've read through it a couple times and it took running a game and coming up with house rules to deal with ambiguity to really understand everything.  For example, it mentions the white and black arrows on the dungeon tiles and tells you that if there's a black arrow, you have to draw an encounter card.  But it doesn't tell you what the white arrow means, except that it's the difference between a difficult situation and an easier one.  The implication is that you don't draw an encounter card when the white arrow is there (or, I discovered later, some scenarios explain a specific thing to do if the arrow is white), but it doesn't spell it out.  And it can be confusing the first few times you play through the game.  Likewise, some dungeon tiles have skulls on them and some don't.  I couldn't find in the book exactly what those mean, so we just decided that it meant you had to draw a monster card.  I'm sure there will be an errata online to address the nebulous rules but you'd think that the game you purchased would have the rules clearly laid out.  Sifting through the forums shows that a lot of people have made up house rules to address some of the ambiguity.      For our first game, we went with the second scenario (the first scenario is for one player).  It was the most straightforward and presumably easiest: the goal was to locate the chapel, find the Icon of Ravenloft and escape with it.  The game comes with five characters/classes (fighter, wizard, priest, rogue and ranger) and each character has a selection of power cards that they can use once in the game or at will.  Thankfully, the game suggests specific cards if you don't know what you're doing.  We went with those and it was fine.  The game is split into three phases for each player: Hero, exploration and villain.  During the hero phase, you can move a set number of spaces on a tile and/or attack.  If you reach the end of a tile, you draw another dungeon tile and set it down.  The tile will indicate whether you have to draw an encounter card or not and whether to place a monster.  If you have an encounter, you have to draw an encounter card and it'll tell you what to do.  Most of the time, some random monster will attack you or everyone on your tile.  You roll the dice, add their attack to it and see if it's above or below your armor class.  If it's above, you take the damage listed on the card.  If it's below, you either take no damage or, more often than not, take one damage regardless.  Encounters are 90% mean.  You don't want to deal with them.      After the encounter, you draw a monster card and place the miniature on the bone pile in the room.  Because the game doesn't have a game master to control the monsters, if you draw the card, it's your monster to control.  Castle Ravenloft intelligently deals with this by using the monster cards.  Each monster has a specific tactic that you use, which follows a \\"If the monster is within one tile of you it does this\\" or \\"if the monster is next to a hero, it does this.\\"  Some monsters, like gargoyles, won't move if you are over one tile away from them.  But most of them will move towards you and attack.  The difference is which attack they'll use.  As an example, a spider will bite you if it's next to you.  If it's within a tile from you, it'll use its web attack to slow you and then move to you.  If it's over a tile away, it'll simply move towards the closest hero.  Killing the monster means you keep the card which in turn acts as experience points.  Experience points are very important because you can spend five points to cancel out an encounter; or, if you roll a natural 20, you can spend five experience points to go up to level two...obviously this doesn't happen very often.      Castle Ravenloft can be a very intense game.  Because there is no game master and in order to prevent heroes from taking their time and just slowly taking care of monsters, waiting around and healing up (using a cleric ability, for example) before continuing on, Ravenloft throws encounters at you with wild abandon.  If you don't explore (reach the end of a tile and place another), you have to draw an encounter card.  Likewise, if you are fighting three monsters and it's not going well (meaning, you can't continue on and explore), you have to draw an encounter card.  This can quickly spike the difficulty and overwhelm you to the point that you won't win.  You only get two healing surges (we played with three, as was recommended in the rulebook for \\"lowering the difficulty\\") and all of the scenarios end if even one player is dead.  In case it's not evident: Castle Ravenloft is hard and often punishing.  Once you add in traps that can smash you into walls, shoot arrows, or immobilize you among other crazy cards you can pull, your chances of survival seem almost nil.  The game is stacked against you.  That said, we managed to barely survive our first game based on right-timed skills (the fighter's dragon breath at the end which ended up hitting all three monsters and killing them) and luck.  But we had fun the entire time.      With twelve wildly different scenarios and two available to download from Wizards' website, there's a lot of replayability in Castle Ravenloft.  I will end with a little anecdote about our first playthrough.  I was playing with two friends.  One had a bit of experience both with computer RPGs and some table top experience.  The other had absolutely no experience.  At the beginning, she just took what power cards were dealt to her, looked them over and said \\"I have no idea what any of this means.\\"  She didn't really care what was going on.  But something interesting happened.  As the game progressed, she grew more and more into it, and at the end when we were faced with three monsters and it looked grim she excitedly and animatedly jumped up, yelling, \\"OH! I can use my dragon breath skill and kill them all!\\" It made me smile.  While Castle Ravenloft is geared towards pen and paper geeks like myself, it is simple enough that someone who has never played through a module (let alone know what a module is) can pick it up and have a great time.
B004BSDKUE|5.0|Before I heard the album, I was afraid that the entire album would be based on sex. While I did enjoy \\"Beam Me Up Scotty\\" I had to skip a few tracks.But for this album, I only skip one. Many people won't agree with me, but I LOVE PINK FRIDAY! While the album is a little uneven, it is overall an awesome album. Nicki is showing who she is and is doing what she wants. Here is my track by track review    1. I'm The Best 10/10  This is one my favorites. Nicki gives a mini version of her life story over a nice beat. I appreciate the lyrics and her delivery. I've seem some reviews that say that she's too egotistical on this song. I think its because she's female.    2.Roman's Revenge 9/10  I love her exchange with Eminem on this one. Although the beat could be better, I think that it fits the overall \\"i'm mad as hell\\" theme. I would love to see a video for this one!    3.Did It On 'Em 4/10  I absolutely hate this one. It's gross. I love the \\"I'm the bestest\\" type songs but this is too much. Let's leave it at that.    4.Right Thru Me 8/10  I love this song! She doesn't sing like Aretha or anything but I really love her singing voice. It fits her personality. The instrumental is so sweet and I really love the subject matter. So many people relate to this song.    5.Fly 10/10  Awesome. That's all I can say. Awesome. Rihanna's hook is too sweet and so are Nicki's verses.    6.Save Me 10/10  This is my favorite song on the album. There is absolutely no rapping in it. It seems as thought she pushed a guy to the side for fame but now she wants him back. The little queen metaphor is cute too. I really hopes she makes a video for this one.     7.Moment 4 Life 8/10   Another good track. Drake and Nicki do their thing. The hook is okay but I'm not crazy about it.    8.Check It Out 7/10  I love Nicki's parts but will.i.am just drowns out the song. I'm not a will.i.am fan so his contribution did nothing for me. This doesn't mean I don't go around going \\"I can't believe it!\\"     9.Blazin 8/10  \\"I dear you, BAMBI\\". Awesome. the entire song is blazin. At first listen, I felt that Kanye's verse was too long. But it fits perfectly. I love it!!     10.Here I Am 9/10  This song may not be radio friendly but I really dig this one. The song is about a relationship gone wrong. It seems as though her guy is controlling and thinks she'll fade away with him. But she's telling him otherwise. <3    11.Dear Old Nicki 10/10  2010 Nicki misses 2007 Nicki. But she clearly states with this song and with this album that she's ready for a change. The chorus and verse flow together perfectly.    12.Your Love 10/10  When I first heard this song last year on the \\"Barbie World\\" mixtape, I thought I was listening to a different artist. Who knew that Nicki was capable of such a sweet song! The Annie Lennox sample is awesome and I'm glad that she created this song. I loved it so much that I made a music video using clips from Bedrock, My Chick Bad, and a song called \\"Higher Than a Kite\\" from the Come Up dvd. In Higher than a kite, she's wearing a kimono and wielding a sword. Little did I know, she had the same idea lol. However, I do hate that the lyrics change for this version. In the original, they're about to get married. Imagine how that would have played out in the video! Getting killed at her wedding!!!    13. Last Chance 9/10  This song is cute but I wish that Natasha had a more defined part. It seems as though they just tagged her verse on the end. But the song is awesome!!!    ****Although this is a review for the normal version, I encourage you to check out the song \\"Super Bass\\" on the deluxe version. It is AWESOME! I love it dearly! There are also 5 other bonus songs. They are \\"Girls Fall Like Dominoes\\" \\"Wave ya Hand\\" \\"Catch Me\\" \\"Muny\\" and \\"Blow Ya Mind.\\" Check em out!    Overall, Pink Friday is a cool album to have in your collection. I'm not a \\"Barbie\\" or anything but I am a huge fan of hers and I think that it is because of her ability to be versatile. Nicki said that she doesn't want to be defined and this album shows that. The production could have been a little better but this is an awesome debut. In a nutshell, PICK IT UP!       ******After listening to the album more, I had to change a few ratings. :)
044654759X|5.0|I currently own every novel Nicholas Sparks has ever written.  I have yet to be disappointed in any of his writings.  I get frustrated when he pairs a couple together only to have one of them die some horrific death, leaving the other partner crushed but moving along into the sunset.  So when I heard that Sparks was releasing his latest novel and it'd have a mystery twist thrown in, I was hooked.    Book stores are a thing of the past in the area I'm in.  I ordered off Amazon and paced the floor until the UPS guy brightened my doorway with that box.  After tearing into the package, I sat down to read and nearly two hours later, I was almost halfway done with the book.  It's that good.  This particular novel was a bit outside Sparks's norm of sappy love fests and torn lovers and I for one was glad for the change.  I love all of his work and this book was no exception.  I stayed up late to finish the book in one sitting and though I regretted only getting a few hours of sleep that night, it was worth it.  When I got to the ending of the novel, I was blown away.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.    Once again, Sparks doesn't disappoint.  If only he'd write more than one novel a year.
B003VYAVGA|4.0|\\"Progress\\" is the latest CD by UK Pop group Take That, and their first with Robbie Williams since \\"Nobody Else\\" 15 years ago. While their previous two CDs \\"Beautiful World\\" and \\"Circus\\" featured a soft adult Rock/Folk sound, their new CD - produced by Stuart Price (Madonna, Killers, Scissor Sisters) - finds them living up to the album's title as they take a grand leap forward with a more upbeat synth-driven sound. Their new sound is more in line with Williams' solo work.<br /><br />\\"Standing on the edge of forever, on the edge of whatever\\" go the opening lines of the opening cut the theatrical lead-off single \\"The Flood\\" with an anthemic chorus and Williams and Gary Barlow on lead, followed by the frenetic \\"SOS' with Williams and Mark Owen on vocals and a whiff of Killers. \\"Wait\\" has an electro beat and ghostly flourishes, while Williams and Owen again lead on the Muse-style glam stomp \\"Kidz\\" set to crunching martial beats.<br /><br />The fluttering \\"Pretty Things\\" is more subdued with Williams and Barlow singing over a Bowie-style pulse, while the dark throbbing \\"Happy Now\\" has a chorus rising above the gloom. \\"Underground Machine\\" is a gritty Funk Rocker, \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" features Owen singing almost autobiographical apologetic lyrics about his philandering set to a Beatles-style bounce. \\"Affirmation\\" is a frenetic Pop/Rock song again with shades of Bowie and Howard Donald on lead, and closing are the ballads \\"Eight Letters\\" with Gary Barlow and the hidden stripped floaty Jason Orange song \\"Flower Bed\\".<br /><br />This is the best Take That album yet, and it has already set records in their native UK where it sold over 500,000 copies in a week earning the best first week sales yet this century.

B0040QYROK|5.0|For years I have admired but not really liked this film.  I think it is because there was no real \\"complete\\" version available.  I thought Georgio Moroder deserved an \\"A\\" for effort (and a D- for his score) in putting together a longer version in the 80's, and Kino certainly deserves that grade for the most complete version that they put on video earlier in this decade.  However, because about 30-40 minutes was still missing, it still was not a true masterpiece to me;  a classic, yes, but not a masterpiece.<br /><br />When I heard about an almost complete version discovered in South America, I was very intrigued. but when I saw this version at the TCM Festival last spring, I was blown away by the power of the film and it finally made sense with so many little bits restored to the film.  We are still missing a few minutes, but with the exception of Joh Fredersen and Rotwang having a good, old-fashioned fight, whatever is still missing can be lived with.<br /><br />This is an astounding film, and Kino's HD transfer is remarkable, to say the least.  Image clarity ranks with their gorgeous copy of THE GENERAL, and even the battered found footage has been cleaned up enough to not take you out of the film when it appears.  I wish the Alloy Orchestra score that I heard live was on this disc, but the Huppertz score is still quite good.  If you are a classic film fan but still have a reluctant feeling towards silent films, this will make you a convert.<br /><br />Bravo to Kino!

B00418NXBK|5.0|Loved this album! Every track is a blast!  The CD was delivered before the estimated date of arrival, perfect!
B0040QYROA|5.0|I had an old copy of Metropolis on VHS tape and although I was awed by its special effects, the story never made much sense.  I heard the stories about how this movie was literally butchered and it was thought that much of the film was lost forever.  Then it was found in, of all places, Brazil.  If you think you have seen Metropolis, you really have not until you see this version.  Suddenly, much of the gaps in logic are filled in.  The quality of most of the film is superb.  I was mesmerized for the 2 1/2 hours that the film ran.  A truly remarkable achievement.

1926778103|3.0|[[VIDEOID:moBTCFKEQ4U4HR]]The Art of Darksiders is a 288-page paperback art book, thicker than I expected. The cover is nice and has some shimmer underneath the art.<br /><br />Joe Madureira is the creative director for Darksiders and the artistic direction is largely influenced by his designs.<br /><br />The book is packed with hundreds of concept art on the characters, environment, weapons, artifacts, CG models and other illustrations. There are lots of sketches for anything that moves. The environment art are mainly coloured pieces. The art is beautiful and there are details everywhere.<br /><br />The text was lacking as there are only character and location descriptions. With so much art, I was expecting some artist commentary regarding the game but there is none. Strangely, there's also no foreword and introduction -- you go straight into the art on page 1.<br /><br />The binding for a book this thick is quite bad, hence the average rating I gave. It's fragile and will break when you open it too much. The alternative hardcover edition is only sold at Udon's site and cost too much.<br /><br />It's a great art book let down by the terrible binding. Darksiders and video game art fans can expect bittersweet satisfaction.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I received this book as a gift after I started watching Dexter on Showtime.  I think that the character Dexter in the books is definitely darker than the Dexter in the TV show.  The Dexter in this book truly has no feelings.  The plot is fascinating and I loved the way all of the characters we see in the show have a darker side in the books.  The difference in the LaGuerta character is huge.  Whether or not there was a TV show, I think this book would have grabbed me and brought me back for more.  I am currently reading the other books in the series.  If you like complex characters and don't mind a little blood and gore, I highly recommend.
B0015AARJI|5.0|When compared to the Playstation 3 Sixaxis controller that came with my non-slim system, this controller is a fair upgrade.  The Dualshock controller has more weight to it and a more solid feel than the sixaxis, as well as the rumble addition.  The controller does NOT come with its own micro-usb charging cable.  This means you will need to charge with the original cable that came with the system, or will need to buy another one.
B0049D1TCM|4.0|I'm not one of those types to dismiss a rapper because she's female like most people have done.  I first took notice of Nicki Minaj in 2008 on her Beam Me Up Scotty mixtape which was an absolute classic mixtape in my opinion.  One listen to that mixtape made me a believer that she could do some things in the rap game.    Aside from her looks, she's also a rather talented rapper in flow and lyrics.  By now everyone has (or should have) heard her verse on MONSTER by Kanye West where she absolutely outshines and murders Jay-Z, Rick Ross, and Kanye on the same track.  A masterful verse complete with all of the voice inflections, personalities and voices.  I admit I wasn't a huge fan of her \\"different personas\\" but she switches back and forth effortlessly and seamlessly.  She built her brand up by collaborating with many artists but notably a bunch of pop artists.  She gained respect by going toe to toe with the likes of Drake, Kanye West, and Gucci Mane.    On her debut album Pink Friday she takes her sound in a non traditional direction.  Instead of coming out and putting her lyrical talent to the test she chooses a more experimental mix of sounds that for the most part actually works.  Honestly, we haven't heard a female rap album done in this manner in a while.  There is no shame in her game throwing some straight pop songs on here next to some pseudo R&B type songs next to the \\"traditional\\" hip hop type songs.    No doubt about it this album is very commercial so buyers should listen to the album first but that doesn't make it a bad album or a non hip hop album.  She raps on the album it's just the beats, style and melodies are a bit different.  Roman's Revenge is just weird but it works.  Your Love and Right Thru Me are very effective singles and I like both songs. Did It On Em is a menacing track and a call for war and it's by far the hardest track on the album.  Perhaps this type of rap is what a lot of \\"real\\" hip hop fans were expecting and I admit even I was expecting more of that type.  One gripe is that she uses Big Sean's Supa Dupa flow a bit too much.  It's time to retire that style...Favre(Ex. I'll kick that girl...punt).  However I still enjoy a majority of the songs included here.    Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday is definitely a unique listen and those expecting something more along the lines of a Lil Kim/Foxy Brown/Remy Ma/Shawnna type of album will be in for a big surprise.  It's more along the lines of a Missy Elliott album.  However if you've liked recent releases from artists such as M.I.A., Rihanna, Kanye West, Drake, or Kid Cudi then I believe there's a good chance you would enjoy this album as well.  3.75 Stars.    ***There are 6 bonus tracks; Girls Fall Like Dominoes, Muny, Super Bass, Blow Your Mind, Catch Me and Wave Ya Hands.  These tracks can be tracked down the way you know is best.  From those I believe Girls Fall, Muny, and Blow Your Mind should have made the final track listing.  So many bonus tracks why not just release a double album or include them all one release instead of going thru the nonsense of different album versions, pre order exclusives and other garbage tactics??  Stuff like that is why people use the internet to their benefit***
B003TT2X72|1.0|When I saw the current sale today of each of the LOTR titles on Blu Ray I still didn't even think about it.    Until the Extended Releases are available on Blu, Warner / New Line is not getting my money on LOTR. My wife and I have already purchased both the theatrical and extended DVDs, we're not getting double dipped again.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|Well I must reiterate what the masses have already stated and that's that this is an outstanding album and that Kanye West has really outdone himself with My Dark Twisted Beautiful Fantasy.  He went all out with this one with unique sounds everywhere, elaborate bridges, strange yet all too fitting and appropriate guest features, etc. etc.    One thing is for sure and that's Kanye West seems to reinvent himself after every album.  For the past year people were asking the \\"Where Are You Yeezy?\\" and his answer was that he was cooking up a classic that will undoubtedly define his career and cement his legacy as one of the greatest producers and rappers of all time.  Sometimes we as fans don't appreciate or quite understand what is happening with artists until they leave for good  but it is a great thing that Kanye is getting the recognition he deserves.  It's tough to pick a favorite song but All Of The Lights is about as good as it gets but I'm also loving Devil In A New Dress...the breakdown in the middle of the song is sheer beauty and Rick Ross delivers a grandiose verse like only he can.  Runaway also is as ambitious as it gets with its vocoder and breakdown near the end of the song.    I'm trying to go easy on the superlatives but that's a tough task.  This album right here flows along seamlessly with each song having its own distinct sound and personality yet it all comes together perfectly in an album format.  Before this album I was prepared to let Janelle Monae runaway with that album of the year title but now with MDTBF and Lady Killer I must strongly reconsider these thoughts and truthfully there have been plenty of great albums this year.    Kanye has released perhaps the biggest album of the year in terms of its impact and anticipation and the music lives up to the hype. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy creates its own mood and atmosphere and pulls you into his world. If you are any type of music fan there's something on here for you.  Highly recommended.
0307454541|2.0|the more I dislike it!<br /><br />There could be spoilers in this review.<br /><br />For a \\"thriller,\\" this book was awfully boring.  The main character was so beige that I could not understand why every woman in Sweden wanted to sleep with him.  He was utterly passive.  And ate a lot of sandwiches.  At first I found all of the references to making coffee, drinking coffee, going to get coffee, offering someone coffee, to be rather humerous but then they became a distraction.<br /><br />And Vanger could have saved himself a lot of money hiring an \\"investigator\\" because apparently all it took to solve the mystery of his neice's disappearence was to gather up all the pictures that were taken the day she disappeared and look at them very, very carefully.  Oh, and have a socially inept, tattooed and pierced, (so we know just how socially inept she is)aneroxic, woman-child hack a bunch of computers and read EVERY DOCUMENT in a corporate archive.  I also found it amazing that after 300 pages of meaningless details of everything that could possibly be deemed unimportant and bland, the culminating scene with the murderer took about 5 pages and very little happened.  This was even more suprising considering the grusome and detailed descriptions of the sadistic crimes committed by this man and his father.<br /><br />I really didn't care for Lisbeth Salander.  I felt no warmth for her or interest in her at all.  I found her annoying and cliched.  And I really don't understand why she destroyed all the evidence of what the murderer had done to his victims.  How was there going to be any justice that way?  I get that she didn't trust the \\"establishment\\" and refused to have any contact with authorities, but destryoing all the evidence of the horrific crimes seemed out of character.<br /><br />This book is almost as bad as the Twilight saga and that's saying something!
B00428ZRFY|4.0|Rihanna's 5th studio album (seems like she just came out huh?) LOUD is definitely a solid effort for her.  While being a stark contrast in mood to her previous album (Rated R) it still delivers some good sounds, lyrics and production.  Rihanna is one of my favorite artists that I didn't know was one of my favorite artists.  While sifting through my catalog of cd's I realized that I've purchased every one of her albums and have no regrets about it at all.  Personally, I think she shines more on ballads and midtempos but her club songs have been wildly popular.  While there are a few of them here (Only Girl In The World and S&M) that is not really my cup of tea, the album is filled with songs in the vibe where I believe she is at her best.    People also like to make fun of her vocals but she actually can sing pretty well she just has a unique tone that is unique to the industry.  She can also adapt to different genres which makes her highly accessible.  She usually has a touch of reggae, R&B, and pop and this album is no different. Rihanna also enlists some A-List guests such as Nicki Minaj, Drake and the one and only Eminem on the sequel to their mega hit Love The Way You Lie.      The album is a bit short but I like SKIN the most followed by (in no order) California King Bed, What's My Name, Raining Men (NH), and Cheers Drink To That.    Loud is a solid effort and can go right next to Rihanna's other releases in your collection.  While not as great as Good Girl Gone Bad or Rated R, it's still worth some of your listening time.  4 stars.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|An awsome package. It's a great gift for all the children that like Toy Story. It contains 10 excellent discs and the box toy give a specially touch.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I have no words. If you enjoy hip-hop music and someone who is a genius musically, definitely cop this album. How can an artist just keep topping himself with every album he makes? It's amazing.
B003EV6DBM|2.0|David Tenant was the best Doctor by far.  Replacing him was a huge mistake...I was entertained by the new Doctor and his companion, but I still miss David Tenatn.  I will give it one more season to see if he can turn it around... but my hope's are fading fast.
0446563048|5.0|This book is a must read, it won't leave your hands until you finish it. Ah, and it will make you smile, Tony has a great sense of humor.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|Kanye West is starting to making music for Kanye, I really don't even know what to say about this.  You can't just throw anything together and call it Hip-Hop.  If you ever wondered what would happen if a rapper with A grade production skills got too successful too fast and branded the hell out of himself then My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is for you.  I am not going to say it's close to his first two cds which were classics but I will tell you to pick it up, simply it is a 10, as Kanye would say it's, \\"good music\\".  And you have to see his movie, Runaway, that comes with the Deluxe Edition to believe it.
B003VQM2M4|4.0|Grinderman II isn't as good as I, but it's still the best album of 2010. As my mate famously said \\"I'm a man's man, but I'd shag Nick Cave\\". Best live band in the world right now.
0393072231|4.0|Very interesting and informative book about Wall Street and the big banks, and also about some smaller hedge fund guys who betted against the big system and won.
0061997811|5.0|This is a spectacular book.  It is a must have for any Harry Potter enthusiast.  If you have a Harry Potter fan in your life, get them this book.  You will not de dissapointed!
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I have purchased all of Rihanna albums, and I have to say this is one of my favorites.I think that is is too short, or maybe because I love almost every song the album just seemed shorter and shorter.     I'll break all of the songs down one-by-one    1* S&M-This song is my least favorite, I just can't really get into it like I want to. I don't know if it's because it's too pop or what. The \\"Na, Na,Na.\\" I found that to be very annoying,and I could not sit through and listen to the song, without getting a headache. It's too something, I just don't know what. The line where she says \\"Sex in the Air..I love the smell of it.\\" I don't know if that was suppose to sound sexy or what, but it sound kind of gross because I'm just sitting there thinking to myself...Eww...      2*What's My Name?~ I love this song!!! I loved it from the first time I heard it. I'm glad she released it as a single,because I think this song will take this album to the top..hopefully.The entire song the hook,and everything is on point. Adding Drake in the song really spiced everything up.Personally, it sounds like they still have something going on between them. I think they have hooked up before though. Just watched the video. I think he produce that song too...She probably should have let him do the entire album.    3*Cheers(Drink To That)~ I didn't like this song at first.The \\"Yea,Yea.\\" by Avril L. started to annoy me at first, but then I really fell in love with this song. Now, I can't imagine the Avril L. part not being in there, because the song probably wouldn't sound as good(Rihanna said so herself)I like the part toward the end where they break the song down and some men start singing in the background(Cheers To The Freakin Weekend) I like this song the most because it makes you happy and it's the perfect song to play on the freaking weekend(LOL) and party or just lay around and get drunk with your friends!!! Cheers!    4*Fading~ This Song is still growing on me,I can relate to it though. Iam starting to slowly like it. I think it is a really beautiful song.    5*Only Girl In The World~ Very Catchy, I like how it goes into the Chorus, it's very,very dramatic.It sounds like a bomb drops and it's just this totally different song. It's very \\"Clubby'. I can see it being played in the club everywhere. It definitely makes you feel good.I didn't like it first when I first heard it,again it annoyed me a bit.    6*California King Bed~ Very Beautiful Song I love it!!!!! It actually made me cry, It sounds similar to \\"Fading though a bit at first. It's a song about a relationship falling apart, and how they were best friends in the beginning, now they are almost strangers. I love how it starts off with \\"Chest to Chest..Toe to Toe.\\" I thought that was very touching and emotional.     7*Man Down~ When I first heard this song, I was thinking about her and Chris Brown, I thought she was talking about him. Also, This song seemed like it would be on her \\"Rated R.\\" album. Because of how dark and violent it seemed. It was almost as if she was trying to tell the public..\\"Look just because you saw that picture of me, or just because I was physically abused, Don't think I'm Weak.\\" So There came Rated R,and obviously she still feels that way. \\"Man Down\\" is her talking about getting away with murder.I don't understand why she is trying to be \\"hard-core.\\"     8*Raining Men~ I immediately went to this song when I put the cd in. Number one,because I wanted to know if it sound like the original song \\"Raining Men.\\" and Also Number #2 because Nicki Minaj was on there. I loved this song from the start. I like the message it has also in it. It's telling women don't worry about that guy, if he isn't treating you right then there are plenty more out there that will. Don't settle for anyone..Because There \\"Falling Like The Rain..So We Ain't Running Out.\\" :-)I like Nicki's verse on the track, she is very entertaining and \\"out there\\" with her lyrics.\\"    9*Complicated~My relationship isjust like this right now. I also like how it shows Rihanna's vocal ability more. Because alot of people were saying she couldn't really sing or anything,so this song will be sort of a slap in the face for them :-). This song is about her Boyfriend's relationship with her. I hope it doesn't stay \\"Complicated.\\" Because if it does, I don't see how they could last. Especially the way she was talking about it towards the end of the song: \\"I'm stick around for a little while longer..Just to make sure, that you really sure...You Like Sleeping Alone.\\"    10*Skin~ This song is so sexy!!! It definitely puts you in the mood for you and your lover. Rihanna has a sexy vibe in this song. \\"No Teasing..You Waited Long Enough. Go Deep..Imma Throw at ya..Can Ya Catch It?..No Holding Back...You Know I like it Rough.\\" Rihanna definitely brought it with this song. I hope that it is a single,because I think it will be a huge success.    11*Love The Way You Lie(Part II)~ I was very excited to hear Part Two of Love The Way You Lie, being the fact that I loved Part One. I think that Part Two, has more of a Rock edge to it, which I love.Obviously she was talking about Chris Brown in this song. It seems like she is still not over the breakup, which is normal. Personally, I would think she would be angry at him,but she sounded really heartbroken in the song. Which is confusing to me a bit...how could you still love someone that did that to your face?  Anyway, (Back On Topic) I like the beat and the lyrics of the song.     I like when Eminem came in towards the end, as always he delivered lyrically at his best.He is one of the only artist of TODAY, that actually writes about issues going on in the world besides talking about Money,B*tches,and Sex. I admire that about him.After Tupac died, rap seemed to die.I am glad that Eminem is still around,he seems to be holding rap up. But someone said that Eminem was the best rapper of all time. Sorry, that is not possible.He is of course the Best RapperAlive.      I love this album overall,and I hope that it sells good, and takes Rihanna all the way to the top. I feel that she truly deserves it. No matter I'll always buy her album(If it sounds good) I'll give it 5 stars!
B00338QF0U|2.0|I marvel that this book was published with paragraphs like, \\" Adam drank his whisky and consumed his peanuts with a velocity and hunger that surprised him, emptying the packet into his cupped palm and tipping the nuts carelessly into his mouth in an almost ape-like way (stray peanuts bouncing off the table top in front of him). The packet was emptied in seconds, crumpled and placed on the table where it crackingly tried to uncrumple itself for a further few seconds, while Adam picked up and ate the individual peanuts that had escaped his furious appetite. He wondered, as he savoured the salty, waxy peanut taste, if there were a more nutritious or satisfying foodstuff on the planet - sometimes salted peanuts were all that a man required.\\"     crackingly? for a further few seconds? foodstuff? Is this a poor translation of another language? Definitely some of the lousiest published writing I've read. This peanut eating description was unbearable. Really - the writer couldn't come up with a more compelling way to show an agitated state of mind than this? sometimes salted peanuts were all that a man required? is this a parody?     His descriptions of things are painfully strained and add little to the story, \\" He went to the gent's lavatory, stooping down a narrow, bendy staircase - as though it had aspired to be a spiral once but had given up halfway through the transformation - to a pungent basement where beer and urine competed on the olfactory level.\\"   competed on the olfactory level? I felt like I was reading a book written by an eccentric computer. Needless to say, I did not finish this one.
B000XA5K4I|2.0|As I watched this film, it seems like nearly every three and a half minutes, I was saying \\"Jeez, was that stupid.\\"  It's just another one of those kinds of films where the protagonist is sought and shot at, but never catches a bullet.  The main hero of the film will have 50 (said to be) professional killers shooting at him, and yet they always miss, even at close range.<br /><br />The only reason why I rented this film was because I like to see Monica Bellucci films, but even she couldn't save this ridiculous \\"tongue in cheek\\" shoot `em up.  I am sure glad that I watched this one alone.  I'd be embarrassed to have anyone think that this kind of movie entertains me.

B004B4RCDE|5.0|Let me start off by saying I loved \\"Rated R\\" and and its deep dark lyrically inspired songs, but this is not anywhere near that album...& I thought I would be disappointed with the brightness and LOUDness of this album, but I was pleasantly surprised by how S&M, the first song, made me want to turn it up louder and Rock out! As a fellow island girl, I love the reggae influenced songs on this album (ex Man Down)& the slow songs (California King Bed, Love the way you lie II) are good as well. I can play this album straight through without skipping a song and that alone is reason enough to give it five stars, but it also makes me rock out, whine it up, and REWIND!!!
0312600844|4.0|I think this book deserves a better overall review than it gets on Amazon. I loved it and can't wait to discuss it with my book club. It is a powerful story of love, unbearable emotional pain, and families.

B001GZ6QBU|5.0|My favorite movie EVER!!!       & the best joker EVER!     I could watch this over and over again..
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|Nicki Minaj did her thing. She is without a doubt talented and arguably the best, but this album isn't the perfect mix of hits. The collaborations are amazing, and it was surprisingly great to hear Rihanna and Natasha Beddingfield on this record. The majority of Nicki's lyrics are off the hook as usual as she does what she does best. [[ASIN:B0042RUMEQ Pink Friday]] as a whole is unlike her mix tapes and hot features because there are so many types of songs included. It really could have been two albums as it clearly goes in two different directions. The classic Nicki which was first presented to us is found on only about half of this album. She says she is multifaceted and refuses to be kept in the box of the face making strange noise making barbie, so if you are only or mostly interested in hearing that crazy Nicki we originally fell in love with then you will find her on Did It On 'Em, My Love, Blazin', Roman's Revenge and on the majority of the track entitled I'm The Best. The rest is a new twist of her character(s), and entails out there beats and a lot of her signing, which I believe garnered this album four stars. Rapper turned singer or not, her creativity is undeniable and this record is still worth the money, go buy it!
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|One of the my personal favorites. This one really gives a satisfying story about not just the origins of wolverine, but of all the X-MEN & more!!   XD
B003X2O6KW|1.0|I was expecting great things from this album, and honestly it fell short. Its overproduced and underdeveloped. Why is there an orchestra on every song, or a feature... who are you Lil Jon. I expected more then this from Kanye after the long lay off and the songs that leaked... but shock of all shocks \\"Runaway\\", \\"Monster\\", \\"Power\\" and \\"All of the Lights\\" are the only stand outs on this subpar offering from one of the greatest rappers ever. I think Kanye got a little too caught up in his on hype
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|got it in perfect time, great shape.     i returned one of them because my son-in-law already bought it. so far no hassles.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki speaks to women like me. She not talkin about selling drugs and going to prison so according to some other reviewers shes not \\"rapping\\" newsflash people the world has changed its 2010 all black people arent impoverished and struggling, and personally I dont wanna her that crap all the time. Nicki is the future of rap, her and Drake. Her album reminds me more of his then of her past mixtapes, its a mix of her rapping and singing. Its a solid album, certainly worth the 10 bucks I spent
B001DPC52C|5.0|I won't go into a long spiel about how awesome and epic this DVD is; others have done that sufficiently.  If you like WT just buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I'll be the first to say it; WE ALL OWE NAS $10 cause HIP HOP is DEAD! He told ya'll that this was coming but we simply didn't want to see it....what's crazy to me is that this Garbage would get compared to a legend. There are tons of credible female MC's that this imitation will have to pass to even reach Kim (Foxy, Eve, Rah Diggah, Trina, etc....) so it's crazy that she can openly steal another MC's style and then water it down with a wack delivery and call it \\"New\\"....\\"Has Been, that's right I said it Has Been...\\" Nick/Baby you've got to even \\"Bee\\" to have \\"Been\\", here is a very strong word of advice if you're going to try and discredit a MUSIC ICON (Not a HIP HOP ICON, but a freakin House Hold name) then you're going to have to first surpass her Body of Work...The reason why you're not ever going to be mentioned in the next ten years is that Hip Hop is constently evolving and it's also very fickle; which is the only reason that you and your AL B Sure looking counterpart will not be mentioned after about two seasons....if it were all about Hype then G Unit and 5-0 would still be around, but it's about Hip Hop and staying true to it, I predict that this Album will sell about 500k and maybe even a million but most gimmicks do! When the \\"Pop\\" kids catch on to the next trend than we can get back to the \\"Realllll Hip Hop, Hip Hop\\"
B000099T3P|4.0|A sleepy town in rural Kansas, Grover's Bend  is rarely touched by the hustle and bustle that plagues other communities. The stillness that insulates the tiny backwater is shattered when ravenous fugitives from outer space touch down. desperate and trapped in their embattled farmhouse, the Brown family struggles to repel the deadly alien onslaught. Their salvation comes in the form of two relentless, laser-wielding intergalactic bounty hunters. the destruction the critter horde leaves in it's wake has delighted b-movie fans for decades. humor, cheap gore and inspired storytelling unite in this queer film and the viewer benefits.
B004498KPU|5.0|This compilation of Michael's short films is a must have for any true fan. I purchased mine today (11/22/10) and I absolutely love it. The halographic cover is really nice seeing the images move before your eyes is truly something Michael would have thought of. I already have all of these brilliant short films (Except for One More Chance) on vhs tapes from years of taping everything Michael premiered on MTV, VH-1 BET ect....I am very proud of my personal collection and recently did my best to put them on dvd. So why purchase this package if I have everything? Well its a simple answer: I am a true to the heart Michael Jackson fan and I knew it would be put together in a way I could never accomplish. I was right! this is a beautiful package and its something any true fan will cherish. The only disappointment is that GHOSTS was drastically shortened from the original 30+ minutes to a little over 4 minutes...luckily I have the original full length version in my own collection. Maybe Sony will put Michael's 30th Anniversary Special on DVD.
B004259BMM|5.0|I was originally going to pre-order this album from target.com, but decided to go to the store on November 16 instead.  The $11.99 was the best money I have spent on an album since.....well, since \\"Defying Gravity\\"!  I have been listening to this album almost non-stop since I left the store!  The songs definitely have more \\"sweetness\\" to them but any Keith Urban fan understands where the music comes from - his heart and where he is in his life.  He is obviously in a very good place right now and that comes through beautifully in this album.  I always have a hard time picking \\"a favorite\\" song from his albums but if I have to....\\"You gonna fly\\"....well, maybe \\"Shut out the lights\\"...or maybe \\"Long Hot Summer\\".....ok so I can't pick just one.  It is DEFINITELY worth spending the extra few dollars to get the extended version.  Thank you once again for delivering a wonderful collection of songs!  Cannot wait to see him in concert again!!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I had my doubts that this album would live up to their previous great albums but this album way surpassed those albums 7/5.
1400031346|3.0|This series by Alexander McCall Smith were a selection for my book club and though I found this first book entertaining and unique, there is very little mystery involved. I enjoy complex, detective stories and this collection of vignettes tend to be simplistic and easy reading.      The main protagonist is the unusual Ms. Precious Ramotswe, a sized twenty-two, middle-age Botswanan lady, sans any detective experience, who starts her own detective No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency after receiving an inheritance following the death of her beloved father and getting free of a an awful marriage to a wastrel.  Precious has a sharp mind and the confidence and tenacity that a good detective needs and to triumph over preconceived notions and male chauvinism.      Smith has written a very charming, thought-provoking an African woman, the traditions, culture and citizens of Botswana, a landlocked nation in southern Africa. I loved the main character and the writing was uniquely charming and endearing.
1401309666|3.0|This is an idea that should have been kept to a white paper or an article. It is the same information chapter after chapter.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|the movie is the perfect guy movie, theres action and lots of humor, even in the serious moments there is humor, i would deffinatly recomend this movie to anyone
0817439390|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book!  I highly recommend it for beginners.  Bryan breaks down everything so it's easy to understand.  His personality really shines through in his writing, and it feels more like you're listening to a lecture than actually reading a book.  He relates fundamental photographic properties to every day situations so that they're easy to understand and easy to remember, without being cheesy.  This book is a must-have if you're just beginning photography, whether you're shooting digital or film.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I'd always been late to buying Kanye West's albums, but once I heard about this album several months back, I counted the days down and then jumped on Amazon's pre Black Friday deal this morning; this is definitely THE best dollar I've spent. A few of these songs were released as singles over the course of the last few months, but I only listened to a couple. I didn't care much for Power, and I began wondering if this album would even be close to 808s and Heartbreak, or more importantly to me, Graduation. While I won't rank it up there with Graduation,  I will say this album is great.
B003568FR6|5.0|I work out regularly (run outside, go to gym), but it's getting too cold to run, and I'm getting too busy to drive to the gym and back. So, I bought this! Level 1 made me sore the next day. I tried Levels 1 and 2 today (in preparation for Thanksgiving). I'm sure I'll be feeling this tomorrow, and that's the true sign of a good workout if you ask me!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this book was great. readers will fall in love with Katie. there is an unexpected twist at the very end. you have to read it!!!
B004BC7MRM|4.0|First off let me say I had no Kid Rock cds or mp3 before this album. I hate Rap Crap or Hip Hop and didn't like any of his previous work. But I found this was just the type of country or alt country sound I really like. I think he could do well with a new career in Alt country songs. Get together with Hank III for some tips and go for it. I basically liked almost every song, so if you're into Alt country I think these songs work very well. I'm a sucker for songs with a story and acoustic guitar work. Sometimes simple is better.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Many years ago John Lennon said that the most influential musician of his generation was Brian Wilson. This great collection is proof he may have been right.    \\"I Loves You, Porgy\\" is sensational.     There isn't a doubt in my mind that the Gershwins would love this clever take on some of their best work.
0061231401|5.0|I love the Sigma Force Novels!  It's an easy read but the way it's written brings you to other places and puts you right in the middle of the action.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I have been waiting for this CD for months and now its finally here. Like Graduation you can just put this CD on and just let it play straight to the end. Lyrically Kanye is still on point especially on Dark Fantasy and Gorgeous. I wouldn't say this is the best Kanye CD its about on par with Graduation, but I like all Kanye's albums even 808's and Heartbreak. Now just need to know when Jeezy's 103 comes out and I'll be straight.
B003O85W3A|5.0|This Album has received either total praise or complete hate. Honestly i think its Arcade Fire's best work. The Canadian band has brought a new take on classic rock by making it in their Indie Grandeur. Tracks such as the opener and sharing the Albums title track is a swooping, magical start to this amazing album. \\"Ready to start is an energetic is like a stick of dynamite building up to its end in great anticipation to a thunderous explosion.  \\"Modern Man\\" being one of the best songs of the album with butlers vocal providing a romantic vibe. but the best song on the album smut be \\"Sprawl II\\" A great Anthem masterpiece. The entire Cd has no weak points. Its worth a buy. and its worth the Grammy but knowing the modern music scene it won't and go to the next bubblegum Diva in line.
B003JA5MO2|4.0|First let me ask, why are there no vinyl reviews for the vinyl release?  I guess not many folks bought the (very expensive) 2 LP set, including myself.  I have been listening to this fantastic Cd for a few weeks now (even though I purchased it soon after it came out).  It ages like fine wine.  Sure there are no anthemic rokers like Refugee or American Girl, but the album is classic Petty in every way.  \\"No Reason To Cry\\" is as perfect and heartbreaking as any ballad Petty ever penned.  The Heartbreakers rock \\"I Should Have Known It\\" like a band committed and inspired to the heart of rock & roll.  The songs are all fantastic classic Petty, but the real revelation here is the way the band plays together, all held by the incredible glue of Mike Campbell.  This album like no other allows him to really stretch out and show why he's one of the greatest unsung sidemen in all of rock & roll.  The songs, instead of being super structured are loose rolling travelogues from road veterans telling their stories.    After hearing this well produced CD, I can only image how great the vinyl sounds.  I'm even tempted to repurchase it to have the 2 LP set.  The live feel is essential to the enjoyment of this album.  I also have a new found respect for the Steve Ferrone.  In the past I felt his drumming was'nt \\"signature\\" enough for the Heartbreakers, always seeming to play it a bit too safe for such a classic rocker.  He still does'nt stretch too far away from his timekeeping style, but he is absolutely in the pocket here with the Heartbreakers.      This is one of the most satisfying records of the year. I'd love to hear a review of the vinyl.  Don't any you vinyl geeks have this album?  Come forth.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|I heard \\"Give a little more\\", and rushed to buy this album. Actually I buy it as a birthday gift for someone else. I haven't listened to all the songs yet, but I will. There's only one thing I concern as a real \\"CD\\" -- its packaging. I figured out that the Deluxe Edition refers to its content, but I really felt disappointed that the packaging is so far from what I imagined... Doesn't a Deluxe Edition deserve a more delicate packaging? It's just what I thought. After all, as someone who won't own it, I may only focus on the songs (mp3)~ :)
B001GCUO5M|4.0|It came within three or four days. The cover was cracked slightly (but im pretty sure it's from delivery) Thank you!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Perfect first doll. Just the right size. This is my second Corolle doll. My 2 year old granddaughter loves this doll.
0375842209|4.0|It was a difficult book to get into but once I got past the first 30 pages or so I was hooked. It's a different take on World War II and what happened to the German people during ths time.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|This is one of the most anticipated CDs in a long time, and it did not disappoint. Kanye is at his best when either criticizing or praising himself. Such tracks as \\"Blame Game\\" \\"Runaway\\" \\"All of the Lights\\" and \\"Power\\" will undoubtedly go down as some of Mr. West's greatest tracks. Great CD and well worth the wait.
143911000X|5.0|Just like in the TV series, Barney captures the essence of \\"The Bro Code\\". Great companion for How I Met Your Mother.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job is a documentary written and directed by Charles Ferguson, narrated by Matt Damon and starring Ronald Reagan, Alan Greenspan, Bill Clinton, Henry Paulson, Robert Rubin, and many others whose obsession with deregulation and whose regulatory failures led to the banking crisis and worldwide recession that began in 2008 with the bankruptcy of Lehman and AIG and the collapse of GM and Chrysler.    The movie dissects the origin and development of the mortgage bubble, it's meltdown and the resulting world recession which resulted in 30 million people losing their jobs. Like Michael Moore's documentaries, Inside Job is composed of ambush interviews, news clips and comments most of the key players who declined to be interviewed and by critics of banking practices and regulatory failures beginning with the Reagan administration and continuing until the world wide economic crash which began at the end of the Bush administration in 2008.     The documentary takes viewers step by step through the developments, beginning with deregulation debacle in the savings and loan industry under Reagan and continuing through subsequent administrations including, importantly, the repeal under Bill Clinton of the Glass-Steagall Act which had required the separation of banking and riskier securities trading activities since 1933. The elements leading to the housing bubble and the financial meltdown were deregulation of the banking industry, securitization of the mortgage industry through the creation of mortgage derivatives, excessive bank leverage creating excessive risk and failure of the bond rating houses to accurately assess the risk brought about by securitization of subprime mortgages.    The movie is similar to several of Michael Moore's movies such as \\"Wall Street, A Love Affair.\\" Inside Job's lack of Moore's humor is more than made up by the detail and clarity which it provides about the dogmatic faith in unregulated markets, abuses, growth and influence of Wall Street banking behemoths and how they have captured government economic and regulatory policy, including the recent weak regulatory bills signed by Barack Obama.    However, one of the most compelling and damning portions of the documentary is its expose of how the financial industry pays economists at top universities and graduate business schools to write articles expressing their viewpoints without disclosing the payments they get for the \\"research\\" and serving as directors of the companies. Larry Summers, former Clinton Treasury Secretary, Harvard President and chief Obama economic adviser has made millions consulting for hedge funds. The Dean of the Columbia Business School, former Bush chief economist, R. Glenn Hubbard, and Reagan economist Martin Feldstein came across as arrogant and defensive when pressed by the interviewer about their ties to Wall Street and their role in the rush to de-regulation and tax cuts for the richest Americans. John Campbell, chairman of Harvard's economics department and Glen Hubbard were reduced by the interviewer's questions \\"to stammering obfuscation,\\" to borrow a phrase from A.O. Scott's N.Y. Times review of the documentary.    The most discouraging conclusion of the documentary is it's demonstration of how seamlessly the the baton was passed from the Wall Street insiders and fanatical Friedmanite free market economists to Treasury Secretaries and de-regulators in the Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush administrations. And many of the same true believer captives of Wall Street were appointed by President Obama, belying and undermining his eloquent vows to reform the financial industry.    To borrow another phrase from A.O. Scott's review , the movie is \\"about a crime without punishment\\" and with millions of victims.    [...]
B0000AI45P|5.0|I have rather mixed feelings reading the reviews. Some people say that you should buy this album because it was essential in the history of punk rock. Others tell you (though not many) that you should not buy this album because in 30 years it will not be remembered by many. Some people even tell you not to buy this album because it is not pure punk.  What a nonsense! I advise people to buy this album just because I think it is a extremely beautiful piece of work. The songs are very well written, the melodies are great but what I like most of all are the glorious guitar lines and solos. Don't buy an album because it is historically important or because it's unlike everything else. Or because it is pure punk. Buy it just becase YOU LIKE it. I'm sure that in 30 years this album still will mean a lot to me and I wouldn't care if nobody else would listen to it anymore or if it would not be historically important (though in my opinion in 30 years a lot of people will still think it's a masterpiece).

B003X2O6KW|5.0|Ten, twenty years from now. People will look back at this album and thank Kanye for making such a masterpiece. Whoever said Hip Hop is dead surely hasn't heard of Kanye West and Jay-Z. Now Watch the Throne is next. 2011 lets go there. The Roc is definitely in the building.
B001BOXJZW|5.0|There are a lot of good female vocalists, but only a few truly great ones.  These are women who I put in a league all their own:  Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin, Genya Ravan, Tracy Chapman, Joan Armatrading and now Dana Fuchs.  Her live vocals on this album are so evocative that I can almost taste the Stoli and smell the cigarette smoke drifting up from the tables.<br /><br />Particularly fine specimens are Baby Loves the Life, Misery and Strung Out.  Each one perfectly conveys the dissonance of a life that's been too long lived in the nightclubs, yet too drawn to the dark side to give it up for suburbia.  It is that fatal fondness for the edge that makes Dana Fuchs so appealing to those of us who share that attraction.  Those of a certain type -- and you know who you are -- will find themselves playing these songs over and over again, on into the night.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|This album is one that you will want to drive fast to. Although with many slow songs, they are all high energy and feel-good.

0783225792|3.0|Casino is based on the life and times of Las Vegas businessman and mob front man Frank \\" Lefty \\" Rosenthal and his wife Geri Mcgee and Rosenthal childhood pal Anthony \\" The Ant \\" Spilatro. This film was superbly cast but every time I see De Niro and Pesci together I feel like I am watching Goodfellas.  The story is I think an attempt by Rosenthal who died in 2008 to self promote himself and demonize his late X wife who died in 1982.  This is a very worthy mob film but the storyline is weak.

B0043ISH6O|4.0|I love that The Social Network's soundtrack is composed by Trent Reznor.  It lends yet another reason to see this movie, and if you were on the fence before then this soundtrack might push you over the edge.  Listening to the 19 atmospheric tracks on this album make you wonder how they'll figure in to this Facebook movie.  Kudos to Reznor for proving once again that he is one of the most talented musicians out there.  With help from Atticus Ross, he's crafted a fine film score.  Of course, with any soundtrack of this nature, not everyone's gonna get into it.  This is all instrumental and abstract...not something you can just pick up and listen to.  Fans of Nine Inch Nails' equally haunting instrumental Ghosts I-IV album will definitely appreciate The Social Network's score, as this is essentially a \\"Ghosts V\\".  Unlike the Ghosts album though, this soundtrack has a bit more flair and melody to it.  If you're in the mood for something like this though, you'll find plenty to be mesmerized with!  This goes double if you're listening through headphones.  The soundscapes are just filled with little nuances that swirl around your head as you listen.  And in true Reznor fashion, when it comes to the sonic experience, everything is perfectly balanced.  All this adds up to an expertly crafted album.  Definitely worth checking out!
1439152780|4.0|This is the first book by Kate Morton that I've had the pleasure of reading, and I wasn't disappointed. A thick literary mystery with layers of intrigue and clues to be discovered.<br /><br />Edie Burchill, a present day publisher, stumbles across a decades old mystery surrounding the decrepit and ancient Milderhurst Castle in the English countryside. Little does she know that the aged Blythe sisters who live there, twins Percey and Saffy, and their younger sister Juniper, are each hiding secrets from themselves and the village. When Edie discovers that her own mother spent some time at Milderhurst during the evacuation of children from London in World War II, she's bound by a sense of duty as well as her own curiosity to visit Milderhurst and learn more about the women who live there, and their father who wrote a famous children's story which Edie herself once adored.<br /><br />The Distant Hours is a good mystery, page after page pulls you in, and Morton deftly layers plot on plot, tying all the strings together at the end. There's more to the scene than just Milderhurst and the women who live there. There's the mystery of the two wives of their father, and how they each died. What happened to the man who was supposed to visit Juniper? Why won't Edie's mother talk about her time at the castle? Morton is a master at the multi-plot book. She leaves no loose ends.<br /><br />At times the plot lines did become predictable and plodding, however I still found myself pushing onward enjoying the heft and length of the book in hand. A satisfactory read, enjoyable; charmingly odd, like the Blythe sisters and their secrets.

Annie Lennox presents these songs in very stark and aggressive interpretations.  The arrangements are beautiful and her voice while strong, is still angelic.  What a wonderful and unique treat this album is.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|I've heard a lot of mixed reactions on this movie and I can totally understand why. The movie can evoke some pretty strong emotions surrounding the Vichy Regime and the persecution of French Jews if you take the movie too seriously.    But it's a strongly representing movie of Quentin Tarantino and his curiously violent and playful style. The movie plays like a really bad-ass comic book with phenomenally well-developed characters and truly amazing acting on all accounts (probably the best \\"bad-guy\\" acting I have ever seen by Christoph Waltz).    Bottom line: if you have a weak stomach for blood and violence, you should avoid this movie. If you can accept the violence and the dramatic spin on the real events of WW2, this movie is delightfully entertaining.

0316010669|5.0|This is a very interesting book. With his characteristic easy-going style the author examines the first two seconds of human observation. He refers to them as intuition or snap- judgments first and later as intuition. The book is well articulated as he explores different parts of this phenomenon through different chapters. He states that there is a sophisticated unconscious process that takes place whenever we are facing a situation in which we are required to take action.  This process is much faster than our conscious thought and rationalization process, he points out that this ability it is related with a particular area of the brain's frontal cortex located behind the nose. He points out experiments in which patients with brain damage were unable to choose between two sets of alternatives with their pros and cons detailed laid out by themselves.<br /><br />Gladwell also points out that there are many unconscious associations that are transmitted to us by our environment. Moreover, he asks the reader to engage on some exercises and test throughout the book in order to experience this and other assertions made by him.  One direct implication of the previous is that our unconscious process can be educated or trained. Another implication is that these implicit associations may bias our intuition which reveals that our intuition can also lead us to make mistakes. Still this doesn't mean that we must only use our conscious rational thinking process as the only way to solve problems as data can also fools us. Worse, having extensive data won't necessarily protect us as too much data can prevent us from seeing the forest because of the trees. Information or knowledge means nothing if there is not any understanding of what these information means.  Our \\"intuition\\" works with understanding, understanding requires a lot of preparation, education and experience, the alternative is just making random choices.<br /><br />Understanding translates into \\"good\\" judgment and \\"good\\" judgment into good decisions. In situation in which we are overwhelmed by information, variables and intricate consequences \\"intuition or judgment\\" is found by Gladwell to be better at making the call that our traditional conscious logic and verbal analysis, which ironically has proven far superior for making simple decisions.<br /><br />The book ends with a reflection and a call to action. Both methods of taking decisions have their strengths and weaknesses; there is no panacea but a need for balance between these two methods. Moreover the observations made on this book are here to stay, but now that we have this knowledge about the human decision process, how are we going to use this knowledge to overcome the current deficiencies that we as a society have when taking decisions.<br /><br />Along the book there is a Gladwell signature everywhere, the language is clear and direct, the message is relevant. Gladwell is not trying to construct a classical scientific theory, but to transmit his observations as directly and clearly as possible. In short , a fine reading.nto good decisions.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|Those folks giving this movie a 1-star review must hate their lives, because this movie makes no excuses for its over-the-top action and banter. It's got THE list of action heroes in ONE place! What more could you ask for? I guess people were looking for Shakespeare, or they don't understand what action movies are meant to be. Ignore the pretentious gasbags and have a good ride full of explosions, one-liners, and all the testosterone you can handle.    It's a mindless action flick... and that is a GOOD thing.
B0049VQZUA|5.0|I never can get enough of these \\"zombie\\" end of the world type movies. I happened to stumble across this show last evening after downloading and installing Boxee, a free internet program for your computer that helps you watch TV shows and movies online. Playing around with it I found \\"The Walking Dead\\" and since it was storming outside, I thought it was a good night to watch such a flick. The first episode was free from AMC's website, but I couldn't wait to see where it went. It definatly left me wanting more. Thanks to Amazon's on demand service, I then watched episodes 2-4 back to back to back with anticipation! I can't wait for episode 5! I don't watch enough TV to justify a cable or satellite bill, but when the weather is nasty, I love this on demand service.<br /><br />If you enjoyed movies Zombie movies like \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" or \\"28 Days Later\\", you'll love this TV series on AMC!

B0043KK4N6|1.0|First of all; yes...I listened to the whole soundtrack before it came out, I didn't buy it for I wouldn't waste money on garbage such as this, but I did listen to it.     This item should only be for the hardcore Christina Aguilera fans  It contains perhaps her most strained vocals of any album, her voice sounds truly damaged  She barks her way through most every song in a ghastly manner and gives the impression of her  vocal folds going through a meat grinder, it is an awful experience.   The only song where she truly sings is \\"A guy what takes his time\\" which seems to sit in her  comfort zone, not too high for her to start screaming and barking off key and not too low for her  voice to turn foggy and weak and unsupported.     Perhaps her fans enjoy that strained sound like she is struggling to just phonate, but as someone who listens to Whitney Houston (before crack), Mariah Carey (early 90's), Barbra, Judy, Linda Eder, Lara Fabian, Shirley Bassey, Linda Ronstadt, Mahalia Jackson, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin, etc...in other words, REAL SINGERS, I can't stand Christina's awful way of singing which makes the simplest middle belt appear to be impossibly difficult, that for me is the definition of a TERRIBLE singer.     The songs in general are rather mediocre, no standouts (unless you are a gay man with the campiest and worst taste in the world or a Christina fan, which are pretty much the same thing) and though Cher sings her songs quite well there's nothing memorable about it. Don't waste your time with this and go listen to some real music  and real singing instead, not the strained belching of Christina.

0142405809|5.0|I can't say enough about this book that hasn't already been said. At 5 stars it sells itself.  What I will add is that each time there has been an event or opportunity to share a book with other children besides my daughter, THIS is the book that is chosen.  The morals of the story, think big, take a chance, even a small creature has value, you can always do your part to help (sometimes in a VERY big way!)even if you are small, friendship, the beauty of the world...all wonderfully demonstrated in rhyming verse.  The pictures are wonderful as well and don't be surprised if you choke up and have to hold back tears at some points, it is that moving! I will also add that every time we have given this book as a gift it has become the child's new favorite book...and the parents as well.
B0034G4OUO|2.0|THIS DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br /><br />I've always wanted to like Dwayne Johnson as an actor. He was so entertaining when he was The Rock, why can't his movies be just as entertaining? Unfortunately his best received films are the more family oriented ones and watching an ex-wrestler who used to talk about his love for pie and \\"laying the smackdown on all your candy asses\\" seems a bit bittersweet. Films like Faster are what Johnson should be sticking to, but it doesn't live up to its potential and results in another flat action film.<br /><br />Wasted potential is the perfect way to describe Faster. Dwayne Johnson spends more time walking around looking pissed off than he does killing anyone or actually saying anything at all. Billy Bob Thornton doesn't do much of anything either as his character struggles between being a drug addict who doesn't amount to anything to a police officer who's about to retire and get full benefits who is also trying to get his family back together again. He spends most of his screen time drowning in his pathetic life. Then there's Dexter's Jennifer Carpenter who seems to be brought into the film to do nothing more than show up, cry a little, and say stupid things. Nothing the actors did really helped drive the story forward.<br /><br />The cinematography fluctuated between being interesting and being incredibly annoying. Right when something like the way the camera was placed while the driver was driving or something as simple as reloading a gun was done in a way that seemed original to catch your attention, the film would turn around and throw shaky camera techniques at you for no reason or the scenes that caught your eye would be too brief to really make up for the mediocrity of the rest of the film. The most interesting aspect lies within the final minutes and relates to the hired killer going after the driver. That concept alone that's about the length of a one minute conversation is better than Faster as a whole.<br /><br />Dwayne Johnson seems to have better luck with family films, but I think his fans would rather see him in R-rated action films since his physique and film presence fit that genre best. If he could find a film that was like Faster with a meatier role that gave him more lines and had better writing, it'd probably be a lot more satisfying. The kills in Faster should have been the highlight since the film revolved around the driver gaining revenge for his brother, but they fell short. Everything about Faster did. I was completely expecting Johnson to either turn himself over to the authorities or kill himself to be with his brother at the end of the film. The driver received the revenge he so desperately seeked and did it in a nonchalant, hot-shot vigilante kind of way to let everyone know it was him doing it. Yet police can't seem to keep up with him and he just kind of drives off into the sunset at the end. It felt like Faster was left open ended for nothing more than sequel purposes alone, which is the weakest form of a cop out for a movie ending. Coincidentally, a film called Faster managed to feel twice as long as its 98 minute duration.<br /><br />In the end, Faster contains elements from both Gone in Sixty Seconds and Taxi Driver, which should result in an excellent film. Instead we're left with an action film that uses these elements at face value; it contains the fast cars and intense chases of Gone in Sixty Seconds with the uneasy and unpredictable shootouts that are reminiscent of Taxi Driver but Faster lacks the depth, star power, enjoyment factor, strong cast, or lasting value these two films still have today. If you plan on seeing this film, you better be sure because that's a long dark road you're headed down (sorry, couldn't resist) and that road is nothing more than a pointless detour from greater things.k with family films, but I think his fans would rather see him in R-rated action films since his physique and film presence fit that genre best.

I just sampled some of the songs, sounds like Kanye to me, so I am happy, plus for $3.99, honestly, I have nothing to complain about.  If you are like me & enjoy all of his rap albums, but not the alternative one where he tries to sing then you may like this one.  I do...

0525951652|5.0|This is just a great read, personalizing the lives in four countries all drawn painfully into  pointless carnage. Follet does an amazing feat of depiecting how the social orders were changed forever in the UK, Germany, US and Russia. I was drawn to this book in part because my grandfathers were on different \\"sides\\" miuch like Walter and Fitz, and like those characters fundamentally against the war yet forced to play a part in it -- their recollections were very much like those Follet brings to life--the chaos in Russia, the horrible loss of life, the whole social structure changing. President Wilson is off his pedestal and much more as I beieve he was -- although no mention was made of his role in imprisoning and forcefeeding suffregettes, his bigotry is evident.    I can't wait for the rest of the series.

0123694965|5.0|This book goes above and beyond what you might expect from the title.  The advice is practical, not obvious, and inspiring.  I bought the book expecting that it'd be loaded down with obvious ideas, and fluff, but I figured if it had a couple of gem ideas in there it'd be worth the price of admission.  Boy, was I surprised and blown away!  The material is very practical.  If I had to go out and sell one book, this would be the one I'd pick.  That's because it's so easy to love the ideas in here.  And they're applicable to all kinds of things, not just game design.    Literally every time I open this book, I end up jotting down 5 awesome ideas every few pages.  I could only read a few pages at a time because I would end up getting sidetracked with the new mind-altering possibilities and thoughts it has inspired.    I can't imagine how someone could be disappointed with this book.
B0000025VI|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan was the greatest blues guitarist of his era, and his debut album may be his very best.  He hits us right out of the gate with \\"Love Struck\\", a rock'n'roll tune worthy of Chuck Berry, his voice tinged with whiskey and his guitar playing a breathtaking mix of flash and liquidity.  \\"Pride and Joy\\" is a bluesy rocker after the style of B.B. King.  \\"Texas Flood\\" is dynamite slow blues, while \\"Tell Me\\" is great medium-tempo blues, and \\"Testify\\" and \\"Rude Mood\\" are a little faster.  \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" is an amusing take on mid-tempo blues, and while the lyrics aren't emotionally overpowering, the reappearance of SRV's voice after a couple of instrumentals really makes this track click.  \\"Dirty Pool\\" is another stupendous slow blues.  \\"I'm Cryin'\\" is perhaps my least favorite, because it sounds a little too much like \\"Pride and Joy\\".  But \\"Lenny\\" is a truly lovely instrumental for guitar: heartfelt, but delicate - a real departure, and a perfect coda for this album.  Nobody ever played the blues better.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|Where to start?  I've only been into the band for about 3 years, although I own every album and I like them all, some more than others....I give this album more of a 3.5 Stars (7/10)<br /><br />The first thing that hit most of the general public straight in the ears would have been a scatter of Come Around Sundown's singles; if I'm not mistaken, 'Radioactive' and 'Pyro'.  The singles are decent songs, very accessible, catchy and well written (classic new age Kings).  However, this obviously again wasn't enough to please old-time fans of the band.  This is of course totally understandable, but the singles are just not enough to initially judge the album.  You could pick any song off the album and throw it on a high ratings radio station and it would hold it's own.  The point being.....I wish there was no singles to ruin the fun!  From the atmospheric and melancholic dare I say \\"stadium rock\\" sound of 'The End' to the very fun, rhythmically driven 'Pony Up', there is plenty of gems for the masses to enjoy.  Sadly, most of the fans have turned their backs on principal because the band over five albums has changed their style since 'Youth And Young Manhood'...............I mean come on!!!!  If CAS was an overrated, awful album, go ahead, curse it, but it isn't.<br /><br />Avoid the radio, buy the album,  see if you like it and like it for what it is.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|A wonderful movie in every way--dramatic (even if you already know the big result), beautiful, and funny.   It's great to see John Malkevich in a role that lets him be funny in addition to everything else.  And the relationship of mother and daughter is beautifully told.  Worth owning.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|This monopoly game is great.  My brother and I have been long time players of Nintendo and Monopoly.  This just rounds out our collection of Monopoly games beautifully.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|\\"Hachi-A Dog's Tale\\" was one of the most profoundly moving films I have ever seen.  I can't begin to recommend it enough to anyone who loves or has ever loved a dog.  The story will stay with you for a long time and without revealing any spoilers, I guarantee you will find yourself shedding many tears throughout the last 1/2 hour or so of the film.  An absolutely wonderful movie experience.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|For a surpise, I bought this for my husband who loves Annie Lennox as much as I do.  But...I was ripping the cd open on my way out to the car.  I blasted it (kids at school!) to hear Annie's incredible voice.  She's gifted with the amazing range to pull off the difficult songs that she's chosen.  Beautiful, soulful and harmonic.  A must buy for Annie Lennox/Eurythmics fans.  Now, can I get the shrink wrap back on for my husband?  :)
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|Kanye has stated that he wants to be the new King of Pop, and \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" sounds like an obvious claim for this title. His legion of loyal followers are of course claiming it to be a masterpiece. But what about those of us who aren't yet convinced of his genius?<br /><br />Here's my take, from someone who likes hip hop, but admittedly thinks Kanye has always been overrated.<br />More than anything, this album sounds Big. Reminiscent of the production from his first three albums (heavy on samples, especially 70's soul), but piling on the grandiosity with dense soundscapes of strings, choirs and whatever else he can cram into your speakers.<br /><br />To me, this is like the rap equivalent of big budget arena rock. Think Queen, ELO, Styx, and Yes. Think \\"Use Your Illusion\\" by Guns N' Roses. The kind of music that wants its listeners to bow down and worship its creator.<br /><br />Hey, sometimes that kind of stuff has its place. Queen has a slew of great singles under their belt, and \\"Twisted Fantasy\\" has some nice moments as well, like \\"All of the Lights,\\" and the low-key \\"Lost in the World.\\" But, mostly, this reaching-for-the-stars bombast is exhausting. Less is often more, you know. For instance, proto-rapping legend Gil Scott-Heron, sampled extensively here, did his most brilliant work with only some drums, a flute, and his electrifying words.<br /><br />How do Kanye's words fare, by the way? Well, I've always maintained that folks who paint him as a lyrical genius have been selectively ignoring some really embarrassing lines, like \\"Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA/ Like Martin with no Gina.\\" If anything, he's inconsistent, and this album's lyrics are no exception. For every clever line (\\"What's a black Beatle anyway, a f***in roach?\\") there's something like \\"Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your Winslow,\\" a pun that would ruin any rookie MC's career.<br /><br />If Kanye wants to be the King of Pop like Michael was, he should know that this one ain't his Thriller. With Thriller, MJ made sounds that were risky and innovative, yet appealed to countless demographics. It was effortless in its appeal; anyone with eyes and ears was welcome to enjoy it. In contrast, \\"Twisted Fantasy\\" is an album that shouts for your attention, and demands your concentration, not to mention your sympathy for the trials of our poor Important Superstar. It's closer to Michael's later album \\"His Story,\\" which was an overwrought pop package designed to profit from a pre-established assumption of the Artist's Greatness. That album was a little much, but at least it came well after MJ had earned his title as King.<br /><br />To Kanye, I recommend that he scale back his ambitions a bit, stop trying to be The Biggest Man in the World, and just try to make music that is authentically expressive of emotions felt by us regular people. Your faithful followers will worship you no matter what you put out, so you may as well try something new to get the rest of us into your camp.<br /><br />To Kanye fans, what I say means little to you, I'm sure. These are just my humble opinions, and you're welcome to ignore them.<br /><br />But to people who are similarly disappointed with this album and all the hype surrounding Kanye, definitely check out Big Boi's \\"Sir Lucious Left Foot\\" for a taste of Ambition done right. Not to mention Janelle Monae's \\"ArchAndroid,\\" which does require some patience to get into, but more than pays off with intelligence and emotional depth that reflects a concern for a world far beyond Kanye's isolated bubble of experience. These are my nominees for King (or Queen) of Pop.<br /><br />But what's a black Beatle anyway? As Janelle and Big Boi demonstrate, it's someone who makes challenging ideas seem simple and appealing.<br /><br />Kanye? Maybe he's the black Axl Rose...<br /><br />**Update** It's been almost two years now. How does the album hold up? Perhaps I'm a little more welcoming, because no one is shovingit in my face as a MASTERPIECE anymore. But still, this thing's by no means perfect. Overall, it's a bit top-heavy: the best cuts are stacked at the beginning, and at some point (\\"Devil in a Blue Dress\\") it really starts to drag. We all know Ye's got some talent, but he really needs to develop a more critical editing ear, rather than follow his every impulse. Hopefully some day he'll be as great as he thinks he is.it in my face as a MASTERPIECE anymore. But still, this thing's by no means perfect.

B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I purchased this Movie as a gift for my Mother-in-law, and it came in plenty of time for her birthday. Very pleased with the turn around time. Thanks
B00008WT49|4.0|Seems to be a very fine CD, don't know that I can really tell the difference between the SACD version and the original CD, but have only listened to twice, still will do a detailed listen soon.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|5 for 5. It is damn hard for any artist to start off as strong as Kanye did. College Dropout and Late Registration are two of the best rap albums of the last 10 years. The man is a producing genius. Taking sample from Bon Iver and King Crimson to help elevate this album to a level not seen in years. He absolutely kills it on every track, not one mediocre song, everything complements each other perfectly. I highly recommended this album to fans of Hip hop and even those not so much a fan of the rap game.     Top 5 tracks -     Power  Lost in the World  Monster  So appalled  All of the Lights
B00008CLOA|1.0|I was looking forward to this Disk so much as I just purchased a hi quality SACD player.  Honestly, it is a poor SACD, very muddy in the drums and background.  I thought I was imagining things until I talked to other owners of this SACD version of DSoTM, and they said the same thing.  Looking forward to buying a hi quality vinyl disk in the future. I hear it is excellent.  My recommendation would be to avoid this SACD version of DSoTM.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|While Iron Man 2 is not the best superhero movie and is not up to par with either of the recent Batman movies, it still holds its own.  This movie is more focused on Tony Stark the man instead of just an action packed movie where the character fight just to fight.  If you watch this movie as a prelude to the next Iron Man or upcoming Avengers movie and not watch it just looking for nonstop action, you will enjoy it.
B003X2O6KW|3.0|From reading the first page of reviews, I am rather convinced that somehow someone involved in the production of this album paid for the first few reviews to be posted. This album, to me, was not a step outside of anything we have heard from Kanye West, infact i'll even go as far as to say \\"we have heard better\\". This album was a mash up of the songs Kanye already debuted on \\"RunAway\\" and his over zealous trash talking interviews. If you enjoy THAT side of Kanye you will enjoy this album, but if you enjoyed the Kanye who you were proud to see make it out of the hoods of Chicago and tell his story of drive, the beauty of a young black man in search of better meaning, and who maybe cared more about others than talking about what people think of him, or not, then you will be somewhat dissapointed. Personally I do not think this album is genius by any stretch of the dark twisted imagination, and it sounds like the same stuff we've heard from west going all the way back to jesus walks. His lyrical skills have not grown, his musical ear has not grown, and its pretty much the same album from long ago.... with ALOT LESS  humility.
B001LQCID4|1.0|Well, I was compiling a collection of my 25 favorite films, and this is on it. Prior to my purchase, I read reviews on this, but they seemed positive.Forget that! The version is poor , choppy, and most dissapointing(I've seen this film before) on a 55\\" screen, the film is in a box that uses only half the screen andd cuts out subtitles, dialogue, even implortant parts of the pictures. I will get another copy, BUT DO NOT GET THIS ONE! Pay a little more, and get a decent copy
0380730367|4.0|Just as [[ASIN:0061998869 Sacred]] offered a break after the tension of [[ASIN:0061998850 Darkness, Take My Hand]], Prayers for Rain is a lighter, more plot-driven and less intense ride after the emotional devastation of [[ASIN:0061336211 Gone, Baby, Gone]]. When a former client ends up taking a suicide dive after her life falls apart over the course of six months, Kenzie and Gennaro end up digging into the case and coming to find that someone may have helped that collapse along. What follows is a great little psychological thriller, as Kenzie and Gennaro end up in the crosshairs of a warped stalker and attempt to turn the tables on him. This one isn't as heavy or gut-wrenching as the best books in the series, but it's still a great thriller, and it's fun to see Lehane getting to cut loose and go a little over the top for a bit. Add to that the fact that Bubba gets more face time than any of the other books, and you've got a great and fun entry in the series. No, it may not rank among the best, but it's still a blast of a thriller that features a great villain and a fantastic second half, as our heroes get a chance to do what they do best.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|One of the single worst movies I've ever tried to watch. I couldn't make it thru, yes it was that horrible.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|Stargate SG-1: The Complete Second Season:  This was one of the seasons I missed. And watching it for the first time was a real joy.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|In the cosmology of Woody Allan films this comes in between average and not quite good.  The story centers around three women actress Scarlet Johansson, Penelope Cruz and some tall rangy broad whose name escapes me.  The tall rangy broad is a sort of pale Keaton character with the same delivery and lines that might've been recycled from Annie Hall. Penelope is an angst ridden loca whose outbursts and violence are right out one of her Aldomavar films. While Scarlet is a angst ridden blond who has cruised through life on her good looks. Javier Bardem plays an artist whose ex-wife is Penelope and in the course of the movie bangs all three of women (nice work if you can get it).  The comedic complications derive from the tall rangy broad being engaged/married to someone else and Scarlet, Penelope and Javier forming a short term m&eacute;nage a tois with titillating girl on girl action.  The whole picture has that sort of that disillusioned malaise texture and vague inconclusive ending that one associates with Bergman's movies about the Swedish middle class.  Consider this movie a secondary option.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|The product arrived in a quick manner and was of great quality.  I would certainly buy from this seller again.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!!It was a birthday present for my adult daughter- and that's all she could say when I asked her to review it! Great price too!!!
0743527305|5.0|I bought it on CD as I travel a lot.  Had to listen to it twice.  There was so much to grasp.    A great book
B0044XV3QY|3.0|Avatar is an impressive looking film with an overly simple story that makes us feel we've been here before. This is a strange feeling to get from a film that looks like nothing we've ever seen before. The story is basically 'Dances with Wolves' ala sci-fi with a little mix of our own American history thrown in with our treatment of the American Indian. The film is better than I expected and it's certainly worth seeing... especially in HD! WOW! The characters look fairly believable, but none have any real depth, so caring for these creatures is pretty nonexistent.<br /><br />The story is very predictable and I was telling my wife exactly what was going to happen after the first 15 minutes or so. Send in someone to gain their trust and then stab them in the back for accepting them!.....Blah blah blah! It's all been done before and I'm surprised that Cameron didn't develop a better script considering the amount of work that went it to the visual aspect of this film.<br /><br />If you're a sci-fi fan, prepare for an amazing looking film with a very unsatisfying story. If you're looking for deeper dramas, then this one could be a little light for you.
0143118420|3.0|Read this for a book club (selected by another).  I enjoyed her writing.  Made me laugh at times ('cross between a barnacle and retriever') and not believe at other times.  Characters and story enjoyable but not memorable for me.
4789007758|5.0|If you can only have a few books to learn the Japanese language then this would definitely be one of them. I Highly recommend this book and its beginner and advanced versions.
0142403873|5.0|I bought this for my nephew who lives several states away from me. My sister said he loves it and makes her read it to him at night. Great book for kids.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|This album is too layered, too processed sounding, too compressed, etc. The producer needs to go. Bring back the famed producer of Rush's earlier work Terry Brown. His albums had a clean crisp sound with instrumental separation and a great flow. This is one loud mush of sound. Bad stuff. Forget the writing, it may be good, you can't tell the production is so overblown. Digital ear splitting garbage.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|This CD is truly a top notch Doobie's \\"album\\" not to be left out of any collection.  The documentary of the Doobies on the DVD is worth the price alone.  The songs are very reminiscent of early Doobies.<br />Fantastic CD - my advice - get it!!
B0046MVVOW|5.0|I was excited to buy this CD because I absolutely loved Ke$ha.<br />When I bought this CD, I expected that it'd have the F-bombs, since<br />there isn't an explicit version or edited (clean) version.<br />Once I recieved the CD, I opened it up and listened to it noticing<br />censorship on every F-bomb. Then on the cannibal cd, they censored<br />out SH-T, even though they play it uncensored on Ke$ha's web site.<br />Other than that, the CD is good. I love ke$ha, so this censored cd<br />won't harm me that much - i'll just get used to it...
0061537969|5.0|Excellent book.  Also read Stein's other books that were also excellent.  Can't wait until the movie for this book comes out with Patrick Dempsey as the race car driver.
B002MJV75O|4.0|I ordered this on Oct. 20 and didn't get it until about mid November. Thankfully, the product was much nicer than I expected and was, ultimately, worth the wait.
030745455X|4.0|Stieg Larsson is a good author.  It is most unfortunate that he only wrote the 3 books.  I good story that leaves you wondering until the end. Good character development and story line.
0312600844|5.0|I am surprised at how few people got into this book. If your looking for a page-turner this isn't that.I'd say it meanders with humorous and pointed commentary on modern life. I was completely ensconced in these characters lives. I was sad for it to end but can happily say it was a satisfying one. It actually made me feel good about marriage, that there was recognition of the bonds that tie you together are built on a history that includes both the good and the bad. Contrary to what some of the reviewers felt I thought Franzen truly loved these characters, their imperfections made them seem real to me. This is a wonderful modern novel that gently teases the liberal affectations of certain types you may well know. I certainly do.
B00308YN2U|5.0|I believe I have this exact DVD, but with a slip cover and the movie photo is of Harry and the Headmaster in the boat while crossing to the lake island inside.  the slip cover is 3-D.  I found this to be an awesome movie with nice extras and really can't believe any negative reviews.  it seems very true to the book considering the time allowed for a movie.  if the next 2 DH movies are as good as this movie, I will be very satisfied as well, but I expect them to be better.  ALSO, FOR ANYONE THAT HAS NOT READ HP BOOKS BUT HAVE SEEN THE MOVIES, the last book, DH, is the best and to me it is an adult related book as oppose to childrens book by far !!!  I strongly suggest any HP fan that has seen all movies up to date, yet not ready any books, to read this last book.  the movie can't contain all the information in the book, and it will explain so very much as did the previous books.  again, it seems to be an adult book, but fine for healthy minded children, and the earlier books did seem to be more suited for a younger crowd, but this last book could be an adult classic for centuries !!!  thank you, Leslie (lesorgemusic)
0316098337|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I found it a total disappointment. My sister listened to the CD version and raved about the person who does the boy's voice, so I chose the CD over print. I found the book lacking in all the ways others who rated it one star did, and let me tell you, listening to all those flaws is worse than reading them. If the CD did not belong to the library, I'm sure I would have cracked it in half.     The 5-year-old sounds like he's mentally disabled due to his awkward sentence structure - or maybe like he was raised by wolves the first half of his life and is only now learning the language. The syntax reminded me of the way TV shows from the 1950s made Native Americans sound. Yet the boy can use very mature words now and then and has even learned to square numbers. Yes, he counts on his fingers to do it, but what kid this age can understand the concept of square feet? That he leaves \\"the\\" out of his sentences all the time really got annoying in short order. His mother comes off as extremely intelligent and she seems to be teaching him everything she can - except grammar. The reader for the mother's dialogue makes her sound like a voiceover model for a luxury car commercial, but I still found myself loving it when she spoke because it shut the boy up for a while.     Telling a story like this from the point of view of a 5-year-old is a huge challenge and the author failed miserably. When someone cannot make it through the first chapter of a book on CD - which allows doing housework or knitting or driving at the same time - it's not a good sign.     I'd like to thank the reviewers who wrote the plot out in their *Spoiler Alert* comments. I got the gist of the story in five minutes and knew my decision to give up on it so early was a wise one. Saved me hours of time.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This movie is exceptionally good to me because the actors ad libbed much of the movie. Because of that, it comes across as very natural and unscripted. The concepts explored give one lots to ponder on and the scenery and setting are amazing.
B0040Y7EU6|5.0|First, the sonics. It does seem a bit undernourished in terms of dynamic range, but if you do what I did, and jack up the volume, (about 5db over normal, in this case and using dts) you won't be too disappointed. I have the old Ozawa version in a presumably chinese pressing, which I got on e-bay. Its sonics are pretty grim on my copy, and the picture is lousy. But Kathleen Battle is marvellous. I've never been a big Ozawa fan - I just never thought  he had anything new to say. I have a few other later Simon Rattle/BPO dvds, and most don't have any sonic deficiencies.    The visuals are well done, with everybody getting a chance in the spotlight. Picture quality is good, if not up to the very latest standards(this is a 2004 recording).     As to Carmina Burana, it's a good rollicking piece - one great tune after another for an hour or so, orchestration very unsophisticated and brash, lots of percussion, and a whole lot of fun! The choirs are uniformly good, as are the soloists, but I give special kudos to baritone Christian Gerhaher, who really interprets his various solos. Great vocal gymnastics and facial expressions (and excellent falsetto!). Rattle handles the piece at a consistent level of excitement, and his is a performance that will stand up to the original Eugen Jochum recording from 1967.    The Leonora overture is well done, and the overblown version of the Handel Messiah chorus is OK for what it is.    I am finding with more and more of these releases, where reviews are luke-warm or worse, sound issues are generally improved by using proper surround sound decoding. I like dts over dolby digital. Even though my receiver will generate five channels out of the PCM stereo track, it always seems flatter and less involving than the dts track.    Overall, this is a disc worth getting, whether you're an existing Orff fan, or not.
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|SMH at the review that put this album in the same shelf as Nas' \\"Illmatic\\" and Tribes \\"Low End Theory\\"    There's no denying this is a great artistic record from a man who clearly has genius marred by a healthy dose of narcissism. It's a great pop record, but a hip hop classic?    I'm sorry, but I'm not buying it. I stopped listening to Kanye West records after his 3rd LP. Hip Hop to me is about swagger, and dope beats. It doesn't have to be gangster. But 808 and Heartbreaks was the beginning of the unfortunate genre of emo rap, and this record follows in that vein. An artist has to grow, and follow his or her artistic vision, Kanye West has definitely done that. But for those folks who are making this out to be some great comeback for real hip hop, no way.     Is it a grandiose breath of fresh air from mediocre rap records from the past several years? Most definitely. But a hip hop classic this isn't.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|One of those cd's I keep playing since I got it.I have been with Kid Rock from the beginning and love the different styles and changes he has experimented with.I'm sure he has found his calling now.Country,country rock,whatever you want to call it.I am into many genres music and accept and support his style.He has teamed up with Sheryl Crow,Martina McBride,T.I.,Zac Brown and even Bob Seger playing piano on Collide.It may not be for those fans who are not into an artist changing their style or growing.What I always say,you don't like,don't buy it or listen to it...I love it and hope those who enjoy different styles of music will to...From beginning to end there are your rockers and ballads...Get it now if you are one of changes...
1400032717|3.0|Adventurous and inspiring, one autistic child's struggle to find the murderer of his neighbor's dog and his experiences along the way is one of our century's most acclaimed novels, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. This novel, by Mark Haddon, is not only a national bestseller, but a Whitbread Book of the Year. Christopher Boone's autism makes for one of the most individual works ever written. His fierce hate of the color yellow and physical contact are just a couple of his interesting quirks, but it also makes for a very misunderstood boy to the outside world. The outsiders' feelings of misunderstanding can sometimes quickly turn to incredulity or fear. This is also in part to the fact that Christopher does not comprehend any emotions other than happy, sad, or angry. He cannot lie and he cannot trust those who have lied. So when his father makes this tragic mistake, Christopher must leave his home because his father cannot be trusted. He and his pet rat, Toby, will begin and journey unlike any other. This leads him on an amazingly troublesome train ride to London from his quaint town of Swinden. Christopher's only thoughts are of survival and to survive, he must evade his father's clutches. He will do just about anything to get away from him. Christopher would even escape a cop, but only because the cop meant to take him back to his father. His journey, though one full of fear, is also one of enlightenment for both his father and himself. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is truly great. It's so great in fact that no one should be surprised when it becomes a classic that our grandchildren's grandchildren will be reading in school many, many years from now.
B0043URV8M|5.0|I have to counteract some of the last reviews which have trashed this soundtrack. I am a faithful follower of Harry Potter and like all the soundtracks- some more than others. Although I am fond of John William's soundtracks, especially Prizoner of Azkaban, I am sick and tired of people bashing the latter soundtracks.     Now that I've listened to Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack several times, it has ascended to one of my favorite of the series. Yes, it may be quieter, and more subtle than the other soundtracks, but it actually has some tonal and instrumental similarities with the William's soundtracks that make this soundtrack sound more Harry Potter than arguably the last soundtrack or the Goblet of Fire soundtrack. This soundtrack has really grown on me and has a lot of standouts that I think in time, people will become very fond of rather than just dismissing it as garbage not created by John Williams.      Pay particular attention to:    -Oblivation (a powerful theme to rival Hedwig's Theme)  -Snape to Malfoy Manor  -Polyjuice Potion (a magical number that sounds very \\"Harry Potter\\")  -Harry and Ginny  -The Will (particularly the beginning)  -The Ministry of Magic  -Detonators (another classic number)  -Destroying the Locket  -Ron's Speech (very pretty)  -Lovegood (best song on the entire soundtrack; very magical, yet unconventional)  -The Deathly Hallows (eerily dark but great)  -Farewell to Dobby    Don't listen to all the crap reviews here. Trust me, this soundtrack will stand the test of time and I guarantee that those that have given this album one or two stars will rethink it in the future. While I was also in the camp hoping for John William's to come back, I am excited about Alexandre Desplat doing the last movie!
B00386EZJU|5.0|I am typically not someone who buys movie soundtracks, however every now and then I see a movie which really connects with me (both visually and musically) and \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\" is one of those films. This is my favorite movie soundtrack that I have purchased since the soundtrack to [[ASIN:B000002P1A Dragonheart]] (which features the magnificent \\"To The Stars\\" score which is, unfortunately, not known to many people except from several movie trailers such as \\"Mulan\\" and many others...that link is for the tape since the cd version oddly has no sound clips but just search for \\"Dragonheart\\" in Music for the cd).<br /><br />Anyways, onto this soundtrack. It has quite a lot to offer from the movie. There are a few pieces of music which are missing (such as the music played right as Stoick learns of the dragon nest from Hiccup and steps outside and nearly loses his composure, as well as the music that plays right as Hiccup wanders into the lagoon for the first time with the fish as the dragon creeps down behind him). Everything else (to my knowledge) is included.<br /><br />The main themes you will want from this soundtrack are \\"Forbidden Friendship\\", \\"Test Drive\\" and \\"Romantic Flight\\". \\"Forbidden Friendship\\" is the adorable yet beautiful theme that plays as Hiccup begins bonding with the dragon and they learn to trust each other. Particularly stunning is the epic buildup to the section that plays as Hiccup is wandering through the maze-like lines to reach the dragon, which (to me) foreshadows that Hiccup will not have a straight, easy path to reaching and be-friending the dragon (and having it be accepted).<br /><br />\\"Test Drive\\" is the epic bagpipe influenced piece that plays as Hiccup takes Toothless out on his first major flight with Toothless after fixing his tail. The music is exciting and builds up to wonderful chill-inducing \\"hook\\" that plays as they dive straight toward the ocean in a breath-taking scene that couldn't have been more amazing even in live action.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Romantic Flight\\" is the beautiful (but short) theme that plays as Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless soar through the dusk/night skies over the ocean once Toothless has accepted Astrid's apology and learned that she is not a threat. The build-up to this theme is beautiful as they fly through and obove the clouds with the northern lights brilliantly shining in the background. My mom in particular loves this track (and \\"Forbidden Friendship) even though she (sadly) hated the movie (she felt Toothless looked far too \\"evil\\"...good grief!).<br /><br />The other tracks on this soundtrack are also great, as this cd can be listened straight through without any skipped tracks. I also love the epic intro to \\"Dragon Training\\" as this cd lets you hear the almost brooding theme that Gobber talks over in the movie (:30-:50) which sounds straight out of the \\"Dragonheart\\" or even \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" movies.<br /><br />Overall, if you love epic, beautiful movie scores, I would strongly recommend both the soundtracks to \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\" as well as the aforementioned \\"Dragonheart\\" (composed by Randy Edelman). You can not go wrong with either.action.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Romantic Flight\\" is the beautiful (but short) theme that plays as Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless soar through the dusk/night skies over the ocean once Toothless has accepted Astrid's apology and learned that she is not a threat.

I also love the epic intro to \\"Dragon Training\\" as this cd lets you hear the almost brooding theme that Gobber talks over in the movie (:30-:50) which sounds straight out of the \\"Dragonheart\\" or even \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" movies.<br /><br />Overall, if you love epic, beautiful movie scores, I would strongly recommend both the soundtracks to \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\" as well as the aforementioned \\"Dragonheart\\" (composed by Randy Edelman). You can not go wrong with either.
B0043URV8M|2.0|I remember listening to the Half-Blood Prince before watching the film and being unimpressed at first. However, watching the film completely changed my opinion and resulted in some parts of the score becoming among my favourites in the entire series. I hoped that this could be the the case once more Deathly Hallows: Part 1, however I was mistaken. This score simply doesn't sound like a Harry Potter score to me. Although Hooper's scores tended to be somewhat minimalist at times, they always sounded like Harry Potter soundtracks to me. I was especially disappointed about the lack of Hedwig's Theme as Desplat had said that he believed it hadn't been featured sufficiently in the last few films. I know the theme does make a few very brief appearances, but unfortunately these are easy to miss and we are never given a true statement of the theme. Hedwig's theme appears to be the only homage to any of the previous scores and they are not even replaced - brief moments, e.g., in Snape To Malfoy Manor appear to be building up to something but ultimately left me unsatisfied. Although I can understand the fact that the films have been growing steadily darker as the story progresses, I don't believe that this a legitimate reason for the signature themes of the previous scores to be ignored. For example, Howard Shore did not decide to abandon the main themes in the Lord Of The Rings just because the characters' situation was growing darker. Even in the darkest moments, the Shire themes can be heard, albeit matured versions and although I can understand the fact that the music is going to subtler as much of the fanfare-style music of the earlier films would be out of place, I don't think that it should reach the point of being unmemorable - I literally find it difficult to remember most of the tracks on the C.D., having listened to it multiple times. Overall, I don't believe that it is a terrible score, however, as I mentioned it just doesn't sound very \\"Potterish\\" and I have gotten the impression that some of the music could have been written for just about any run-of-the-mill soundtrack. It just doesn't send the same chill down my spine as the previous scores did. While Hooper and Doyle might not have made much use of the majority of John Williams signature themes, the music always felt like it belonged to the films. I almost think that some of James Hannigan's scores for the video games were superior to this. I will certainly still listen to this soundtrack, but is such a pity that the first part of the end of the series had to be so low-key and underwhelming. I'm almost dreading a Harry Potter score for the first time, but maybe he can redeem himself with Part 2, as perhaps he will choose to go back to the \\"basics\\" to bring the scores full circle.n the impression that some of the music could have been written for just about any run-of-the-mill soundtrack.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|I didn't know what to expect on Shutter Island, the movie's title is sort of off-putting and I thought it was going to be a relitively cheesey pocorn movie.  Then I realize it's directed by Martin Scorsese at the last minute and I enjoy most of his films.  If Shutter Island were directed by anyone else, it potentially could have went into another realm and direction and collapse from within.  I loved Leo Di Caprio in The Aviator and Titanic so he's gained my approval as a decent actor who really commits himself into the roles he's playing.  I was a bit apprehensive when I first heard the east coast accent he devolped for this role and I thought to myself, \\"am I going to have to listen to this crap all night?\\"  But then it seamlessly blends into his character and it just becomes him, which is quite impressive.  There is also something attractive about him that I can't quite put my finger on.  There's this subtle sexual undertone thing going on with him and I don't know if it's because I'm sexually atracted to him or if it's just because he's aging well and looks more handsome now.  This has nothing to do with the movie but it can influence your oppinions about his acting and the film itself.  Actually that's not true because I think Russel Crow is hot but I hate all of his movies, he's a crap actor. Never mind, I'm sorry.  I'm off on a strange tangent.  I enjoyed the intersting story in Shutter Island and it does throw you for a loop at the end when u find out that Leo is actually a patient at the facility.  It's sort of in the same vein as the ending in Nicole Kidman's \\"The Others\\" (another great movie).  It's very Twilight Zone-ish and creeps you out.  Shutter Island is the first movie I've seen this year that's actually entertained me.  Good movies are hard to find these days, just like men.  I wonder if Leo Di Caprio's single?  Hmmm......
B000OSF33W|5.0|This one tugs the heart strings! Be warned! One of the best episodes for the season because just as Sammie starts to love again, it is doomed because the girl he likes is a werewolf.. The relationship between the brothers is also shown as Dean proves to share Sam's pain and it seems like he would wish it away if he could. The title \\"heart\\" could not be more perfect.

1594202559|5.0|This is the magnum opus on the hedge fund industry. As other hedge fund related books seek to either vilify the industry or brazenly praise the uncanny good fortunes industry insiders - this book does neither - which I found refreshing and a strategic positioning of this work from \\"the rest.\\"<br /><br />Sebastian Mallaby is currently the Paul Volcker Senior Fellow for International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. He's also a columnist at the WA Post and spent over a decade with The Economist responsible for international finance coverage - serving a bureau chief in Washington, Japan and southern Africa. He is the author of several noteworthy books on the political economy.<br /><br />This work is an epic contribution to the historical evolution of certain financial products and the global industry(s) spawned therefrom in primarily, the western world. Welcome to the hedge fund industry, including an amazing cast of characters, their thought processes, training, relationships and the outcome of their work - The Making of A New Elite - with More Money Than God.<br /><br />Admittedly, it is rare for me to dedicate myself to the reading of 400+ pages contained in any one volume, on any subject. Yet, the manner in which this book develops contains the unique qualities that inflame the desire within reader to come back for more. Incredibly well-written, researched, balanced and apolitical. This work is REQUIRED READING as an essential component in developing an understanding of global financial markets, risk assessment, risk management and the art of speculation.<br /><br />As I read the book, Mallaby makes some points that have been central themes of other authors (See The WSJ's Scott Patterson's - The QUANTS), regarding the miscues that fueled poor investment/risk management strategies. Listen to Mallaby to garner the essence of this observation as it relates to the \\"art of speculation\\" - \\"The art of speculation is to develop one insight that others have overlooked and then trade big on that small advantage.\\" P.91<br /><br />  \\"After the 1971 debacle, Weymar set about rethinking his theory of the market. He had begun with an economist's faith in model building and data: Prices reflected the fundamental forces supply and demand, so if you could anticipate those things - you were your way to riches. But experience had taught him some humility. An exaggerated faith in data could turn out to be a curse, breeding the Sol of hubris that leads you into trading positions too big to be sustainable.\\"<br /><br />  \\"The real lesson of LTCM's failure was not that its approach to risk was too simple. It was that all attempts to be precise about risk are unavoidably brittle.\\" P.231<br /><br />  (LTCM) Had misjudged the precision with which financial risk can be measured.\\"p.245.<br /><br />The point is that an unrepentant belief in the quantitative modeling that provides that \\"one insight that others have overlooked and then trade big on it\\" can have enormous consequences in either capturing returns or accelerating a cataclysmic demise of the capital under management.<br /><br />How has that all worked out, in recent years? According to Mallaby, \\"Between 2000 and 2009, a total of about five thousand hedge funds went out of business, and not a single one required a taxpayer bailout.\\"<br /><br />Ah yes, \\"bailouts\\" - what is Mallaby's take on this issue? Listen to the following: \\"Capitalism works only when institutions are forced to absorb the consequences of the risks that they take on. When banks can pocket the upside while spreading the cost of their failures, failure is almost certain.\\" P.13. Mallaby is clearly not a proponent of \\"privatizing the gains and socializing the losses.\\"<br /><br />What about our affection with history that drive financial and other forms of socio-economic modeling. Mallaby has some succinct insights:<br /><br />  \\"Projections are based on historical prices, and history could be a false friend.\\" P. 233.<br /><br />  \\"In 1997, Merton and Scholes (LTCM) received the news that they had won the Nobel Prize for economics. The award was greeted as a vindication of the new finance: The inventors of the option-pricing model were being thanked for laying down a cornerstone of modern markets. By creating a formula to price risk, the winners had allowed it to be sliced, bundled, and traded' l thousand ways the fear of financial losses, which for centuries had acted as a brake on human endeavor, had been tamed by an equation.\\" P.231.<br /><br />  So, where does Mallaby leaves us at the end of this magnum opus? His analysis leads him to conclude \\"The worst thing about the crisis is that it is likely to be repeated.\\" P. 377. However, to suggest that the hedge fund industry was the primary culprit in either the creation or magnitude of the Great Recession would be erroneous. Again, between 2000 and 2009, 5,000 hedge funds are to have ceased operations - none of which required a taxpayer bailout. Mallaby also takes a rather benign approach to the plausibility/practicality of regulating this industry (\\"The record suggests that financial regulation is genuinely difficult, and success cannot always be expected.\\" P. 379).<br /><br />Yet, at the conclusion of this work, one quote from Mallaby continues to resonate with me: \\"It is the nonintuitive signals that often prove the most lucrative.\\" p.302. However, the term \\"lucrative\\" as is as applicable to assessing risk and thereby avoiding potential losses, as it is to capturing returns on investment.<br /><br />Like I said, an epic contribution to the historical evolution of the hedge fund industry. An uncanny, incredibly thorough, balanced treatment - written in a way that is appropriate for both industry insiders, and the lay-person. A perfect volume for graduate coursework in finance -- one that focuses on human beings, as well as the quantitative financial services products they develop and deploy in the global markets today.Prize for economics.

B002ZG974M|1.0|I can't believe how many high stars this gets. Maybe it's just not my thing. I thought I would find it fasinating to watch, but it wasn't - boring as anything. I would have found it more enjoyable if maybe they talked about the different places and the different ways they raise kids there, but all your doing is watching babies move, cry, etc... I really don't understand the purpose of this film. To each their own I guess.

B002ZG981E|5.0|I typically do not like straight up action movies. They can be entertaining, but I basically hate anything by Michael Bay.  But even with the really cerebral sci-fi story aside, I would still love this movie even if it were only an action movie because of how well Nolan creates this.  It really takes hold of the viewer and the pace does not let up the entire time.  This is the best movie of the year.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|[[ASIN:B003X2O6KW My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]] is certainly Kanye West's most intriguing effort if nothing else.  The tracks generally trend lengthier than briefer, amping up the conceptual minimalist concepts characterizing some cuts -  clearly a product of 2008's [[ASIN:B001FBIPFA 808s & Heartbreak]]. `My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' is a better album, and rivals the very best of West's discography (arguably [[ASIN:B0001AP12G College Dropout]] & [[ASIN:B0009WPKY0 Late Registration]])  finding the rapper/producer in full-on experimental mode - a macro trend in rap music as of late (think Drake, KiD CuDi, and even B.o.B. to some extent). While the tracks run the slightest bit too long, the quality is undeniable as West has constructed an album that is both an anomaly, yet also a conceptual masterpiece.  To say it has singles as commercial as some from his previous efforts would be an overstatement, but it is a compelling effort whether it is overtly commercial or not.<br /><br />\\"Dark Fantasy\\" opens the album with rapper/singer Nicki Minaj `pulling out all the stops' with an exceptional spoken-word British accent.  Additionally, Minaj and indie-folk singer Bon Iver contribute background vocals.  Random? Yes - and this track sets the tone for the album in the sense that it is manic, ingenious, and incredibly creative.  Let not forget to mention a clever sampling of \\"In High Places.\\" \\"Gorgeous\\" proves just as captivating, featuring KiD CuDi & Raekwon guest spots.  KiD CuDi handles the vocal duties (yes singing) on the hook while Raekwon lends a sturdy, solid rhyme on the fourth verse.  While four verses is a bit much, I suppose Mr. West, who uses a unique microphone effect on his (and Raekwon's verse) has a lot to say.  With that said, the track is exceptional by all means.  Perhaps the harsher microphone production contrasts the fact that the track is entitled \\"Gorgeous\\"; it is definitely seems an coincidental contradiction.<br /><br />\\"Power\\" is an obvious valedictory effort, lifting samples \\"It's Your Thing\\" (Cold Grits), \\"Afromerica\\", and perhaps most impressively, \\"21st Schizoid Man\\" as performed by progressive rock band King Crimson.  This is easily West's best rap performance in sometime and the track proves to be an exceptional choice for a first single by all means.  The production work and the combination of multiple samples and solid drum programming makes \\"Power\\" superb.  The hook also lives up to the hype: \\"No one man should have all that power, with clocks ticking I just count the hours...\\"  Additionally, West keeps \\"Power\\" from sounding predictable by changing the pace slightly on the third verse and  adding strings and piano towards the end on the fine section in which West quasi-sings \\"now this would be a beautiful death...\\" Grade - A+.<br /><br />\\"All of the Lights,\\" preceded by an interlude of the same name is certainly the biggest track in sometime, with numerous musicians credited. As melodramatic as it may be, it is equally epic with superb drum programming anchoring the entirety of the production.  The hook is again remarkable, handled by the ubiquitous Rihanna singing: \\"turn up the lights in here baby/extra bright I want y'all to see this/turn up the lights in here baby you know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights.\\"  Interestingly in addition to Rihanna's hook, Fergie, Kid Cudi, Alicia Keys and Elton John can be heard (most audibly) out of the star studded performance.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is just as epic, featuring Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj and Bon Iver. \\"Monster\\" is arguably the album's best performance, finding the rap star doing something completely different from before.  All of the verses are exceptional and the expletive laden hook is - well - addictive.  \\"So Appalled\\" follows up the track with another star studded cut, again including Jay-Z, Pusha T, Prynce Cy Hi, Swizz Beatz & The RZA.  \\"So Appalled\\" is another solid, captivating listen, but doesn't trump the epic nature of either \\"All of the Lights\\" or \\"Monster.\\"<br /><br />\\"Devil In a New Dress\\" trims down the guest list to  only Rick Ross, and turns out to be another A+ performance.  The production work is exceptionally put together here, anchored by an excellent sampling of \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" (Smokey Robinson).  What I like most about \\"Devil In a New Dress\\" is the `stream of consciousness' approach taken by Mr. West; it is a hookless performance.  The epic \\"Runaway' follows (featuring Pusha T), in all of it's nine-minute plus glory.  Well produced with a smart guest spot by Pusha T, the hook may be the best part: \\"and I always find something wrong, you've been putting up with my ______ for way too long... let's have a toast for the douche bags/let's have a toast for the...\\"<br /><br />\\"Hell of  a Life\\" samples \\"She's My Baby,\\" proving to be another solid performance. \\"Blame Game\\" brings in \\"John Legend, and heightens a soulful vibe.  \\"Lost in the World\\" features Bon Iver once more on perhaps the most experimental cut on the album.  Closing interlude, \\"Who Will Survive in America\\" continues where the production work of \\"Lost in the World\\" left off with a spoken word interlude painting atop it.<br /><br />Overall, this album is one of the best of the year - surprising considering how controversial West is. Despite being such a divisive figure, West always seems to `bring it hard' where it matters most - his music.  He is unafraid to push the envelope and always serves as an innovator.  While some may not completely understand `My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,' one cannot deny how carefully constructed it is.of either \\"All of the Lights\\" or \\"Monster.\\"     \\"Devil In a New Dress\\" trims down the guest list to  only Rick Ross, and turns out to be another A+ performance.

0060936223|5.0|I loved this book.  It's a tribute by Patti Smith to Robert Mapplethorpe, her lover and friend, and a sensitive, tender -- and astute -- account of the downtown scene in the 1970s, as seen and experienced by two talented young artists finding themselves and their art.  Smith is a painter and a poet who evolves into a musician; Mapplethorpe is a painter who becomes a controversial, gifted, haunted photographer.  She works in bookstores to support them.  He is the star, but she is the survivor.    Anyone who has been young, with dreams and passion, or who lived through the times described by Smith, will embrace her story.  It's told in a voice that is poetic, honest and real.  When I finished this book, I felt that I had gained insight, not merely into Smith and Mapplethorpe, but also into their work and the times in which they lived.  Plus, they loved one another.  That love illuminates Smith's story.    This book richly deserves the National Book Award, and I am so happy that it won.  Somebody on that panel of judges had the imagination and good judgment to recognize something really special when he or she read it.
B001GCUO5W|2.0|Look guys, I do get it. The film is a study of insanity before a thriller/horror. Doesn't make it good. Furthermore, if you read the book you'd see my point.<br /><br />I read the book nearly a year before the film got released and I loved it. Quite possibly the most edge-of-your-seat book I read in a long time!!!! Furthermore when I saw the trailer and heard Scorsese would be doing the film adaptation I got ecstatic. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers, and he directed my favorite film of 2006- The Departed. That movie was just spectacular, and it changed the way I saw movies forever. It blew my then-teenage mind, and I'll never forget the first time I saw it.<br /><br />So could tell, I was excited, and flocking to the theatre on opening day, I was ready to place this at the top of my list.<br /><br />The film is true to the book, yes. Is that a good thing? It depends. I was happy they stuck with the book, as basically it seemed like they used the book as the film's screenplay.<br /><br />However, I have the feeling that this would be a one star review if I hadn't read the book. For one, even my girlfriend, who hadn't read the book, knew the ending about 10 minutes in. The plot worked well in the book, but as a movie, just simply fails, again showing that not all books that are great make good movies. The movie is pretty alright, as it is lush and colorful in a few scenes and at times even seems like a gothic horror film.  Again, pretty pictures does not equal good movie.<br /><br />Another thing ruining the film is its \\"punch in the face\\" musical score. Come on, the score was ridiculous. Spooky tingling piano music!!! Nazi-marching-into-town-music!!! LOUD BRASS music!!! Whoever did the score needs a kick in the teeth. The murder scene near the end was hilarious due to the inappropriate spooky tingling piano music.<br /><br />In short, honestly this film is pointless. I love Scorsese but this film just doesn't do anything for me. Skip it.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|A rich classic has been vandalized.  The audio was hard to listen to, the storyline was dark and it served no purpose to the movie.  A total waste of time as far as I was concerned.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|\\"Band Of Joy\\"#5, is Robert Plant's 9th studio release.  I liked this album a whole lot better than his last one with Alison Krauss \\"Raising Sand\\".  On this release the band sounds sharper and Robert just seems to be enjoying himself here.  My favorite tracks are, the Los Lobo's cover \\"Angel Dance\\" #47 rock, addictive, Robert at his best.  \\"House Of Cards\\", the Richard Thompson cover with Patty Griffin on back up vocals.  The country stomp of \\"Central Two-O-Nine\\".  The 60's sounding very Beatleish \\"You Can't Buy My Love\\", and the psycheldelic \\"Monkey\\" and traditional songs \\"Cindy, I'll Marry You Someday\\", a great banjo folk tune and  I really love his take on \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\".  At 62 Robert Plant keeps going, never boring.  Do you really want him to do Led Zeppelin forever?!
B0041KOVUU|4.0|Of course, the Pumpkins have given all of these songs out for free on the internet, but this may be worth it for the hard-core fan.    First of all, the boxed set contains a CD of the songs, that's pretty straightforward. The songs are excellent, but you can have a listen for yourself online to make sure its your thing.    The package also contains a vinyl record with the five songs on it. Unlike the vinyl in the first Teargarden EP, this is a relatively high quality pressing. The pictures printed on either side are beautiful, and for me, this thing plays like a champ. The sound is terrific, this record isn't just a pretty picture.     Overall, its well worth it for the uber-fan/collector, for anyone else, just get the songs from the Smashing Pumpkins website when they come out. It's free you know.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Seriously, you guys! Come on!  Nicki Minaj's debut album, Pink Friday, is no where near as bad as you guys \\"claim\\" it is.  You guys aren't even creating reviews, they're more of you guys venting about what you dislike about the artist!    First off, Pink Friday is a fun, up-tempo, lyrically mastered, debut album. Tracks like \\"Roman's Revenge,\\" \\"Right Thru Me,\\" \\"Blazin,\\" \\"Super Bass,\\" \\"Moment 4 Life,\\" definitely show why Minaj has received the praise that she has been receiving from the public. That's why she has hundreds of thousands of Barbz and KenBarbz (I'm neither).    Female hip-hop artists, rap music alone, I've never liked. It just never interested me. I'm not saying Nicki Minaj is the reason I listen to rap now, because I don't, I just listen to her rap music. Nicki is bringing in music listeners from the Pop, Dance, and even some Alternative categories, and they are loving her. I would say people love her so much is because she's fun, free-spirited, spunky, charismatic, plus she's very involved with her fan base. She constantly communicates with them via Twitter and Facebook.    The point I'm trying to make is, why is everyone, primarily R&B/Hip Hop listeners, being so negative towards Minaj? Is it because she's not sticking to the mold \\"you guys\\" want her to stick to? Is it because she's breaking into mainstream? You know, the same thing happened to Taylor Swift now that she's mainstream. Country music lovers don't like her because they think she's not \\"true country\\". I think the same for why Hip-Hop listeners don't like her because she's not sticking to \\"their\\" expectations.    Nicki is HOT! Pink Friday is HOT! Regardless of what YOU have to say about her, she's not going anywhere ANYTIME soon! Plus, this album is going to SELLLLL!

That song is just brilliant beyond belief. In fact, almost every song here is brilliant, except maybe \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"One of My Turns,\\" both of which don't really hit the right notes sometimes. But hey, two songs are nothing. The other 24 songs (whether short or long) on this 2-CD set are enjoyably wicked and beautiful. I'm so glad that I encountered this at still a relatively young age. It's been said before, but I'll say it anyway: they don't make them like that used to anymore.<br /><br />Grade: 9.7/10
B000VR824S|4.0|I had the 2004 and 2007 in my collection - and went to Chicago for the 2007 show.  That was a highlight of my life I must say, so after seeing the 2010 dvd I was again amazed by the performances, but a little disappointed.  I felt the show was \\"smaller\\".  Mayer only brought the trio and while his rendition of \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" was stellar, I don't think it matched 2007's \\"Gravity\\" with the whole band.  That said, it's a great dvd with standout performances, Sheryl Crow and Truks and company were great, as was Clapton of course - and it's alway good to see BB still out there!  Worth having in the collection.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Unlike many required readings for high school literature classes, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an engaging read. She builds the complexity of this novel with each additional character introduction. As the story progresses, I felt the connection between myself and the Bennet women develop. Though not as dramatic as the early 19th century, the same credentials for an acceptable relationship exist in the modern 21st century. Wealth and social status, as well as appearance were essential to the acceptance of a spouse, to avoid embarrassment to one's family. There remains an element of judgment in relationships today concerning individual etiquette, wealth and physical characteristics. This prejudice extends to peers and family members. In Pride and Prejudice, it contributed to the anxiety in the developing relationships between Jane and Mr. Bingley, as well as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />In the opening of the novel, Darcy's pride leads to Elizabeth's prejudice against him. His admiration grows because of her rebuke. This scenario takes place in all aspects of our society. We want what we can't have or that which seems out of our reach. We are never satisfied. Darcy falls victim to these desires as Elizabeth's rebuke transforms his pride into admiration for her.<br /><br />Looking past the intricacy of the English language, I found Pride and Prejudice to be a novel of great complexity, where the lives of all characters are intertwined.  From Mr. Collins marrying Charlotte Lucas, to Mr. Darcy finding Lydia for the Bennet's, each character had some effect on all the others.  Austen keeps the reader wondering, only putting their minds to ease at the conclusion of the novel.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Ms. Nicki did not deliver as her ego and and rap persona wants us to believe. She is to cocky and not humble and it turns me off. She is talented and is definitely a STAR, but she need more work.. Im sorry Its just not real music with any substance. Go listen to \\"Snitchin\\" by LIL KIm on her last album. That is real story telling and the true art of rap, which Nicki needs to become more experienced in.
0061733199|5.0|This book covers so many primitive and modern techniques of varying skills and functions in regards to survival. It teaches you in depth on skills related to hunting, fishing, tracking, preparing game, shelters, fire making techniques, survival mentality and preparation, and ways to deal with specific emergencies and disasters. It has alot of interesting skills as well, such as knot making and other useful and easily applicable skills. I highly suggest this book if any of these things interest you.
0385528752|5.0|Switch takes an ancient metaphor that Jonathan Haidt uses in \\"The Happiness Hypothesis\\" and elaborates on it for an entire book.  Using plenty of real-life examples and up-to-date research references, Chip and Dan Heath provide a pattern that can be readily followed to help people and organizations make changes -- in themselves, their places of work, an industry or in entire countries.<br /><br />The Heaths' focus on one aspect of human nature that we all share and we all sometimes struggle with in a way that is very accessible and relate-able to anyone.  They've reduced a complex behavioral phenomenon to basic outcomes without getting bogged down in all the intricacies of the behavior or the root sources/causes of the behavior.<br /><br />You will be able to immediately apply each piece of the book as soon as you read it, whether to yourself, a loved-one, in your place of work or with clients.  You will better understand why appealing to the thinking without appealing to the emotion is an exercise in frustration -- and a much longer route to take -- rather than dealing with both.  You will better understand how to leverage the thinking (intellect, logic, reasoning, etc.) to help move the emotion in beneficial ways.  And, you will better understand what differentiates successful from unsuccessful appeals for making changes.<br /><br />Forget the following notions:<br />- People don't want to change.<br />WRONG.<br />People make changes all the time.<br /><br />- Dealing with people on an emotional level is demeaning and over-simplifying complex matters.<br />WRONG.<br />Nearly every move we make ultimately gets checked against our emotional response to our decisions, whether we realize it or not.  Not dealing with people on an emotional level as well as the \\"intellectual\\" level can be traced to most conflicts and failures.<br /><br />- Will power is enough to make long-term changes.  People who can't stick to a change are simply lacking the discipline to exercise their will power.<br />WRONG.<br />Will power alone can only make very small, short-term changes at best.  Will power has a very small supply, takes a while to replenish, and can only \\"fool\\" emotions for a short time.  Meanwhile, the emotions have a nearly inexhaustible supply, are constantly replenishing and are \\"active\\" whether will power is being applied or not.  Long-term change is only attained when will power is used to make small, frequent, consistent changes to allow the emotions to align with the desired outcomes.<br /><br />Best of all... Switch gives keys to doors I (and probably many other readers) stopped trying to open.ake very small, short-term changes at best.

B000MR9D5E|3.0|It's absolutely beautiful. The reason I gave three star my regular DVD can play, but my HDDVD player can not play it. I can't enjoy it's full potential.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Great book one of the best written books written. Awsome since it is a freebie. Story is amazing. Very detailed. And once again its one of the best books written and is personally one of my favriotes.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love the entire Fire and Ice series, but this is honestly my favorite. The series is written in first person through the eyes of certain characters that are broken up at the beginning of the series and continue on, problem is they die alot so don't get to attached. What I enjoy about this book more than the others is that it contains lots of political maneuvering, excellent environments that are very different, large scale battles and just a worldly view of what is going on from the point of view of several characters. You really learn to love the world their in and what is going on and feel pain when they lose a loved one or anguish when they lose a battle. Honestly, this is Martin's best work right here. If you haven't started the entire series, pick it up, you will not be disappointed.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Look its been a long time since I last purchased a CD retail. I usually buy a song hear and there via itunes.   I have to say that this album is fantastic.  Almost every song on this album is a hit.  The production is stellar.  Quality beats and West's lyrics have improved greatly.  There are quite a few memorable lines that he drops that were very impressive.  Truthfully, after listening to this album, I think he really raised the bar for Rap and Hip Hop.  My Favorite Tracks:    1. Dark Fantasy  2. Gorgeous  3. So Appalled  4. Devil in a New Dress  5. Runaway  6. Lost in the World  7. See me now (Bonus Track)  8. Power  9. Monster    Buy this album.
0553381687|5.0|I honestly picked this book up just because I thought the cover looked cool and I liked the maps inside. Little did I know that this would become my favorite series of all time. Martin has a way of grabbing the reader and just sucking them in. The book starts in the cold north where a local lord and his several children live a basic life. The lord is promoted to be basically the \\"vice president\\" of the entire continent by the king and has to move to the capital. The story is told from the first person, but not from just one person. Instead each chapter is told by a different character. Later on a tragedy happens and all these characters are scattered to the four winds. Some end up in royalty, some become traveling thieves, some go to entirely different continents. The backbone of this story is that a great kingdom falls apart and every one is left to pick up the pieces, it is a masterful adventure and I honestly hated when I had to stop reading from one characters point of view and shift to another just because by the end of the chapter I had become attached. Some of these characters are evil, so you get the best of both worlds, and some are torn inside, flawed just like real people. Overall, if you love politics, backstabbing, love, drama, magic and adventure, you need to pick this up.
B003PNIS08|2.0|I was expecting more from the 2nd in this series.  There is clearly some appeal to the Larsson books, but I just don't get it - very underwhelming!
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|The idea behind this film is that humans have literally been able to create robotic bodies so that they can go out and do things like having a job and clubbing from home without danger through a different body. I like the idea, its a kind of metaphor for people staying home on Facebook and other things all night and not actually ever doing anything outside their personal bubble. The film adds on this as Bruce Willis is forced to begin living life without his surrogate body and go out as a normal human again. The drama adds further in the fact that Bruce has not seen his wife in a long time, even inside their own home. Even when confronted she just says, \\"this is my body now.\\" So what didn't I like about this, mainly, it doesn't really feel like it knows what it wants to do. At times its a good action movie, at others a mystery, at others a drama. It also lacks depth, we see a news story at the beginning about whats going on and then boom your in it. It also has parts that I guess your suppossed to just figure out on your own, i.e. their are several different bad guys, but we don't get a backstory on them, we simply know \\"they are bad.\\" The film is worth watching, just do not expect a lot from it.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I was rather young when I first saw this film, probably around 12 or so. My best friend and I were always watching movies on weekends, usually B horror films and slapstick comedies that were broadcast in the afternoons. We stumbled onto this one, and it's been a lifelong memory of ours. The insanity of it, the over-the-top characters and plot left us howling and to this day we STILL quote lines from it. Truman Capote was a hoot, and Peter Falk was a riot. The whole cast was outstanding, playing off each other in the numerous utterly absurd situations. I was overjoyed when it was finally released on DVD and it made the perfect Birthday present for my friend (still my best friend after almost 30 years). This film is most certainly NOT for those interested in \\"serious\\" movie plots, and it has a few moments where things get a bit bogged down, but it does well at not taking itself seriously and showcases some outstanding slapstick comedy from the cast members. The parodies of well known literary sleuths are excellent, those who know who the characters are based on will get a chuckle out of seeing these madcap renditions of them.
0553381695|5.0|Like the previous book this one continues the epic story. This book is a little more intense than the last as more sides prepare for war and political maneuvering. Lots of near characters and new surprises, and you slowly come to realize that their is more at work here than just a political uprising. Great story telling and anyone who is ever been an avid fantasy reader needs to pick this book up.

B003W5C0VM|4.0|Mick Taylor is, without a doubt, the best lead guitarist the Rolling Stones have ever had.<br />The Stones were at their peak when Mick was in the band and this movie proves it.<br /><br />As for the movie itself; it's poorly lit, shot from bad angles and grainy and blurry, especially during Gimme Shelter.<br />Also, it's cobbled together from multiple live shows so don't expect a modern concert \\"look\\" out of this Blu-ray.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the audio wasn't remixed to showcase Mick Taylor's superior guitar skills and you'll need to tweak your<br />audio settings to pull Mick's stellar performance to the forefront. The \\"LPCM\\" audio setting worked best for me.<br />Visually, Mick Taylor does not jump around like Pete Townshend or Angus Young, his performance style is similar to Eric Clapton's.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because the audio mix didn't give Mick Taylor the respect he earned.<br /><br />BTW: You can buy this Blu-ray at Costco for $12.99.
1416972250|5.0|WOW! What a WONDERFUL book! I could not put this book down...I loved every minute of it!<br /><br />This is the final book in the Mortal Instruments series (although now I think there will be 3 more books). In this book Clary and the whole gang end up in Alicante (The Glass City in Idris). Clary is searching for a potion to wake her mother, but while doing so runs into trouble with Valentine. In this book two other characters are brought in the middle of Jace and Clary's \\"relationship\\"...Sebastian and Aline. I loved what these characters brought to the book! You also get to meet Luke's sister in this book.<br /><br />This book was so good because everything kind of fell into place. All the things you were wondering about and couldn't figure out came together. There are some twists and surprises also. I figured out most of them, but a few of them took me by surprise!<br /><br />I am so glad I ended up reading the rest of this series!! This is right up there with my favorite series now...I actually enjoyed this last book better than Breaking Dawn (and I loved it)! I can't wait to see what else Cassandra has in store for us!!!!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Some users have said that they have experienced a dead-zone with this controller. I can see how this can happen with third-party controllers because most of them don't use Bluetooth. Although this controller doesn't use Bluetooth, I haven't experienced any lags, or dead-zones during my gameplay. I defiantly prefer this layout over the original, and I haven't had any trouble with the buttons or triggers. -This is a great product, and you can't go wrong.
0316098337|4.0|I would have to say that I enjoyed this book a fair amount. Could I put it down? Yes. Was I totally sucked in? No. That's why I can't join the other 5 star reviews on here, which was part of the reason I picked it up in the first place. It's different, I'll hand the author that. I can see why this book is not for everyone, given that the entire story is told through 5 year old Jack and in his 5 year old voice. There were some parts I found to be unbelievable but it is fiction afterall. But I would have to say that I thought this book good, not amazing, and I couldn't see myself recommending it to any of my friends. They wouldn't enjoy the way it was written.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|It is amazing to see the lives of the patients unfold and unravel in unison with his life events! Best show I have ever seen...
193413712X|2.0|The story's basic structure (jumping back and forth between generations) is intriguing, at first, but doesn't follow through. Seems that Harding was going in an interesting direction and then got lost, added a few stupid twists then just ended the book so that he could sell it.  In the end, I did not get much sense of what these people were about. Full of lengthy, flowery descriptions which didn't convey to me any feeling or emotion.  Really just gobbledegook.  I think the Pulitzer committee were afraid to say that this emperor had no clothes.
1439102813|4.0|I enjoyed this novel because it discussed a topic (alzeihmers) that I am not familiar with.  It captivated what a family goes through with intreging writing.
B003X2O6KW|1.0|Just doing my part in bringing these OVERRATED ratings down. I like Kanye but Im not feeling his style this go around at all, Its interesting sounding but this is probably even worse than 808 & Heartbreak. Either Kanye is trying way too hard or not enough but Im not feeling it at all, sorry.
B002RWKSII|5.0|For those of us who grew up with Beach Boys harmonies and rhythms, this is a great way to reexperience them in a unique way. Brian Wilson sounds as good as ever -although I had my doubts about whether I would like this CD, I just love it.

B000RZIGVS|2.0|Perhaps I got a bootleg copy, but it sure doesn't look like one.  No Chinese characters on the disks.  All Region 1.  The case looks legit as everyone has been describing it.  Yes, the packaging needs some serious help.  Cheap green DVD holders that easily break and a couple were broken when I got the set.  Clear packing tape is the binding material for all the pages of each of the 3 groups of DVDs.  No poster was included even though it says one is included of the dedication plaque.  No list of episodes anywhere in the package except on the disks themselves and the type is pretty small and not the best printing quality.  But, the worse problem I saw was the encoding quality!!  Come on!  These are supposed to be professionally made commercial DVDs from Paramount/CBS DVD.  The colors are drab and there is a lot of compression \\"noise\\" and lack of detail even in close ups.  When you pay for a show that you have seen on TV in the past for free, you expect to get really good quality.  I have the TOS first season (2004) and the quality blows this set away!  I would advise waiting for a better set.  I'm going to check a season out at the library and compare it to this set.  I can't believe the lack of quality.  One exception was the special features disk.  Some of the quality there was pretty good.    Correction: The package says Region 1, but my decryption software says these are multi-region.  I got these off eBay for $102.  I've been reading other reviews and it does look like this is a bootleg set.  Beware of eBay deals!
B0042816YK|3.0|A more appropriate name would be, \\"Eat, Pray, Love & Sleep.\\" Unfortunately, this was the movie I most wanted to see when it came out on DVD. Thank you, again, Red Box for saving me from spending 20 dollars on a movie I would likely never watch again.    In the beginning we are introduced to a woman who is having a perpetual life crisis. Never being happy or finding her hearts content. Common story for just about EVERYBODY I KNOW. How they went about resolving her dilemma was just not that interesting. Her trip to Italy was relatively uneventful and the lesson to gain from it was to eat what you want and buy bigger pants. Basically, we got that from the watching previews. Then in India, she didn't find anything beyond that either.    I was hoping for her to find some degree of benefit from each location, putting it all together in the end to become a whole, happy person. None of this actually happened.     The last trek to Bali was when it got interesting and is the ONLY reason I give this movie three stars. The adventure and love story there was filled with interesting characters that finally made the movie more interesting than watching paint dry. Javier Bardem really brought something into the movie that simply didn't exist before. He played a great character and his acting was done very well. I liked this entire segment. If only the entire movie would have been like the last third.    Rent it. Then decide if it is worth it. I see some people felt it was worth five stars. I envy them. I just can't live in that world. If you want to really enjoy a great \\"Finding Myself\\" chick flick, get \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" instead.
B003A9OVS0|5.0|I was gonna buy this CD at the store on black friday, but then I saw a tweet on twitter that it was on sale for $1.99. And I remembered that Amazon also had a free $3 code for MP3 so i got that and downloaded the album for free!! I love the Gorillaz. This album is amazing. Very happy with my purchase.
B004CAWKXE|4.0|I really like the album but I'm kinda pissed. I probably would've waited a little bit before buying this album, but the price of 4 dollars was too good to pass up. Until I bought it. It was really 8 dollars. I'm so annoyed about that because the website lied and then charged 8 dollars. Grr. I mean, it's not not a good album, but, again, I would've waited for it to go on sale or asked for it for the winter holidays.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I chose to believe the positive reviews, rather than the ones the claimed the controller had dead zone in the analog stick...  I should have listened.  The dead zone made it impossible to play FPS like the COD series.      Not making it a blue tooth device was a huge mistake.  Syncing it with PS3 was also somewhat of a pain.      If all that was (magically) fixed it would have been a great controller!  But at this point in time - no good, returned to Amazon.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Every once in a while, a movie comes out that just blows you away. Maybe it's the acting, the story, or the special effects. Everyone talks about how revolutionary the Matrix was, or how about 300 with its incredible slow motion action scenes? Well friends, today I'm happy to say that \\"Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World\\" has been added to that exclusive list for me.    It was the energy, chaos, production, and special effects. I've never seen a movie that pumped me up more or filled me with so much positive energy. I initially caught interest in the film due to the video game theme and the \\"seven evil exes\\" plot- I mean who doesn't want to see a movie where you're going to see SEVEN epic battles?? Also I heard Chris Evans was going to be in it and that guy rocks.    The scenes in the movie were shot incredibly well.. In Scott's many battles you will not only see the battle itself, but the reactions of main/supporting characters, interaction with extras, and of course.. dizzying special effects. I told my friends that the effects in this movie made the Matrix look like the Blair Witch Project!    And the ENERGY of this movie! I can't even describe. One minute you're watching what appears to be typical \\"teen movie\\" dialog, and before your very eyes the scene transforms into a battle so epic you won't believe your eyes. It's so over the top, yet so enjoyable. I could watch this movie 100 times. I just want to show everyone I meet so they can feel the same energy.    While I can't talk enough about the great things in this movie, there are a few disappointing things- Mainly that the movie sadly didn't even recoup its budget! I was shocked to hear that it did not perform well, despite the high reviews from viewers and even critics. And I don't have to tell you that movies in this genre (teen, action, humor, over-the-top) usually get hammered by critics. We need to support movies like this so that they continue to be made. The cast and production crew deserve all the respect inthe world and they have mine. I can't even imagine how long it took to produce the amazing special effects.    As for actual negative points about the movie, well my only real complaint was many of the actors chosen:    Michael Cera (Scott Pilgrim) - OK this guy is extremely annoying to a lot of people. I wouldn't even be surprise if the movie did worse because people refused to see the movie due to this (in fact one of my friends immediately mentioned him as why he didn't feel like seeing it). He did a good job acting in the movie, but he just can't rise out of that geeky, annoying personality that so many people despise. I would have preferred a stronger male lead.. somebody more memorable for sure.    Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Ramona Flowers) - Bad, Bad, Bad. I have no idea why she was chosen. Her personality was about as bright as a black hole. Her only redeeming quality was her looks, but her boring personality even dragged that down. She talked in a monotone manner (although not as bad as the character Kim). In a movie where a guy is going to fight the whole time over a female, I would hope that they could pick a female \\"worth fighting for!\\". She wasn't it.. Sorry Mary.    Anna Kendrick (Stacey Pilgrim) - Ugggh.. I guess somebody decided that they needed a typical \\"90210\\" personality. Cliche, cliche, cliche.. Certainly could have been more original.    Despite these poor choices for main and supporting actors, there certainly were a lot of memorable performances: Kieran Culkin (Gay Roommate), Johnny Simmons (Young Neil), Ellen Wong (Knives Chau), Mark Webber (Stephen Stills, \\"The Talent\\"), and let's not forget the evil exes! Notably Satya Bhabha (Matthew Patel), Chris Evans (Lucas Lee), and Jason Schwartzman (Gideon Graves).    So for the BOTTOM LINE: Go rent or buy this on BluRay. Don't let some of the actor choices turn you off, because this movie is a masterful production. I'm not even a fan of Michael Cera and this movie tops my list of AWESOME movies of all time.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|I rented this on netflix sometime ago, thinking it was some documentary on the beatles or something. To be honest I wasnt paying attention. Well it arrived and I thought, ok well its here so lets see..<br />Now, I dont know if its cos I was not expecting it, but this musical movie blew me away.. The music was perfect and I am a stickler for copies. pseudo beatles etc.. but this felt so right, the story also appealed to me. .being a brit in the 60's, moving to US , it had a lot of parallels.<br />The musical numbers production were excellent.. So anyway, I decided to buy on here as I had a free 5 dollar code.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone especially guys who think they hate musicals.. which I still do ;) .. just not this one..<br />Go buy or rent if you are a lennon fan, a beatles fan, a girl ;) or a guy ;)
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|After the famous fanfare, the finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony begins with a dialogue scored for cello and basses. This NY Philharmonic recording is outstanding, as one can hear the bows biting into strings, that's how good the dynamics are in the Manhattan Center during this 1964 recording. The drive of the Fifth, the humor of the Eight, the magnificent Ninth, it's all there. The Bernstein Third with wife Felicia Montealegre as the Speaker, recorded in 1964, all four Brahms symphonies: my favorite movement is the finale of the Third, though the great horn solo in the finale of the First is a very close second. Bernstein's tempos are brisk, full of the energy of youth, reaching for that harmony just beyond reach. While the sound is not quite up to the digital standards of today, it is still very, very good. And there are a box full of symphonies to explore, understand and enjoy. You might even want to stand up and conduct a movement or two yourself: the Bruckner Ninth, Copland Third, Dvorak Seventh, Frank D Minor, Haydn Paris and London Symphonies, Ives Second, the Liszt Faust Symphony, the complete Mahler cycle, Mendelssohn, late Mozart, Franz Schubert, William Schuman, Robert Schumann, Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Jean Sibelius, the complete Tchaikovsky cycle, it is a breathless collection. And a bonus - all the photographs on the CD jackets and the glorious large format booklet. If you're a Bernstein fan, this is a must have. ENJOY....

B00275EHJG|3.0|We were huge fans of the first films in this series, and we couldn't wait to see this movie.  In a nutshell, kid's films with cartoon characters are supposed to be laugh out funny or smartly comedic, or both.  Yes, there were moments of laughter, but just not enough.  You kept hoping toward the end it would turn hilariously and energetically hysterical, but it did not.  Was it waste of time?  No.  Am I glad that I resisted the urge to see the movie at the theater and thus save a few bucks with a large family?  Yes.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I don't normally write reviews like this, but this movie deserves it from me. I can't believe I missed out on this one in theaters. The story seems standard, but has plenty of its own touches.  The pace is nice, with a few slower points dotting some really incredible action. The music is absolutely perfect. The sounds effects are also flawless, and the special effects and camera work are top-notch, too. Some might take issue with that last statement with the odd cutaways and split screens, but here it works perfectly, like truly bringing a comic book to life. There are even text-printed sound effects in the background.     And I know what you're thinking. \\"Text-printed sound effect? Like 60's Batman?\\"  Kind of, but somehow they pull it off in a way that isn't cheesy. In fact, it's so not cheesy and works so well in the context of this movie that they either fly by without a bump, or are brought out in such a cool way that they bring a visible smile to my face. I dare you to not be excited when the unexplained announcer yells \\"K.O.!!!\\" at the end of a fight!    There are those that might not like this movie. Older audiences might have all the references and humor fly right over their heads. Anyone 13-39 should get them, though, and have this movie permanently etched into their minds for the rest of their life.    Only downside is a relatively bland video transfer. Nothing awful, mind you, but this could have been reference material if it was done right, but as is, it's merely good.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|THis is a very touching movie and is good for the whole family,It tells a great story about the way things are today and is acted very well by all,I bought it after seeing the trailer and was not disappointed All ages should enjoy this movie and could learn an important lesson about life and love and family
142311339X|4.0|I was a big fan of the last five books, but maybe my tastes have changed or maybe Rick is just trying to push out more material is the least amount of time.  Hopefully this next story line picks up in the next book or two (and yes, I will likely buy those also).
B00428CPUY|3.0|I purchased the DVD and watched it last night.  I have the shows from past years and this one does not have the pop that the others do.  The artist lineup had the potential to really wow the concert goer but IMO was a little lackluster.  My biggest disappointment was the video editing which is probably the main reason this rated a 3.  Too many out of focus shots coming into focus, shots of the audience clapping instead of focusing on the artist, jumping to new shots so fast it really took away from the performance.   I think the guy was trying to be too artsy-fartsy in the editing room and really messed up a good concert for those of us who were not actually there.  If you buy this do yourself a favor and just pay attention to the audio and you will love the concert.  If you do not have the previous years you are missing out on some first rate shows.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|First off, why oh why did we have to have the Theatrical Version in this set? I bought that DVD six months ago. We don't need a repeat here! The Special Edition isn't really even necessary, either, since all of those scenes and more are actually in the Extended Cut. I guess that one's for people who only want to see a few of the added scenes, but not all. Maybe they're running short on time that day or something. Frankly, if I'm gonna watch extra scenes, just show all of them to me.<br /><br />So, they put the first half of three different versions of the movie on disc 1 and the second half of these versions on disc 2. I hate that!! I thought I was done with changing discs mid-movie when Dances with Wolves and The Green Mile did that years ago. I know they can put a 3-hour movie on one disc. I see miniseries and TV show discs all the time with at least three hours on them!<br /><br />The packaging is 50/50. The outer layers are great. I love the book style with the slipcovers over them. I thought it would unfold like the Fox TV series of Buffy or Angel. No. It opens like a book and each disc has a carboard sleeve that slides out of the end of each page. Rough cardboard sleeves that the disc slides around in during shipping and handling. YOUR DISCS WILL BE SCUFFED OR SCRATCHED WHEN YOU OPEN IT.<br /><br />So, my idea would have been: put all of the Special Edition on Disc 1 (for those who wanted to see that version), put all of the Extended Cut on Disc 2 (my favorite) and leave Disc 3 with the featurettes and deleted scenes as it is. Think a little, people! Don't just cram all the crap you can find on a \\"Collector's Edition\\" set and throw it in there all willy-nilly. And switch to a more orthodox way of disc storage so as not to damage them before we ever get them, please? This set could have been as wonderful as I think the movie is. 5 for the movie. 3 for the DVDs.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I was looking for a field recorder to start recording higher-quality audio for use with my 7D when doing interviews and short clips for a website and some other clients. I'd done a lot of research on the zoom series (H1/H2/H4n).<br /><br />hen i visited my local Sam Ash, i was sold on the H4n the moment i held it. The build quality is solid, but lightweight enough to not be cumbersome. The MAIN ting that sold me on the H4n over the cheaper but equally awesome zoom products is the XLR inputs that are phantom powered if you need it for condenser or other high-end microphones. The jacks are combo jacks so it can take a 1/4\\" or an XLR in, which is great.<br /><br />The H4n comes with a plastic protective case which fits like a glove and sufficiently protects it from getting banged up in a bag with other equipment. The wind screen isn't that great, but there are aftermarket windscreens like the \\"redhead\\" which are awesome. The built-in condenser mics are great, and the built in effects are equally useful, especially for adjusting audio for doing voiceover work or spoken word, like podcasts.<br /><br />It can record in MP3 format at varying bitrates so you can get the most out of your SD card if you have a lot of audio to record or if you just don't like having to convert formats. You can adjust mic levels on the fly, even during recording which is awesome. Additionally you can suspend and resume recording (to the same file), which i've heard some other recorders can't do, but i'm not sure about that.<br /><br />I haven't yet tested it as a USB device as I don't podcast or do anything that would really need it [i often have my mixer piped into my line in on my computer] but the feature is nice to have. I suppose you could also transfer your files off the SD card if you don't have a card reader.<br /><br />The price is right too ($300 at any retail outlet), and feature-wise surpasses even more expensive offerings from tascam or sony.<br /><br />highly recommend this to anyone looking for a field recorder for low-budget film-making/interviews/documentary/music....it's good for everything!film-making/interviews/documentary/music....it's good for everything!

B00428ZRFY|4.0|'Good Girl Gone Bad,' in my opinion, marked Rihanna's true evolution from Reggae/R&B artist to Pop icon.  She really found her niche, and then all of a sudden she totally dropped the ball with 'Rated R,' an album that was frankly all over the place musically coupled with some of the worse singles being released (what happened to 'Fire Bomb' and 'Photographs' being released as singles as opposed to the other awful offerings?).  But now it seems like she's back, looking a bit Katy Perry-ish with her new look this time around, with 'Loud.'  It seemed like this album was rushed given how quickly it came out from the last, but clearly some serious work was put into it.  The title 'Loud' would give the impression that this album is going to be heavy on dance and crazy on sick beats.  It's a bit of that, and a decent mix of Pop, as well as a return to Rihanna's Reggae roots.<br /><br />Noteworthy Tracks:<br /><br />What's My Name - Nice Island/Carribean vibe.  Drake's rap is kind of pointless, but hey, it works.<br /><br />Cheers (Drink to That) - Uses an Avril Lavigne sample, but a complete Alanis/Glen Ballard ode from beginning to end.  Hard to explain, but if you loved Alanis's early stuff, this will definitely sound like a throwback.<br /><br />Fading and California King Bed - Airy and light pop ballads that are very single worthy, impressed with the vocal arrangement and overall songs, some of her best work in that area.<br /><br />Only Girl (In the World) and Complicated - Very dance and heavy on the House vibe.  Her voice is on point and the arrangement fits the beat perfectly.  They do sound a bit a like with Rihanna singing to the max of her range, but it works, wish she would give this a lot more often.<br /><br />Man Down - Complete fire, love this song and the passion in it, she definitely returns to her true Reggae roots on this one mixing patois with her singing that brings the lyrics out even more.<br /><br />Raining Men - So glad that this didn't turn out to be a remake, but it's a hyped up club/Reggae-influenced joint featuring Nicki Minaj.<br /><br />It must be noted that the Deluxe and regular versions are CLEAN.  What's My Name, Man Down, Raining Men, Complicated, and Love the Way You Lie (Part II) ARE ALL EDITED.  If you want the unedited versions (parental advisory version), which I wanted more than anything after I found this out, you're going to have to download it from Amazon or iTunes.  Don't know whose decision this was and I'm  still a little upset about it, should've just released it the way it was but, whatever.  Pout or go out and buy it instead of the physical album.<br /><br />This album is another solid release by Rihanna and offers many singles, so I hope she promotes the hell out of it because it's really some of her best work sonically.d joint featuring Nicki Minaj.

142311339X|5.0|OK, this book is serously AMAZING!!!!!!!!! At first I did not know what the book was about so I read some reviews and I realized that is a new series from Rick Riordan who writes my favorite books. When I realized that it is based on the prophsey from book 5 in the Pecy Jackson series, I had to get this book. It was raining and cold and my mom was sick so I made my dad take to Target and i got the book. He said i couldn't read it until i got all of my chores done. It took me 10 minutes to clean a disaster filled kitchen. When I started to read the book I could not put it down. It took me all night to finish the book. I started to read at 8:30 and I finished the book at 2:45. Its long but well worth it. The only prolbem is that I have to wait until next year to figure out what happens next. I want the next book to be equally amazing but I really want Riordan to hurry up! You will get used to the piont of view changeing throughout the book quickly.     *Percy is missing. Jason wakes up holding hand with a girl named Piper and she believes that Jason is her boyfriend. Leo is a so of Hephaetus who fixes the Bronze Dragon (read the demigod files to figure that one out) and helps save the day. Did I mention Percy is MISSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jason(son of Zeus) has no memory and needs to save Hera(Juno) with the help of Leo and Piper(daughter of Aphrodite). You will not find out where Percy is until the very last sentence of the book. I cryed. Lets put it this way... Hew could die. Yes I'm serous, he could die.*    I really enjoyed this book and I hope this helped. : ) By the book, but read the Percy Jackson series before, for a better understanding of this book.
0452289963|5.0|I'm listing A New Earth on my website and was looking for the best place to refer people to read about it, when I came upon this Amazon listing.  Those who say there are better books and intellectually pick it apart, well, that is obviously true for them, yet I've seen this book change people's lives profoundly - friends, family, even acquaintances. The book is a visceral experience of change and awakening, so I hope any hope negative posters do not discourage you as a potential reader, it is an amazing book.
B003Y5H4VG|4.0|A thriller with real teeth, this film presents a barely fictionalized account of events related to how the Bush administration apparently lied on a massive, perhaps criminally reprehensible, scale regarding Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program, seeking justification for America's going to war with Iraq.    One of the most interesting things about Fair Game, for me, is how an entertainment based on actual events cycles back to continue the \\"real-world\\" narrative  that gave rise to it.    The film actually further pursues husband-and-wife Valerie Plame and Joseph Wilson's counterattack against those in George W. Bush's administration who deliberately leaked Plame's status as a covert CIA operative to discredit her husband, formerly an Africa expert with the State Department, who had gone public with the news that the US government was lying about Iraq having imported large quantities of \\"yellow cake\\" uranium from Niger.    The film weaves together excellent acting by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, in the roles of Plame and Wilson, with network video footage of Bush and Cheney spinning the grounds for going to war, as well as with other documentary material I won't reveal for fear of spoiling its impact. Fair Game has no compunction about using these names as well as those of Karl Rove and Scooter Libby. There's a heady tone of, \\"Okay, these people, whom we're naming flat out--this is no time for coyness--appear to be liars and pretty evil. So we say, and they can sue us if they dare.\\"    According to the storyline, not only did Bush/Cheney's spinmeisters set out to destroy Plame and Wilson's careers and public reputations, they showed utter disregard for the lives of the many agents Plame was operating in countries such as Iraq, where Saddam's displeasure entailed brutal ends for agents and family members alike.    Through much of the story, Plame and Wilson are getting smeared by the bad guys. By film's end, however, their tough and principled refusal toback down is finally paying off.    Now the film itself presents a nicely self-referential continuation of their attempt to show that--even in this age of mass media and expert political manipulation of public perceptions--us little people can fight back. And we can resist partly by using similar instruments.    At this point, though, the cynic in me rears up and suggests it ain't so easy, and nowhere is it writ that the good guys have to win. How much will Fair Game serve, as surely it was intended, to alert the public to the basic amorality of many of our puppet masters? Hardly at all, I'll bet. More likely, those who were already true liberal believers will say, \\"Right on, right on!\\" while those who suckle their realities at the Fox News teat will dismiss Fair Game as just more consarned work of the Devil and his liberal minions. And never the twain will meet.    So the Republicans will win the US national election in two years, and China will loom at one end of the Tea Party negotiating table, other guests being North Korea as the dormouse and Iran as the March Hare. (Does anyone know where I can find a couple of affordable tickets off-planet? One way will do fine.)      Whatever. Did I mention the movie is also very entertaining?

B000VT6FAO|5.0|While i expected something amazing, I really didn't expect this solo shot into the stratospere. Still, listening to it has spawned a sequence of loops that make me listen to it even more, making me feel as thought I managed to hit the mark when it came to buying. This also means that the singer hit the mark when it came to the construction of something viable, and I really have to give D.H. cudos on this creation. Were it not for striking it out on his own, we would have never seen the level of talent here.<br /><br />Of the two releases that D.G. made, I have to say that this one has been my favorite. The reason I say that is because the album is not simply a creation reflecting the talents of an older band. no, he has something else here, something amazing, and i love it quite a bit. From the first track I can say that I was hooked, and the first week I owned it I was programming it as videogame background sound on my X-box 360 so I could listen and play. What does that mean, really? It means that anyone that has yet to pick this up has missed out on something that is not only creative but that runs the emotive spectrum and the temponic spectrum as well. From the slow and the sad to the upbeat and the love bitten, it is all there.<br /><br />for those who fear a remake of the same old stuff, fear not. This is something new, something great, and it will keep your attention. There are plenty of tracks to check out the see if you agree, too, because reviews are simly voices that house the opinions of people you probably don't know. In the end you are the boss and you are the one opinion that matters. So listen, give it a chance an a few spins, and see if you agree. I think you'll be glad you did.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Oscar is one of those kids that constantly finds himself picked on. In his freetime he dreams of serial killing, even keeping an album on the deeds of other men. He also has a knife and imagines himself killing over and over again, and this little deed attracts the attnetion of Eli. Eli first approaches Oscar on a playground outside of his apartment as he works on a Rubic Cube, and the two quickly strike up conversation. for all intents and purposes, it is an innocent affair between two 12 year olds. The only problem is that Eli has a friend she lives with and that friend hangs people from trees and drains them of blood. Worse still, Eli drinks blood to survive and has a need to feed - even if that means picking off people in the most unlikely of positions.<br /><br />Before I begin, I have to note that this is not the book Let Me In. If you watch closely you can see a lot of the pieces here, but you lose a lot as well. You lose Oscar's problems, Eli's ways, and you lose her \\"roommates\\" deal. you also lose eli's past, something that is hinted to, and a lot of other things. Still, that doesn't mean that much. Personally, i like the two of them and I keep them as different things in my mind. I do not like to mix the two, either, because the picture of eli in them movie is one I love. I like the way the two kids get along ore than anything, and I like the way things go. True, I would have liked the things that Eli can do with her hands and feet, but I am willing to give that up for the greater good of the movie. Besides, putting that stuff in would have certainly made this movie something that a lot of people would have protested.<br /><br />When you wathc this, everything from the acting to the way things go are beautiful. You have no idea how old Eli is here, but you get ideas of some things aobut here. She has a thing for puzzles, and one of the things she has is valuable enough to \\"buy a nuclear power plant\\" if sold. You also see the pain that Eli feels and the way that she seems to want to be loved. I have a thing with Oscar, not the actor but the kid in the movie, and I really am not a fan. I know hes a 12 year old, but he does things that are cruel. The thing with not inviting Eli in is hard to watch because shesimply wants someone to care, and other things hapen as well. Still, it is tender in a lot of places and, honestly, it touches me and creeps me out as well.<br /><br />This movie has some stuff in it that is kiddy. you might keep that in mind when wathcing it. You might also keep in mind that it is not the book so, for those who didn't like the reading, you have something different.As I said before, this is NOT the bok and sometimes reading it may even hurt what you have seen. You get background and some stuff you may want to know, but knowing them hurts the relationship. honestly, stick with the 5 star movie unless you simply have to have it all. this is a great feature and you can love it forever.to want to be loved.

B004BSEKH6|3.0|C'mon guys. Just because Nicki Minaj puts out a subpar, pop-ish album doesn't mean hip hop is dead. Nor does it mean she's a talentless hack. She's just...misguided? That'll work.    This album is not that great. It's not even very good. But it'll do. I, too, was expecting a looot more from her, but I'm not entirely surprised. As another reviewer noted, it seems like she only goes hard when she's featured on another artist's track and doesn't quite get there in her solo stuff, which probably results from a lack of experience. Maybe she's just a product of poor production influence. Maybe she was a little intimidated, what with all the INSANE BUZZ surrounding her. Maybe we're just expecting too much. Whatever it is, the album is disappointing - I don't deny this.    But give her a break. It's listenable and fun. A couple of tracks may be skip-worthy, but most are just silly, synth-laden tunes with okay hooks and entertaining raps. This isn't a five-star album. This isn't a one-star album either.     Better luck next time, Nicki. And, reviewers, stop bitching. Please and thanks.

I give it 3 stars as it its cute, the pacifiers are great and it would make a great baby shower gift...is it practical?

B0043A0U94|5.0|I have a number of Audio Fidelity CD's in my collection and have to say this is one of the better sounding ones I've heard.     This was the first CD Sony released back in 1982, which at the time was a great improvement in technology to my ears. I still have my vinyl copy of this album and if I want to hear it on vinyl I'll pull it out, but this much improved digital album is what I'll most likely reach for.     I realize there is a time and a place for audio freaks to talk about every little part of a release as if the music was released for this small elite group of people who think they \\"know how to listen to music better than most people\\", but the bottom line is this mastering sounds better than the last version Sony released, and the average Billy Joel fan will be more than happy to hear it, while a small group of bitter tech nerds can sit around and bitch about it on the internet.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|This was the first \\"real\\" headset that I purchased for gaming.  I've owned cheaper ones (less than $35 type) and there was no comparison.    PROS:  AMAZING SOUND:  wow, what a immediate difference was noticed in the sound when compared to standard tv speakers.  The bass was pleasing, the \\"surround sound\\" worked well in most situations (not so good for TV viewing...see below).  GAME CHANGING:  Mainly used on COD 2 MW for the PS3...I can't believe the sounds that I could hear when wearing the headset - things I never heard before.  Not to mention the sounds (like footsteps, climbing ladders, landing from a jump, etc) that made a significant strategy advantage during game play.  Truly game changing.  MIC CONTROL:  how nice it is to be able to control chat volume w/o affecting the game play volume.  Turn the mic off completely or just turn the chat volume down - either way, it is controlled separately from game play volume.  NEVER had any complaints about the quality of sound from my mic either.  NOT JUST FOR GAMING:  it was really nice to use these while watching tv late at night - crank up the football game or UFC fights w/o disturbing anyone else.  And it sounded better than my TV speakers as well.      CONS:  COMFORT:  good for about 2 hours on my head (which, as I have been told, is on the large side).  Much more than a couple of hours and a noticeable discomfort began.  Not terrible mind you but certainly an area for improvement.  BUILD:  well, my pair lasted just under 6 months before the headset broke - the area of the headset where the ear piece meets than part that goes over your head.  Granted, it was used daily (between my son and I) for the past 6 months so with that into consideration it's not too bad but I would have liked a little more life out of the build considering the amount we paid for them.    OVERALL - glad I bought them.  Since buying them, I don't ever play the PS3 or hardly watch tv without using a headset.  I got spoiled I guess.  Now to finda replacement pair - hoping to either find a newer model with better build around the earpiece to headpiece area or be  v e r y  careful with the next set that I purchase and hope it lasts a little longer this go around.
B004498KPU|3.0|I went to play the dvd on my standard tv (I do not have a widescreen TV) and noticed black bars on the the sides of the screen.  I am used to black bars appearing on the top and bottom of my screen (widescreen format), but not on the sides.  I attempted to adjust settings on my dvd player, but nothing worked.  I looked on the packaging and it says \\"Formatted for Widescreen Televisions\\".  Are you kidding me?  I now have to watch all of the videos inside of a large black box or buy a brand new TV?    This makes absolutely no sense.  Even largely released moves might be \\"Enhanced for Widescreen TVs\\", but not specifically formatted for them.  This is dissapointing as I cannot enjoy these videos as intended, because they are not being presented as intended.  I could understand if this was a Blu-Ray release, but it isn't, it is just dvd.    I gave 3 stars for it being the most comprehensive collection...to date and I'll eventually get a widescreen TV.  I still think it is absurd that these dvds were released like this.

B00377V6J2|5.0|Just finished watching the DVD for the second time last night. Almost 1 1/2 hours of pure electric blues. I think this is unique. When do you get two blues players like this together \\"in session\\", and preserved like this to enjoy after they are gone? Other reviews are providing a lot of great details so I won't rehash it, but here are some reasons for 5 stars: 1)great picture and sound, 2)including full length uncut songs/jams, 3)pretty good choice of camera shots for the most part, although at times I wanted to see the hands, not just the face, 4)one-of-a-kind session.     I wish ALL available footage was on the DVD, but what is here truly satisfies the craving for unmatched electric blues, and I'm thrilled it was made available, and at a fair price.
B0046MVVOW|1.0|The new songs sound exactly the same as Animal; not in the sense that the songs have a similar style, but in the sense that the beats, choruses, etc. sound exactly the same.  The new songs really show no musical or vocal progression on Ke$ha's part; as a music fan, when examining an artist's sophomore effort versus their initial effort, I expect some type of growth and with Ke$ha I find none at all.  The lead single, We R Who We R, sounds exactly like Tik Tok but isn't as good as her first smash single.      Bottom line: If you have Animal, you basically already have the new songs.  I do not recommend buying this product.
0439796636|5.0|Although this is a children's book, the story seems to be of interest to adults, especially those who may be curious about the use of horses in WWI. It was well-written, interesting, and emotionally moving. The physical book seemed to be of good quality.
B00005V1WO|5.0|I first saw Gothic when I was in college and smack in the middle of my Tortured Romantic phase, traces of which linger to the present day.  The cinematography is very lush and the acting is top-notch.  Repeated viewing shows it stands up to time.  I am glad I purchased this DVD and recommend you do to!
B004CA2HVE|5.0|I purchased this cd when it first came out and everytime I listen to it I hear something different.  It's really a feel good album and Kanye does a great job of capturing the soul and moment in every song, by making you feel the emotion behind everything he's saying.  I strongly suggest this cd to everyone.
B002ZG981E|2.0|This movie is not mind bending at all, this movie is a rip off of Vanilla Sky (Abre Los Ojos) and The Matrix.  I was hoping for a twist at the end so it could save the movie, but that never happened, its very predictable ...halfway thru the movie you'll have an idea of what kind of ending is gonna have.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday is Receiving Horrible Reviews.... GOOD!<br />IS ANYONE REALLY SURPRISED? ANY MALE THAT BUYS THIS CD SHOULD BE SLAPPED ALONG WITH ANYONE WHO GIVES THIS ALBUM MORE THAN 2 STARS \\"2 STARS IS BEING OVERLY NICE\\", MATTER OF FACT ANYONE OVER 16 THAT COPS THIS CD MALE OR FEMALE SHOULD GET THEIR BEHIND BEAT......<br />THINK WE ALL OWE NAS $10.00, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IT WHEN HE SAID HIP HOP WAS DEAD.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I purchased the fan edition of the album from Josh's website. Illuminations for me is a brilliant album by a brilliant singer. Simply stated. But there's more to it. Josh brings out more of his personal side in this album. The songs on this album are so beautiful, and, as I've read, many of them were done in one take, that's amazing and it still sounded incredible. I've been a fan of Josh Groban's for the past 8 years now. I've heard pretty much all of his repertoire and the voice that comes out of that man still is unreal to me, even after all these years. I admire his higher register and his lower register; his range is beyond belief now. Kudos Josh for yet another \\"Illuminating\\" album. Keep the great music coming!
B0035XMGXS|4.0|She saw him live in Detroit, MI, January this year. Then she was after me getting her the album. It is great she says.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|As a long time Accept fan I was somewhat skeptical, until I heard the album. I think this is their best since Balls to the Wall, and possibly the best ever. I won't go into a long tedious review, instead let me just say IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS ALBUM THEN YOU ARE A P*SSY!!!
B004CA8YK2|5.0|This is My favorite Album right now. It has been on repeat for 24 hrs. That said it is a spectacular piece of work. Due to the G.O.O.D. Friday tracks we have heard all of these tunes in some way over the last 13+ weeks,  but they have all been tweaked and re-worked.  It is a feature laden work with Kid Cudi, Jay Z, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John etc. etc.<br />All tracks are good can't say I would skip any as it is best heard from beginning to end.<br />My favorite tracks are<br />All The Lights (massive).<br />Blame Game(slow melancholic)<br />Lost In the World > Who Will Survive in America(Impressive)<br />The Whole CD is Crack.....
B003YWUTJI|5.0|An unheralded release that hopefully will be recognized on the charts.  The collection is a diverse gift of traditional & current works by various artists and enhanced by the melodious voice of Norah Jones.  Another positive note is - the disc is FULL!  Just wonderful to listen to over and over...
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford:  The Second Season is a pleasant return to a gentle, comforting and occasionally humorous town and its inhabitants.   I'm looking forward to the third season.
B000002TP7|5.0|Immediately after placing my order I received an email to confirm the order was received and that it would be shipped immediately. Excellent communication from seller:)
B003H9MSPG|4.0|It came within 4 working days to our home in the UK! The darts go further without the barrel attached, but they are more accurate and the gun looks better with the gun attached! Simple design, and great looks make this one of my favourite nerf guns!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Al I can say is WOW! This set is phenomenal! The greatest blu-ray set yet? YES!     I ordered mine from the UK (Amazon UK)and saved $32 at the time(now still $12). Set arrived in 8 days and I was watching ALIEN (Ab-FAB!)last night on my SONY BDP-S370 with NO problems (latest firmware installed, 2gb USB plugged in, connected to internet). Load time was around 1 minute for each disc. The \\"Disc Unbound\\" feature worked as advertised and decreased the load times on subsequent discs to about 25 secs. All of the features, sound, and video worked flawlessly. I noticed no issues or problems that others have complained about on the US version. I did find the accordion-like disc holder to be a bit unruly, but the discs are kept nicely protected in the snap holders, unlike the US digi-book where they just slip in and out of the paper (increasing the chance of scratch damage).    MU-TH-ER mode looks amazing and I look forward to giving it and the 64hrs of bonus material a work out in the near future. ALIEN looked like I was watching it on release day in the theater(except better!). The Ridley intro was cool and made me anxious for the prequel to come.     Well, I am excited to watch ALIENS tonite, so off I go. Cheers, Fox!
B0049VQZUA|5.0|Even if Zombie flicks have NO appeal to you, this show is so well done I can't imagine anyone not appreciating the story. I can't get enough. I'll buy this season and every other they make of it. 10 out of 10.
B004498KPU|3.0|For anybody that was fine with the quality of the videos on other collections, you'll be okay, but if somebody is expecting pristine, hi-def quality remasters of the videos, prepare to be disappointed.  I don't know what qualifies as remastering the videos (as the sticker on the front of this proclaims), but I was disappointed.  Some of the videos look better than others, but I fail to believe that they went back to source materials to remaster many if any of these.  I have the previous DVDs and don't really see much of an improvement.  Also, all of the clips from Moonwalker look like they just ripped them from a VHS copy.  In fact, at the end of Speed Demon, there's even some good old fashioned tape stretch distortion at the bottom of the screen.  A really half-assed effort.    To be fair though, the audio sounds better than before.    Also, aside from the missing full-length Ghosts mini-movie that others have already advised of, this collection is far from complete.    I've listed the tracks below with reference to previous availability.  Please note that all references to previous DVDs and availability are based on Region 1 DVD only.  If abbreviated, the titles refer to the \\"Dangerous: The Short Films\\" collection (DSF), \\"HISTORY on Film\\" volumes 1 & 2 (HOF1 & HOF2), and the \\"Number Ones\\" (N1s) collection.    ===================================================  ===================================================    01 Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough  --- Same as on previous DVD collections (HoF1 & N1s).    02 Rock With You  --- Same as on previous DVD collections (HoF1 & N1s).    03 She's Out of My Life  --- Previously unavailable on DVD.    04 Billie Jean  --- Same as on previous DVD collections (HoF1 & N1s).    05 Beat It  --- Same as on previous DVD collections (HoF1, HoF2 & N1s).    06 Thriller  --- Same as on previous DVD collections (HoF1, HoF2 & N1s).    07 Bad (full-length version)  --- Same as on \\"HIStory on Film\\" volume 1 DVD.  --- The shorter edit is available on the \\"Number Ones\\" DVD.    08 The Way You Make Me Feel (full-length version)  --- Same as on \\"HIStory on Film\\" volume 1 DVD.  --- A shorter edit is available on the \\"Number Ones\\" DVD.    09 Man in the Mirror  --- From Moonwalker. Same as on the \\"Number Ones\\" DVD.    10 Dirty Diana  --- From Moonwalker. Same as on the \\"Number Ones\\" DVD.    11 Smooth Criminal (Moonwalker version)  --- Same as on \\"HIStory on Film\\" volume 2 DVD.  --- The \\"blurry\\" MTV video version was on the \\"Number Ones\\" DVD.  --- For reference, the actual Moonwalker film version has a little bit more footage in the middle interlude when everybody's snapping their fingers and moaning, but it's never been on DVD in that form in Region 1.    12 Another Part of Me (live recording)  --- Not previously available on DVD.    13 Speed Demon  --- From Moonwalker. Not previously available on DVD.    14 Come Together  --- From Moonwalker. Not previously available on DVD.    15 Leave Me Alone  --- From Moonwalker.

It replaces some of the shots with footage of Michael with big angel wings.    29 Earth Song  --- Same as on previous DVD collections (HoF2 & N1s)    30 They Don't Care About Us (brazil version)  --- Same as on the \\"HIStory on Film\\" volume 2 DVD.    31 Stranger in Moscow  --- Same as on the \\"HIStory on Film\\" volume 2 DVD.    32 Blood on the Dance Floor (Refugee Camp Remix)  --- Same as on the \\"HIStory on Film\\" volume 2 DVD.  --- The video of the album version is available on the \\"Number Ones\\" DVD.    33 Ghosts  --- As stated in other reviews, this is not the full mini-movie that incorporated 3 songs from the Blood on the Dance Floor EP.  In fact, this is not even just the Ghosts segment/dance routine as many, including myself, assumed it would be.  This is an edit of footage from the Ghosts mini-movie set to the song.  It's mostly the dance number, but throws in other footage in such a way that, unless you've watched the original version online or through imported copies, it will make little-to-no sense at all.  They didn't even keep the footage of Michael doing the Rihanna \\"Single Ladies\\" walk/dance move that he did first.  A real disappointment.    34 You Rock My World (full-length version)  --- Not previously available on DVD.  --- An edited version, trimming off about 4 minutes, was on the \\"Number Ones\\" DVD.    35 Cry  --- Not previously available on DVD.    36 Blame it on the Boogie  --- Not previously available on DVD.    37 Enjoy Yourself  --- Not previously available on DVD.    38 Can You Feel It  --- Not previously available on DVD.    39 Say Say Say  --- Not previously available on DVD (at least not a Michael Jackson one).    40 They Don't Care About Us (prison version)  --- Not previously available on DVD.    41 Why?  --- Not previously available on DVD.    42 One More Chance  --- Not previously available on DVD.      Also, the following footage from previous DVDs is also not on this set:    HIStory on Film, Volume 2:  --- The \\"Brace Yourself\\" montage.  Also on \\"HIStory on Film\\" volume 1.  --- The \\"Billie Jean\\" live Motown 25th Anniversary performance.  --- The HIStory Teaser (showing the armies marching and the statues)  --- Michael's MTV 1995 VMA performance.    DANGEROUS SHORT FILMS:  --- The \\"Heal the World\\" live Superbowl performance.  --- The \\"Dangerous\\" montage sequence.  --- Behind-the-scenes footage for almost every Dangerous video
0061733199|3.0|The book is well put together but I feel 80% of it is common sense. If you have absolutely no outdoor skill then this might be just the ticket. If you've spent very much time without a roof over your head then you might be the slightest bit disappointed.
B000093BDX|1.0|It's surprising to me that no one mentioned the key reason this is an unsatisfactory collection ... the songs are not complete.  The songs only last 1:30 - 2:30 minutes ... very odd and very frustrating.  I have no problem with the selections, but to have entire verses cut out makes me crazy.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This album along with Kanye's GOOD FRIDAY releases is a breath of fresh air with everything else out there. Kanye has it all, he understands good music and how much is needed to go into it. He's the artist that always gets tempted but in the end never falls and that's why people still love him. He got a lot of flak for his last album, but I believe it was needed for him to transition and further develop his versatility. You can tell that this album has elements from all his past albums working together. He is really in his own class now.    I really like:  Dark Fantasy  All of the Lights  So Appalled  Runaway  Lost in the World    Also, if you get a chance to see his Runaway short movie, check it out. It is a display of the genius and how all the music in the album melds together in Kanye's eyes. What is most surprising is Kanye's eye for tasteful art, and not just music, but choreography, symbolism, etc. Every song can stand on it's own, but together they are something else... the world may never see another kanye again so appreciate his talent while he is still here.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|I am a fan of the franchise so it stands to reason I should have this. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as it left a lot to the imagination but I have to believe, at some point, some of the questions I have after watching this will be answered in subsequent movies. It let's you know that the Predator franchise is not going anywhere and there is more to come. I can hardly wait.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|20th Century Fox's 1947 Miracle on 34th Street has become a staple for the holiday season.  It has a warm charm to its mystical allure.    As everyone knows, it's a story of belief.  A single mother, Doris Walker, is raising her 8-year old daughter, Susan, without the assistance of make-believe or her former husband.    Along comes an old man with a glint in his eyes for the miracle of Christmas.  He audaciously declares that he is Kris Kringle, the original who just happens to work in Macy's Department Store as Santa Claus.    Mr. Kringle has come to New York City to confront the commercialization of Christmas. As he states to Doris Walker:    \\"For the past 50 years or so I've been getting more and more worried about Christmas. Seems we're all so busy trying to beat the other fellow in making things go faster and look shinier and cost less that Christmas and I are sort of getting lost in the shuffle.\\"    Of course, she finds him amusing until her daughter begins to believe that he is the real thing. Toss in the store psychologist with a Scrooge demeanor and you have a story which plays out in a courtroom. The judge wishes he had never gotten this case on his docket, with an ambitious district attorney who wants to make a name for himself.    It has a great cast. A historical note: it was released to the public on May 2, 1947 because Darryl F. Zanuck, studio head, believed the ticket sales would be better in Summer than late Fall and Winter. He had grave reservations about the film. The original trailer in the winter of 1947 was vague about what the film actually was.    It was nominated for best picture.  It won Oscars for best supporting actor, screenplay and original story.    \\"Faith is believing when common sense tells you not to. Don't you see? It's not just Kris that's on trial, it's everything he stands for. It's kindness and joy and love and all the other intangibles.\\"
B004498KPU|5.0|Omg, this is the best Michael Jackson dvd collection ever! It truly captures what a an amazingly talent man Michael Jackson was! I get chills just watching him perform! As soon as I got this on Monday, I played all the dvds for hours. Again, this is the best MJ collection ever.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|If I could I would give it ZERO stars because it tells you nothing.<br /><br />This isn't a lesson on economics.  It's a propaganda film attempting to cover-up the government regulations that caused this mess and twisting it up by showing the symptoms and placing the sole blame on bankers and Wall St.  Sure they are partially to blame.  But ultimately it was government interference in the free marketplace that is the absolute root cause.  It is commonly refered to as the unintended consequences of leftwing Democrat Party policies and thier socialising risk mentality with Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac - quasigovernment agencies with Barney Frank at the helm.<br /><br />For the truth about what transpired you need to read books.<br />I suggest you start here: [[ASIN:0465019862 The Housing Boom and Bust: Revised Edition]]<br /><br />For the really BIG picture read and watch The [[ASIN:B00006HAZF Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy]]
081297381X|5.0|The author has written a solid book.  It is a sharply argued, and the author rightly comes across as confident, with a low tolerance for those he considers off base.  Though the basic concepts of the book could be summarized in a few paragraphs, one does not tire of the various ways NNT explains his ideas and refutes accepted, established theory.  It is always refreshing to have someone point out and question the basic validity of widely accepted assumptions.
B003WTE886|5.0|Great CD for the WHOLE family (which is rare these day).  Songs are fun and make you want to dance.  Few artist can do it all these days and Taylor is a rare one.  Keep them coming!
B000UBN22M|5.0|CCR was a group of talented musicians and their music continues to live on. During the time in our country when Vietnam and the protest movement was going on, this music reflects the feelings or many in this nation. Timeless tradition....To get the entire album for $1.99 - what a STEAL.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Second CD I own of Taylor Swifts and was not let down.  great songs with singable melodies.  Now i know why she wins all those awards.  Seems really humble as well.  Good for her.
B003LR4QPE|5.0|For most of us who have been salivating for a rerelease of Hanssler's complete Bach edition, this is a momentous occasion.  That being said, the discs are packaged in a flip-top box which is not as sturdy as it could be - careless handling (both in transit and in use) will result in splitting the seams of the box top, which is sad for a set of this caliber and worth.  [This is similar to packaging issues on several recent box sets which used similar flip-top boxes, like the Chandos box and the Miles Davis Columbia Album Collection].  I received two in damaged condition and am still working through getting a satisfactory item.  Once I do, I plan to revel in the glories of J.S. for all of 2011 (Merry Christmas to me!)...
0385523912|5.0|This book is unbelievable.   It was refered by Amazon and I ordered it.  It realy explains why things are going as they are in North Korea.  This is a MUST read for anyone who wants to know what and why things are as they are in that part of our world.  Once  started it, I could not put it down
B003NFM3JU|5.0|When I heard Jim Carrey was going to voice Scrooge I feared that he would make the character over the top.  Well that was completely unfounded as Carrey gives an utterly amazing performance. It is understated and just perfectly captures the character.  The Blu Ray 3D effects are pretty much the same as in the theatrical version.  They never overshadow the movie but instead add depth and beauty to it. Really an instant classic.
0316010669|4.0|I enjoyed Blink's concept which is based on a theory someone can learn in a psychology course. Basically, the author states that people can make snap decisions that are just as good as thought out decisions. The rational is that the human leverages the knowledge is learned throughout their life and subconsciously processing these decisions without knowing. I am not sure if I completely buy into this theory however, the author provides back-up to reinforce his points. I think this book would be an interesting read for some and should be considered if you are looking for something different to read.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|[[ASIN:B002KSPKRS Ear Force X41 (XBOX LIVE Chat + Wireless Digital RF Game Audio with Dolby Headphone 7.1 Surround Sound)]]      this is really good for an hour or two left ear hurts after that maybe its just me but overall i love it would loved it if they had used 3 AAA bat because that way we would get a bit more louder sound need just a bit more  but still love it over the wired headset left that after the first try but yea this one is well worth lying to the wife's that it is only 60 bucks lol keep me from getting it if she knew it is 150 plus
1401309666|5.0|The long tail was basically about the economics of scale and how companies are becoming profitable on products that were otherwise deemed unprofitable or were difficult to make profitable. This new profitability has come to fruition due to the internet. The book goes on to detail how this phenomena came to fruition and how companies have leveraged it. This book would be good for business people in small to large businesses even if they are aware of how to leverage the internet. It provides a good back ground and examples to support the author's position. However, I think Anderson's second book Free would better help a business person compete in today's environment.
B003WTE886|5.0|i love this CD so much!!!! would buy again!!! i love all the songs except \\"revenge\\" not one of my favorites. And what's funny is I'm not a big country singer fan. but this is a real jewel of a CD she's done real well for herself and thats hard to do anymore and from what i can tell she seems to be a real down to earth kinda girl... this is a CD for all ages.
B00005JNS0|5.0|He's been watching in every day for the past week and he LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it.  I would definitelly recommend it.
0807014273|5.0|This is the absolute best book that I have ever read.  There are so many great quotes in this book to apply to every day life.  It really helps you change your perspective of thinking when dealing with tough times.  Amazing book!  I recommend it to my friends constantly.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Let's face it...female MCs have to be that much greater than their male counterparts to be credible.  It's not right, but it's a fact.  While Nicki has shown moments of greatness in a few of her countless guest appearances over the past year, these types of moments are too sparse and scattered in this debut outing to establish her credibility as a stand-alone MC.   I thought this album would be her Hardcore, Il Na Na or Ruff Ryders' First Lady (I'm not even going to mention the Ms. Hill's debut in this context); however, Pink Friday plays as more of a mix between  Ms. Jade's (google her lol) \\"Girl Interrupted\\" and Lil Mama's \\"Voice of the Young People\\".  Yeah...just not quite..never really...yeah, forgettable.     I'm not going to give up on her yet but she still has a lot to show and prove before she even deserves to be mentioned with the likes of Kim Jones, Fox Boogie, Eve, et al.     P.S.  If you want a real hip hop album, I encourage you to cop Kanye's MBDTF. Real talk, you won't be disappointed.
0143145088|5.0|Daniel Pink delivers again!  This book not only gives the reader some valuable insight into their own work ethic and motivations, it could be an invaluable tool for any manager who has direct contact with his staff. Pink provides a persuasive argument for learning how to get peak performance from your team by understanding how different personality types see their job and what really motivates them.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I purchased this movie because I first rented it and found it to be so encouraging and very well done.  Anyone would love this fabulous movie!
0312600844|3.0|I expected to love FREEDOM because THE CORRECTIONS had in its day been one of my favorite novels; because I'd read the first two chapters in the New Yorker and they'd been standouts in that elite fictional environment; and above all because I'd heard that the human-precipitated collapse of the ecosystem was a major theme in FREEDOM.    The first chapter of Freedom didn't disappoint, full of Franzen's sweetly snarky descriptions of the gentrifying middle class circa 1980's:    \\"There were... more contemporary questions, like, what about those cloth diapers? Worth the bother?... Was bulgur really necessary?... How to respond when a person of color accused you of destroying the neighborhood?... Was it better to offer panhandlers food, or nothing?.... Could coffee beans be ground the night before, or did this have to be done in the morning?\\"    I enjoyed this perfect skewering of a lifestyle in which moral questions about charity and gentrification carry the same weight as decisions about when to grind the coffee beans. I 'd already read B. R. Meyers review of FREEDOM in which he criticized Franzen's language for being \\"strenuously contemporary and therefore juvenile\\" but I have no objections to the easy way Franzen's prose slides from eye to brain, going down like a good Gewurztraminer, its fruity sweetness balanced by a little phenolic bitterness and hiding a suprising alcoholic punch. The first sign of trouble came with the second chapter, the one in which Franzen's heroine Patty experiences date rape by the son of a prominent family and lack of support from her own parents. Like the first chapter, I'd already read it in the New Yorker, but unlike the first chapter, I couldn't get myself to reread it. It was hard to believe that the same author who in the first chapter described Patty's neighbor as someone who \\"had formerly been active with the SDS in Madison and was now very active in the craze for Beaujolais nouveau\\" opened his second chapter with \\"If Patty weren'tan atheist, she would thank the good Lord for school athletic programs, because they basically saved her life and gave her a chance to realize herself as a person.\\" Realizing themselves as people isn't something I expect (or look forward to) from Franzen's characters.    Self-realizing Patty is the main problem with FREEDOM, because the only thing she ends up realizing after a lifetime of marriage, motherhood, and an illicit love affair with her husband's best friend is that she'd rather be dead than single. But Patty's an Amazon compared to creepy Connie, who atones for her small sexual rebellion against Patty's son Joey by cutting her arms and giving Joey all of her college trust fund money. This so excites Joey that he marries Connie. Because the author doesn't seem to realize how creepy these relationships are, it makes him seem a little creepy too. The only major female character in FREEDOM who has anything going for her is Patty's husband Walter's young lover Lalitha, who though she works for, has sex with, and adores Walter, is at least better at her job than Walter is at his. Which I suspect is why she had to die, the literary fate of far too many interesting women.    In Franzen's THE CORRECTIONS, mom Edith, Patty's analogue in Franzen's family mythology, discovers after forty or so years of marriage that life without her husband is better than life with him, and daughter Denise discovers she loves being a chef more than she likes being to married to one, and that sex with her boss's wife is much better than sex with him. How did Franzen go from these often disagreeable but always fascinating women to the insipid female doormats in FREEDOM? Perhaps because his world view has changed from a Marxist-tinged critique of capitalism and consumer culture to a deeply pessimistic sociobiological view of the human species. in FREEDOM, Franzen isn't wondering whether or not we use our freedom wisely, but if we have any, or whether we're merely evolutionary automata with the probably catastrophic agenda of reproducing our own species at all costs. From this perspective, Patty makes sense. She's one of those socially monogamous birds who mates with the less attractive yet responsible male (Walter) who will help her raise her nestlings, but sneaks off at the first opportunity to have sex with the stronger more colorful male (Richard) who is too busy having sex with lots of chicks to settle down. Makes me wonder if the reason Patty's so in love with her son Joey is that there's something she isn't telling Walter and Franzen isn't telling us about Joey's actual paternity. But even sociobiology can't explain why Joey is so attracted to Connie, who couldn't survive on her own long enough to raise a hamster.    At this point in his career, Franzen doesn't seem to like women any better than Tolstoy did, perhaps placing most of the blame for the destruction of his beloved songbirds on the reproductive agendas of human females. I know just how he feels. But this avian alienation of Franzen's affections presents him with a perhaps insurmountable novelistic problem: how to engage human readers in the plight of a non-verbal species? Franzen hasn't solved it in FREEDOM, whose women annoy and whose men fail to engage my emotions. But there are moments that bring me around to loving FREEDOM. These come when Franzen writes about what he really cares about, which isn't Patty:    \\"It was the season of migration, of flight and song and sex...Terns came up from one subarctic to the other, swifts took airborne naps and never landed, song-filled thrushes waited for a southern wind and then flew nonstop for twelve hours.... High-rises and power lines and wind turbines and cellphone towers and road traffic mowed down millions of migrants, but millionis more made it through, many of them returning to the very same trees they'd nested in the year before... and there, if they were male, began to sing. Each year, they arrived to find more of their former homes paved over for parking lots or highways... Migrants exhausted by their five-thousand-mile journey competed with earlier arrivals for the remaining scraps of territory; they searched in vain for a mate, they gave up on nesting.... they were killed for sport by free-roaming cats.\\"    FREEDOM's worth reading in spite of its flaws because Franzen has had the courage to write a big readable naturalistic novel with a social agenda, the kind of novel Sinclair Lewis used to write, a style of writing that's so out of style that I for one am extremely grateful that a writer as talented as Franzen is trying to keep it alive.
B0045VZSB6|5.0|The price was a great deal for this Disney classic. My daughter loved it; she little when it first came out and it was a favorite of hers then.  The seller shipped quickly, which was great.
0446520950|5.0|This book was in incredible condition.  Great service and well packaged for shipping.  Extremely pleased with the book and transaction.  Would most definitely return to this seller for future books.
0425166805|3.0|I've a strong interest in the \\"ancient astronauts\\" theory, and this is book is arguably the one that started the whole thing. But having just re-read it after many years, I was left feeling distinctly under-impressed. The book is rambling, disjointed, repetitive, and contains hundreds of unanswered questions. True, von Däniken claims that his purpose was to merely raise the questions rather than provide answers, but it does leave you feeling that you've only read half a book. The way he presents his theories is often sketchy and vague. He doesn't care to consider in any depth what the *purpose* of the extraterrestrial visitors might have been, he is content mainly to claim evidence of their presence. Some of his predictions, such as the human Mars landings, are way off the mark. Moreover, there are many ideas presented in the book but little actual science. His constant pointing out that the American space programme was for a long time based mainly on the work of Nazi scientists is, however, amusing.    The new introduction written by the author is almost laughable. Aside from attempting to riposte a few very specific criticisms of some of his claims, it adds very little to the book.     I'm giving this book 3 stars because of its significance - it set the ball rolling. But if you want a much more detailed, well-rounded, well-researched, thoughtful and better-written survey of our possible ET origins and links, including considerable coverage of the important Sumerian mythology, you'd do much better to read William Bramley's \\"The Gods of Eden\\".
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I truly reccomend this version! The screenplay is close to the book. Everything is in the spirit of Austen. The acting is superb and the characters really make you feel like you are watching not only a piece of history but also a story that is familiar. I am quite pleased with it.
0786868724|5.0|Mitch Alborn has written a number of interesting books that could actually be considered short stories.  His best known may be TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, which is a biographical recount of his relationship with a favorite University professor who is enjoying every minute of his life despite an illness that will soon claim it.<br /><br />HAVE A LITTLE FAITH has some of these same personal insights, as the now 80 year old religious leader of Alborn's childhood asks if Alborn will conduct his eulogy at the appropriate time.  Alborn is puzzled, as they  have had little interaction in more than 25 years since Alborn moved from NY to Detroit, but the story evolves into one the reader will appreciate and ponder.  There are some very different aspects in this story when compared to MORRIE, but the ability of the author to move the reader to contrast some of their own personal insights make this well worth the time to read.<br /><br />There are some puzzling segments in the book, but I strongly recommend this to anyone over the age of forty. Life moves at different speeds for each of us and the interaction of the three major characters in this story makes one consider personal values, commitments and life assessments.<br /><br />As always, comments are always appreciated and valued.<br /><br />John Hogan<br />HospitalityEducators<br />HoganHospitality
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I can't begin to tell you how amazing this movie is. All of the other comments are true, it's something you have to experience for yourself to realize how... almost \\"life changing,\\" it is, especially if you were a 5-year old like I was when I first saw this.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|This book was a HUGE disappointment.  I have read all of David Baldacci's books and this one was a real \\"downer\\".  It just dragged on and on with little action until the very end and that was quickly dispatched with.  I waited such a long time for this book and loved the previous Camel Club group and all of the other Baldacci books.  I hope this is an anomoly and that his next book is back to his previous form. I'm not sorry that I bought it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Christopher Nolan is a genius. In Batman Begins, we didn't see Batman until an hour into the movie which is usually a bad sign. However, Nolan was doing something that was never dealt with completely in other Batman movies and that is the origin story which was very well done. Well, Batman Begins was hailed as Batman's comeback but how do you top that? Can it be topped? The answer is YES.<br /><br />  Unless your a Batman fan, you'd never know that The Dark Knight was a Batman movie and why Nolan chose to take that out of the title is anyone's guess but it really doesn't matter as this is the film BATMAN fans have been waiting for. This is a film that really explores the real batman and who he is as a character. This is more of a psychological film for Batman thanks in part to the Joker played by the wonderful late Heath Ledger.<br /><br />  When Ledger was first cast, many wondered how he could top Nicholson's performance. It's hard to compare because they are two different types of movies with the 89 version showing Joker's origin and Nolan's showing him already as a lunatic psychopathic guy. Ledger really gave it his all in the role and if this was his final performance (It's not that went to Dr Parnassus)he went out on top. This was the role of his career and one of the best. Ledger will always be known for it.<br /><br />  Anyway, Joker plays with Batman's mind alot here and none more so then with the police interrogation scene where Batman is seen as an angry pistoff guy who really, really wants to kill Joker right then and there but his morals won't allow it.  It is a very, very strong and powerful scene and well done by Bale and Ledger.<br /><br /> There's so much going on story wise that it's sometimes hard to keep track of what's what but it does top Begins in every single way possible. Christopher Nolan has reinvigorated the character by doing what he wants and not listening to the fans. He chooses the villains based on the story and based on where Batman is right now. He feels (and I agree) that villains need to test superheroes and Batman, in my opinion, is more of a psychological character. He's not really a superhero. Maybe misunderstood. Maybe a vigilante. Maybe, as Bruce Wayne said in Batman Begins \\"he's just a nut in a costume with issues\\".<br /><br />The Dark Knight excels on every level possible that I can go on and on in this review but I won't. I'll just say that The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made and should be considered a classic. I consider it one of Nolan's masterpieces right up there with INCEPTION and I can't wait to see what he has up his sleeve for Batman's final act.agree) that villains need to test superheroes and Batman, in my opinion, is more of a psychological character.

B00408MS5S|2.0|I had high hopes for this release since I've had very good luck with all of Universal's other Deluxe Editions, but unfortunately, this one ended that win streak. This version is overly bright and suffers from digititis, much like the previous remaster, but not quite as severe.<br /><br />If you already own a previous version and are simply looking for an upgrade in sound, I can see no reason for you to spend your good money on this since you already own something that sounds similar to (2002 remaster) or better than (MFSL or the original CD version) this release. The original CD release, and especially the MFSL version, are vastly superior to this - pretty disappointing since even the reining champ, the MFSL release, sounds like it could be significantly improved upon. Maybe next time...
1932100660|1.0|If Dr Campbell promotes moral or environmental reasons for going vegan, I'd congratulate him. But he is promoting it as the ultimate diet for humans.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his advice that we should go vegan is not backed by his own study.<br /><br />After reading this book, I went to find the actual study (the monograph \\"Diet, Life-style and Mortality in China\\") and there were many holes in his hypothesis. There was no correlation between animal protein and disease! I also found conflicting evidence in science journals. He ignored contrary results and left out data that did not support his view.<br /><br />What I find disturbing is, this book is for the general public and will affect the dietary choices of many people. Most people don't have the time to research these facts for themselves so he takes advantage of that (but if you do, PLEASE go check the information for yourselves before making a decision on removing meat entirely for health reasons). Critical thinking is important.<br /><br />Anyway, here are the problems with the information in this book:<br />- This study was an observational study. Problems with studies like these, it doesn't prove causality. Even with that, the results showed no correlation. In fact, it revealed that wheat had a stronger correlation than animal protein intake - which of couse, he left out of the book.<br /><br />- Casein in milk, he demonstrated, causes cancer. But he also left out feeding SUGAR along with the protein. Sugar has been shown to promote tumor growth. He also didn't mention that casein is not consumed isolated in nature (human breast milk has casein too, should we ban that too?)<br /><br />- He cited an Indian study that showed rats taking 20% casein with the toxin aflatoxin will develop cancer whereas rats taking 5% casein did not. He just forgot to mention that the rats on the low casein diet died after 6 months. While the 20% casein rats lived for 2 years.<br /><br />- Protein from plants can also be \\"complete proteins\\" if you eat a wide variety of plant foods, based on Campbell's conclusions that complete protein like animal proteins can cause cancer, that must apply to plant proteins as well.<br /><br />- He says \\"..there is a mountain of scientific evidence to show that the healthiest diet you can possibly consume is a high-carbohydrate diet\\". Actually, clinical studies show the opposite - that high carb diets (particularly refined carbs) are bad for diabetics, those who are obese, those with metabolic syndrome and some even show that it's bad for people with heart disease.<br /><br />- He links total cholesterol with cancer mortality rates. Researchers still have trouble proving high cholesterol is associated with heart disease let alone cancer! (high triglycerides, with high VLDL and low HDL are better indicators than cholesterol. In fact, 50% of people who develop heart disease have mid to LOW cholesterol levels).<br /><br />- He says overall, the more meat the Chinese consume, the higher the cancer rates. But unfortunately, he left out the county of Tuoli (as demonstrated by Denise Minger) a county with high consumption of meat AND dairy enjoyed ironically low incidences of cancer. The Masai, the Eskimos and even the French with their diets of high fat or dairy and animal protein have good health (low rates of heart disease, low cancer rates, low obesity).<br /><br />- He believes that the lower rates of cancer among the Chinese compared to Americans must be due to their diet of low animal protein. It is well known that calorie restriction in animals and even in humans can improve health and longevity. This was shown during the world wars when food was rationed, rates of cancer and other diesases fell! The China study was done in the mid 1970's to 1980s - the tailend of the mass starvation of the Chinese before the Mao government loosened its grip on capitalism in the late 80s. For decades prior to the China Study, many counties had little food to eat. Ask any Chinese baby boomer from China and they can tell you how poor they were as children. I've heard stories of people eating roots and bark from trees out of desperation. Meat was highly valued and hard to come by. So the whole notion that the Chinese CHOSE to be vegans is insulting.<br /><br />- Campbell makes it out as though we should all eat like the Chinese, for disease-free long life. Go find the statistics for longevity of the Chinese and you'll find the average life expectancy of the Chinese is lower than Americans. Yes, you heard right. You can check this yourself online. In fact, the countries with the highest life expectancy are the ones who consume the highest intake of fat and meat. It is a myth that the Japanese centenarians in Okinawa eat a low fat diet. They eat plenty of fish and seafood and their dishes are greasy.<br /><br />There are more inconsistencies with the information. But you get the point. Before anyone accuses me of being a Campbell basher, think about this: he is SELLING a book, he has his reputation to defend, I don't sell anything, I'm not associated with the meat industry (I dislike them in fact), I bought this book (verified by Amazon) and giving an honest review without vegan-rose-colored-glasses on. I read it with an open mind and came out disappointed and mildly disgusted. Why? Because his suggestions may cause harm to his readers.<br /><br />I'm not suggesting we go and eat as much factory farmed meat as we want. But free range, organic grass fed meat is healthy - high in omega3, low in omega6, low e.coli count, higher vitamin A and vitamin D in organs.<br /><br />My review is not an attack on Dr Campbell as a person. I have not made any personal remarks about him. Nor am I attacking veganism or vegetarianism. I think they're morally valid ways to eat that work for some people. What I am attacking is the information, the content and what adverse affects it could have on people's health.<br /><br />If you're hell bent on giving veganism a go, please take out sugar, refined wheat and Western tofu products from your diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - read it, check the facts and judge it for yourself.inese baby boomer from China and they can tell you how poor they were as children.

B004927I50|5.0|Taylor Swift is a breath of fresh air.  This is her third CD (not including her Christmas CD), and there is still nothing inappropriate in the entire bunch.  I have a few daughters, and they all love pop music, but it is getting harder and harder to find a singer whose material pleases us all.  Taylor Swift has never dissapointed either my daughters or me.  Speak Now continues Taylor's tradition of using her music to tell her stories, and they are stories to which most of us can relate.  Taylor speaks about the angst of coming of age and trying to find love, and she does it beautifully.  Speak Now is a compilation of 14 (or 20, depending on the edition) songs, each one telling a story in a format that will delight her target audience of teenage girls and at the same time welcome their moms to listen in and enjoy it with them.    Thanks again, Taylor!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I purchased the swivel sweeper to use on my kitched/diging area tile floors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-- long battery life. I think I only have to charge it once every week to 10 days. When the battery gets low, it's doesnt swep as well, but it still works.<br />-- swivel action. Works extremely well around our dining room chairs and registers. The head even fits behind the toilet and in between the wall and floor registers.<br />-- price. I picked this up for under 20 bucks. Unless you are a super cost-conscious shopper I don't think you can find any fault in spending this for what you get.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  handle is a bit undersized for the head. I can picture it getting loose and wobbly down the road but thus far, I've had no problems.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone not wanting to break out the broom and dustpan each time there is a little mess to clean. This obviously wasn't designed to clean an entire house like a vacuum is. For the money, I'd say the return on investment is excellent!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|It was GREAT!  My mother had watched it years ago and so we both split the price so that she could see it again and so I could watch it for the first time and LOVED it!!!!    HIGHLY recommended!!!!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|ok, if you are a fan of Avatar, and I mean the fan that watches it more than once and most likely went to the re-release in the Theater in Aug to see the extended version, and loved THAT and still wanted more?? THIS GIVES YOU MORE. more scenes and some behind the scences/making of! ANDthere are 3 versions of the movie in this set..the original movie version released in theaters, the extended version released in theaters, *AND* a \\"collector's extended version\\" NOT released in theaters but has more of the movie in it! whole scenes that were cut out (that I think made it better), portions of scenes that didn't even make it into version #2 that added more depth to the movie;(like what happened to Nyteri's sister). I watched it last night and it is better than the original. If you are a big fan of this movie, you will be happy with this collection.      **NOTE this set is NOT in 3D, (I saw that in the theater too, it was...distracting...you couldn't see anything in the peripherals of the scenes...) but it is still so very vibrant and enthralling, you won't miss the 3D
B00005JLIU|5.0|When I saw this movie, I thought it was wonderful! It was cast perfectly, and the acting was great, the music is wonderful, and overall the movie is a lot of fun! I can now understand why this was turned into a Broadway show. There's lots of laughs while watching this movie, and you just feel so good by the end of the movie.

B00428CCPW|5.0|This album is by far the best of all of Taylor's albums. Not to say her other albums, \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Taylor Swift\\" are bad, they are also great albums, but Taylor really grows as an artist with each album, and does what a true musician should do: Release a new album that is better than your previous. All of the songs on \\"Speak Now\\" were written by Taylor Swift herself, which for a 20 year old artist, that is a big thing. Especially since most of the super popular artists out now don't write their own music. The album is about her past relationships, life experiences and also things friends of her experienced. The message of the album is to \\"Speak Now\\", and not hold back, it's about taking chances, and tells a story about growing up, and living life, and of course, relationships. I would recommend this album to everyone, definitely one of my favorite albums of the year!
B003YBNREI|5.0|I've been a HUGE Doobie Brothers fan since their very first album.  This album not only exceeded my expectations, but I think it's the best new album (from anyone) I've heard in many many years!  Pure Doobie Brother's Rock n' Roll along with blues, latin, jazz and a couple beautiful ballads.  I highly recommend this album to anyone thinking about buying it.  My only complaint is that I wanted more!  The Doobies are still and always will be my favorite all time band - Rock on!
B003L77TZI|4.0|After listening to Katy's first album over and over and over the past few years, I was really looking forward to a follow-up album. This albums doesn't disappoint. I will admit, when I heard it the first time all the way through, I though it was just okay, but after listening a few more times, the album really grew on me and now I love it! I think Katy did a great job on this album, and I'm looking forward to hearing more from her in the future.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This is an amazing album! I recommend everyone to buy it and really listen. It shows Nicki Minaj's growth as an artist. There is something for everyone on this album, no matter what type of music you like.  Also for the boys, don't be afraid to buy it, because I feel that you will like it too.
0525951652|5.0|Fascinating story of people and events surrounding WWI. A very interesting chronicle of the events that changed the world forever from the viewpoints of distinct classes of people that existed in Europe prior to the \\"Great War.\\" I was sorry when the book ended and am looking forward to the next story in this trilogy.
B00008A7QK|5.0|The songwriting on this C.D. is simply exquisite. Marc Bolan's T.Rex sounds so fresh and energetic and raw.  The music definitely shines today and fits  with today's music. He was grossly underestimated in the states in the 70's. The song,\\"Cosmic Dancer' is haunting because he says \\"I danced myself into the tomb, Is it strange to die so soon?\\"  As you probably know Marc always felt he'd die in a car crash before he was thirty and he did in 1977. His guitar work is at his best during this period. \\"Girl\\" is gorgeous and\\"Lean Woman blues' is a blues rocker. This is, in my opinion is tied with \\"Slider\\" as the two best T.Rex records or C.D's.
B003XTUZIM|5.0|Islands wasn't my favorite KC record, but it's one of them now!  Amazing work re-mixing this from the old 40 year old tapes.   What I like the most about this album and the 3 other 5.1 mixes is how faithful they sound to the original recordings.  Same notes, same amount of reverb, same everything, excecpt clear and crisp, with expanded dynamic range and amazing 5.1 surround sound that circles you in music in a very natural way.  Better than headphones because as you turn your head slightly, the sound stays where it is, so it gives a real sense of being right there in the studio. Once you set your speaker levels equally, depending on the distance to your speakers, the recording is a perfect balance.  Very well done.  I can't wait for more of these - like Dicipline and Starless!
B0044KU7KU|1.0|On March 2, 2010, Shooter Jennings released the best album in years, a progressive rock concept album entitled [[ASIN:B004AAKEPM Black Ribbons]]. The album featured novelist Stephen King as a disc jockey in the near future who is, during the course of the album, doing his last broadcast before the government takes control of the airwaves. He decides to go out by playing the one band the government does not want him to play, a band of outlaws known as Hierophant who are in reality the alter egos of Shooter's band the .357s.    On November 19, 2010 My Chemical Romance released a second-rate rip-off of the album. You wouldn't let an author get away with plagiarism. Don't let the band. Support the original.
B002QY9RMA|5.0|After years of trying to avoid Beyonce and her music altogether...I listened to this album and fell in love with her and her music all over again. \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" is such a fun album to listen and to sing along to.<br /><br />*If I Were a Boy: Any girl can relate to this song. She puts so much emotion into this one that it's hard not to be moved by it. 5/5<br />*Halo: By far my most favorite song of her's. This song gives me hope. Gives everyone hope. The lyrics are just beautiful. 5/5<br />*Disappear: I was surprised at how much I love this song. The lyrics go so well with her voice. Just like poetry. 5/5<br />*Broken-Hearted Girl: A very emotional song. Another song any girl can relate to. 4/5<br />*Ave Maria: This one is my second favorite ballad of her's. It's so comforting to hear. Just like a lullaby. 5/5<br />*Smash Into You: This one is okay. I'm not too crazy about this one. 3/5<br />*Satellites: This song just captures my heart and soul. Beyonce's voice is so soothing. 4/5<br />*That's Why You're Beautiful: Again, I'm not too crazy over this one. It still has to grow on me. 3/5<br />*Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It): Such a fun song to sing and dance to!!! 5/5<br />*Radio: I don't really see the point to this song. It's an okay song. 3/5<br />*Diva: A catchy, fun song. I picture Ms. Sasha Fierce as Bonnie Parker here doing stick-up robberies. :)  5/5<br />*Sweet Dreams: One of my favorite songs, besides Singles Ladies and Diva. 5/5<br />*Video Phone: I love the entry to it: \\"Shawty what yo name is?\\" 4/5<br />*Hello: This song has never really caught my attention. So I'll give it a 3/5.<br />*Ego: Beautiful song! Very catchy, very sensual. 5/5<br />*Scared of Lonely & Poison are easily forgettable. 2/5.<br /><br />Overall I adored this album. And I find myself listening to it constantly. My favorite Beyonce album yet!
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|Great DVD.  The music and the history is as interesting today as it was then.  The second DVD has information that, I think, we're all just now learning.  Highly recommended.  I will watch this many more times.  The first time you hear Leon singing, it adds this amazing, hair standing up on the back of your neck moment.

B0043URV8M|5.0|Come on, people, what is wrong with you??? How can you not like this magnificent entry into the Potter world with French composer Alexandre Desplat??    Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love John Williams and I was totally dissapointed when I heard that he was not coming back neither for the first nor the second part of the final chapter in the Potter saga ...     But now enters Desplat!!! I had high expectations from this guy and he more then delivered with this score .... It's dark, it's emotional, it's scary, it's melodic, it's magical ... and I think this is the word that is definitely linked to Harry Potter and his friends. In my humble opinion, it's the second best od the Potter scores (following only Williams' masterpiece for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban).     I too miss more of Williams' tunes incorporated into the work of Desplat (as this is the final chapter of JK Rowling's imagionation), but nevertheless it is more than satisfied musical journey ... the more I listen to the score, the more I'm falling in love with the music ... they say that there is no recognisable theme (Williams has its Hedwig theme and Fawkes the Phoenix theme, Doyle has its Harry in Winter, ...) but I dissagree. The theme can be heard throughout the entire score and the one part of the score that sticks out is, well for me, track number 8, Death Eaters. It's soooo powerful yet so lyrical ...     Do yourself a favour and just listen to the beauty that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1, is. You'll be surprised just how much you'll like it.    Can't hardly wait for Desplat's Part 2!!!
B000AQJPQE|3.0|I bought this for my son's \\"space room\\" for his 5th birthday.  Agreed that it does look cool, but the motor is ridiculously loud and like other reviewer's, I thought maybe something was wrong at first.  Luckily, the rotation shuts off rather quickly, and it's just as fun to light it up.  It's OK, just not great.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|I just installed a new LED LCD HDTV on the wall with a slim mount. After installing the TV I realized that the HDMI cable would not fit between the back of the TV and the wall. I am so glad to have this adapter as it allowed for the cable to be installed easily. It also prevents the normal bending of the cable that normally occurs in tight spaces. Works perfectly. I will be getting more of these to have on hand!
B0041QSZJM|5.0|Pink Martini's \\"Joy To The World\\" is easily the best Christmas album I've ever bought.  All the tracks are great listening, but the absolute best tracks are those that use China Forbes' wonderful voice to best effect.  In my opinion those tracks are #5, Elohai, N' Tzor, and #9, La Vergine Degli Angeli, both of which give the listener a hint of the depth of Ms. Forbes' vocal talents; #8 Do You Hear What I Hear?, which is both hopeful and sad; and #4, Santa Baby (which I've always disliked for its adult encroachment on a children's tradition) is, in Ms. Forbes interpretation, playful and sweet and not at all offensive.    All of the songs are fresh and bring something new to the listener. The one original track on the CD, #11, A Snow Globe Christmas, works very well and compares favorably with the better original songs on Pink Martini's other CDs.    I also have to comment on the quality of the recording - it's excellent!  One feels as if one were in the room with the band as they performed each song.      My challenge will be to avoid over-playing this CD during the holidays!
0307454541|4.0|I have to admit, that 1/4 in to the book I wasn't very impressed. Although I could tell that a lot of ground work was being laid, it was a bit of a bore. It all of a sudden seemed that things then ramped up, and I was on a roller-coaster of suspense. The characters of Salander, and Blomkist were very believable, and intelligently written. As soon as I was done the first book, I downloaded the second. I'm sure that you'll do the same!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Bridge of Sighs is an eternal classic.  None of his other albums come close to this masterpiece.  I saw the Robin Trower band in 1977 at Winterland in San Francisco and again at the Paramount in Denver in 1980.  The Bridge of Sighs songs are still burned in my memory from those days.  This album stands the test of time and is as refreshing today as it was 30 plus years ago...
0060853972|5.0|Well, this was the first book I'm read by Terry Pratchett (well he co-wrote it), and now I'm 2 books deep into the Disk World Series, and I'M HOOKED!<br />This one sits off on its own, and I'm very certain that if you don't have a sence of humor about your religion, your not going to find any of his jokes the least funny.<br />Love it...now I have to get it on Kindle!!
0393072231|4.0|This is a very well written book and certainly chronicles how the mortgage mess began and why it should have been controlled sooner. I find Michael Lewis' books always very compelling reading and was surprised that the end was as disappointing as it was. He sets us up to like and root for these smart people but the profits that they made being on the right side of this trade come at the enormous expense of the vast majority of the people who suffered as a result of the financial meltdown. So it ends up being a sad story instead of a success story which I wasn't really expecting.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Lost was a show that divided the way TV would make shows from then on. This series, in spite of many saying otherwise, only had a few bumps along the way, nothing that compromised their structure and narrative.  With this colection the viewers can perceive with more clarity, the themes of each season, and how this show kept audience glued to the screen.  The box is amazing and filled with secrets. I only missed the instructions on how to play the game that came with the box, but I think there's a lot more to discover about it yet.      Para os brasileiros por aí, as únicas temporadas sem legendas PT-BR são a terceira e a sexta, mas se tudo correr bem e isso for necessário a você acredito que veremos uma versão mais simples no Brasil e poderemos trocar os CDs.    Cheers
B002N62JSK|5.0|This is a wonderful read for those willing to venture into the world of neuroplasticity. It is a bit thick so if your faint at heart you might want to start with something smaller. It talks about different case studies as well as the history of neurology. Very interesting!
B00493AD74|5.0|This movie was beautiful..... It makes you put aside your past and look to the future because you never know what awaits for you. I have seen every movie with Julia Roberts in it and she is one of my all time favorite actresses!! I feel everyone should take a trip to find theirselves. Sometimes the lives that we are living can put us in a dark place. Eat Pray Love is a wonderful movie that I will recommend to everyone I know.
0811876373|4.0|I thought these things were just as cute as can be when i seen these books. They have easy to follow instructions and pictures to go along with them. They have some wonderful ideas we adored the mini cupcakes and the owls. Those are just two of our favorite cake pops. My daughter enjoys looking at these and eating them as well. They are perfect for parties and special occasions they have halloween and christmas cake pops inside here as well.
1439152780|4.0|I was hesitant to read The Distant Hours because of other reviews that stated it could be slow and wasn't as good as her previous efforts, but I was very pleased with the novel. As always, Morton manages to keep the reader guessing about a few critical plot points and surprises with unexpected revelations. Each time I thought I had solved the mystery, I found I was wrong and had to play detective all over again.     It's hard for me to say whether or not the novel is slow in places, as I was so impatient to get to the ending and know what had happened. I enjoyed getting to know the Sisters Blythe and Edie and her mother. Morton has a way with character development.     I definitely recommend this novel. It's perfect for a long afternoon read.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I would consider this movie to be a neo-gothic film. While everything appears to be normal, as far as normal would go for a mental institution in the 1950s, there is always an unsettling element in the mix. The music and the camera angles used also assist greatly is setting the mood for this film.<br /><br />This movie unfolds like a maze, and it has you going down different rabbit holes, firstly, there is the issue of the missing female patient, that has disappeared under almost an impossible situation. Then there is a former Nazi doc, that raises the question of experimental brain surgery.<br /><br />The suspense develops as the weather deteriorates, the Federal Marshals get soaked in the rain and must dodge falling trees. Subsequently, they are provided with in-mate clothes and now sleep in bunk beds provided. The question that now presents itself, is: will they ever be allowed to leave the island? More questions and paranoia is thrown into the mix to keep you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This is a very gripping suspense thriller and keeps the maze going, and blurs reality and hallucination until the very end. A great movie that keeps you thinking as the plot turns and bends.
B0001I561E|5.0|This is an animated musical version of the classic tale.  It changes the story somewhat from the original, but you still have good fighting evil, and a magic lamp.  In this version it is Aladdin and his monkey against Jafar and his parrot.  The special effects are outstanding.  There is also the magic carpet appearing as a character.  The motion picture has been around for a while, but makes a periodic appearance and still makes a good gift.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|When this was being advertised by HBO, this movie was going to be shown, had waited for it and was satisified with it, in fact I loved it. The movie was based on individuals that had partisipated in it and its aftermath of those involved, those who sought to seek retribute and fight for their country, to the horrors of war, to the realization, there is no satisifaction in it, only the fear of death and survival. In the end it was going home and trying to cope with society, back then the returning service people were not de-sensitive, as what should have been, and not just sending them back and letting them to cope
B001W2D6N8|4.0|Everybody Knows This is Nowhere is an album of its time.That band had the heart torn from it after Danny Whitten died and Neil has admitted that he thought the band was over,being that Danny was such an important part of its over-all sound but he took a chance when bassist Billy Talbot brought a recently made friend that he was sure would be perfect for a new and improved Crazy Horse to rehearsals to see if it could work out.After a brief jam at Chess Studios in Chicago,it seemed that the new guitarist Pancho Sampedro,though not a great guitarist but to be sure a dynamic personality in his own right,would be a promising addition to the band and later after Pancho told him that if it wasn`t working out he would just leave,Neil replied \\"No,no...it feels like I`ve been here before,it`ll be cool\\".  Skip to a short time later and Neil came to Billy`s home outside of San Francisco for rehearsals with drummer Ralph Molina,Billy and Pancho which,in Billy`s words,were so funky that after playing almost non-stop for 8 or 10 hours,Neil had to leave.With producer David Briggs behind the glass,Neil brought the new line-up into the studio to lay down some new tracks that were much more rock nad roll oriented than EKTN had been,adding some acoustic tracks from previous sessions and came up with Zuma,named for where he and the band were living during the recording of the album.Who can really say what Neil Young`s best album is...I DO know that this is the album that got him back together with his greatest band and to get that sound back must have been mind-blowing for him and it showed.A must have for Neil Young fans and not a bad album to use to dip your toe into the waters of Neil Young`s music.

0307588343|1.0|An attractive title that disappoints in almost every way.  The writing is downright awful (could they not afford an editor?) and if you can get past that, the author's \\"insight\\" is devoid of any novelty or depth.

B003UESJJC|5.0|This review will briefly focus on the blu-ray itself. The 3-disc \\"Full Disclosure\\" set is aiming for fans of this film or those who love dvds/blu-rays that provides a wealth of information on the making of a film.<br /><br />First, the big surprise is that the original aspect ratio of this film (2:35:1) has been reinstated for the first time for home video release. Coppola and Dir. of Photography Vittorio Storaro previously felt that home video releases in this aspect ration wouldn't be sufficient enough. A compromise was made to for a pan-and-scan process (approved by both of them) where the aspect ratio was changed to 2:1. Storaro reportedly does this for all his films. While his resume is impressive, the decision for the aspect ratio all these years was wrong. Watching the film in 2:35:1 is like watching the film for the first time: not only are you gaining all the picture information in every shot, you'll see every shot as it was originally composed (pan-and-scanning requires shots to be recomposed, which changes the effectiveness of the image).<br /><br />Second, all the supplemental material (if not most) from previous releases are included here: some new and some in longer form. Orson Welles' radio broadcast of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (the film's source material) is included in full. Roger Ebert's interview with Coppola in 2001 (when Coppola's Redux cut of the film premiered) is included in full with a running time of 30+ minutes. There are new interviews with John Milius and Coppola as well. All of this in HD!<br /><br />Third, the magnificent Hearts of Darkness documentary is included on the third disc, which in many fans' opinion makes this 3-disc set the definitive collection. There's also a booklet with rare photos of the shoot, production materials, script and comments from Coppola.<br /><br />It's a handsomely mounted set. If you're wanting to check this out for the first time, there is a 2-disc version (the disc with Hearts of Darkness is dropped) that is cheaper (rent it). But if you've always wanted the best home video version of this masterpiece, get it.). But if you've always wanted the best home video version of this masterpiece, get it.
B000002OPP|5.0|I guess thats why Hendrix is legendary, there will never be another like him. This album is out of all the albums I have heard of his my favorite. Production is amazing and years ahead of its time, song writing again ahead of its time, and guitar playing is simply incredible. I dont think there is much more to say here. If your looking for one hendrix album, skip greatest hits albums and pick this up.
0439023513|5.0|The Districts are rebelling. Thanks to Katniss Everdeen and a handful of berries, she has become a symbol of revolution - the mockingjay. Together with exiles from District 13 and the uprising residents of the other Districts, Katniss and the rebels are going to take down the Capitol. No more `peacekeepers'. No more deprivation and starvation. No more child sacrifices. No more `Hunger Games'.<br /><br />Game over.<br /><br />I went into the third and final book in `The Hunger Games' trilogy knowing it would be a tear-jerker. Suzanne Collins' series is an awful glimpse into a distorted and dystopian world ruled by an entertainment-hungry dictatorship and fuelled by fear. There was no fathomable way that Ms Collins could write an all-round `happy ending' for Katniss and crew. Still, even preparing myself for what I knew would be a hard-to-swallow final book, I was alarmed by the despair in `Mockingjay'. I cried constantly throughout the last 100 pages. . . but I still, surprisingly, loved the send-off.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has written a very complicated final instalment. She is very cleverly giving her younger readers a history lesson with `Mockingjay' by focussing so much of the book on the Hunger Games and Capitol politics. Katniss Everdeen becomes the symbol for the rebellion - her `mockingjay' character is the personification of fight and freedom for the districts. Collins has written Katniss and her created mockingjay persona as a sort of Che Guevara or Rosa Parks - and Collins's history lesson is in showing her young audience just how orchestrated and make-believe a revolution can be. Uprisings don't happen overnight - they need people and symbols to stir the embers of discontent.<br /><br />A lot of `Mockingjay' is cleverly devoted to politicking and the behind-the-scenes of a revolution. And it makes for fascinating reading. Throughout the book I kept hearing that `V for Vendetta' quote: \\"A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world.\\" Collins beautifully articulates the strength behind symbolism and the mobility of revolution and Katniss Everdeen is a wonderful conduit for such explorations.<br /><br />Obviously the take-down of the Capitol is at the crux of `Mockingjay' (and the entire `Hunger Games' series). But an equally large portion of the book is devoted to Katniss's impossible love triangle and the choice she must make between long-time friend Gale, and her arena partner, Peeta. I don't want to give anything away. . . but a lot of my crying throughout the book had to do with Peeta and Katniss. Just. . . wow. They were heart-wrenching. Utterly and completely heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Like I said, I went into `Mockingjay' knowing that the trilogy couldn't, faithfully, finish on a happy ending. There was just no way because a happy ending is not conducive to a dystopian trilogy, unfortunately. Still, I was shocked (and surprisingly impressed) by how cut-throat Suzanne Collins was in this book. She unabashedly puts Katniss through the physical, emotional and mental wringer. Collins is blood-thirsty, killing off beloved characters and giving them gruesome send-offs reminiscent of the arena in book #1.<br /><br />All of the deaths left me an emotional, vicarious wreck. At the time of reading I was almost angry with Ms Collins for writing such despair and it got to the point where I was hoping and praying for just one good thing to come out of `Mockingjay'. But upon reflection, I can appreciate and accept that all that death and gloom was necessary. You have to go there to come back, so to speak. And really, if Ms Collins had written anything softer she would have been selling-out and kowtowing to fans. Instead she remained true to the heart of her series - it started out bloody and ended bloody. Well, bloody brilliant, in my opinion.<br /><br />Yes,`Mockingjay' is sad, and violent and in no way a clean, conventional `happy ending'. But it's all relative. . . because although `The Hunger Games' is a dystopian look at killing sport, it's equally true that at its heart the series is about fighting back. It's about choosing to die on your feet rather than live on your knees. Yes, it's violent and dystopian - but it's ultimately about hope. Collins distils her series' overarching themes in this final instalment, sending Katniss and crew out with an explosive `BANG', which is equal parts sad and brilliant.onal `happy ending'.

B0009IW9DE|5.0|I own this album since 1990, I can say this for sure because I perfectly remember the day that I bought it. It was summer, and I put this album on tape (it was tape time, looooong ago!!!) and this album has been a perfect soundtrack to that summer (and to many summers that followed). The tape stayed in my car for years! I review this now, because the other day I got the remastered edition and I rediscovered it, in a splendid audio format. I mean, the remastering has been made wonderfully! The music is more tridimensional now, the arrangements are more clear and the instruments a lot more separated in the mix. All in all a wonderful remastering for me. I have to say this is the only album I own from John. I don't know why. I am a curious guy and when an artist hit me with a masterpiece like this one, generally I tend to buy everything he recorded before or after the album I like so much. With John, this never happened. I don't know why. My fault for sure. But I will try to check some more albums by him even if a lot of people call The Jubilee his masterpiece and probably rightly so. But I have no doubt that few other album of his could be great too (Scarecrow?). Anyway. Talking about Jubilee, I love it! How can one be objective with an album one has loved so much for so many times? I don't know but I'll try. First of all the songs are strong, they are convincing. The melodies are great (in the rock idiom of course), the songs are great, each one in its own right. Of course I have the ones I love the most, Cherry Bomb, Paper in fire, Check it out, The real life, but the album flows perfectly from the beginning to the end. The atmosphere is about the working class American world and it is told with sincerity and involvement by John. The arrangements are particularly well done and deserves some words. Acoustic guitars, rock guitars, fiddles, accordions, harmonicas, they are brilliant arrangements, simple but perfect to give the music life, and they are never predictable. In few words, this  is a fantastic album, a rock Jubilee. A must have! (... and many thanks for the beautiful remastering job!). In few words, this  is a fantastic album, a rock Jubilee. A must have!

B0044KU7KU|5.0|This CD is amazing!  The Black Parade saved my life, and I was afraid Danger Days would be disappointing but OMG - the boys have outdone themselves.  I've heard some reviews say it's not as hard as their other 2 CDs, but I don't know how they could say that.  Just listen to Vampire Money - it's crazy hard punk.  I totally recommend this CD to anyone who loves MCR, and all of those who don't know much about them.  This is what music is supposed to be - not all that junk we hear on the radio and not all the artists winning the awards.  Support the band!  Buy it, buy it, buy it!
B000001DQI|5.0|As I drove in the car today I listened to my Goodbye Yellow Brick Road cd. I have not played the entire track list  since I had the vinyl LP. Pardon me as I put a handful of grease in my hair. Remarkably everyone was still there waiting for me. Norma Jean, Alice, Roy Rogers, Harmony, Danny, Bennie and BTW, tell me Grey Seal how does it feel to be so wise. This album is simply the best of the best of my childhood. The music and story telling of John/Taupin is (in my opinion) epic and timeless. I can close my eyes (not while driving) and I am 14 and can still be carried away in all the excitement of this collection of songs. I must take leave now. I need to escape the Dogs of Society and Shoot a Hole in the Moon tonight. True fans of GYBR know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />Billie Jo Nance

031603438X|3.0|I slogged through this behemoth of a book...all 531 pages. Keith comes off as an intelligent and thoughtful human being. It is a well written book that takes us through the whole LIFE of ol' keef. I do have some quips about the book...mainly that he tries to play down JIMI Hendrix...claiming that he was in some way responsible for Hey Joe... purple haze was copped from the acid...which it was..but keith it's the song baby. Keef also rants and raves about Brian Jones....an amazing musician who created many of the unique sounds for the early stones albums...paint it black (sitar) under my thumb (marimba) etc. Keith even justifies stealing anita pallenberg from brian...saving anita from the maniac brian....com'on mate....you do not steal bandmates girlfriends.    Besides the revisionist ideas the book is very enjoyable and it really shows the side of a humble, intelligent, and creative humanbeing.
B003WTE886|5.0|I bought this cd for my daughters (and myself) and we love it!  Taylor is super-talented and a positive role model.  Her songs are very touching and relatable.  Only downside: this cd does not contain any pc-dvd content as her first two albums.  If I would have known, I would have just downloaded the album off of the internet for less cost and waiting time.
B000002U82|4.0|I got this album twice: back to back on a Black Friday. The first time I got it, I had to give it away because it was an edited version from Wal-Mart. The second time I got it was the right time. So whose review are you gonna choose? Whose has more information, better information, captivating information, some shapes, or a spectacular trivia of \\"Dark Side of The Moon?\\" I don't know what I should say to get a helpful vote on this. All I can give you now about this classic is my opinion, and I didn't like this album too much, as in it didn't last in my CD player as long as it should've. \\"Speak to me/Breathe (Breathe in The Air)\\" is slow and has good lyrics. \\"On The Run\\" is a crazy instrumental that brings you to an airport and has you off your seat because of the sounds of running. \\"Time\\" opens up as an alarm clock, then it brings you the sounds of \\"Texas,\\" then it goes into the importance of time. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" is famous, known for its singing and sad mourning. \\"Money\\" is a hit. \\"Us and Them\\" is okay, another slow song. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is a brilliant instrumental. \\"Brain Damage\\" has been played over and over again; a psychotic song. \\"Eclispe\\" sounds like the end of the world, a feeling in my description, because of how loud the lyrics are; last track. Supposedly, if you turn up the volume all the way, you hear a violin being played from a different room.<br /><br />Folks, I read stuff about this album on Wikipedia. I know it stayed on the Billboard 200 for 14 and a quarter years. It sold 40 million copies. To me, the art decoration is entertaining. It's a must have, and that's why I got it.
0393317552|2.0|Jared Diamond begins his book with a question: \\"[W]hy weren't Native Americans, Africans and Aboriginal Australians the ones who decimated, subjugated, or exterminated Europeans and Asians?\\" The obvious answer in my mind is that they simply had no interest in waging a war of genocide against the rest of the world, that indeed these cultures would have considered such an effort insane. But this answer does not satisfy Jared Diamond, because he cannot fathom that a culture could simply not be interested in conquest and genocide. He cannot fathom that a culture might not want to be an empire, that a culture might not want to be European. He is looking outward from a European culture and asking why other cultures are different from his own.<br /><br />It quickly becomes clear that he is unaware of this bias, as it does not occur to him to even consider whether the answer to his question lies in culture. Rather he frames our potential answers for us as follows: geography, or overt racism. Jared Diamond dismantles the argument of the overtly racist position (\\"Non-whites failed to wage genocide and conquest against the rest of the world because they are too stupid\\") in favor of the covertly racist position (\\"Non-whites failed to wage genocide and conquest against the world because they didn't have the geographic advantages that Europe and Asia did\\"). By comparing all societies against a European model, the author is inclined to see all other societies as \\"failed Europes\\" that \\"lack\\" certain attributes. That there is absolutely no evidence that non-Eurasian indigenous people had any interest in conquering, subjugating, or exterminating the rest of the world is apparently a moot point. Again and again he talks about how non-Europeans \\"failed\\" to match some European 'achievement', without bothering to provide evidence that they ever even had any interest in it. To get a sense of the absurdity of this, imagine that he had chosen African hunter-gatherer societies as his model instead. Would it then make sense to talk about how Europeans \\"failed\\" to achieve a communal society, an autarkic foraging-based economy, and a total absence of war? It would only make sense if Europe had a clear cultural interest in making these achievements. Otherwise, this is a textbook example of ethnocentrism, or the evaluation of another culture by the standards of one's own.<br /><br />Within another hundred pages or so, it becomes clear that Diamond is fundamentally an amateur in many of the subjects he professes knowledge in. His background is in geography, biophysics, and physiology, and yet has written a book built heavily dependent on the fields of anthropology, archaeology, ecology, and history. He argues, for instance, that Clovis peoples hunted megafauna such as mammoths to extinction, in spite of the clear impossibility of such a feat. (Indeed, a much more plausible theory now suggests that a comet impact was largely responsible.) He also gives a retelling of the old myth that native people reached America by following a land bridge and an \\"ice free corridor\\", despite current evidence that areas as far south as Chile were populated before the land bridge supposedly opened up. (The idea of a land bridge crossing and ice free corridor were never strongly supported by anthropological evidence, they were simply conjectured on the racist assumption that native people were incapable of sea travel.)<br /><br />Another example of incompetency is when he makes the claim that most 'chiefdoms' are \\"kleptomaniac\\" societies in which the elites steal from the common members of the society, without actually using examples from the \\"chiefdom\\" societies he mentions. Instead he speaks of \\"chiefdoms\\" in a mythical sort of way, as if they were all fundamentally the same, and then tells us a story about this generalized, unnamed chiefdom. In this way he can advance his theory of cultural evolution without providing any factual evidence to support it. And in fact the societies he does claim to be chiefdoms are often very different from his idealized portrait of \\"the chiefdom\\". For instance one of the \\"chiefdoms\\" he describes in the book are the \\"Kwakiutl\\" (who are actually the Kwak'waka'wakw; 'Kwakiutl' was the name of a single Kwak'waka'wakw band that was mistaken by early anthropologists for the name of the larger group). But rather than being a \\"kleptomaniac\\" society in which the top members steal from the bottom, Kwak'waka'wakw society is based politically on potlatching, a system in which leaders are ranked not for how much they accumulate from the commoners, but how much wealth they can give away to them. Only by continuously giving can a leader show that he is worthy of the community's respect and maintain his status. A situation completely 180 from Jared Diamond's simple system for caricaturing diverse societies, which comes us to us incidentally from antiquated works of anthropology, such as Peter Farb's \\"Man's Rise to Civilization As Shown by the Indians of North America\\", first published in 1968).<br /><br />These are just a few of the more striking examples. He often reveals his lack of a hand in more subtle ways, as for instance when he describes the 9% annual death rate of First Nations people in Saskatchewan from European germs as \\"incredible\\". But this rate is hardly so incredible. Where I live, just to give an example, 90% of the local population (the Kalapuya) died over a period of three years when malaria was introduced to the area. If he had researched the subject in any depth he would have found that the death rate in Saskatchewan was actually fairly typical.<br /><br />It also becomes clear that Diamond did not research his question to find an answer, but rather answered his question and then handpicked evidence to support that answer. Even still, much of his evidence is flaky at best and lends itself better to other explanations. For instance, he tries to explain that the apparent naivete of American Indian leaders in the face of psychopathic conquistadors was due to a lack of history books. Even if we ignore Diamond's ignorance of the complex oral histories in these societies, this argument seems rather impoverished. A much more likely answer is that these cultures had simply never come into contact with behavior so callous, arrogant, and mythomanic as that presented by the conquistadors, and thus were unable to prepare themselves against it. If this reasoning occurred to Diamond, he was careful to ignore it, as it directly contradicts his thesis. Indeed, Diamond took great care not to present any explanations that discouraged his overall conclusion, gambling that exhibiting unwavering confidence in a carefully constructed story would prevent people from noticing his academic shortcomings.<br /><br />Considering his book was a bestseller and won him both a Pulitzer Prize and a documentary series, it appears that his gamble paid off quite handsomely.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Let's remember that Robin Hood is ficticious, NOT a historical figure. The filming of this movie was in keeping with Ridley Scott's stlye and was reminiscent of the filming stlye in Gladiator. I'm not clear why some of the reviewers of this film are hung up on the accents and worse yet the history in the film. This film portrays FICTION and takes historical license as any film may. Ridley Scott's version of Robinhood is clearly NOT meant to be a DISSERTATION on British history. The new-ish takes on the history surrounding the story of Robinhood were interesting and kept the story moving and emotional. Russell Crowe is Russell Crowe. I was pleased to see glimpes of Maximus from Gladiator and Aubrey from Master and Commander as well. He does well in the role of leading small bands of misfits therefore who better for him to play than Robinhood? Cate Blanchett is strong and heroic in her role as Marion, with a bit of Scarlett O'Hara thrown in for good measure. This film is very enjoyable and engaging. Grumps against the history in the film should stick with the History Channel and avoid delving into fiction at all.
B002LIZWTI|5.0|In anticipation of release of Warpaint's first full length album, I kept wondering how they were going to treat this overlooked but inspired EP.  Having seen the band live and watched them tear it up as an opening band for Sonic Youth, I hoped that they would re-record one of the tracks on this collection.  Upon release of the new album and finding no such re-recorded tracks, I realized that this EP was in no way a rush job or in any way needed improvement.  While not quite as long obviously, this album may top the incredible full length debut garnering such high praise.<br />  The opening \\"Stars\\" may be the best track this band has written.  Unsettling yet utimately optimistic, this briefly sketched tale of a love affair turning stale proceeds with a slowly building intensity.  \\"Elephants\\" starts off sounding like a Local Natives/Vampire Weekend rip-off before the vocals drop in and the vicious rhythm section lends the song an frantic edge.  \\"Billie Holiday\\" shows that even when acoustic, the band can create melodies that are disturbing while at the same time beautiful.  And battling \\"Stars\\" for EP highlight is the Blondie-inspired \\"Beetles\\", which veers all over the musical map in a dizzying frenzy.<br />  This band has everything going for it.  Strong lyrics, inspired vocalists, guitarists not content to play it safe, and a rhythm section better that 95% of the pairings out there.  If you liked \\"The Fool\\", you will love this EP!

0688014291|4.0|This classic management book was recommended to me by a friend when I was looking for help defining my own management style. I was surprised that a complex area like management could be broken down so simply.      Essentially, there are 3 components to the One Minute Manager: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praisings, One Minute Reprimands.  While I appreciate the simplicity of theory, the practice, of course is much more difficult.  The book is a cursory overview and definitely could be expanded upon, but on the other hand, I really liked that it was such a quick read with simple concepts that were easy to grasp.     It's definitely a good read for anyone who is just starting to get into management, or who needs a brief refresher course into why we do what we do.  It's a starting point, but shouldn't be relied upon as the only resource.

B003AE0TY0|5.0|When I first picked up this book recomended for a book club, I had no knowledge of the author or the subject.  The story was fascinating, a live woman's cancer cells disseminated over the entire world for every type of health research, including vaccines. I could not put the book down. I could not believe all this took place during my lifetime, and moreover, without my knowledge.  I had never heard this story before, and with Skloot's massive research, she makes it come alive as it should be.  To see that there is a family story behind the cells is a tribute to the author's thoroughness; she minutely exposes the entire story.  If you enjoy history, science, medical research, or a gripping human interest story, this one is for you.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki Minaj's debut album \\"Pink Friday\\" is the most-entertaining, fun, hip, album to come out of the Hip-Hop/Rap in over a decade!  People on here are just rating it bad just to rate it bad!  \\"Pink Friday\\" is a really interesting album. YOU CAN'T DENY how addicting and interesting her raping is. Her lyrics and the way she is dramatic during parts of her raps when 'Roman' comes out, it's just AMAZING!    Nicki makes Rap music listenable!

0439023513|1.0|Like others, let me state I LOVED the first two books. And yet the only reason I am writing a review is to add to the number of 1 star reviews this book will get. Every character was short changed. There was no one to get behind. *spoiler* and the last third (?) of the book involves a mission that no one ordered, that doesn't succeed, never could have and is just a way to kill off character we actually like and to teach us that the Katniss we had grown to love stopped existing at the end of the second novel. She never makes an appearence in this book. She was unlikeable throughout the entire novel. Are we really supposed to believe that after all she and Peeta have been through - that in his greatest hour of need, she finds him not worth the effort? Oh lord this book was bad.
B003U0AHBO|1.0|This movie represents the highest epitome of corniness, futility and null narrative coherence of recent times.  This movie is more an unfinished silly cartoon painted by numbers for the joy of \\"who-knows-who\\" than an amateur honest failure. Avoid it.

B0031RAOVY|4.0|I caught this film on the Hallmark network first and was really impressed by Hachi, the akido. However, that the dog would return day after day for 9 years never really knowing why his master doesn't show still causes me to choke up. If one is a dog person, the loyaltly shown by this dog was remarkable, even if he did die the year after I was born. If you really like the show, you might want to see the Japanese version too. Again, if you are a dog person, don't miss it.

B001AQO400|4.0|I saw LIT before I had ever been to Japan. The movie seemed a bit strange and I wondered why Bill Murray was in such a flat, depressing comedy about really nothing at all. I didn't get it. In Spring of 2005, not long after I had returned from three weeks in Shinjuku, Tokyo I watched it again. Now the familiarity of the location really captured my attention. I had stayed at the Hilton Tokyo, just two blocks from the Park Hyatt hotel Bob Harris (Murray's character) was in. This is not me trying to brag or anything, but me just saying that the movie now presented a reality I had recently experienced. I could relate. It was almost surreal. My company had sent me there solo for three weeks to work with a customer. I was by myself a good amount of the time and had a lot of freedom to experience Tokyo as best I could. Navigating the subway, surfing the hotel TV stations (most all in Japanese, except BBC), and experiencing a few restaurants, shops, and grocers were among my biggest adventures. This is not a review of my trip, but my newfound love of Tokyo made so many moments in the movie stand out. When Bob is surfing the hotel stations you catch a few seconds of World Chart Express, something I watched A LOT of and how I came to know about YUKI and discover my favorite song of 2005, \\"Joy\\". Also when Bob is just arriving into Tokyo from the airport and just looks so beat, but is kind of in awe of the lights and brilliance of the city... that was me. I remember getting to the hotel about midnight and not really being able to sleep. Anyway, the movie just really struck a chord with me in many ways. I also picked up on and could relate to the general theme of the movie about two lonely people out of their element. Anyway, Murray's humor here is very understated but still very Bill Murray. I find it hilarious at times, but not strictly a comedy. There are a lot of quiet moments that get you thinking about what's important in life, and about finding or searching for someone, if only a friend, that you are really comfortable being with. Don't let all the bad reviews scare you off. Even if you've never been to Tokyo you may still find a lot to like about LIT.only a friend, that you are really comfortable being with.

B00406UK7S|3.0|\\"Centurion\\" is a quick and dirty historical chase movie featuring great looking costumes, brutal battlefield gore effects, and the very real grueling elements of Northern Scotland.  These majestic but desolate ancient locations dominate the movie, often rendering the actors tiny ants in the distance. On the rare occasions we get intimate with the cast, the frostbite visible on their skin is no special effect and their shivering certainly isn't acting, this is some hardcore guerilla filmmaking from rising genre director Neil Marshall. Framed with complex jump editing and shaky camera work, the violent multi-weapon action that dominates the movie is hard hitting and authentic feeling.      As the central antagonist Olga Kurylenko's gives an intense silent performance, her startling stare conveying both rage and tragedy. Unforunately, the rest of the cast fails to make much of an impression with even some of the cliché stock characters blurring together.  Leading man Michael Fassbender is terribly dry, and even with sporadic \\"stating the obvious\\" mood killing narration you can't really connect with the guy.  While the film is exciting when it's rolling the narrative is lurching on fumes by the closing act, and the precious few slow scenes feel like painful abrupt stops rather than welcomed breath takers. The unique spectacle of the movie is worth seeing but be warned it isn't a very satisfying film experience overall.     -Dan S. of dangerdiablogik

0810997827|5.0|As most people that have a 9 year old will tell you they only read when they want to....... i have read so many reviews before allowing my son to read the books...... i myself am a fast reader,  read the first book in a little under an hour..... there for judgeing for myself if it was appropriate for him to read.... i think that these books were great....they helped my son so much... he is reading all the time now. Hiding in his room under the covers reading when he is supposed to be sleeping just to get a few more pages in!!!!!! That is so great..... he is on his second go around reading the books to his brother(who is a year younger) and they are really enjoying them.......  it gives them so one to relate to..... know that there are other people out there that have problems and that try to get out of doing things and lying and it has help teach my kids that those things don't get you very far..... I think these books are wonderful.

B000069HK2|5.0|The cd was in the condition the seller said it would be. It only has a few minor scratches, otherwise the cd is in great condition.

B003ZVJFFM|3.0|I'm a fan of all Christmas Carol adaptations, even the Muppet one, and at the beginning of this movie I thought \\"wow, this could really be good\\" but it turned out to be disappointing.      The problem I have with the movie, just my personal opinion, is it tries to alternate between serious scenes and slapstick humor and the mix just doesn't work (for me). Some scenes are recreated in a serious, dramatic way that really convey the spirit of the book.  The passing scenes of 19th century London life add a lot of atmosphere and Carrey does a great (serious) job with the voices.  Then - bam! - some visual gag is thrown in that's reminiscent of Carrey's physical comedy in other movies or a Bugs Bunny cartoon and you're thinking \\"where did that come from?\\"; then just as abruptly it switches back to the standard dramatic story.  The physical comedy might work for little kids but the movie also has some scenes that are too scary/disturbing for young children, so who exactly is their audience?  The last straw for me was a chase scene (really, a chase scene) that was clearly thrown in to show off the particle/water/physics effects of their animation engine, as if we haven't all seen enough animated water by now; you could almost hear the programmers saying \\"oh! oh! can we throw this in, it will look so cool.\\"    If it was supposed to be a comedy, it should have been lighthearted throughout.  If it was supposed to demonstrate that they could make a great Christmas Carol using animation (which they could have) they should have left out the shtick.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Finally, a band has breathed life into a genre that, in recent years, has begun to lull itself to sleep.  Remember when rock was fantastical, larger-than-life, and challenged the very ground it stood on?  Yeah, neither do I.  The last time it did that, I wasn't even born yet.    This band must have noticed the same thing since they took the ideals of pop, punk, dance, and rock, and brewed them together in the mind of a comic book genius.  The concoction is bold, jolting, and downright fun.  Totally worth the $10-$15 to buy.  Would make a great Christmas/Hanukkah gift.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|This is the first time in years that I shelled out money for a whole album and I am glad I did.
B003OTLVAW|2.0|Arrived two days after placing order (thanks blowitoutahere) and I was excited to hear one of my favorite albums on SA-CD for the first time. Brothers in Arms got a fine treatment when Universal released it on SA-CD. Knopfler's own Shagri-la is a thunderous disc, full of both nuance and power. When I first played this I was blown away, not by it's sheer awesomeness, or it's silky presentation of Knopfler's signature tones, but sadly by how shrill and noisy it is. Highs? Way too high. Bass? Almost non-existent. Checked all of my connections. Checked to make sure they had shipped an actual SA-CD. No problems there. Put in a few other demo-worthy SA-CDs to see if maybe I had developed an ear infection... Nope: Nat King Cole sounded as silky as ever. Bill Evans and Scott LaFaro still sound like they are playing in my living room.   This is one hack job. Here's what it sounds like...   HISSSSSSSSSS (we are the sultans of swing) HISSSSSSSSS (cymbal crash) HISSSSSSS. Unforgivable quality, at least for this price. I have CDs of recordings made in the 50s (Ella Fitzgerald songbooks come to mind) that sound finer and denser than this. Universal Japan is making a quick buck. No effort was made to clean up the proceedings in any way, unlike on the CD remasters.  To make things worse, I played the remastered CD version after my first listen, just to be sure, and preferred the mix and sound quality to the SA-CD! Avoid unless you are a Dire Straits completist and don't mind dropping $60. Sorry.

B000055ZB8|5.0|In 1922 Nosferatu was the first feature length vampire film to be released and to this day it is still one of the best. The story was essentially a rip-off of Dracula which almost got all the film prints destroyed due to copyright infringement. Thankfully prints outside of Germany survived and the film lives on. The names and locations here were changed from the original story but can still easily be seen as a Dracula film.<br />Max Shreck plays the menacing Count Orlok and with his rat-like features and superb makeup job is still one of the creepiest horror figures to this day. The cinematography and use of shadows in here are great and give the whole film an eerie gothic feel. Nosferatu is a German Expressionistic film along with other movies such as \\"The Cabinet of Dr.Caligarri\\", \\"The Golem\\", and \\"Metropolis\\". Nosferatu is arguably the best of this style of film with Dr. Caligarri being a close second.<br />There are many different DVD versions of this film including many cheap low quality editions due to the fact that this film can be found in the public domain. I purchased the Image Entertainment DVD which is sufficient with a good quality transfer and original tinting. It also includes two soundtrack options that both give the film added atmosphere. The Kino video edition is also a worthy edition. Kino later released the \\"Nosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)\\" which runs 94 minutes and I would imagine to be the best edition of the film on DVD so far. The special features on the 2-disc version are The original film score, a 52 minute documentary, newly translated English intertitles, a 3-minute short documentary on the digital restoration, and lengthy excerpts of other films by director F.W. Murnau.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Once again, Kanye uses immaculate word play and sly intellect to keep listeners satisfied. From the creative (and appropriate) use of Nicki Minaj in the intro to the \\"Who Will Survive in America\\" outro, this album is rap album of 2010. His lengthened version of Runaway was incredible. Although hooks, beats and features are great, he doesn't let any other factor outshine his particular words, This album will be on repeat. Worth every penny.
0061353248|1.0|I had a lot of hope for this book based on all the positive reviews in Amazon.  The experiments into behaviors that don't fit \\"classic\\" microeconomics, and demand and supply curves, are very interesting.  What amazed me is that the author, who apparently is a pretty disciplined social scientist, would take the results of his experiments and reach such biased conclusions.  For example, in one test he finds that college students take fewer candies when offered them free rather than when charged a penny.  His research shows only that the quantities were less but....his conclusion was that the \\"free\\" results were due to concern by the students for the overall population - that they didn't take as many because they were concerned about everyone getting their share.  He then extends this specious thinking to overall governmental policy in areas such as health care.  Could they have take less candy solely for the self-serving purpose of not being viewed as pigs?  Could the numbers of candies purchased for a penny be due to the candy being offered at substantially below market prices? We'll never know because Ariely, in his rush to justify liberal social action, never bothers to explore other possible causal factors.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Can't go wrong with the original Sony Dualshock 3, as opposed to the third-party options that seem to have malfunctions. Works awesome!
B000WC39SG|5.0|The acting and photography was great. The blu-ray version at $10.99 is much better than the the dvds - there are no artifacts and video is sharp. The dvds are grainy. Of course the opening scenes cut from old sources are grainy, etc. But once you get to the movie itself the sound and picture are great. The story is excellent as others have said. I wish other blu-ray versions were just as good. For example, French Connection II blu-ray was a bit disappointing because the video was grainy.
0525951652|5.0|I do not usually write reviews, but I really loved this book.  I was sorry when I got to the end and wish the next installment was out now!  I read the criticisms regarding coincidences with the characters, but a book is entertainment after all and it didn't bother me.  I also read the criticism regarding the wealthy characters generally being less than noble and the poor characters being generally more noble.  It is very plausible that those entrenched in unearned wealth and status through many generations would develop a sense of entitlement and not very noble attitudes toward the rest of the world.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Annie Lennox is a unique talent, and this holiday release is no exception. I really liked the CD the first time that I listened to it, and now after 15 plays I am totally enchanted with it.    What a wonderful blend of vocals, harmony, instruments and arrangements we have here. It has an old-fashioned yet powerful new sound quality that resonates throughout.    For the moment, 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen' is my favorite track, but then I was influenced by the extraordinary promotional video. 'As Josepsh Was A Walking' and 'The Holly and the Ivy' have become two favorites, also.    Note that profits from her song 'Universal Child' will be donated to charity, a noble act in the holiday tradition.    After introducing two others to this wonderful musical experience, I just ordered 2 more copies as gifts.    An Annie Lennox Christmas album is a dream come true, and this effort does not disappoint - indeed, it soars to the top of the tallest tree and then up to the heavens beyond. Bravo!

B00459EZ7Q|5.0|stargate universe is a great new look into the universe of stargate. I love sg-1 and sga, but this new show is so much more real. so much in depth with not only all the character devlopment, but with telling a great stargate story. There were two episodes from last season that litterally made me cry. No tv show has ever made that happen. And the fact that they were tears of joy and woo hoos is even beter. I suggest SGU to anyone who loves stargate, sci-fi, and compeling  storytelling. Plus the #1 greatest space adventure of all time

B0044XV3QY|4.0|I liked Avatar when I saw it in IMAX 3D.  It was fun, beautiful to look at, and used 3D in a way that few films do.  I also thought the acting was mediocre at best, the story cliched and predictable, and the ending to be more than a little ridiculous.  I also found Sam Worthington flat and frankly an unlikeable protagonist as Jake Sully.  Still, it had a lot of great action and great visual effects.  Obviously, I was in the minority as to my thoughts on the quality of the movie as a whole, as the film is now the highest grossing of all time, and people seem to really love it.  And good for them.  I don't see a lot of the re-watch value in this film, especially without the 3D and on a smaller screen though.  So I avoided the first blu-ray release and then borrowed this from a friend to see the added story elements and watch the making of documentary features.  And on that second point, I'm glad I watched them.  The second disc is pretty much why blu-ray was invented.  It's packed to the gills with interviews, concept art, effects tests and so much behind the scenes footage that they could sell it as a stand-alone disc and I would be inclined to but it.  For tech geeks and people who love to see how movies get made, the two Blu-ray discs with the extras are well worth watching, and if you love Avatar, this would have to be a must own.<br /><br />As to the film itself, well, on the first disc you get three versions of the film.  The first version is the original Theatrical Cut, which really drags in a second viewing if you just thought the film was ok.  I then ignored the re-release cut and when to the collectors addition cut that features 16 more minutes of movie, including a new opening on earth, and a lot of extra back story that fleshes out SOME character motivations, but also does nothing to make me like Sully any more than I did the first time.  The Na'Vi are still, to me, just another take on the \\"noble savage\\" characterization that you used to find in Westerns.  The reasons why the \\"unobtanium\\" is so hard to extract are still vague and Quaritch is still a thin villain.  The final battle is expanded a bit, and that's fine, so if you're a fan, this is pretty much the edition to get.<br /><br />Based on the quality of the special features and the three editions of the film on one blu-ray, I'd bump up my 3 of 5 star rating for the film to a 4 of 5 star rating for the whole package.  If you loved Avatar in the theater, you'll love this.  Anyone who didn't love the movie but loves the making of movies will love the extras as well.asons why the \\"unobtanium\\" is so hard to extract are still vague and Quaritch is still a thin villain.

0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis does it again...     Within about 250 pages, he's created a narrative on one of the most landmark periods in the country's history through the lives of folks you, nor I have heard.  And during this narrative, the reader affirms that the \\"credit extension\\" that funded the housing bubble was the result of market inefficiencies (read: rating agencies, unintended reglatory consequences and short term greed of financial institutions).  All the while, Lewis does it with a firm, quick writing style that he's most famous for, making the book tough to put down.  If you've read any of his books and liked them, this one is no exception.    If there is any downside to the book, the story is at times choppy, given it is shifting back and forth between different characters.  As much, the ending is a bit abrupt, leaving the reader to wonder where some of the characters are today.  The later point is probably more credit to how good the book is...      I'm now looking forward to his next read,
B001VLXNLU|1.0|The 'vampyres' in this book are much more like witches. They are brought over by a tracker, who points at them, and then they are 'marked a fledgling vampyre. The only similarity between these vampyres and others is they sometimes drink blood. They basically have magical powers and have affinities for the elements. They worship a goddess, which in time becomes quite blasphemous.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|At first I was enjoying the movie. But after a while, some things weren't making sense and I thought that they were going to be explained in the end, but it didn't happen. A creepy guy drops off a box and tells Cameron Diaz's character that if she presses the button she will not only get $1,000,000 and someone she doesn't know will die (and she shouldn't tell anyone except her husband) but he omitted to tell her that by pressing the button she can only enjoy the money if she can live with her son being deaf and blind or her husband has to kill her in order for her son to be normal. So it wasn't just about having the power to make a random person die and getting the money, her life was at stake. Consequently, the creepy guy would program the box for the next victim and tell the good part to the woman who most likely has a husband and more people would die. To be honest the concept of the story for a horror movie is good, but I don't think it lived up to the vision of the director or whoever came up with the story and for some reason due to some sort of pressure or something, the director decided to go with it...I'm just speculating. It's not like the actors were terrible. The story just wasn't well-developed. At some point I felt that Cameron Diaz's husband knew a lot more about the box and the creepy guy than his wife because of the library scene where he is watched constantly and their son looked mysterious sometimes. They don't say who the creepy guy is working for, I don't know how he got all those people to work for him, I wasn't sure what role Cameron Diaz's husband's boss was playing, how safe her son was with him at the end, etc. I guess it's supposed to be one of those movies where you give your own ending, but I didn't like it. When I finished watching it I felt that I had wasted my time. They were a lot of loose threads. It was just confusing and very scary.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|This is a very good series that I use to supplement my biology classes.  The time-lapse sequences are superb and the slow motion can't be beat.
B0041T52S6|2.0|The worst type of film. The one you go into with such high expectations, only to see those expectations dashed.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|This is a truly great movie. I watched with my family and we all enjoyed. Great story, an utterly vibrant and beautiful way, the audience is shown an epic film filled with tragedy, truth, unfairness, redemption, hope, sacrifice, loyalty and love. It would be nearly impossible for anyone to walk away from this film without something worth holding onto.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|I would equate owning this product to that of the spare socket set one just never removed from the back of their truck. That is, it might not be necessary most of the time but it's sure nice to find when you need it.<br /><br />This product, with its multi-direction swivel, can be a real hassle saver when dealing with relatively inflexible cables in confined quarters. The product is also touted as preventing wear and tear on the cable if it's subject to frequent plugging and unplugging. That may be true, but I still believe that the primary benefit is that of immediate headache relief when that situation in which it's needed arises.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I got this the day it came out for 3.99 and got the deluxe today for 19.99 at a local store this have been another great album from Kanye West this is not just hiphop its art i listen to it none stop i also know alot of people who went out and got the album and they give it 5 stars this is real G.O.O.D MUSIC so if you dont got it a say get its a must have.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I like the product.  I had my monitor at work sitting on two organizer trays flipped upside-down.  Now the monitor can position closer to me and greatly improved my usable desk space.  Install was pretty easy, less than 10 minutes. I would buy another one for home if I had the need.
0525951652|5.0|One of Follets best so far.  Very engaging and full of interesting historical details about the WW1 era.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the 3 part series.
B00447G2MK|5.0|If someone can find 2 A Day To Remember albums that have the same exact sound, I would love to entertain the argument. Sure their sound changed slightly on this record, but it's still good-old \\"pop-core\\" that they are known for and no one can do the same. The people that say this album is a little bit lighter are right, it is. Not as many huge breakdowns with resonating bass, but it's perfectly fine because 4 out of the 10 songs do have a major breakdown. The lyrical content on this album is ridiculously incredible. I've never listened to an album and thought \\"this song perfectly describes the emotion in this situation, or this one... etc,\\" until now. Great album by a great band, buy it. SUPPORT MUSICIANS
B00338QENI|5.0|I thought this book was delightful.  A lot of interesting facts, as well as a very engaging story about Henrietta Lacks and her Family.  Read it!
B003ZW0MS0|5.0|Best since Sweet Tea.  Wish BG would come to NYC.  May need to visit Chicago in January to see him!
B002T9H2L0|1.0|I don't get the message of this movie.  It is disgusting and pointless.  Yes, war itself is disgusting and ugly, but this movie is an insult to all our brave men who fought against the Nazis.  Whoever read To Hell and Back by Audie Murphy got an idea what WWII looked like.  Our soldiers were not what this movie makes them!!
B0045LSIRM|5.0|Bryan Adams strips down his songs into just an acoustic guitar, piano, and vocals.  These arrangements place more emphasis on his voice to carry the songs.  The result is amazing and succeeds in creating an emotional impact.
B000MV8ZD6|4.0|I won't lie, I did not care for this movie when I first watched it back in 1987 and pretty much put it out of my head since then. recently, my wife had bought one of those cheap dvd collections of movies like Deep Red, Cat O' nine Tails, Last Man On Earth, Night Of The Living Dead, ect. But what did I see included with these gems? House By The Cemetery. So, feeling nostalgic for bad taste, I popped some popcorn, grabbed me a hard lemonade and sat down to give this Lucio Fulci offering a second look. Well, believe or not, I actually enjoyed it, with some minor complaints which, by the way, reminded me why I didn't care for it the first time around. First I'll talk about the negatives, not enough details about Freudstein's motive, he's a paper thin type killer with not a whole lot of depth. The same I would say about the other characters as well, who did not put up much of a fight against a slow moving, maggot filled corpse. The kid (Bob) voice dubbing is downright annoying, I almost put the volume on mute whenever he was going to talk. (I'd rather listen to a whining 2 year old with nasal issues than hear \\"Bob\\" again!) Positives: awesome soundtrack, good cinematography, a few well pace suspensful scenes creating the right atmosphere for an otherwise creepy horror film. Oh, did I mention the gory murder scenes? Makes Friday The 13th look like Romper Room! Hmm, maybe it was it the six pack and a half of hard lemonade that made this film more bearable a second time around. Ah, nonethless, I did like House By The Cemetery and would probably pick up a copy of the Anchor Bay release as an addition to my growing collection of Italian horror films. Besides for a walking maggot farm, Dr. Freudstein is a pretty cool monster!
B003WTE886|5.0|This album, by Taylor Swift, is truly crossover country and it's wonderful. Interestingly enough, I've been questioning its country genre.  No matter, I like all kinds of music and am very pleased with Taylor's work.  My personal favorite tracks are:<br /><br />1. Mine<br />4. Speak Now<br />6. Mean<br />7. The Story Of Us<br />8. Never Grow Up<br />9. Enchanted<br />10. Better Than Revenge<br />14. Long Live<br /><br />Thanksgiving will be the one month anniversary since I bought copies of this album & that I have been listening to it.  It feels like just a couple days ago that I had gotten this cd, which means it's a great album & I love it!
B004259BMM|5.0|This is an average KU album and that's not a bad thing! Every song is good. I don't feel there is any filler on these 8 tracks. For only $6.99, that's less than a $1.00/song. Itunes charges $1.29/song and you don't even get a hard copy! Trust me every song is Excellent! This may be an average KU album but its way ABOVE average when comparing to other artists' today!
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Let's face it, you gotta hand it to these 50-something guys for still cranking out great metal tunes after all these years. When this album was released in 2006, I really didn't know what to expect, since the Maiden machine had been inconsistent from 1990 to 2000. When Bruce returned, the identity of the band was restored, but the first two releases following Bruce's return were decent offerings, but nothing to be overly enthusiastic about. I'm pleased to say that this album tops those two in that it has a somewhat darker tone to it, and can really rock at times. There's a little more intellect in this album, as opposed to other albums. I love BRIGHTER THAN A THOUSAND SUNS; it's the best song on the album, and one of my all-time favorite Maiden songs. Bruce is stellar on vocals on this one,and really sings with emotion, and Steve has the Geddy bass thing going. I give this album 4.5 stars, because it's consistent throughout, and is very enjoyable overall. There are great riffs that stay with the listener on this one, such as THE REINCARNATION OF BENJAMIN BREEG, and OUT OF THE SHADOWS. Of course, the best one is BRIGHTER THAN A THOUSAND SUNS. Get this CD, and appreciate what an aging band can still produce. 9/10
B003X2O6KW|4.0|The CD My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was Kanye's 5th solo studio release. If you've kept up with Kanye from the beginning, you know that this is nothing like his previous work, as his albums constantly progress towards newer and different sounds. This CD relies heavily on a combination of synth production as well as live instrumentation. As a masterful musical genius, Kanye again does wonders on production. There are phenomenal string arrangements, beautiful harmonies, melodic runs and fills to help progress the theme of each track: Now for the info:    Pros: The pros are that Kanye definitely does something FAR from his College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation period, and something slightly off-kilter from 808s & Heartbreaks. More removed from the loss of his mother, the songs are not as gloomy as previous, but he keeps the dark feel. This allows more a more progressive cd, with the songs telling stories. Musically, the CD is phenomenal 6/5 (if even possible!?!), lyrically, Kanye still delivers the punches and the witticism.      Cons: This CD for Kanye still falls short by far of the gems he dropped consistently on his first two CDs. Lyrically, not Kanye's greatest, though the metaphors, similes, and and wit are all there, the lyrical content is more braggadocious that one would normally care for in an average dose of rap. You're constantly reminded of high-fashion, top-line cars, and Kayne's worldly possessions.     Though, in fairness, not every song is about some otherwordly theme or high-life, there are songs which relate to other issues, though it is [inadvertently] clear that they are not flowing with the [inadvertent] centrally-made theme. The music, though beautifully crafted and arranged, the CD also has an overall dark feel to it, which (in my opinion) recedes the playback ability of the CD as it leaves an opposite of the overall joys music leaves    Summary: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a musically genius CD that delivers mind-bogglingarrangements, high-end production, original Kanye West witticism, and a storybook-molded theme which pushes the music along    Lyrically: 4/5, Musically: 6/5 (lol), Content: 4/5.   **Overall: 4/5
0307454541|4.0|I would imagine that others have already commented at length about how great this book is, so I don't feel too much need to go into that.  Suffice to say, it's world famous because it is spectacular, fast-moving, insightful, cunning, and often quite suspenseful.  I couldn't put it down, though, in fairness, part of that may have been because my life is so damn stressful now that I am desperate for a diversion.<br /><br />The thing that struck me most positively about the book, however, was the author's cleverness.  I really marveled at how he interwove the plot details and the characters' lives and personalities.  He truly created a huge, interconnected, three-dimensional world in a way that so few can.  He is a true novelist.<br /><br />But I found a few flaws, the first being the biggest.<br /><br />1)  Had the story been more realistic and logical, when Mikael and Lisbeth found a beheaded, gutted cat on their front stoop they would have left the island immediately, and continued their investigation from a safer location.  That was obvious.  Yet when they stayed, doing the \\"courageous\\" thing, unnecessarily living completely unprotected, the author lost me.  Clearly he needed them to stay to further the plot; no matter that it compromised the reality of the story. Suddenly they stopped being the flesh-and-blood characters the author had worked so hard to create, and instead became comic book superheroes.  And, sadly, as a consequence the book from that point onward became much more dull for me.<br /><br />2)  A woman as smart as Lisbeth would have found a way to get her guardianship status removed.  That annoyed me throughout the book.  With her intelligence, hacking skills, and willingness to use blackmail she had ten times the necessary ingredients to do the thing that was most important to her in the world.  And she could have done it easily.  The author's denial of this proved to be a weakness of the book, and largely an unnecessary and unsatisfying one.<br /><br />3) I found the intricate history of the Vanger family DULL.  A bit more pruning would have been better.  It slowed the book down early on, and I could see how many people would have stopped reading it at that point.<br /><br />4) I got tired of Mikael's lousy sexual boundaries:  all-but-concurrent sex with his girlfriend/editor/boss, his neighbor/study subject, and his friend/research assistant/partner.  Of course, this is just my issue, but I got tired of it.  I get sick of reading about sex addicts.<br /><br />5) Weak ending.  The book literally petered out.  Yes, I know, there's a sequel (right?), but c'mon, that ending just dried up and died on the vine.of the Vanger family DULL.  A bit more pruning would have been better.

B0044KU7KU|5.0|And I honestly can't see why anybody would be. So, I've been with this band since its early Three Cheers days, and when The Black Parade was released, do you know how many reviews I saw that said it was horrible? A LOT. More than a lot. And yet here are people saying this is a cheap imitation of some Jonas Brothers pop band and TBP was TRUE rock, but what I don't understand is... how do you not hear strokes of songs from TBP on Danger Days? Besides that, truly, a band that knows how to reinvent itself like My Chemical Romance has time and time again is a band that's going to survive the test of time, and the fans need to accept this. Danger Days is an amazing album. FREAKING AMAZING. It has not left any of my various CD players since I first purchased it, and I smile like crazy when I'm listening to it.<br /><br />I fully admit that I am a fan of most genres of music, so maybe that's why I'm able to embrace their &#34;pop&#34; sound on this album. I also can't say this is the first time I've heard a sound like what's on Danger Days because I honestly don't listen to older rock -- for all I know, MCR was inspired by older bands on it. But to me, this album is completely refreshing to listen to and I personally don't think it's like anything out there today, &#34;Jonas Brothers bands&#34; and all. Perhaps because this year has been total crap for me and I love this band SO MUCH... that's the reason why I'm happy this album is here. I think I needed it -- it couldn't have been more perfect timing. And it's also the reason why I'm so ecstatic for the fun sound My Chem has instilled into Danger Days. It's &#34;no-regrets, dance until you drop, balls-out, air-guitar-around-your-house-in-your-underwear&#34; type of music, and I for one applaud them for making it so. With all the crap that's been going on in the world -- the economy, the job loss, etc. -- this album is like a lightning bolt of energy. IT'S HAPPY. And I need happy right now. Not depressing (although, I would never call MCR depressing, anyway).<br /><br />It's disheartening to hear when fans of an artist's work can't or won't embrace them when they try something new. If you've only listened to this album once, I implore you to give it another go-around before you decide to toss it in your trash. I'm copying and pasting what I said in my last review for TBP here because it still remains true for me to this day: &#34;The band is growing. I happen to like Three Cheers and Bullets equally. I don't think MCR would want to sound the same time after time after time... To me, an album is an expression of where you are in life at that particular moment. The lyrics and music SHOULD reflect this, and it shouldn't matter if it's creating a different sound or not. MCR's music is just about as much for them as it is for their fans, if not more. We should remember this as fans of their music and not write them off as complete has-beens because they've been featured on MTV one too many times. Just because they have a new sound DOES NOT mean they've sold out.&#34;<br /><br />Now for the songs themselves? I am sincerely in love with every single song on this album. It's like an orgasmic mix of trans-am 80s hair music, punk, psychedelic electronic, and dance music. And considering the persona each band member has created for themselves (Party Poison, Fun Ghoul, Jet Star, and Kobra Kid), the music fits PERFECTLY. &#34;Destroya&#34; is the one that stands out to me the most in excellence, but I can't say it's the only song on there that is my absolute favorite. The best thing about MCR is their ability to create albums that have songs on them that I can switch back and forth on my favorites. Tomorrow, &#34;Bulletproof Heart&#34; might be my favorite because they're all my favorites. When I first saw the music video for &#34;Na Na Na,&#34; I felt like this album was going to be a comic book adventure in music form, and I'm elated to say this holds true. I will continue to take anything MCR throws at me, and praise their name to anyone who has never heard this awesome band's music.<br /><br />Killjoys, make some noise! My Chemical Romance is back on the airwaves.name to anyone who has never heard this awesome band's music.  Killjoys, make some noise! My Chemical Romance is back on the airwaves.
0312600844|2.0|I read this mostly as a result to see what the fuss was all about.  Still haven't figured out what the fuss was about. Definitely over-rated and over-hyped by media. Is there such a thing as an intelligent professional book critic anymore?

0439023521|5.0|I picked up this book because this summer I saw the third book in every bookstore, so I was like, why not? I'm not really a reader of YA, but I have to say I absolutely love this. Cannot put it down the moment I picked it up. Collins had that magic where she pulled in the reader from the very first moment. The first person present tense gives the story an immediacy that quickly catches a reader's attention. When I finished the first chapter, I know I was a goner.    The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the country in North America is called Panem. There is the Capitol and then the 12 districts serving the Capitol. Because of a rebellion decades ago, the Capitol designed the Hunger Games as punishment to the districts and as a reminder that the Capitol has the power to destroy the districts should they ever try to rebel again. The Hunger Games is basically that the Capital picks 24 kids (a girl and a boy from each district) to participate in a game where they kill off each other in an arena and only 1 can live in the end.     Katniss Everdeen is a 16 year old girl living in District 12. When her younger sister was chosen to be in the Hunger Games, she volunteered. Thus begins her journey to the Capitol and all that ensues. Because of the rather dark nature of the story, it's sometimes hard to remember that Katniss is only 16. Like other girls, she can be selfish, throws tantrums, and just be an all-around teenager, but at the same time she's remarkably old for her age, has seen a lot of dreadful things in her life, and had the strength to survive all the obstacles life had thrown at her. Sometimes one can't help but admire Katniss, but like I said, she isn't likable all the time, so in this Collins has truly created a believable and real character with conflicting emotions.     For the length of the book, there're a lot of other characters, but while the characterization of some might be a bit lacking, one truly start to care for them through the eyes of Katniss. Even her competitors are not completely despicable. This only pulls at one's heartstrings even more because we know that they have to die, yet we can't help but wanting more than one of them to win the Hunger Games    Truly enjoyed this. Reading the next book now.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|What the hell??? These people that are bitching about this great dvd not being on blu ray?????  Omg stfu!!! Just enjoy the great music and the monument for Paul Gray and remember that slipknot owns! Period. Stop hating you selfish sob pricks!!
0439023491|4.0|Like the first one, I couldn't put this book down for the life of me. I just had to find out what happens to Katniss and all the others.<br /><br />This one beings when Katniss and Peeta has to do their Victory Tours. Before, Katniss finds out from President Snow that because of her defiance in the last Hunger Games, there are uprisings in the other districts. So the story is played out from there with Katniss trying to protect her loved ones in the backdrop of an uprising.<br /><br />This book does begin a bit slowly, as Katniss does a summary of what happened since she returned and kind of rushed through the Victory Tours. Like one reviewer said, I do wish Collins had given a present account of her meeting with Gale instead of having it be Katniss explaining what had happened, but this happens often in this series, even in the first book, where in the middle of something Katniss would draw up a memory of the past, which does interrupt the story somewhat.<br /><br />Mostly, Catching Fire deals with Katniss' conflicting feelings toward Gale and Peeta. While it sets up for the rebellion, most of the time we see Katniss trying to decide who to pick, yet at the same time Katniss keeps thinking that she isn't really capable of loving anyone. As always, we see a lot of Peeta and Gale only plays a small role in this book, but I wish Katniss would just pick someone. It's sooo frustrating!!! But the second half of the book gets better once Katniss has made up her mind about what to do and the Hunger Game continues.
1423113381|5.0|Son loves to read and this was one of he loves.  He has read all of the Percy Jackson books and loved this and finished reading it within one week.  Couldn't stop.
0060855924|3.0|I've just finished reading this & I'm scratching my head as to whether I like it or not. The first 30 pages were completely confusing as the author introduced too many characters in a world I hadn't yet grasped. After a while everything falls into place & makes sense (or nonsense) but you'll get the drift soon enough. At times it's really interesting but then the story will go off on a wild direction. It's not terribly cohesive although that's probably the idea. I can see how some people could find this addictive & I imagine if I continue reading the series I may fall under Pratchett's spell. If this sort of over the top humour fantasy has got you interested it's probably worth giving it a go but it will not appeal to everybody.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|I made every attempt to ignore the zebra print cover art for Beach House's third record, Teen Dream, as I rescued it from it's wrapper. Once inside the zebra carcass I found - surprise, surprise - two discs and two books. Bonus! I put the disc with the Easter blue zebra print on it in the player. Didn't appear to play. Put the disc with the Easter pink zebra print on it. Also didn't play. I looked at the pink zebra book then the blue zebra book. Stumped. And already tired of zebra. Then, finally, I put the blue disc back in ... it worked. It had a bit of silence at the beginning before things got started, but, once the music fell from the carcass, it sounded big and grad. Immediately better than the band's first two records. Turned it up.    The pink book revealed that the pink disc was in fact a full-length DVD full of videos for every song on the album, each video directed by a different filmmaker. The first director's name? Sean Pecknold. Hmm. Pecknold, as in Fleet Foxes Pecknold? Yep, the brother of the head Fox. Seemed odd to me, considering my first thought as Teen Dream's opening song played was \\"it sounds like these guys have been listening to the Fleet Foxes since their last album.\\" Weird. The closing video was directed by Broken Social Scene frontman Kevin Drew, too. But no, Teen Dream doesn't really sound too much like BSS. More on the videos later.    The first thing you need to know about the music side of Teen Dream is that it is a very big sounding record. Band members Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally took the R.E.M. approach while following up the success of their 2007 breakthrough, Devotion, here recording in a converted church. On board for the recordings was producer Chris Coady, a studio whiz known for helping bands (most notably TV on the Radio) sound bigger than life. The result is a record that sounds like a mix of Devotion, the Fleet Foxes, the most recent M83 record and Mazzy Star. The sound is dusty and dreamlike. Vintage in a really hip soap opera sort of way, if you can imagine such a thing.    Both books are full of creative imagery, giving Teen Dream the feel of a full-blown art project. Music. Film. Art. Some of the images in the blue book would've made for great album covers. (Anything but zebra print.) The songwriting here is good. Almost as good as the ornamentation, production or soulful - almost creepy - vocals. Nothing profound or hugely creative about the writing, but surely the kind of material that will dig its hooks into a fair share of arty college-age girls (and sensitive boys with silly glasses). Also recommended to the future soap-watchers of the world.    Needless to say when speaking of Beach House, this is a very dramatic sounding music, but in a cool way. Not quite Antony Hegarty Johnson dramatic, but in that ballpark. And the videos are a nice bonus, even if much of the work probably belongs on YouTube with all the other filmschool videos out there, rather than on a nationally distributed DVD. But that's not the point. The point is that this is very theatrical, visual music, so who cares if the videos are all big on production and short on concept and execution. There are much less desirable things to do than watch 10 young video artists overusing Final Cut Pro while listening to some very stellar tunes. Sean Honey's video for \\"Lover of Mine,\\" in particular, is a success. Beach House singer Victoria Legrand's video for \\"Silver Soul\\" is another winner, even if her work clearly struggles to find a balance between subject and style. Oh, and let's not forget director Allen Cordell's half great work on the video for \\"Walk in the Park.\\" Some beautiful cinematography on that one.    So, for a very modest price, you get a great new set of dream-pop music, a disc full of video art, two books and some zebra prints. Not bad. The main event here, obviously, is the music. And while the full presentation does enhance the experience, in the end, we just have the tunes. And they're great. TeenDream is the new cult classic of the uber dramatic, endlessly cinematic and wholly effeminate Sour Times genre. If you like Low, the Cocteau Twins, Portishead, Mazzy Star or even the Fleet Foxes and shoegazer stuff like Ride, chances are Teen Dream is going to be a very big record for you.
1400079144|4.0|Mr. Brown has a knack for mixing the factual and the fictional into a plausible scenario. He does it so well that the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" brought a whole slew of conspiracy loonies out of the woodwork. There were endless debates about the book's validity as well as copy-right infringment lawsuits and books rushed into publication to refute it. All this over a simple work of friggin' fiction. \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is more of the same, but this time, it revolves around the Masons. The author's book is pure escapism. The protagonist, Robert Langdon, is certainly no Indiana Jones. He's smart but kind of wimpy. The mysterious antagonist, Mal'akh, is scary, but it doesn't take Einstein to figure out who he really is behind all the tattoos. I was concerned about the characters and genuinely shocked about one specific claustrophobic event involving Langdon. The book was a fun way to kill some time and learn a little bit of Washington trivia.
B003OJBWGK|5.0|Look at the cover of this record. Look at the title of this record. Look at the name of the band. And hey, listen to this record, even. No, there's nothing new or unique about Best Coast and their debut record, Crazy For You. The record streamed in advance on Urban Outfitter's website; Bethany Cosentino, the gal who writes, sings and plays guitar in Best Coast, looks like an actor playing a rocker chick in a movie that would surely star Juno; and Bobb Bruno, Cosentino's partner in crime, looks like a million other California stoner dudes who play guitar and wear ironic T-shirts and glasses. The lyrics discuss important things like hanging out, boys, boredom, weed and summer fun throughout the record's 12 pop-rock cuts. It's gross. Seriously, this is a gross record. Even the irony-drenched cover brings the gags.    Just kidding. I absolutely love Best Coast's debut record, Crazy For You, even if it seems like the most obvious summer indie record ever made. I like it because, unlike most of the hip records out this year, it's not a weird record. It sounds almost exactly like that band Girls (also from California), but with a girl singer and a whole lot more consistency. When describing the record to a friend, I said the following: \\"No, no, shut up dude! Crazy For You reminds me of that first Strokes record - the one with the hand and the butt and the glove. No, dummy, it doesn't sound like the Strokes. Are you seriousl! LOL! I mean, they could tour together, but it doesn't sound like the Strokes. LOL! Mostly, it's just that it's a super obvious, been there/done that record that is too good to deny. Seriously, dude, you just gotta hear it a couple of times. It's like that band The Tyde, from a few years ago, but actually good. Or kind of like a sister to that new Wavves record.\\"    Said friend zoned out on me somewhere during the babble; I've not heard from him since. I figure he's either A) totally obsessed with Crazy For You; B) taking a break from our friendship; orC) scoping out AA programs and planning my intervention. Any way you look at it, I did my job. The dude has good taste, and will thus find his way to Best Coast one way or another because, make no mistake, Best Coast made a phenomenal first record. This is the sound of my summer, and surely many others - no shame in sight.    I know what you're thinking - Dum Dum Girls. All Girl Summer Fun Band. Vivian Girls. Times New Viking. All that stuff. Nope, not this one. I've heard all those bands and all those records, and none compare to the fuzzy summer stoner anthems of Crazy For You. The ingredients are simple: imaginary girlfriend vocals; pseudo-surf vibes; Bill Murray and Thurston Moore as super fans; awesomely lazy riffs that echo and bounce; simple drum and bass that never gets in the way; four or more hooks per song; a whole lot a moments that will remind you of your favorite late-90s indie bands; and, of course, Cosentino, who is about as alluring as they come (fyi, I've never seen the girl, only heard her sing). There's also that whole laid-back California vibe, but nothing here really matters more than how many hooks and melodies Cosentino crams into this record. This is pop music. Very cool, very addicting pop music, not at all unlike that first Strokes record. Cut the fat; add some fuzz; nail the hooks; press record; repeat.    You'll hear these songs in movies for years to come, no doubt. Indie rock high school boys will have a new crush and their girlfriends will have a new hero. This is the record that will be made into a T-shirt and pop up as a point of discussion in a movie starring Jonah Hill, Jesse Eisenberg or Scott Pilgrim. It's a better version of that pretty great Harlem record, Hippie, that got a lot of attention a few months ago. Seriously, as crazy as it sounds, this is a minor classic in the making, and deserving so.    To recap: Juno; surfer/stoner; girlfriend vocals; hooks; Girls; California; fuzz; Bill Murray; and melodies. And that's aboutit. The lyrics aren't deep or complex (\\"I want you soooo much\\"; \\"I'm happy / I'm happy / I'm happy / You make me happy\\"; \\"The world is lazy but you and me, we're just crazy / But when I'm with you, I have fun / When I'm with you, I have fun\\" etc.), but they always work. And the playing is at all times about as simple as your least favorite local band. But somehow, this record just works. It's fun and easy and undeniable. Records like this don't come out often, not since The Ramones lost their touch. Yep, I'll admit it: I'm in love with Best Coast, even if this is the only record they ever make that's worth listening to, which is very likely.
B0040JHXTS|5.0|I bought the Blu-ray box set primarily for the 2009 high-definition video of the \\"Darkness\\" album recorded live in Asbury Park.  Everyone has to perform his or her own calculus as to whether the separate parts of this box set merit the asking price.  For me, the Asbury Park footage is worth the full price of admission, and everything else in the box set is an extra.  The video quality is spectacular in high-contrast 1080p/24.  The 24/48 LPCM audio (in both 5.1 and 2.0) is crystal clear, dynamic, detailed and involving, albeit slightly bass shy (which I can fix via a simple subwoofer gain adjustment in my 5.1 surround system).    But best of all, the performance is incredible.  I have never seen Bruce solo so ferociously on guitar, and the rest of the band sounds great, too.  Standouts for me are \\"Racing in the Street\\" and \\"Adam Raised a Cain.\\"  Would I have preferred to buy the Asbury Park performance as a standalone Blu-ray for a fraction of the box set's price?  Yes, of course.  But given that this footage is not available separately, I took the plunge on the box set and have no regrets.    By the way, I have started tracking though the Houston and Phoenix 1978 live footage and the performances are, of course, amazing.  As expected, the audio and video captures of these '78 performances are nowhere near the quality of the '09 Asbury Park performance (and the Houston footage is much rougher than the Phoenix footage), but as noted above, I consider these recordings as essentially free extras (along with the three CD's).
B0029LX2LC|5.0|I'll admit to being confused when I heard the news that The Roots had accepted the gig as Jimmy Fallon's in-house late night band. I wasn't bummed, because they'd been stale for years, but did figure that, as recordings artists, The Roots were all but done. The Fallon gig, to me, felt like retirement. I bought their ninth studio album, How I Got Over, recording during their ongoing Fallon gig, because I was about to leave for a long trip and wanted some new music. I checked the 30-second samples online and, surprisingly, of all the records I could find that night (and didn't already have), it was the best option.    A few days later, while on my \\"long trip,\\" it clicked. I'd been playing the record mostly as background music, which is all I figured it'd ever be for me, when songs started to jump into the foreground. I'd bought, somewhat enjoyed, and eventually sold off nearly every record the Philly-based hip-hop band had ever released, but this one seemed different. How I Got Over, despite its epic list of guest artists, felt very concise - or maybe cohesive is the right word. Clocking in at about 43 minutes over 14 tracks (only 11 of which are proper songs), the record is the band's by-far tightest work yet. They've dropped the need for the forced inventiveness we heard on Phrenology and moved on from the lousy crossover pop efforts of The Tipping Point.    They're no longer obsessed with paying tribute to J. Dilla or making a \\"throwback\\" or concept record. They're no longer confused or burdened by their own expectations. Basically, it seems that The Roots are finally at the point in their career where they're done trying to be this or that, and are now comfortable just making a record. The irony of this newfound maturity is that, by not being overly conceptual, the band has made their best record yet. And, believe it or not, we have Jimmy Fallon to thank. Fallon because he's the man who got these guys to play together on a daily basis with a new set of challenges.Taken away from the focus of their own music, The Roots were able to grow, digesting the music of guests with each show they played, turning down no challenge. And thus we have a record full of guests that never really feels like a record full of guests. Artists like Joanna Newsom, The Dirty Projectors, Monsters of Folk and more pop up, including Dice Raw. More predictable guests like John Legend and Phonte show up, too, but, like all the indie rock guests, they blend in nicely.    Frontman Black Thought subtly holds things together without ever being too overzealous. He pops up here and there, the only constant voice in a sea of big personalities. His band, fronted in musical direction by drummer Ahmir \\"?uestlove\\" Thompson, also never come off as too anxious. They don't sound like a subtle/safe late night backing band and they don't sound like the rap band that used to try to hard. Here, surprisingly, they simply do what works and nothing more, in doing so, creating a boom-bap surprise.    How I Got Over, featuring instant classics like \\"Radio Days,\\" \\"Right On\\" and \\"Walk Alone,\\" works for me in the same way old A Tribe Called Quest, Jungle Brothers and De La Soul records worked for me in the early 90s. The sound is organic, lean, melodic and soulful; it's the kind of record you can play over and over again, whether you like hip-hop, indie rock or pop. Against all odds, a sub par late night show has made The Roots relevant again.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie was absolutely unreal. The story itself, the characters all having their own respective parts in the movie where they do something stunning. I've seen this movie 4 times in theaters and enjoyed it more so that time then the previous. I too have been impatiently waiting for this one to come out. I have never enjoyed a movie in its entirety such as this and the soundtrack is amazing itself
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Over his forever interesting career Kanye West has time and time again proven himself to be the hip-hop equivalent of rocker Ryan Adams. Both men are consistently good at what they do, often prolific and, maybe most importantly, passionate loudmouths who, as celebrities, keep mostly transparent personas. The major difference is that Adams, like it or not, is a genius of his craft and West is, at best, something of an idiot savant. Listening to West's new record, the undeniably great My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I can't help but chuckle at all the faux paus, simplistic \\"concepts,\\" misunderstandings and shallow thoughts bursting from below the thick layer of confidence West cakes his lyrics with. Recently, via his Twitter account, West (who has of late been doing all he can to frame himself as some sort of groundbreaking art star) wrote about an expression he'd just learned, tweeting something to the effect of \\"I just heard this new term, commerical art, have y'all heard of it? I realize that's what I do, commercial art!\\" Yes, Kanye, we've heard of commercial art. Hey Kanye, have you heard of toenails? They're great! OMG, they've made sense of my life! You should check `em out!    Later, still via Twitter, West went on to call cheese ball pseudo-artist (and West protégé, natch) Kid Cudi his \\"favorite artist alive,\\" later talking about how he had \\"just discovered\\" abstract expressionist Mark Rothko. I could go on about the blind idiocy of Kayne West. Heck, I could fill a book with the ridiculous things he's said and done \\"in the name of his art;\\" but all that said, I also believe that his lack of self awareness is the very thing that allows him to wholly believe that he's the most important man on earth - and it's that very belief that keeps him so interesting. Couple his incredible level of naivety with his labored understanding of pop craft, love of hip-hop history and undeniable production skill and you have the most fascinating big-name working pop artist of the moment.     Speaking candidly, Beautiful is the exact kind of hip-hop record that the rock-centric genre tourists (the ones confused by Earl Sweatshirt, scared of Dead Prez and in love with Jay-Z and maybe Eminem) hold high, as if they're suddenly experts on the hip-hop genre. And with Beautiful, West has become even more of a critics' darling, making, again, the exact kind of hip-hop record that white writers - both young and, especially, old - love, understand, appreciate and call a classic. There's nothing too new here, aside from some of the song lengths and determination; the language, writing and delivery will be alien to no one who fell in love with hip-hop through MTV; the pop turns and songs structures are as right now as any Lady Gaga effort; and last but not least, credibility is achieved by West's attachment to the aesthetics of the much respected Native Tongues movement of the late 80s. So, yes, Beautiful will be a hit among critics and fans alike, probably way more than it deserves to be.    The highlights are everywhere, varied in their appeal, moving from artful moment to radio-ready hit to classic hip-hop, all amazingly produced. A long record featuring a handful of downright epic productions, West really went for it with Beautiful, building beats that almost always feel as big and memorable as past works like \\"All Falls Down,\\" \\"Gold Digger\\" and \\"Crack Music,\\" continuing a production career that already ranks among the all-time best. Collaborating with West at times are his two biggest influences, RZA and No I.D., as well as Mike Dean, Jeff Bhasker and many others. After two years of recording in Hawaii, often inviting friends and fellow artists to come play along, West ended up spending over $3 million on recording the record, employing musicians and recording a huge number of songs along the way, eventually settling on a 13-track setlist.    The lesser tracks, for my money, include \\"Hell of a Life\\" (though it does feature one of West's mostinnovative arrangements yet), \\"Monster\\" and \\"So Appalled,\\" none of which are bad songs, pre se.  \\"Monster,\\" featuring the dreadful Rick Ross, the out-of-place Bon Iver, Jay-Z and West protégé Nicki Minaj (who is one heck of a creative performer), drags on forever, held together by a formulaic verse-hook-verse format. \\"All of the Lights,\\" surely a future radio hit, is damn good, save for the snoozer mod-era R&B hook that could be sung by any number of today's female R&B clones. \\"So Appalled,\\" despite featuring way too many guests and awful usage of the word \\"ridiculous\\" over and over again through the whole of the song, is a decent posse cut while \\"Lost In the World,\\" again featuring Bon Iver, is one of the more unlikely pop-indie-rap songs I've ever heard. The rest of the record is, well, pretty damn perfect. \\"Dark Fantasy,\\" \\"Gorgeous,\\" \\"Power,\\" \\"Devil in a New Dress\\" and \\"Runaway,\\" especially, are all new West classics. New hip-hop classics. They're big, diverse in aesthetic appeal and about as well produced as any hip-hop or pop record you'll heard in 2010.    While West may seem to be little more than the latest in a long line of pop stars who strut around proudly (and cluelessly) in funny sunglasses as if they're the first to do so, I believe he is worthy of the fuss. The emcee/producer's blind ability to shamelessly play along with current trends while producing classic hip-hop beats works well to support his unmatched ambition. Maybe I've been prompted by West himself to say this, but damn if the man isn't in the middle of his Michael Jackson moment, standing tall as a pop star worthy of all the attention and fandom he's been receiving, asinine moments and all. Quite possibly a new hip-hop - and pop - classic.  [...]
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Here's another movie that was brilliantly put together by Ben. Has anyone seen Gone Baby Gone, his first director role and he killed it. His brother was the main character, good one-two punch. I watch this movie everytime it comes on cable, it draws you in. But the Town, wow, I could tell it would be good by the previews but everything about this movie had me on the edge of my seat. All the costumes and just the story itself didnt seem like it couldnt happen in the real world. 10/10
B0040T7B2W|4.0|Opener \\"I Didn't See It Coming,\\" featuring lead vocals by, I'm told, actress Carey Mulligan (An Education), is best heard through headphones. If played on your stereo or computer or in your car, you'll miss all the best parts of the song - frontman Stuart Murdoch's subtle backing harmonies and, mostly, layer after intricate layer of cutesy flourishes. Perfectly well written and composed, the lead vocals don't work as well as they should; a shock when you consider how well Murdoch worked with guest female vocalists on his God Help the Girl side project. It's sad to see such an otherwise great pop song soiled by a guest vocal that needn't be. (Mulligan or not, the vocal doesn't work.)    Write About Love, the eighth proper studio record from Glasgow indie poppers Belle & Sebastian is focused, you guessed it, on the endlessly interesting topic called love. Recorded once again with American producer Tony Hoffer, who handled duties on the band's last record, the excellent The Life Pursuit, Write About Love again sees the band in big and full mode, here mixing the preciousness of their early records with the power of, say, The New Pornographers. Murdoch again playing the role of creative honcho (as he should have been all along), the songs are all well written and composed, if not as effectively as the band's last two proper releases.    Belle albums, no matter how or when they were recorded, are all the same in one particular way. And by that, I mean that they all feature two or three instant standouts, one or two absolute snoozers, and six-to-eight mid-tempo growers. Some records have more standouts or snoozers that others, but all feature a solid number of songs whose appeal grows with familiarity. Track seven, \\"I'm Not Living In the Real World,\\" is a poppy grower, for example, while \\"Read the Blessed Pages\\" is a snoozer and \\"Come On Sister\\" is a standout. That's just how Belle & Sebastian albums work. Despite crafting pretty straight forward pop music, the Belles havenever been a band that makes an accurate first impression. This is because, partly, they make very detailed, clever music. Grasp the melodies and hooks easily, sure; then digest them; then whatever. Be you a student of Burt Bacharach or the guy working the music counter at Barnes and Noble, to form a proper opinion about a Belle album (and by that, I mean to respect the artists involved with repeat listens), you have to give these songs a week or more. (You're not special, so buck up or shush up.)    That said, I didn't personally like the Norah Jones guest vocal on \\"Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John\\" (or most of this record) the first or fifteenth time I heard it. A man usually bursting with great taste, I get the feeling Murdoch's eyes were lost in the fame and beauty of Jones' smoky glow. Again, too bad, the song seemed otherwise solid. Pretty girls make graves; Stu, of all people, should know that much.    \\"I Can See Your Future\\" sums up Write About Love pretty well. It should be a new indie pop classic. It's written by a man with a clear gift and the composition is one to love deeply on Saturday afternoons in the fall with your beloved. But damn, the lead vocal, again, is handed off to some Isobel Campbell impersonator. Murdoch, who went through a sad phase a few records ago - where he'd often hand off both writing duties - made two consecutive classics (Dear Catastrophe Waitress and Pursuit) last decade where he was almost always upfront, alone. Well, damn, he's up to his old failures again, seemingly letting whoever sing whenever they please. The man writes and composes great pop music, but all the string and keyboard swells in the world can't save the dooming of less talented friends and guests. And thus, here it is, Write About Love, one of the very worst Belle & Sebastian records yet. Maybe even the worst. If you're a fan, be sure to check out the songs, pick your favorite and maybe make an EP length playlist. Then go listen to something else and hope for yet another Belle comeback record.
B00004RJ74|4.0|The best horror/slasher flicks are the ones that never, ever, take themselves seriously--super slimy grimy vegamatic over-the-tops with satirical tongues planted firmly in cheeks (though in which anatomical cheek it's unclear).  FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is one of these awful gems; it's nonsensical and silly and gruesome and bad and as much darn fun as one can ever hope to have watching a cut-'em-up (plus in this case, bite-'em-up).  In fact, after the first uber-violent, utterly ridiculous bloodletting orgy I jumped from my couch to give FROM DUSK TILL DAWN a standing ovation.  Now that's entertainment.<br /><br />Made in the mid-Nineties before anyone knew who the hey George Clooney was (or is) and directed by Robert Rodriguez with screenplay by Quentin Tarantino (who also stars as Clooney's warped brother), this is one bad flick about two violent robbers who kidnap a family and flee to Mexico to seek refuge at some hole-in-the-wall off-road bar. . .a bar offering anything but refuge.  Needless to say as dusk ensues the vamps come out of the woodwork while the violence is sloshed by the bucketful as mayhem spins madly with the occasional clever zany quip.  Other performers I particularly enjoyed include Fred \\"The Hammer\\" Williamson, Tom Savani (when he tries to hide his \\"changing\\" into a vampire from his fellow companions I was rolling on the floor), a surprisingly subdued Harvey Keitel, and Cheech Marin (in multiple roles).  But nothing--and I mean NOTHING--compares to a heart-thumping striptease performed by a gorgeous, stunning Salma Hayek; it's visual Viagra that's instant money, and it's yet another reason why FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is nonstop, goofy fun.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B003XX2PD6|5.0|I'm proud to admit that I own at least one copy of everything Deerhunter-related, including the overrated 1978 Michael Cimino war-era drama. To me, Deerhunter frontman Bradford Cox is what we all sit around tailking about: an artist who knows what came before, digested it and found a way to produce something new-yet-familiar that is forever covered, front to back, with his unique fingerprints. No one has ever sounded like Bradford Cox before, but he's really not doing anything too weird or difficult, especially on this record, Halcyon Digest, the fifth proper Deerhunter full length (that's counting the band's impossible-to-get debut and the obscure Carve Your Initials Into the Walls of the Night). The Deer's last record, 2008's double album, Mircocastle/Weird Era Continued, saw the Atlanta-based rockers taking leaps towards a more commercially accessible sound, a jump that continues on Halcyon.    The result is a sound that would've once been described as \\"college rock radio,\\" but now, because it is both straightforward and strange, is harder to classify. Neither a proper Pitchfork/blog-era band or Rolling Stone outsider champion, Deerhunter could almost be described as a Radiohead-aware garage band with a kinda/sorta girly singer. That is, a garage band with some pretty cool tricks and toys, and a leader with lyrics and vocals too good to be screamed or buried in the mix.     Lengthy opener \\"Earthquake\\" is a slow, muddy and atmospheric stage-setter, showing that, once again, the Deers have some new cards to play. Despite its modest production, the song feels every bit as expansive and pseudo-progressive as a Radiohead cut. There's no big post-production, politics or pretentious vibe here; this is a slow, sturdy opener for indie rockers who prefer the art of album-making to stage antics or unnecessary scene-setting.    Next up is \\"Don't Cry,\\" a poppy, mid-tempo rocker that could've easily been on disc one of Microcastle. Three years ago a fairly accessible cut likethis, which displays Cox's signature optimism, would've been the band's most radio-friendly work to date. Same goes for \\"Memory Boy.\\" Not here. On Halcyon, a song like Don't Cry is only a warm-up for a track like Revival, an instantly lovable carnival ride into the depths of the band's endless ability to write fresh and cool songs. While raving on about this record to friends, I always make mention of \\"Revival,\\" calling it one of the two \\"lifer\\" cuts on the record. (What's a \\"lifer\\" cut, you ask? Have you heard the opening song on Loveless? Or how about \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\")    Guitarist Lockett Pundt's \\"Desire Lines\\" is another instant standout. For the unfamiliar, Pundt (who releases solo albums under the Lotus Plaza moniker) is also a very solid song maker, working closely with Cox all along, together developing a cohesive sound. He's the one sideman in the history of sidemen who I wish would contribute even more songs to his band's records.    There's too man great songs here to discuss, truthfully, but I'd be a failed critic if I didn't mention the sax-laced \\"Coronado,\\" easily my favorite cut of this year. It's Cox at his most memorable and lovable, catapulting him, in my opinion, to the top of the songwriter heap. A song you just have to hear.    While some may still prefer the artsy approach of the band's breakout record, Cryptograms, to the more accessible Halcyon Digest, I do not. Not even close. And I'd argue that anyone with adult opinions about art also will not. As much as I love and respect experimental bands like Animal Collective (whom Cox also loves and sometimes even works with), I have a greater respect for an artist like Bradford. The man knows that, at the end of the day, it's the pop songs that stick and last and influence. And, knowing this, he approaches his work with a strong creative love, using every second of every song, squeezing as many details and ideas into the margin as he can. The deep, strange art and inventiveness is always there, mixed in the moments that hold together verse and hook.    The result is one of 2010's best releases yet. And, even more importantly, Cox here becomes (along with Sufjan Stevens), the new leader of his thoroughly confused, blog-screwed generation of overzealous hipster artists. Hopefully some of these flavor-of-the-month kids will find the influence of Halcyon and maybe start making music that still sounds good next weekend. Halcyon Digest is a rare thing: art rock done right.

B004498KPU|3.0|I've got to say, I'm rather disappointed in this set. My main complaint is that more than half the videos are presented in full-screen format even though the packaging states the set is formatted for widescreen. I guess they mean it will display full-screen properly on your widescreen TV and not necessarily that all the videos are PRESENTED in widescreen. The videos that are presented in widescreen are fuzzy and seem out of focus. This review is coming from someone who is spoiled by the quality of blu-ray and whom hasn't bought a standard DVD in over 2 years. So maybe what I am complaining about is just standard DVD quality that I've long forgotten about, 6x less the resolution than what I am used to viewing. Either way, the video quality (for something that was supposed to be remastered for color) looks like laserdisc quality at around 420 LTV, with that old VHS-looking screen jittering and linear block-like fuzz. I actually compared the quality of these videos to my VISIONARY set, and sure enough, the quality is identical minus dirt specs, so obviously the color remastering they are boasting is strongly attributed to dirt removal. I guess that alone is an improvement, but just know the videos do not look any better than they ever have as far as resolution goes. People used to DVD quality will probably be more than happy with it and not notice a thing. Again, maybe I am so spoiled by 1080p blu-ray quality that my expectations were set too high for 480p resolution, but honestly most of the videos look like laserdisc with 420 lines of TLV and not even 480p. I've seen some decent 480p DVDs upconverted on my 1080p set and look close to 720p but this set just disappoints my every expectation. I know these videos are old, but come on! Jazz the quality up a little and don't sell us something we already have! I traded in my Greatest Hits 1 & 2 DVDs as well as my Dangerous Short Films DVD for $1 each preparing for this set to replace them, but technically this is the same exact thing I already had, just in one box. I'm really disappointed, and when I emailed Sony about a blu-ray release, I got no response. It is what it is I guess. This is still Michael Jackson and I still am glad to have this collection on my shelf. The book is cool, but beware it's cardboard covering and not hardcover.. I thought \\"hard-bound\\" meant something thicker than cardstock, but what do I know. It's worth $28 on Amazon but I wouldn't spent anything more than $30 on it anywhere else. I think my biggest complaint is I just want to see Michael in all his amazing glory, and the quality of this set doesn't allow for that :( Come on Sony, where is my Blu-Ray?

B003WMX3SY|5.0|After being a PC user for more than 10 years I finally decided to take the plunge and build my first rig from scratch. The case is the last item I ordered from Amazon.com as planned. I already tested the system to be up and running before I put the components into the case. I also downloaded the installation manual from Antec's Web site before the case was delivered to familiarize myself with the procedures. I realized that there are almost endless possibilities with this case. To keep things easier for myself as a novice, I shot for the more 'conventional' set up. It took me a couple of hours to finish in the end. Some of that time was spent figuring out some nuts and bolts but generally the set up was straight forward. With all the excitement I managed to lose one of the pre-installed thumbscrews for a side panel. I meant to order a spare one from Antec via email and they sent me two for free. Hats off to the guys at Antec. I've been using the case ever since. Though I'm not a heavy gamer I pretty much have the PC on all the time when I'm home. It's working without a glitch and I don't reckon there's a problem with dust. Great product and service from Antec!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|If you're a fan of historical movies, especially historical people like Queen Victoria and Prince Albert then this is your movie. Yes, you probably have seen the different versions of movies available for these two historical figures, so what's one more. Take another look of how Queen Victoria stepped in to rule a monarchy that is still standing today.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I first watched this series when it aired on TV.  As soon as it was released I purchased it and have watched several times through.  Great for kids and great for adults as well.
B003A3K3JW|5.0|Watching and hearing Gustavo Dudamel not only as Conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic but also with his visiting Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela for the past two years seems to confirm the fact that here is a gifted musician whose place in the world of music making and in bringing music to our youth is assured.  He is dynamic, a showman on the podium, but in the end he has an enduring sense of pure humility that is rare today: first the music and the performers and last the conductor.<br /><br />This performance of both the Stravinsky: Le Sacre du Printemps and the  Revueltas: La Noche de los Mayas - works he repeats almost everywhere he conducts - are just his cup of tea.  This recording is bold, brash, rich in sonorities, and brimming over with the energy that explodes from each work. And yet Dudamel goes not only for the drama in works such as both of these but he also takes time to linger on the quiet phrases, providing just the right amount of tension release the score requires.<br /><br />Even the more adamant naysayers are falling under his spell, his gift for making music immediate and yes, even timeless.  He simply has it.  Grady Harp, November 10
B003PGNBNY|4.0|This is a pretty good Disney flick with some catchy toons.  I especially like the song \\"Introducing Me.\\"  I would recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first one and enjoys a good musical.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|The Dresden Opera was wise to have this live performance of Verdi's warhorse RIGOLETTO recorded and committed to DVD as this is like the only time we will be able to see/hear  Juan Diego Fl&oacute;rez as the Duke of Mantua.  He is absolutely magnificent in this production , but then equally as impressive is Diana Damrau as Gilda.  She is a beautiful woman with an extraordinarily fine voice and stage presence.  And Zeljka Lucic captures the multifaceted aspects of the tortured jester Rigoletto.  Fabio Luisi conducts with a fine sense of pacing the performance, allowing the singers to rule when in aria and at the same time keeping the orchestral sound propulsive to make the drama move.  The production itself is by Nikolaus Lehnhoff who once again wants us to believe that putting costumes from various periods on the characters (primarily the trench coat look) is supposed to make the drama more intense.  It gets a bit wearisome except for the fabricated stage parcels that allow us to observe other character's reactions to the drama as it unfolds.<br /><br />But all that aside this is a Rigoletto for the top of the heap. Hopefully there will be a CD version to allow those who don't favor the 'look' of this production to just listen.  Grady Harp, November10
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena McKennitt's first two albums, \\"Elemental\\" and \\"Parallel Dreams,\\" were self-produced albums of traditional Celtic music, in addition to classical poems set to music and instrumental pieces. Only with the \\"The Visit\\" did Loreena begin her own lyrical contributions and really come into her own. Now after years of exploring Celtic culture and its historical path through the Mediterranean and the Middle East, she's returning to the traditional Irish music that launched her career.<br /><br />It's interesting to listen to her interpretations of these songs compared with her earlier works. It reflects the years of life experience that has passed, and shows how her voice and musical style have matured. She brings in less of her well-known ethereal sound, opting for a more earthy tone for the first few tracks. \\"As I Roved Out\\" and \\"The Star of the County Down\\" are lively Irish jigs, energetic and fun. She interprets W.B. Yeats \\"Down by the Sally Gardens\\" beautifully, taking a rather short poem and expanding it into a full length song. She famously set Yeats' \\"Stolen Child\\" to music in \\"Elemental,\\" so coming back to his works truly exemplifies a return to her roots.<br /><br />The traditional English ballad \\"The Death of Queen Jane\\" is a standout, beautiful and tragic, it leaves you thinking about it long after the song is over. The instrumental piece \\"The Emigration Tunes\\" is actually a song she performed live early in her career, which she has reinterpreted for this album.<br /><br />The last song, \\"The Parting Glass\\" is extremely powerful and somber. You rarely hear such genuine emotion, and it speaks to anyone who has endured a personal loss.<br /><br />This is a beautiful album by a great artist looking back over her life, finding perspective by returning to her roots.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I came a little late to the Josh Groban party; he already had three albums out and the Christmas one on the way. I think that may be why changes in style and mood from album to album don't bother, or delight, me as they do fans who've been there from the beginning. I recognize \\"Illuminations\\" is a hard right turn away from previous efforts, but there is a lot to enjoy here.<br /><br />\\"Hidden Away\\" and \\"Higher Window\\" are real surprises for me; they're simple, beautiful songs, and not unlike the song \\"Awake\\" from the album of the same name; however, the melodies are very strong here and the lyrics feel close to home. \\"Straight to You\\" is starting to look like my favorite song of his: the interpretation is sublime, the instrumentation inspired, and I like that he stays in mid-range, which reinforces the lyrics of the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" is the coolest song he's ever done. Had he stuck to the previous albums' formula, this could have had the track 1 spot. Obviously the beat is killer. And do the chords in the chorus sound distinctly...Native American? Even cooler. There are a lot of amazing layers in these songs, some of which require the use of headphones to fully appreciate.<br /><br />\\"London Hymn\\" is where I started to think I understood the underlying inspiration JG was working from. I don't know too much about his musical roots - I know he loves the theater - but it's hard not to think he owns a lot of classical music. When you hear pieces like Rachmaninov's \\"Vespers\\" or Sibelius' \\"Andante Festivo,\\" it's extremely easy to make the transition to \\"London Hymn\\" or \\"Straight to You.\\"<br /><br />There are other strong songs - \\"If I Walk Away,\\" \\"War at Home,\\" \\"L'Ora Dell'Addio.\\" The French song was just okay for me, as were \\"Bells of NYC\\" and \\"Galileo.\\" He does use quite a lot of falsetto this time around, which is...interesting, and sometimes it's lovely and sometimes I kind of raise an eyebrow... \\"The Wandering Kind\\" sounds like Jim Brickman, and I just don't go for that kind of piano music. Something, instead, along the lines of Enya's \\"A Day Without Rain\\" would have completely made my day.<br /><br />While I understand the frustration of the fans who were hoping for a different style and selection of songs, some of the highly negative reviews here are just silly. One reviewer said it was the worst singing they had heard, maybe ever? If that is the case, whatever criteria they are using is so far from the realm of actual musical adjudication as to be basically worthless. Even his most over-eager fans are still right: he has one of the best voices, period. It doesn't help anyone to demean him for the sake of a one- or two-star review.<br /><br />I applaud him for trying new things, for taking a risk in a new direction, and I feel as though with this album I understand better who he is, as a person and musician. Hopefully he will get the overall sense that this was a success by his definition, and continue to find happiness giving of himself in the coming years.I just don't go for that kind of piano music.

044654759X|3.0|This book is not Nicholas Sparks' best work. I liked it a lot but it got dragged out toward the end when Kevin went to search for Katie (Erin). This book reminded me of the movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" which I felt that the idea was sort of stolen from the movie with a little twist of course. Overall not a bad book but I guess I expected more after reading \\"The Lucky One\\", \\"Three Weeks with my Brother\\", \\"Dear John\\", and \\"The Last Song\\" which by the way my favorite books from Sparks.

B002M9WW30|5.0|The odds were equally stacked against Sylvester Stallone as they were against his creation, the fictional southpaw boxer Rocky Balboa - a million to one shot. Languishing in obscurity as an extra in small films, Stallone managed to sell his script, about a Philadelphia club fighter who gets a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship, and an American cinematic icon was born. Spanning six films, the Rocky series stands as one of the most lucrative franchises in Hollywood history and has truly penetrated the cultural lexicon.    In Rocky, washed-up Philly boxer Rocky Balboa is granted the chance of a lifetime. Hand-picked by boxing champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as his next opponent, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) must find the physical strength under the tutelage of scrappy trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and the courage to go the distance and prove that he's \\"not just another bum from the streets.\\" But even if he doesn't win, at least he will find love and self respect in the arms of Adrian (Talia Shire). Rocky won the 1978 Oscar for Best Picture, made the name \\"Adrian\\" an annoyance to anyone bearing the name, and inspired countless people to run up staircases and throw their fists in the air triumphantly.    In Rocky II, The Italian Stallion tries to start a family and a new life away from the boxing ring. Despite partial blindness in his right eye sustained from his first bout with Creed and a wife clinging to life, Rocky is lured back to the ring for a rematch that will literally come down to the last second.     Rocky III takes the series in a slightly more surrealistic directon. Rocky's partial blindness is never addressed again for the rest of the franchise, and Rocky's opponents become more like caricatures, in the form of flamboyant wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) and grimacing, mohawked brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Life as the world champion has made Rocky complacent after a string of easy fights. But after being soundly beaten by Lang, Rocky finds an unlikely ally in former foe Apollo Creed, who trains Balboa in his own style so he may regain the \\"eye of the tiger\\" and reclaim the championship from Lang.    Rocky IV veers directly into the realm of 80's anti-Communist propaganda absurdity and MTV slickness, as Rocky finds himself taking on roided-up Russian superfighter Ivan Drago, who possesses a 1800 PSI punch - harder than actual gunshots! Synth-accompanied training montages abound as Rocky mourns Apollo's death at Drago's hands and heads up to snowy Siberia in order to prepare for the fiercest fight of his life.    In the aftermath of Rocky IV, Rocky finds himself brain-damaged and inexplicably broke in Rocky V. Seems that Rocky's brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young), signed away power of attorney over the Balboa fortune to some shady lawyer who loses all the money. Forced into retirement by his scrambled noggin, a much more punch-drunk Rocky sells off his remaining belongings and moves his family back into his old Philadelphia neighborhood. Rocky reopens Mickey's boxing gym and takes a young fighter, Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) under his wing. Tommy quickly rises up the boxing ranks, but betrays Rocky by signing with Don King-esque promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) in order to get a title shot. Gunn wins the title easily, but fears forever living in Rocky's shadow. He calls out Balboa, culminating in a bizarre fist fight between teacher and student on the cold Philly streets. Rocky emerges the victor, yet somehow avoids being arrested while Gunn gets taken away by the cops. Stallone's desire to return the character to its roots after the increasingly cartoonish direction the series was taking is understandable, but having Rocky lose the fortune he fought so hard for and earned over the course of four films is just depressing, let alone the \\"shady lawyer\\" angle seemed highly contrived. Rocky V remains the most confusing, misconceived installment in the franchise, and left a bad taste in everyone'smouths, including Stallone's.    Stallone sought to make up for Rocky V with Rocky Balboa, which finds an aged Rocky (Stallone himself was 60) the owner of a a Philly restaurant where he indulges its patrons with stories of his glory days in the ring. Looks like the Italian Stallion has found an opponent even he can't defeat - time (though his brain damage is forgotten, much like his partial blindness). Adrian has since died of \\"woman's cancer\\" and Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) is now an emotionally distant businessman. After a simulated boxing match on ESPN finds Rocky the victor over current heavyweight champ, the absurdly named Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), Dixon challenges the long-retired Balboa to an exhibition match. Balboa, longing for one more throwdown, accepts the invitation and sets out to prove that the last thing to age is your heart. Though Rocky Balboa (the film) prescribes to the Rocky formula established from the very beginning and the prospect of a sextagenarian - with or without brain damage - being allowed to take on anyone in a sanctioned boxing match is more than a tad outlandish, this final installment (which Stallone assures us is the FINAL one) feels the most genuine since the original, as Stallone imbues his most iconic character with his own frustration with growing old and that lingering desire to make good on past regrets (like Rocky V) while he still can. With Rocky Balboa, the story finally feels whole.    And you have the whole story here, in Rocky: The Undisputed Collection on Blu-ray.
B003UESJJC|5.0|PQ and Audio are amazing; it's the best this movie has looked and sounded ever, and the special features make this set a must buy.  Very highly recommended!
B001AR0D4A|2.0|This movie was so depressing and unnecessary.  It was more about psychology and feral instincts and less to do with monsters in the mist.  It's underlying message is pretty simplistic, that people are mostly bad and will do horrible things in the face of an apocalypse.  Yes I'm sure that some people would revert to animals under certain circumstances, but I think most would not.  The director also really cheats to make his point possible.  He goes out of his way to make the crazy woman, Mrs. Carmody, look like she's got the makings of a prophet.  He deliberately spares her the fatal sting of a giant bug, making it look like she's got some spiritual power.  The monsters also seem to follow her instructions, by not attacking when she says they wont.  So, if you are stacking the deck like that, then of course it makes your message more acceptable.  It's like tipping the scales of an experiment to more easily reach your predetermined conclusion.  It's ridiculous.      ** SPOILER ALERT **  This movie is also unnecessarily brutal.  I'm not talking about the monsters here either.  I'm talking about the brutal stabbing of a soldier just before they throw him out the door for the monsters to get him.  What was the point of that?  If he was going to be thrown out to be eaten, then why the stabbing over and over again.  It's just the lame director throwing out some more shock violence.  By the way, this did not happen in the book.  Aside from the social experiment, the rest of the movie is interesting.  The monsters are pretty well done, though the special effects are average.  It's got some intense scenes that work pretty well.  You get bits and pieces of what's going on from the soldiers.  That's where you find out that a secret government experiment went horribly wrong.  They figured out a way to \\"look\\" into other dimensions.  Unfortunately, they allowed one of those dimensions to spill into our world.    The ending is also just emotionally punishing.  ** SPOILER **.  The escapees from the market drive in the mist until they run out of gas.  The main character, David, and the other adults in the car decide that suicide is better than starving to death or being eaten.  David shoots everyone in the car including his young son.  No bullets are left for himself though . Distraught, he gets out of the car and decides to commit suicide by being eaten by monsters.  Just then, the mist clears and he sees the U.S. military approaching in force.  They are gathering survivors and killing all the monsters.  If he had waited a few more minutes, then they would have all survived.  What horrible and depressing ending.  It makes absolutely no sense for these characters, who went through so much to escape, to all of a sudden give up so quickly.  I left the theater feeling numb.  Was there a point to this movie?? I think the point was that the director wanted shock value and to be different.  He throws you a bone by clearing the mist and showing that the nightmare was ending, but come on.   Overall, this movie will be fine if you don't mind depressing movies with little hope and where the main characters (good guys) all die.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|The Notebook Movie     The Notebook(2004), by Nick Cassavetes is beautiful, romantic, has a love that surpasses all obstacles and the greatest love story this century has seen, it should not go unseen.  Though, be prepared to go through a few tissues, and do not worry, it brings some good laughs and warm feelings as well.    The movie is set in the 1940's in South Carolina.  With a beautiful music score and gorgeous scenery, this movie will take your breath away.  It is carefree, fun, and it takes you back to a time without high technology and security alerts to get in the way, all you get with this is love.    The entire story is being read by an old man to an old woman in a nursing home.  He is telling the story of a young man, Noah and a young woman, Allie, and their love for each other.  He goes through their entire lives from the moment they meet at a carnival to the moment Allie has to choose between her fiancé and Noah.  The movie goes through all the obstacles and circumstances that test the true strength of real love.  In the middle somewhere it becomes apparent that the old man and the old woman are really Noah and Allie all grown up, still together.  Though the biggest obstacle of all time is present, Alzheimer's, but Noah is still there by her side trying to bring her and her memory back.    The Notebook has its cliché moments but the actors Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allie) really pull it off beautifully.  Anyone and Everyone can connect and yearn for the love in this love story. Guys and girls alike will fall in love with this movie.
1442337966|5.0|Because I had to order the CD set, I bought the book and began to read it while I not so patiently awaited it's arrival. I was mid-way through when the cd's arrived and so at that point, I read and listened in my car together ( no, I didn't read in my car).  I have been through the cd's many times, start to finish and now pick and choose the segments that I want to hear, that I need to hear. I LOVE  The Power. It contains alot of missing links for me, many ah-ha moments. Rhonda Byrnes voice is very soothing too, It is beautifully done.  She provides easy and practical ways to implement change immediately. It's a must read/listen to.I would do both!

0670021652|4.0|THis offering by Gilbert will never be a movie as was her last huge hit book but it would make a good documentary. She did extensive research from antiquity to remote tribes and everything in between on relationships. When you are finshed you will reflect that maybe a commitment wasn't (or isn't) for you. When you finally put it down you will probably have a good talk with yourself.

1400079144|1.0|With over 2600 reviews already there isn't too much to say that hasn't been said, however I wish to point out that Robert Langdon wears a Mickey Mouse watch (in case you didn't get it the first dozen times Brown mentions it) and he is without a doubt the most uninteresting, single dimensional character in modern fiction. Tom Hanks should be embarrassed to portray him and I hope he doesn't in the inevitable sequel you just know is coming and won't see if you read the book, unless you like dull dialogue, pointless chase scenes and clueless characters.<br /><br />Secondly, take the plot from The DaVinci Code and change the location. That's The Lost Symbol. Don't waste your money or time.
B00005N6KG|1.0|this is the second set of the same headphones from the same seller. this is the second time the right earpiece failed. it has some sort of short in it that causes sound to go in and out. this review is an attmept to prompt the seller to replace the item at its cost. an upgrade to a more reliable model is preferrable.
030726999X|5.0|I was hooked after the first book and am so bummed after finishing the third book I don't know what to do with myself.  It is so sad that Larsson did not live to finish this series and was not able to enjoy the acclaim for creating a fabulous read.  This is my favorite book of the series, but it doesn't really matter, as you will want to read them all after finishing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Believe the hype and good reviews; if you are patient and read them all the reward will be a longing for the next one, which sadly won't happen.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|this movie was a rousing tribute to all of those war vets that could find themselves fitting in when they came home....Stallone went downhill from here; Rocky is his only other claim to fame as far as movie making goes....

0312600844|3.0|Selected this book because of it being recommended by Oprah's Book Club.  It was OK, but I was disappointed.
B003E48AYC|4.0|Tim Burton's Alice is not the classic Alice that many of us read about when we were kids.  This Alice is modern day cynical; the characters are right out of a Machiavellian play, jockeying for position and power.  Not for children under 12, as the subject matter is not family oriented.
0545305497|5.0|Great, fast service. I couldn't believe it came to me so quickly from the United Kingdom all the way to California in a week. It was expected to come in December and I got it the first week of November. I would order from them again.
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|The overall story is as described by Amazon.  The animation is very nice.  The sound is fine.  My 5-year-old has watched it a few times and the 10-year-old only once.  I watched most of it, but it is not as entertaining for adults as some of the other Disney pictures.  Both of my children are girls, and I would not recommend this to a non-fairy lover.  It is a cute story, with the preoccupied father as my only complaint--this is one stereotype I wish we could overcome:  Some dads (maybe even most) are involved with their children more than with themselves.  It is a movie worth watching for the younger female set, though it does not have the \\"I want to see it again\\" factor from my girls that I have seen in movies like \\"Mulan\\" or \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\"
B004B4RCDE|1.0|I cant beleive people are giving this album 5 stars! This is the worst album I purchased in my 28yrs I wish I can take it back to the store and get my money back. This cd has only 1 hot song and that whats my name. Please save your money and burn it off someone or limewire.
0525951652|3.0|I have read every Follett book written. I like the way that he developes the characters, makes them seem like real people, with qualities and faults, the good and bad. In this Novel, Fall of Giants, he has allot of characters. It seems that there are so many that you lose the flow of the characters life, when the book shifts to another character and setting. The characters are intersting, but since this is a historical novel, the characters seem to alway be on the side lines of those actual individuals that were alive during the time period and were a part of history. It was a good read, but not a great read. If a person is starting on a Follett book, others Follett books will get ahold of your attention and keep it. Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, A Dangerous Fortune, all better novels to keep ones attention.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|I like most of the music on this soundtrack. My favorite track is \\"You've Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\". Cher still has a strong voice. She moves me on this song.  Christina shines on the track \\"I'm A Good Girl\\".  This is a fun and flirty song.  Christina shows her the ability to hit the high notes on the tune \\"Got A Hold On Me\\". This song gets me moving.  Cher has another bright spot on the tune \\"Welcome To Burlesque\\".  The violin playing gives this track an alluring quality that I really like.  Christina sounds so sensual on the track \\"A Guy Who Takes His Time\\".  This song has a jazzy tone that sounds good to my ears.  Show Me How You Burlesque\\" is an excellent upbeat tune.  I like this song very much.  Christina slows it down with the track \\"Bound To You\\".  This song is very pretty.  Christina sounds feisty on the Etta James cover \\"Tough Lover\\".  This is a good tune.  I can't give this soundtrack five stars.  I do not like the song \\"The Beautiful People\\". This song does not move me like the others.  This track has the guitar riff from a Marilyn Manson song by the same name.  I just don't like the guitar riff on this song.  The music is pretty good here overall though.
B004DC2WF2|5.0|This is the best Zombie story brought to the screen. It has the genius of the original Black and white \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" with a new age twist. Too many recent zombie movies exploit violence for the sake of violence, out of control zombies running around like rabid dogs and leave nothing of a story to hold your attention. This sets itself way above the pack for zombie films even though its on TV. It doesn't need over the top violence, sex and cursing to be good... I'm glad its on TV: more to see and more room for the story to progress. A total work of genius in the story as it focuses in on the normal people and not your military hero with ultimate fighting skills. Greatly filmed and brought to life. There is nothing out there that can even come close to the quality of this series.   I wish more shows would offer this much quality.
0240816250|4.0|From Focal Press comes \\"Way Beyond Monochrome: Advanced Techniques for Traditional Black and White Photography\\" (second edition) by Ralph Lambrecht and Chris Woodhouse. Despite the now well developed digital (r)evolution, the authors wholeheartedly still believe in the power, range and versatility of analog (film) photography and traditional silver-gelatin printmaking, particularly in its use in art and documentary photography. The authors have created a heavy-weight book that explores and informs in extensive detail the techniques and benefits of monochrome photography and how to expand both the limits and the quality of final prints in ways that are informed by everything from image quality to hybrid printing to working with digital negatives and everything else that plays a role in the final result. This 542 page volume is ideally suited to those looking for careers in either art or portrait photography and provides an impressive array of extensive information on every aspect of the field.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|As an exception to rest of the hollywood community where every director and producer is after fooling general audience in hypothetical, imaginative creations and banking on providing entertainment, Michael Moore as a person is actually using this mass communication medium to pass on some very crucial messages. While no one is claiming that what he is saying is 100% right, however, it certainly is though-provoking and concerning the well being of human kind. Just like Fehreneit 9/11, this documentary is based on facts, and brings about things are generally are hidden (on purpose) from ordinary people.   Although you dont have to agree to it word by word, but it certainly a must watch, and I hope more and more wealthy producers will produce meaningful movies like this one.
B003YDUUH8|3.0|5 stars for almost everything, such as Robbie himself, all the singles released from his solo career and also all the music videos but why the songs is censored ?     Another thing is the selling price from Amazon is too high !!! I bought the ultimate edition with USD80.97 including delivery charges and sadly i found this item in my country, the selling price is only USD38, what a rip off.
B001DUMHA2|3.0|First thing's first.  I have nothing but praise for all the pieces on this classic album.  It is one of my favorite classic jazz albums and one of the first that come to mind when I think about jazz.    My two-star deduction comes from the surprisingly frequent surface noise (\\"ticks\\" and \\"pops\\") from the 200g audiophile vinyl pressing.  As a general rule, the more massive the LP, the quieter it should be.  The surface noise was frequent and audible enough to be distracting at times.  The spindle was also off-centered, leading to an audible wow in steady decaying notes.  For an audiophile LP that lists for $50, it's downright inexcusable.    Sure, the timbre and sense of air is better than the CD version's but that's the only advantage of this LP.  If you choose the original CD release, then the sound quality will sound noticeably veiled in comparison.  Yet, if you choose the Sony Super Bit Mapped CD version, then you would be buying a sound with deliberately goosed up treble.  For sound quality stakes, it's a no win situation.
B00493AD74|5.0|I have seen a couple of movies like this , but I really related to this as a women. I have done<br />my own searching for self, love ,God and understanding . This movie comes close to the real<br />truth. We as women sometimes fail at forgiving others and mainly ourselves , we forget to listen<br />because we throw our selves into relationships 100 percent and then wonder why it fails to make<br />us happy.. I realize it is because we lose ourselves . I have done this in my life trying to please<br />someone else all the time and losing my self , my personality , my soul , my heart and I come away<br />Broken ,Because I lost all the confidense that I started out with in the relationship , That<br />confidence that made the other person fall in love with me or feel attracted to me .. So I tried<br />too hard . Now I know that is not real love. Two people have to love each other , forgive each<br />other laugh together , Enjoy each other . If not it will fail miserably. So beause of my past<br />choices I was scared in my self ,afraid to move forward , afraid of my choices in life now at 67 yrs<br />I realize it's all my path to finding me and it's ok to Love , be Loved and to trust Love ...<br />As God so easily put it , as a commandment above all else Love one another !!!  Rent the movie<br />Buy the movie & Buy the book , Learn , Grow ,  YOU WONT SORRY !!!!
B000JMLKCG|4.0|Good story for a movie.  In fact there was a movie set in the west during gold rush based on this story.  Good, but I forget the movie title.  Both are very believable, which I like.
1439177783|5.0|Portia de Rossi's book \\"Unbearable Lightness\\" has undoubtedly painted a refreshing picture of what it means to be healthy. Her book plummets the readers in to the most dire and scary times of her life and lifts them right back out leaving a feeling of hope and newfound energy. I finished reading this book and couldn't bear leaving my feelings to swirl around my head.     Portia brilliantly combines her insights of recovering from her eating disorder and the interplay of her sexual orientation to publically display the grueling nature of recovery and self acceptance. This has prompted me to consider my own body image and how I perceive my sexual orientation and the relationship the two have on my self-presentation.      \\"Unbearable Lightness\\" is a book that should be read by anyone who has a distorted self image, not just for those who struggle with eating disorders. Portia amazingly combines important life messages within her struggles with her weight and lays out the challenges in a page-turning book. Brilliant! Thank you Portia!
B0043A0PXU|4.0|I have no idea how anyone can rate this one star.  Annie has such an amazing voice.  The video for God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is what sold me on this.  It's brilliant.  I buy very few Christmas cds, but this is one that will endure.  I also want to note the beautiful packaging (cover shot/booklet/liner notes).  A classy production from a classy lady.
B0042RUMEQ|3.0|Nicki Minaj is one of the most interesting rappers in the game right now and I have to admit that she is pretty entertaining when she is on a song. I wasn't planning on buying this album at all but I saw it for a pretty cheap price so I was like \\"why not\\". Now that I have listened to the whole album, I kinda regret buying it. It's not a bad album persay but I just feel like I kinda wasted time listening to it. Nicki Minaj isn't exactly the best female rapper, but what makes her so special is the fact that she is WEIRD!!!! She is if anything, the Lady Gaga of rap. She has moments where she can shine in rapping but her selling point is most definitely her personality on a song, not her lyrics. Her lyrics are basically just punchlines, and more than 60% of her punchlines are pretty amateurish. When she does happen to have subject matter on a song, I just feel she could've done sooooo much better for example on \\"Fly\\" and \\"Here I Am\\" there are moments where she goes off topic and you feel a sense that she is just freesttyling and not sticking with the main premisis of the songs theme. Another thing is that the album is completely off balanced, I don't know exactly what the message of the album is, but I guess she is just trying to get herself out there. Generally the album is 13 tracks all single worthy but that is about it. Another thing I have a problem with is her singing, Nicki Minaj does have a nice voice but her hooks are plain boring and uninspiring, she needs to learn from Drake about writing hooks because her hooks are just her singing ONE word over and over again which is very unoriginal. The production on this album is pretty solid, but nothing special as far as revolutionary, it is what you expect from a typical Hip Hop album. Some songs are very girly and popish which is fine especially for Nicki. As of right now, Nicki Minaj is the hottest female rapper right now, but as far as being the best, she is very from it. An average album.<br /><br />Top Tracks<br /><br />1) I'm The Best - The only track where I feel Nicki Minaj delivers at all corners. Lyrics are good, musicality is good and overall song is good. If Nicki made more songs like this, I would probably like her a little more.<br /><br />2) Moment 4 Life feat. Drake - This collaboration is always interesting for me. Drake and Nicki Minaj have pretty good chemistry together and Nicki does a pretty good song as far as putting feeling and attitude. Drake drops in and does pretty good himself, I just wish he sang on the record, that would've made it perfect.<br /><br />3) Blazin' feat. Kanye West - This is Nicki Minaj at her best as far as flow goes, she rips the track pretty insane. Kanye West adds flavor to the track which I like alot. Great track.<br /><br />4) Check It Out feat. will.i.am - Nicki Minaj is a very versitile rapper which is a good thing if you want radio play and sales. This song (while very childish) is a very catchy record. will.i.am is very corny on this song and Nicki Minaj as well but this song is about fun and I can't be mad at that.<br /><br />5) Save Me - I love the production on this song which is probably the only thing I like. The lyrics are decent enough. But like I said earlier, Nicki's hooks are wayyy too basic for me to be endulged in the track. A track that had so much potential, but its still a good song.<br /><br />The other tracks except for the terrible \\"Did it on Em'\\" are just too girly for my taste so I can't really get into them as well. Romans Revenge feat. Eminem is a decent track but Nicki's lyrics are just too stupid and punchlines are too childish for my taste, but its nice to see that Slim Shady is BACK!! Hopefully she can mature a little bit as an artist with her next release and stop with this Young Money style of rap.he Best - The only track where I feel Nicki Minaj delivers at all corners.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this CD.  Kanye continues to reinvent himself and push the envelope of hip-hop.  There isn't a cut on the CD that I dislike, and I can't even begin to tell you my favorites.  I'm happy that this one has exceeded the hype.
0061733199|5.0|I have read there is a pocket edition available also!  That will be my next buy for my Bug out bag.  The information is provided clearly and logically.  I am always open to tried and trued ideas when it comes to survival this book provides a great resource to many situations.  SAS handbook is number 1! on my survival reading list, followed closely by Six ways in Twelve ways out.
B001EC3JME|1.0|The holster is very tight. I was trying to use it with a Mag-Lite LED XL100. Pulling the light out can sometimes be done with a smooth motion. Putting it back could not be done easily and often requires using both hands.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|This movie works on so many levels, it's difficult to review accurately.  I think you will view it differently than your neighbor, depending on what you choose to focus on.  Is it a mystery?  Is it an issue of the manipulation of vaccines?  Or is it about a society where the government can monitor it's citizens 24/7, track you everywhere and control your behavior through a massive computer system? Or is it a modern view of an old classic love story?    And it works on all of those levels.    Look at where we are in America today.  Look at the TSA at airports, coming to train stations, bus depots, metra stations, and who knows where else.  And when you see this movie, you can very easily see where we are headed.    And, in addition, This Perfect Day by Ira Levin is a better book describing a future than 1984 or Brave New World.
B001NGWFQ2|5.0|What can I say... I love this album.  I ran into ZU in a youtube mix with some of the Zorn stuff that I love and was stunned.  Loud, excellent, hard experimental rock.  If you like Naked City, you'll like this as well.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, listen to some samples first and then buy yourself a copy of this album!
014241543X|5.0|If I Stay is an intense and moving story about Mia, a talented cellist, who is the only member of her family to survive a horrendous car crash.  The story is told from Mia's point of view as she experiences an out of body experience that allows her to be aware of what is going on around her, even while in a coma.  The story switches smoothly from present to past events.  We learn of Mia's love of classical music, her fears of leaving her boyfriend for Julliard, and her relationships with friends and family.  This is a thought provoking novel that will cause the reader to take stock of their life and the things that mean most to them.  Keep a box of tissues handy.  Forman is a master storyteller.  Though written for young adults, many adults will enjoy this story as well.
0312360258|3.0|I really wasn't into the book during the first half and really thought about not finishing it, but I decided to finish it anyways. I was really put off I guess because this \\"vampyre\\" story is just so different from the traditional stories of getting bitten and turned, it just seemed rather corny to me. These vampyres are more witches than anything really. And there is too much boring detail about their rituals and circle casting. Maybe if I was Wiccan I would enjoy it more. Once the possible romantic interests started picking up is when I started getting more interested. Overall, I am interested in finishing the series to see what happens, but the author is extremely repetitive. For instance, I really can remember that u-we-tsi-a-ge-ya is cherokee for daughter; I don't need to be reminded in darn near every chapter of every book! It seems like everything is repeated every chapter. I will keep reading them, I'm currentely on book 4, however I keep feeling disappointed when I find out how many more books there are,the story really could have ended by now if all the repetitiveness was taken out.
B002ZG999U|4.0|This movie was made for old timers, like me, who would like to recapture a little of our youth. A movie that is pure entertainment without an apology to anyone. The cast was great and the story line pure fun. See the movie and enjoy.
0061997811|5.0|I love this book...  Why do I say it´s a sneak peak?...well ... I think that this kind of book could be done one for each movie instead compile 5 in the same one.  It is  a very good book that covers many aspects on the movies : actors feelings , concept art , graphic design team ... but fans will apreciate more and more detailed books on this movies.  One of the most interesting things of this book is the paper props that came attached to the book. You have plenty of them , even a Ministery of Magic identity card!  So , if any of publishers read this reviews , just one suggestion : make more of these!!! One for each movie!!! or publish one paperprop book!!!
B000002QWD|5.0|One-of-a-kind voice like an instrument, truly the voice of a century interpreting the best-selling song of all time written about Christmas by an immigrant Russian Jew.
0525951652|5.0|This is an excellent book. Ken Follett's special talent to describe and build characters coupled with his knowledge of history and the way of life creates a story line that is very enjoyable. A great read I would recommend for anyone.
1439177783|3.0|First off, let me say that I liked this book for the simple reason that it truly immersed me into the world of a woman living with various eating disorders. Before reading Portia's book, I had an idea, but never fully grasped the day to day rituals and rules of the illness. I applaud Portia for her honesty and complete transparency. I was heartbroken for her and she helped me understand her world and how she struggled.     That being said, I don't agree that Portia is a particularly good writer and I think her editor might have failed her. The book feels laborious at times and redundant, and overall, while it helped me understand how exhausted she became over time with her illness, it doesn't really help the reader. I grew a little fatigued with the narrative as she tended to over write about the details of the rituals and not share more about herself.    Also, this seems more like a book for an outsider who does not understand the world of someone with anorexia or bulimia. Helpful for a family member or a partner to understand their loved one better. I feel the book offers very little in the way of hope and much of Portia's writing has a neutral tone. I am not sure what someone struggling with an ED would get from the book-maybe some validation, but they would probably be all too familiar with her world.     I don't feel I know Portia any better having read the book. Her writing style and voice on the audiobook are rather aloof and austere and I feel she is still probably pretty guarded. She seems as though she never wanted much attention and is probably very happy as Mrs. Ellen DeGeneres.     Maybe I don't remember the 90s very well, but I don't remember Portia being as big as she presents herself in the book. She discusses being hounded by paparazzi and fearing them but I honestly don't remember ever hearing much about her. I wasn't sure if the paranoia described in the book was a by product of her self absorption or if she really was pursued by the media.     Iliked the book, but its not for everyone. Its very bleak and the treatment and recovery portion are almost like post script. I actually hope Portia writes another book that narrates her recovery in greater detail. She seems to be great at remembering details.     I think a better book is one called \\"Life Without ED\\". I highly recommend that one.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I love all of Josh's previous CD's and couldnt wait for this one.  I knew it would be \\"different\\" but it was just plain awful.  The songs are terrible with the exception of Hidden Away and Higher Window...which are the only two that somewhat remotely resemble the \\"old\\" Josh.  The rest are just painful to listen to and some, such as Galelio..are just plain strange.  I would describe most of the songs as a cross between folk-type music and a really bad Broadway Musical.    Ok Josh, the experiment is over...please get back to the music that made you what you are and that you sing so brilliantly..PLEASE.    I wasted my $$ on this CD and sadly I will pass when he tours with this album.  I dont think I could sit thru two hours of Illuminations without ear plugs.    Sorry Josh, Im a big fan and this was hard for me to write.  Lets hope its not 4 more years before you produce a better album.
B004DC2WF2|5.0|From the first episode I was hooked on this show. Instead of it simply being another Zombie apocolpyse movie it actually shows the survival instinct and struggle from the survivors point of view while still dealing with an unimaginable variable of also having to deal with the living dead at the same time.   Each episode is amazingly written and the character portrayals are perfection. What is brought out is not only the human survival instinct but also the struggles we each deal with on a daily basis but brought to the forefront now because of personal tragedies and an extreme situation.  This particular episode brings out the complexities of personal relationships and the painstaking efforts to exist as well, in a group atmosphere. With each day comes a new battle and a new beginning or end, and sometimes both. Trying to hold on to ones past and at the same time exist in the now, even when someone close to you is dying a horrific death. We the viewers continue to watch as we see the development of both good and bad in each person and then also accept those characters who appear to be above reproach. It is an amazing epilogue of mankind in it's most severe realm.  While there have been many Zombie movies and quite a few good ones over the years, this series goes above and beyond the portrayals and the story of simple fear, death and mayhem. This is about as real as a story as you could ever expect to see about the battle of survival.
1582701709|3.0|Interesting read.  Not the best book on the topic, but worth a look if you have been reading all the others.
0307454541|4.0|By the time I got to this book I had already seen the movie and read The Girl Who Played With Fire so perhaps it is understandable that I didn't quite like as much as the second one. There is more background development in this one with less action. Blomkvist's history with the Wennestrom company and his conviction for libel are explained as well as the family history of the Vanger family, a wealthy dynasty with dark secrets and twisted relationships galore. Lisbeth Salander's background is in part explained and her rather eccentric personality that somehow endears itself to the reader with all its intriguing and bizarre attributes. Salander is a whiz kid on the computer, a top echelon hacker, and a misunderstood, abused member of society that makes an unlikely hero. How these three focus points of the story merge into one gripping mystery is quite a creative feat for the author. The ultimate linking point, a mysterious disappearance, unfolds with gruesome surprises and action.[[ASIN:1931391912 The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)]]
143350393X|3.0|This ESV Study Bible (TruTone, Forest/Tan) is great in most ways.  It has wonderful resources (notes, maps, index, etc.) but the printing is spotty. The ink is not consistent throughout.  Some pages are very dark to the point of the ink making small words unreadable and others are too light. My wife had my name embossed on it prior to a good look at the printing so I'm stuck.  I have read similar reviews with this problem so it is probably common.<br /><br />Another important aspect to take into account is the weight.  This is a HEAVY Bible.  It gets uncomfortable if you have to heft it around for any length of time.  Taking it to church is a chore and I find myself taking older smaller Bibles even if they have less resources due to the extreme weight and awkward size of this new one. It is probably meant to be left at home and used primarily for study.  In Conclusion, just know what the primary use of this Bible is before you buy and check for printing problems as soon as you get it.
0439023513|5.0|I absolutely loved the Hunger Games series and this book is no exception. I thought it had a good but almost predictable ending.
B00006LWSF|1.0|The only songs worth anything on this album are the ones by Rakim and Gang Starr and, of course, you can't download only those songs. You have to get the whole stupid album which is full of Eminem and other worthless artists (all of whom should trip and scrape their faces in a puddle of AIDS). Honestly, why not let us get the two worthwhile songs and disregard the rest? I'd almost be willing to buy this if it wasn't filled with 80-85% garbage. Frustrated after going through Amazon, Napster, and several other sites to get the songs I want, only to be told I have to buy the whole piece of crap album to \\"8 Mile,\\" (which I won't even start to get into because I'll stab my own eyes out). This is a kick in the face for sure.
1441965904|5.0|I found the book really useful.  It's really inspiring. It explains how do make convincing presentations that get the audience attention.  It's not only that. People go to presentations, and conferences in general, not just to be informed about hot topics in their research area. I believe that a crucial factor is also to meet key people in the hope of setting up a collaboration. I am an economist and in this book I found a wealth of information telling me how to write and deliver the kind of presentation that will motivate members of the audience to come and up and speak to me at the end of the presentation and/or during social events. The only comment I would make is that it would have been nice to have had more input on how to use Powerpoint, but given that this book is primarily on the English language part of presentations, then I suppose that would have been beyond the scope of the book.

B0047SF41G|1.0|Beware: do not watch on Amazon Video on Demand. The picture quality of the movie was good, the movie itself is pretty good but every 10 seconds the movie freezes for a second, without a miss throughout the movie. If you are watching s suspense or action movie, you totally loose interest if you miss important scenes, like in this movie. I was watching on mac, not sure if that's the reason but  i have a high config mac, i watch online movies/HD all the time on Netflix or other sites and never had problems. Amazon should fix this issue as they are always top rated in everything they sell. I rated this one start to raise a flag for amazon to correct this issue.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|A Christmas Carol is over 160 years old, and it's still going strong. I bet Charles Dickens would be proud. This movie is visually beautiful and has amazing scenery. Jim Carrey does a great job at playing Ebenezer Scrooge, who wants nothing to do with Christmas, forces Bob Cratchit to work on Christmas day, and refuses to go to his nephew's Christmas dinner party. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by his dead partner, Marley that tells him that he will be visited by 3 ghosts who try to change Scrooge's outlook on Christmas. Christmas Past shows him how Scrooge came to be who he was, Present shows him that his nephew feels sorry for him and that Cratchit's family don't have enough money to afford a meal, and the Future shows him what tragedies will happen unless Scrooge changes his ways. I highly recommend A CHRISTMAS CAROL!!!
0817439390|4.0|I think this book is pretty outstanding, with one shortcoming.<br /><br />The author talks about the photographic triangle (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO).<br /><br />He talks in depth about why and when to adjust aperture and shutter speed, but barely touches on when you should be adjusting your ISO.<br /><br />I can make some educated guesses based on what I've learned in this book (maybe, adjust it to the lowest setting to get the aperture and shutter speed you need), but would have expected a little more information on it.<br /><br />Overall great book though.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|I like this album because there is a mix of everything.   There are three songs that I tend to skip over (Fading, Complicated, and Cheers Drink to That).   My favorite songs on the album are:  Man Down (4/5)  Only Girl (5/5)  What's My Name? (5/5)  S&M (4/5)  Raining Men (4/5) Nicki Minaj is annoying.   Skin (even though at first I didn't like this song, but I like it now)(4/5)  California King. (4/5)    The music sounds good, but some of the lyrics are lacking substance. I do not recommend this album for younger teen girls because the lyrics are too suggestive. I only gave the album three songs because I felt it was not Rihanna's best effort; like I said the lyrics could have been better.        Item shipped quickly.
B000040OBS|4.0|This is dark, at times harrowing, early electronic music, and it's not for everyone. I like it sometimes, but one listen to Frankie Teardrop is enough. The intensity and style of vocals is still unique over 30 years later. Most of the songs have well-crafted underlying tension. The first listen to Ghost Rider blew me away.    I'd never heard this record until 2010, and while the later influence on electronic music is obvious, they also heavily influenced rock bands to come. \\"Ghost Rider\\" is the clear template for the Wipers \\"Youth of America\\"; several songs heavily influenced the Spacemen 3. I suspect Jesus and Mary Chain might've been influenced by them as well.    The final song, Keep Your Dreams, is in the style of Neu, the post-Kraftwerk band.
1401323952|5.0|I went out and bought this book after hearing Lawson on NPR one morning a few weeks ago.  I am not disappointed!  Not only is this book a feast for the eyes, it's a feast for the tastebuds, too!  After having the book for only a couple of weeks, I have made four of the recipes and have several more bookmarked.  We loved the banana coconut cake (which is great leftover, toasted for breakfast), Thai chicken noodle soup, butternut pappardelle with bleu cheese (I substituted gnocci) and ham and edamame bean salad.  Because I have a pretty extensive cookbook library, I was afraid that there wouldn't be anything new or inspiring in the book when I picked it up in the store.  Not true at all!  I highly recommend this fresh, fun, beautifully photographed book!
B000024KVO|5.0|I do enjoy the earlier psych rock of pink floyd , its ok ;but this one and all that followed are more to my liking, although 'meddle' is very much a modern type of floyd disc to me too.  atom heart mother\\" and all that came before are much more spacey to be sure. I like them but I love floyd from 'meddle' onward. This one is one of my favorite floyd cds , it is where they get more precise about songwriting and less jammy. There isn't a bad song on this soundtrack either.  If you are fan of the later floyd \\"dark side of the moon\\" onward then this one will much to your liking and you will find little fault with it. It's a solid post psych rock disc.  Meddle is more psych but still so well done that non fans of psych rock may enjoy it by the way. the earlier stuff is pure psych rock , which is cool, I like psych rock, which pretty much had died out by this period. But psych rock to me was never as good as this type of solid prog rock that floyd became. I have all of this bands music too, well all that I can get , those unreleased songs are hard to get these days, even on boots.  So I do like both sides of pink floyd for sure. But this is the start of their true greatness and you need this one if you like the later floyd for sure.

B0000AKCLS|5.0|If I was to pick the very best recent rock blues cds that I have purchased and enjoyed (always a difficult proposition), I would definitely choose Joe Bonamassa's Blues Deluxe, along with Jimmy Thackery's Wild Night Out!, Eric Clapton's From The Cradle, Ronnie Earl's Deep Blues, and Stevie Ray Vaughan's In Step. Blues Deluxe seems all that more amazing because a following blues-tinged Joe Bonamassa cd, You and Me, is a big disapointment compared to the outstanding blues music, vocals, and guitar playing that are found on Blues Deluxe. I've listened to Blues Deluxe a large number of times, and the cd never fails to fascinate my rock blues and blues tastes. Every song on Blues Deluxe is outstanding blues. Joe Bonamassa does a superb job of singing and playing THE BLUES-Blues Deluxe is also among my most treasured blues cds! If you enjor blues and/or rock blues music, I very strongly and confidently recommend Blues Deluxe to you. The cd is so well done that I consider it a masterpiece.    John
B0028K3192|3.0|the most annoying is that the last two songs would not have passed any serious consideration to be included in the album.  so, out of 9, you have 2 forgettable, couple with unnecessary experimentation, and the rest is very good.  crafty work but coupled with vanity.  3* at very best.  no way it was deservedly included on the best r&b album list.

0786956291|4.0|As cinemaphile says in his excellent review below, this is a springboard.  If you are new to D&D or the 4th edition, it is a good simplified start.  It really has everything you need to play an INTRO version of the game.  This is apparently part one and has a level 1 adventure.  Part two is the Dungeon Master's Kit, where you add a lot more of the full game rules, get more player and monster tokens, and an adventure that picks up where the red box leaves off (2nd-3rd level).  Part three is the Monster Vault, where you get a whole bunch of great monster tokens, and continue the adventure from the first two items (4th level).    You will eventually need a markable map of 1\\" squares since included maps after this box do not cover all encounters.  Here's how do this on the cheap:  get a sheet of 2' by 3' 1/8 plexiglass (got mine for less than $15 at my local Ace store), some wet or dry erase markers.  Then I taped a whole bunch of light green (less glare) ordinary colored paper together, drew in the 1\\" grid, put the plexiglass on top, and voila!  Ready to go.  You can also put the regular maps under the plexiglass and mark things up all you want during the game without ruining the map--makes tracking stuff a lot easier.

1439177783|3.0|I was disappointed in Unbearable Lightness. Although it was well written, I found the repeated descriptions of the turkey, egg whites, Extra chewing gum, etc., so tedious to get through that I often wondered if I had hit the back button on the Kindle while I was reading.     On the other hand, it was fascinating to read how someone as gorgeous and talented as Portia could think she was anything other than gorgeous and talented.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Let's face it.  'Lost' started as a great show like no other at the time, and six years later, it ended not with a big bang but with a wimp.  This got to be the worst ending ever created for a show that this magnitude.<br /><br />I suspected that the creators had no idea at all which direction they wanted to take this show until last season, they kept creating so much suspense and intrigues surrounding it, but in the end the holes were just so big that they simply fell through without any hope of mending it.  It got me watching 6 years earlier because I wanted to find out what it was nature of the island and what the mysteries were about.  6 years later, all I got is `because I'm special',  can you believe a lame answer like this?  Special my ass, if I knew this coming, I would quit watching it long time ago.  Now with the money in their fat pocket, the creators simply cared less about the audience in the last season.  Early in the show, fans had speculated about the nature of the island, including assumption that it's purgatory, the show's creators kept denying it, and six years later, they took the easy way out.<br /><br />I would never watch or pay for another DVD that created by J.J.Abrams.  you're such a sham, Mr. Abrams.
B002C6A6N6|3.0|I just rec'd The Complete Medicine Woman Series, which I ordered for a gift at Thanksgiving. However, I am holding it until Christmas, because I am concerned with a \\"Flagged\\" notice on Amazon about this DVD set.  When I called Amazon, they told me it's with disk 28, skipping. If this is the case, Amazon should have had the notice up prior to my ordering or during, or simply inserted a \\"new\\" copy of disk #28 without me having to find out by surprise after the delivery came.  Has anyone recently purchased this series, and had a chance to watch it? I do not know if I should be returning without opening, or \\"wait\\" until Xmas, but then what happens when I want to return the disk and the package has been opened?? NOt a good feeling. Your help appreciated. The rating I gave was necessary for me to provide this note to you. Without something \\"stared,\\" I was not able to post.   Thank you.

B002JVWR0Y|5.0|For me DEXTER is without a doubt the best show on television.  Its acting, writing, directing and producing are so above anything else on tv.  The mere fact that the main character is a serial killer we root for is the first thing to tell you how great the show is.  Episodes are shown and stories told all with the voice-over of Dexter, who is so expertly played by Michael C. Hall.  We hear all his feelings and thoughts as he chooses the actionsd he must take.  Through these voice-overs and flashbacks to his father we learn all about how he developed as a person and why he has such a difficult time with emotions and needs to take the actions he does.  This season is by far the best thus far.  We are introduced to the Trinity Killer, aka Arthur Mitchell, right away in the first episode.  This character is superbly played by John Lithgow and the cat and mouse game that takes place between the Trinity killer and Dexter is at the edge of your seat tv at its best.  Dexter puts himself into Arthur's personal life and the results are spellbinding.  All other main characters are fully fleshed out and loose no substancce while this major story line takes place.  Rita, Debra and all are given great plots as well.  This season is so full of twists and turns that to give away any more of the plot would be a sin for viewers who have not seen it.<br /><br />And as for the blu ray.  Wow, wow, wow.  DEXTER is the only series that I buy on blu ray.  Many shows are now on blu ray but the quality is often not much better than that of the dvd.  With DEXTER it far surpasses the dvd and takes full advantage of all blu ray has to offer.  Much of the audio is front speaker driven but all audio works perfectly.  Dexter's voice-overs are strong and clear.  They possess a very haunting quality and you feel as if you are truly in Dexter's mind.  All music and action noise fully uses all other speakers for full effect.  Back speakers will often have you jumping out of your skin.  And the picture - if you love DEXTER you owe it to yourself to see it on blu ray.  Colors, clarity and black/white ratio are all amazing.  The Miami shots are so crystal clear.  Ripples in water, facial close-ups, everything is better than you can imagine.  This is blu ray video at its best.<br /><br />DEXTER is a series that has definitely grown with each season.  Cable series have only 12 episodes and DEXTER manages to provide awe inspiring plots each season while character development never misses a step.  I highly recommend DEXTER, particularly on blu ray and particularly this season.  A +++u love DEXTER you owe it to yourself to see it on blu ray.

B004DC2WF2|5.0|After I saw the first episode I was blown away by the quality and caliber of work that was put into this TV show.  The attention to detail and special effects on the zombies especially was so realistic.  Walking Dead is gripping and exciting.  It sets the bar high for what's out there.
B004B4RCDE|4.0|I've become an official fan for Rihanna since Rated R. Up until then I hated her with her first album \\"Music From the Sun\\", liked only her released singles for \\"A Girl Like Me\\" and \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" however when she released \\"Rated R\\" it was more than just the singles that did it it was the entire album (except for photographs lol). Now this cd is good as well with some really good songs on it, I like the angry Rihanna more because she just seems like she's good at being mean and bad. Now this cd is much happier and urban pop radio friendly. The only tracks I listen to and like are What's My Name, Fading away, Cheers, Only Girl, Man Down, California King Bed, and The Way You Lie part 2...so out of 11 songs i like 7 which is 64% of the album which isnt that bad but isnt the best compared to rated r (12/13 tracks or 93% of the album) if you want to talk numbers.
B004498KPU|3.0|First of all, I want to say that I agree with all of the positive reviews written by everyone else. The sound and video quality are the best I've heard so far. But I'm dinging this by two stars for 1) not including the full 50+ minute Moonwalker film (they only plucked Come Together and Smooth Criminal from it), 2) not including the full length version of the Ghosts video, and 3) no 5.1 surround sound mix (still just 2-channel stereo).  If I had realized that this set wasn't goung to be a COMPLETE set of the FULL MJ video collection, I would have saved my money and at least waited for a Blu-Rey version. So now I've got to buy at least two more DVDs to completely replace my LaserDisc collection of MJ videos.
B002X20W2E|5.0|I THINK THIS IS HER ABSOLUTE BEST ALBUM EVER. I LOVE EVERY SINGLE TRACK ON HERE EXCEPT PHOTOGRAPHS AND I AM NOT EASILY IMPRESSED WITH MUSIC SO ITS HARD TO MAKE ME LIKE SOMETHING. I HATED THIS GIRL FOR THE LONGEST HER VOICE WAS ANNOYING BUT NOW IT HAS GROWN ON ME. WHEN SHE SINGS LIVE SHE DOESNT DO THAT BAD EVEN THOUGH SHE DOESNT DO THAT GREAT SHE HAS A UNIQUE VOICE THAT IS YAY OR NAY FOR MANY PEOPLE ITS NOT LIKE CELINE, WHITNEY, MARIAH, LEONA LEWIS, ETC. THIS CD FITS HER PERSONALITY SO WELL. THE MUSIC IS A BIT ON THE GROUND FOLKS SIDE THOUGH. THE SONGS ARE SO GOOD TO LISTEN TO ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR ANGRY OR SAD. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE \\"MAD HOUSE\\", \\"THE LAST SONG\\", \\"COLD CASE LOVE\\", \\"RUDE BOY\\", \\"STUPID IN LOVE\\", \\"G4L\\", \\"FIREBOMB\\". SHE COULDVE MADE A SINGLE/VIDEO FOR EVERY TRACK ON THIS CD. THERE WERE REALLY NO FILLERS ON HERE.
B000025XKM|5.0|I recently discovered Nick Drake and Pink Moon's a highlight. The acoustic nature of the music is consistent throughout. Loud or soft: it works.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The three books are a marvelous read and the characters are all understandable, though not always likable. Many other have reviewed the books plot and writing. What I found informative in this book is the contrast between Sweden's culture, mores and values and the counterparts in the United States. A 700 square foot apartment is considered very nice. In any place other than NYC it would be considered cramped in this country. Vacations are longer and more frequent. Criminals are treated more humanely and sentences are much shorter. Marriage is not important for a committed couple. There are few sexual hangups. Automobile ownership is not essential for doing one's daily business. Excellent public transportation provides a good alternative.<br /><br />The United States could learn much from Sweden and vice versa.
0425221806|5.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />Koontz comes through with another top notch suspensful novel. I see why so many see this as one of his best. Great plot and theme: character devolpment is good, and the end is heart-wrenching. The only thing that keeps this book from being flawless is that it has a litle too much romance for my liking. I never fully connected with Nora for some reason, and that held back from the more romantic aspects. This was not distracting enough to cause a drop in my rating though, and I almost feel like i'm nitpicking. Anyways, if you haven't yet read this one, pick it up. It's defiitely something I would recommend...
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|This album is definitely different and entertaining but it is still a very good cd overall. Now I have been a Nicki Minaj fan since mixtape Nicki but I wasn't this cd to be Mixtape Nicki because every person has the right to grow and do different things. Now some songs I really love on the cd of course Your Love, Right Thru Me, Roman's Revenge, Saved Me, and Old Nicki. Its a good cd for true music listeners who are not stuck in a box about music.
B003LWLIS2|1.0|iTunes was being super slow and since I had a promotion code for Amazon I thought I would try it out. Amazon is much faster than iTunes tonight, but, there is no sound. After some troubleshooting, restarting the TiVo and everything, still nothing. Glad it was just a promo code I wasted.
B0046MVVOW|4.0|Too many people are getting Ke$ha wrong. She just wants to make party music. Simple fun music. She definitely accomplishes this on these two albums. I think the Cannibal EP is just a preview of what's to come.<br /><br />One thing I am disappointed with is that I preordered the 2 disc deluxe set and I was expecting, since I bought it off Amazon, that my cd would not be censored. If I had known this, I probably would have purchased it elsewhere.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I expected more from such a hyped up artist, hyped up album. More horrible singing than rapping to be quite honest. I think Nicki should have stuck with what she did best. The songs were lyrically weak, it was painful listening to some the first time because they were just that bad. For someone with such a colorful personality and style, Nicki Minaj delivers an album that was uninspiring. Maybe she should have focused more on her music than her image.
0060734191|5.0|One of my longtime favorite fantasy series, I have yet to find one I like better. Being geared toward young adults, it is a faster more digestible read than some of the longer, deeply detailed adult fantasy series. I also enjoyed the fact that the author kept a good balance over the seriousness of the subject matter, which was fairly dark and disturbing in parts, without going overboard.<br /><br />I found the story and world to be refreshing and original. It is filled with personable, humorous and unique characters that grow on you and with you through out the three books. The fact that it's a box set is even better, making it easier to follow all the little side plots and details. I only wish that Nix had written more books about this world! Love it!
B003UESJJC|5.0|Great seller ! but he could not delivery this item at the moment.     He told me :    Hi, I sent a refund the day after payment was sent. Amazon, has a hold on my money for 6 weeks.

While sitting at the kitchen table and not really paying attention, I heard this little engine noise and looked up and met the swivel sweeper!  \\"This is the coolest\\" says my friend.  I immediately went to her computer and ordered it.  It arrived 3 days after my return to Port Townsend WA!  I LOVE IT!
B000W10AEI|3.0|Like clockwork, 364 days after the release of Philosopher's Stone the second part of the Harry Potter saga was in theaters. Box office receipts cooled off a little bit, but Chamber of Secrets still posted the second biggest opening weekend of the year behind Spider-Man and the second biggest take of the year worldwide, trailing only behind The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers. Even though it didn't make as much as its predecessor, Chamber of Secrets' global take of $878.6 million is still nothing to sneeze at.    All too often these days we see sequels that replace actors or actresses in leading roles with someone new. It was refreshing to walk into Chamber of Secrets and see the same cast members returning for their roles. Not only that, but they're joined by Oscar nominee Julie Walters (Billy Elliot, Calendar Girls), Mark Williams (Shakespeare in Love), and thespian/director Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Much Ado about Nothing). It's great to see a production of this magnitude attract such talent. In this case it's not just a matter of star power, as the big names that have made their way through Potter are real acting heavyweights, and their presence certainly adds to the realism of the films.    Here Chris Columbus remains director, and, though he still makes a film largely for focus groups, with Chamber of Secrets he creates a much darker film than Philosopher's Stone. Where the first film was light and airy, this second installment in the Harry Potter series is claustrophobic and laden with dread. Although the ending of the first film had moments where you could possibly wonder about the fates of our heroes, this film makes that feeling palpable. The castle seems more lived-in, and the forest also appears more foreboding. Columbus has definitely captured more of the feel of this book as he allows its teeth to show.    As Columbus feels out the reigns, the child actors take a lead from their older castmates and further improve their own acting skills. While I hadno problem believing them previously, here their actions seem even more natural. Daniel Radcliffe even gets the opportunity to ad lib in the final version with Jason Isaacs. Unfortunately, the exchange (Lucius Malfoy: \\"Let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.\\" Harry Potter: \\"Don't worry. I will be.\\") shows Radcliffe doesn't have a complete grasp on his character. He's still young here, though, and his understanding of character dynamics will grow with age.     Chamber of Secrets is definitely an improvement over its predecessor, and it also shows definite growth in subject matter from Philosopher's Stone. Rowling and the filmmakers aren't afraid to approach themes such as racial issues (\\"mudblood\\" is the wizarding world equivalent of a racial slur). Even though the films, as well as the books, contain many of the same plot devices from installment to installment, there's been some painstaking effort to make each film feel like its own entity while still remaining one part of a larger whole. That's definitely one of the greatest strengths to how this series has been approached to avoid a sense of stagnation.
B000TJBNFI|5.0|This movie was very good.  I have seen many stephan king \\"book to movie\\" adaptations and this is definitely one of the better ones.  But some will take notice that the movie does differ from the book, but I think its in a way a good thing, because some of the parts in the book would Look a bit dumb on screen.  I recommend this movie to anyone Looking for a good thrill movie.
B003Q6D25U|4.0|While I'm a fan of the horror genre -- enjoying the collective works of George Romero, Takashi Miike, and Rob Zombie's House of a Thousand Corpses and The Devil's Rejects -- I have to say that I'm a bigger fan of that sub-genre known as the psychological thriller. 2009's Paranormal Activity was one of the best examples of this genre that I had seen in quite a while, as its not-quite-documentary quality/low budget look gave the scares in this film an air of reality not present in most modern horror movies. However, given Paramount's initial intentions with Paranormal Activity and the fact that the studio commissioned a sequel before the first movie's run in theaters was over, I have to say that I wasn't too excited at the prospect of seeing a sequel merely a year after the release of its predecessor.     Paranormal Activity 2 takes place about two months before the beginning of Paranormal Activity. A year after bringing newborn son Hunter home, Kristi (sister of the first film's Katie) and family experience a break-in, prompting them to install security cameras all over the house. As increasingly bizarre events continue to occur around the house, Kristi's stepdaughter Ali grows curious about what's happening, while Kristi looks back to similar instances that occurred during her and Katie's childhood.    In their attempts to profit from the success of the original film, Paramount created a sequel that is close in spirit to the first PA. The resulting film was made for $3 million and still features a completely unknown cast, with the exception of the original leads. Still relying largely on POV cameras, this films also features security camera footage, a brilliant way to feature what's going on in all areas of the house. Seeing exactly what's going on in an unoccupied room, or even outside the house, builds on the suspense the audience feels as we wonder what's going to happen when the family members find themselves in the same room as a spirit entity.     Also addingto the eeriness of this film is the presence of innocent players. Watching Hunter, Kristi's one-year-old son, creates a feeling of dread in the audience as we constantly worry about if and when something is going to happen to him. Hunter's presence also creates a greater feeling of empathy toward the family as they struggle to keep him safe. Another innocent player in this thriller is the family's German Shepherd, Abby, who for most of the movie is merely trying to protect Hunter from a perceived threat, and is included in one of the movie's scarier moments. The family dynamic is also more developed in this sequel than in the original film, as there are more players, each with an individualized stance on what exactly is going on in the house.    For a movie that was sped into production, the plotting and attention to detail in Paranormal Activity 2 are brilliant. This film acts as both a prequel and sequel, and when you see how the pieces fit together it feels perfectly logical without feeling forced. Fans of the first film will recognize a few references to the original Paranormal Activity that work to further the plot not only of this movie, but the original as well.  The care taken with this plot shows that Paramount and the writers/director chosen to further the PA franchise respected the source material.    While the broad plot of Paranormal Activity 2 offers brilliance, some elements of the smaller plot points seem unrealistic and fail to further the plot on a lesser scale. While adding the security camera footage greatly enhances the film, the initial break-in that created a need for the cameras is somehow immediately forgotten by the characters. Logically speaking, it seems that the presence of security cameras would most likely result in a cautious optimism rather than this complete amnesia regarding the initial incident. Also, Ali's research into what's going on the house is presented too late and expounds on the events too quickly. These elements made memiss the more realistic approach of the first movie, in which the characters consult an actual demonologist about the spirit invading their home rather than the internet.     I found myself spending more time acquainted with the edge of my seat in this film than I did the first. On at least one occasion I nearly threw my popcorn all over myself, and I've only jumped out of my seat for two other movies that I've seen in theaters. I highly recommend this film. If you're a fan of the original, interested in anything dealing with demonology, or love psychological thrillers, chances are you're going to love this movie!
B004BSEKH6|2.0|Trite Lil Wayne copycat. I wonder if he ghostwrites for her like Jay-Z did for Foxy Brown. The only songs that stand out are \\"Massive Attack\\", \\"Roman's Revenge\\" and \\"Did It On 'Em\\" It's also more of a pop album than what I would consider hip-hop one. Her lyrics are also very derivative,shallow,and sometimes downright nonsensical, with her making up words in order to rhyme. How many times do we have to hear about how much better she is than every other female rapper,how much money she has (which is strange considering she has only come out with one album), or how great-looking she is. Listen to her free music because it sounds exactly the same, maybe better. I hope she either goes away or tries to express something in her besides her materialism and megalomania.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|Just prior to the release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, tragedy struck when Richard Harris, the actor who played Albus Dumbledore, died of Hodgkin's Disease. After the mourning period was over, production had to look for another actor to take over the role. Having just come off of Lord of the Rings, Ian McKellan was a fan favorite to portray Dumbledore, but he opted out of the running because, after playing Gandalf and Magneto, he did not want the burden of portraying a third iconic character. Friends and family of Harris lobbied for the part to go to Harris' long- time friend Peter O' Toole, but in the end the role went to award-winning theater actor Michael Gambon.    The role of Dumbledore wasn't the only thing to change between Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban. In the interim Chris Columbus stepped down as director, and in came Alfonso Cuaron. At the time Cuaron seemed a fairly unlikely choice, as his previous effort was the extremely adult Spanish language film Y Tu Mama Tambien. Hired on the strength of A Little Princess, Cuaron breathed cinematic fresh air into the series. His vision makes the wizarding world feel older and more lived-in, as if it truly is the ancient world Rowling portrays in her novels. Magic also feels more like an everyday occurrence in Cuaron's wizarding world, rather than a surprise element as it is in Columbus' films. In this adaptation, Cuaron also adds details to the Harry Potter story that even J.K. Rowling wished she had included in the books (most notably the shrunken heads).     Cuaron also enhances the realism of Harry Potter by portraying the normal everyday aspects of kids living in boarding school. Prisoner of Azkaban includes extra scenes and quick glances of the characters joking around, fighting, and doing other things that kids do; the kind of content that is notably absent in previous installments. Watching Prisoner of Azkaban reminds you that, although Harry, Ron and Hermoine often find themselves in extraordinary situations, they are still kids. Another thing I have to admit I didn't notice until my most recent viewing of these movies is the weather. It's important to note that in the first two films the weather is always pleasant; giving a feeling that this magical world is one that is always perfect, always sunny. The world of Prisoner of Azkaban is a much darker one, with storms and turmoil that fit the mood of the series so much better.    Prisoner of Azkaban continues the tradition of casting great theater and film actors in new roles. David Thewlis (Seven Years in Tibet, Naked) joins the cast as Remus Lupin, the newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor,   and Academy Award-winning actress Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility, Howard's End) plays Sybil Trelawny, Hogwarts' professor of Divination. One of my personal favorite actors, Gary Oldman (The Professional, Sid and Nancy) also appears in the film, playing the titular prisoner Sirius Black.     For the younger cast members, this film is a huge leap forward in their abilities as actors. As Harry Potter begins to develop more angst and signs of rebellion, Daniel Radcliffe shows off some of his best acting in the series. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also show amazing growth as actors. A story Cuaron tells shows just how much each of the actors inhabit their characters. When he first took the job as director, Cuaron assigned Daniel, Emma, and Rupert the job of writing a paper about their characters. Rupert, in true Ron fashion, never turned in his paper, while Daniel wrote a one-page summary. Emma, in a move that would make Hermoine proud, chose to write a 16-page essay on her character. Being so in tune with their fictional counterparts really helped these young actors create more convincing portrayals of these well-loved characters.    According to Rotten Tomatoes, Prisoner of Azkaban is the most critically acclaimed Harry Potter film. Unfortunately, it is also the lowest grossing Potter filmas well. There are some speculators who would argue that the drop in receipts was due to the change from the winter season, when the first two films opened, to a summer release. At this point, however, the series was still doing astounding business; at $795.6 million worldwide, Prisoner of Azkaban was  the second-highest grossing film of 2004.
B0017OB12O|5.0|A quick comment about the film itself before getting to the technical details... \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" is not \\"about\\" British POWs building a bridge. It's about Other Things, for which the story (a near-total inversion of the historical facts) serves as a backdrop.<br /><br />Contrary to what one reviewer has written, there /are/ \\"better-looking\\" Blu-ray transfers from that era, most notably \\"The Searchers\\", which is of absolute demo quality. \\"Bridge\\" is excellent, but not at that elevated level.<br /><br />Color photographic materials of that era (and well-into the 70s) had high contrast -- that is, a limited tonal scale. This is most-apparent in outdoor scenes under direct sunlight. The effect is harsh, even garish, and the first 20 minutes or so of \\"Bridge\\" suffer badly from it. For whatever reason, this harshness gradually declines. On the other hand, scenes shot \\"indoors\\", under controlled lighting, do not suffer from this problem, as the direct and fill lighting can be fine-tuned to compensate for the film's limitations. (The same things could be said about many films of this era; \\"Bridge\\" is not unique.)<br /><br />Another problem is that -- despite what some review claim -- this is /not/ a true Technicolor film -- it's shot on an integral tripack material, probably supplied by Kodak. \\"Technicolor\\" of this era suffered from the inability to render vivid colors with their full saturation (unlike \\"real\\" three-strip Technicolor), and a color balance that leaned strongly towards the warm colors, sometimes with muddy or muted greens. In outdoor scenes, one often feels the only colors are blue, green, and brown. Indoor shots under artificial lighting do not generally have this problem -- there's a wider range of more-natural colors.<br /><br />These color deficiencies aren't helped by the fact that a few outdoor scenes have a sickly yellow-green cast. Perhaps the available sources had deteriorated to the point where a full correction wasn't possible, but I doubt it.<br /><br />There was only one point where I saw anything that even remotely resembled edge enhancement. And there appears to have been little or no grain reduction.

What you /will/ see is much-improved version of what I first saw 53 years ago, but nothing more.<br /><br />The sound is real stereo, as befits a prestige \\"event\\" film of that era.

B000Q6ZG5M|3.0|Throughout the course of this look back at the first Harry Potter installment I will refer to what is commonly known in America as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by its original British name, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. J.K. Rowling herself has stated that if she had more clout with the publishers at the time of the initial US book release it would have retained its original name.    For movie-goers, it all started on 11/16/2001. And what a start it was! Easily the most anticipated movie of the year, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone even outgrossed the first installment of another highly anticipated film series that debuted a little over a month later: Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring.* Even with five extremely successful sequels, at $975 million in worldwide grosses Philosopher's Stone still remains the highest grossing Potter film to date.    Philosopher's Stone is a great introduction to the series for newbies not familiar with the books (that's how I was introduced to the phenomenon), as well as for anyone who enjoys the books and was, or is, just getting around to the movies. Rowling gave filmmakers a great blueprint for introducing the audience to a world completely unfamiliar to them by making the series' namesake a newcomer to the underground magical world as well. This choice allows the viewer to see things through Harry's eyes, and in turn feel empathy for him as well.    Another reason this film works so well is the cast. While the film features then-unknown actors in the children's roles, the adult parts are played by British stage and film veterans. I would imagine that, for the children on set, this film had to feel like a crash course in acting school. Here you had Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber, anyone?), Dame Maggie Smith (Othello, Richard III), Robbie Coltrane (GoldenEye, From Hell), John Hurt (Alien, The Elephant Man), and Richard Harris (Gladiator, Unforgiven) all gathered on one set. While I'm sure these veteranthespians assisted the little ones in learning the art of acting, they also lent the film a level of gravitas that wouldn't have been felt otherwise.    While Philosopher's Stone works great as a gateway drug into the Harry Potter universe, it doesn't hold up as well as future installments on multiple viewings. I think this has a lot to do with its slavish devotion to every word of the book. While this is admirable, later installments have shown that you can remain faithful to the spirit of the books while taking some liberties with the source material. I also feel as though Chris Columbus has a tendency to make films for focus groups, giving the film a much more polished sheen than it could have had when converting Rowling's pages to celluloid.    This can really be seen in how lavishly sterile the set designs are in this film. Hogwarts looks more like a museum than a school inhabited by boarding school kids, the grounds look flat and clean, and the Forbidden Forest looks appropriately spooky but lacks the dread we get when we read the book. Each time I rewatch this movie, I feel as though some of the soul was sucked out of the book to give us something closer to what Disney would have made of the series. Of course, given some of the dark themes approached within the pages of this debut novel it can only be expected that there would initially be some attempt to lighten the mood a little.     Overall, Philosopher's Stone is still a great beginning to a brilliant series. One thing that's remarkable in this film is how the actors, even the more inexperienced younger ones, really bring their characters to life. The production team did a great job of trying to bring the life of the books to the screen, even though they do refine some of the bite out of it.
030726999X|1.0|very disappointed.  received a counterfeit from Amazon, not even one of their contracted sellers.  An entire book of Chapter 28 and part of Chapter 29.  There goes my plan for reading over the holiday weekend.... sigh... I doubt mine is the only counterfeit copy on Amazon's shelves.  Although their Quality Control department should have caught it, at least the return/exchange is easy.  now back to waiting.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|In part seven of the Harry Potter series, we see great actors either returning to reprise their roles or showing up for the first time. Returning as a Ministry of Magic employee is former Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher and temporary Headmistress of Hogwarts Delores Umbridge, played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunten. Joining the cast for the first time is the amazing Bill Nighy (Still Crazy, Shaun of the Dead) playing the new Minister of Magic (unfortunately too short- lived a role), as well as the brilliant Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, and the underrated Human Nature) as Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. In the end what really makes this movie great is the characterization. This film would not work were it not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint doing their jobs properly. In Deathly Hallows, it's Rupert Grint who really delivers. Rupert has always been the comedic relief of the group, but here he provides the dramatic tension and performs beyond admirably.     Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is all about character development. Yates, who's now directed more Harry Potter films than any other director in the series, does a great job of creating a film that maintains tension both between its main characters and the ever-present forces of good and evil that dominate the wizarding world. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is not about action or plot development; it focuses its attention largely on the people involved in these extraordinary adventures. J.K. Rowling gave us all a gift by creating such memorable figures to populate her books, and the directors of the Harry Potter films develop these well-loved characters against a brilliantly realized backdrop.    [Spoiler Alert: If you have not read the books or seen the movie I recommend that you not read past this point]     That said, Deathly Hallows is not without its flaws.  The changes that were made to realize this story in cinematic form are rather problematic. There's no full explanation as to why Dobby is around, so had you not read the book his presence might have been confusing. Kreacher's actions are also a mystery, as the troublesome house elf acquiesces too soon and easily to Harry's request without further explanation. Were it not for plot holes of this nature, this film would be much better. As the series has progressed, it seems that the Harry Potter films have strayed further and further from the source material. I'm a big fan of Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince, both directed by Yates, but those movies left viewers ill prepared for this installment.     The problem with converting this series into film form is the same as it is with any movie based on a book: the conflict that exists between the viewer's perception of the book and the director's. Most people would say that there has to be something wrong with either the viewer or the director when it comes to an adaptation of a novel, but in reality there's nothing wrong with either--they just sometimes differ. When it comes to Harry Potter, I'm a fan of both the books and the film adaptations, and one of the things that I like about the movies is the vision of the director. Yates has been brilliant at building these characters beyond what we've seen from them previously, and he continues to do just that in Deathly Hallows. There are things I would love to see in the movie adaptation, such as Kreacher's story of how he helped Regulus recover the locket, but would that detract from the story of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron? Most likely. That's why Yates is great. He knows where the real brilliance of the story lies, and that we can fill in the details by reading the books. He puts on film only what we need.     Unfortunately, Yates is the fourth director involved in this series and the only one making these films with a knowledge of how Harry Potter's story ends. As a result, he's had to include things in this film that don't seem to make sense because of omissions made in earlier installments. Had Dobby been more involved in Goblet of Fire, his presence in this film would have seemed more logical and his death would have been more meaningful to the movie viewers who haven't read the books.    [End of Spoilers]    Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is a good movie, but not the best of the series. To a point it feels slightly episodic and ends quite abruptly. The acting is amazing, and the visuals are brilliant. One can't help but get the feeling that this is leading to something bigger.

B000ZELISO|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince begins on a real somber note. The opening scene, only mentioned but not described in the book, shows Death Eaters causing the destruction of a massive bridge filled with people. What makes this scene unique compared to the rest of the series is that this destruction takes place in the muggle world, not the wizarding one. David Yates, directing his second Harry Potter film, takes great pains to show that there are no safe places now that Voldemort is back and his followers are out in the open. Even some places that were safe havens for Harry in the past, namely the Weasley residence and even Hogwarts itself, are besieged by Death Eaters.    However, the danger surrounding the characters at every turn doesn't keep the teen characters from being teens. Hormones run high through Hogwarts as students pair off and young love blooms. Things may be dark, but in the world of Harry Potter there will always be some light shining through. While some people complained that there was too much young love in this film, I have to admit that I found it interesting that more than ever this film really gave an impression that the teens in Harry Potter are just ordinary (well, for wizards) kids who happen to find themselves in extraordinary situations. As a result, this film is not only the darkest film of the series, it's also the funniest.    While rumors swirled that some cast members would not find their way back for the sixth Potter film (Emma Watson was considering dropping out and Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfoy, had previously made comments that he would not make it to the end of the series), the cast remained intact for Half Blood Prince. Nine years and six films is a long time for a cast to stay together, especially when they're as young as most of this cast was when the series began, so the fact that they're still together is beyond amazing.     The Harry Potter team continues its casting coup in Half Blood Prince. Royal Shakespeare Company veteran Helen McCrory (Becoming Jane, Enduring Love), who was initially cast as Bellatrix LeStrange in Order of the Phoenix but had to drop out due to pregnancy, joins the cast as Lestrange's sister Narcissa Malfoy. The cast member that everyone was talking about, though, was Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (Iris, Hot Fuzz) as Horace Slughorn. At the time of Half Blood Prince's release everyone expected Broadbent to get at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and, while he didn't get nominated, he delivered the best performance the series has known. In fact, all the actors in the series give their best performance to date in this film. Even Michael Gambon finally gets Dumbledore right!    It's also great to see Quidditch back in the series after being noticeably absent from the last two films and just barely present in Prisoner of Azkaban. The sequences are shot better than in the first two films, and depict the game as much more brutal, having more in common with rugby than it appeared to before. The addition of Ron to Gryffindor's team is brilliant. I'm also glad that we get to see more of Alan Rickman's Severus Snape than in previous installments. In Goblet of Fire, besides a few speaking lines, he was relegated to a moment of physical comedy with Harry and Ron, and he was barely present in Order of the Phoenix.     While Half Blood Prince didn't quite catch up to Order of the Phoenix in box office receipts, it's still the third-highest grossing film in the series and was the second-highest grossing film of 2009 with $936 million earned worldwide. According to Rotten Tomatoes, this installment of Harry Potter is ranked the third highest, critically-speaking. It seems a lot of critics felt as though this film worked more as a placeholder in the series than as a standalone film. That criticism isn't too far from the truth, yet J.K. Rowling said that this is the best film based on her books yet.

B003L20IHE|4.0|Letting go is never easy.  For Charlie St Cloud, the death of his brother Sam triggered a change of life. Once a champion sailor, his brothers' passing left him lost, and with a unique ability to see dead people.  Spending every night playing ball with his dead brother, he denies his future for his past.  A second ghost begins to haunt him as his 'girl', Tess, another sailor, is lost at sea.<br /><br />Charlie, missing his nightly appointment with Sam, says goodbye to his brother while he discovers that to move ahead, he must face the future head on. Relying on the faith in St Jude that the paramedic who saved his life gives him, he heads out to sea and finds Tess barely alive.<br /><br />This is one great movie with a good message.  Zac Efron delivers a strong performance as Charlie and Amanda Crew is a good mesh for the psychologically/psychic challenged sailor.  Each cast member builds into this strong character driven film, and turns this into more of a thriller as opposed to a romance or rite of passage film.<br /><br />Truly, the film shows the maturation of Efron as an actor.  His co-stars, Liota, and Basinger are just part of the package.
030745455X|4.0|Book two in the series was just as gripping as The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.  I would certainly recommend reading them in order.  Steig Larsson has now distracted me through two recent trips and made my plane flights and solitary hotel room stays a surreal experience in the best way.  I don't know if it's the Scandanavian setting, the unusual characters of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, or just the unusual combination of cruelty, crimes, and creative crime solving, but The Girl Who Played With Fire continued to transport me into a different world like the first book did.  The writing in ths book lost a little something compared to the first  book.  Lisbeth seemed a little too wealthy and a little too unstoppable.  But I applauded her most of the way, so I can still recommend The Girl Who Played With Fire strongly as a fun, gripping, unusual read.

B004498KPU|4.0|I just received MJ's Vision and have a widescreen HDTV (1080p) and agree with the previous reviewer - the black bars are on both sides of the screen (in 4:3 ratio), which I found annoying - so I changed the ratio on my TV to 16:9, and the black bars are thinner - but you still do not get the true widescreen display.  When I re-adjusted to full widescreen on the TV, the resolution becomes diminished and the picture somewhat distorted.  Also, the film \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is quite grainy and at certain spots actually fades.  I've only viewed Disc 1 so far so can't comment on the rest of the films.  I don't understand why VISION's remastered short films are not released in true widescreen movie format.  Sound production is fantastic though.  Anyone has any ideas?    Update: I finished viewing the remainder of Vision, and the following are a few additional comments:       1)  \\"Man In The Mirror\\" - video comprised of collage of newsclips of major/important events.  This great song was Michael's anthem, and I would prefer to watch this from a live concert film because he sang it with such meaning and desparate urgency.              2)  \\"Another Part of Me\\" - live concert footage.  Michael in full stride and at the height of his magnetic powers.  I've seen this on YouTube, but on a big TV screen, it blows you away and fully demonstrates why his fans go nutso at his concerts.  Sheryl Crow, who toured with Michael on the Bad concerts, said that she will never see talent like this again.  His executors really must see to it that all Michael's concerts are released on DVD.  The guy was awesome!       3)  \\"Gone Too Soon\\" - a different version from the Dangerous short films, which I've not seen before.  Extremely poignant, and at the end, in the final photograph, your heart stops.       4)  The Jacksons' videos (\\"Blame It On The Boogie,\\" \\"Enjoy Yourself\\") and \\"Say, Say, Say\\" (with Paul McCartney) - Michael in his youth - exuberant, fun-loving, exploding with energy - a real treat (and you will find youself watching only Michael - not his brothers).        5)  I wish there were more . . .    All in all, a magnificent collection to have - and we are reminded again how great and expansive was his genius.  Someone like Michael Jackson comes only once, and it is our great deprivation that we lost him.
1439133948|1.0|I had waited with great anticipation for this latest installment in a series that has had some true masterpieces.  What a disappointment!  It reads like an early draft, or maybe a version that was ruthlessly cut to fit some publisher's stricture on length.  Worse, it lacks the wonderful depths of characterization, dialogue, and ambiance that so delighted me in the other Vorkosigan books.  The plot is confusing from the very first page and never quite grips the reader with the edge-of-the-seat concern for the characters that Bujold's other works do.<br /><br />For those not already familiar with the series, the book is full of cryptic, unexplained references to earlier installments.  Rather than provoking interest, they merely leave the reader distracted and annoyed.<br /><br />Perhaps in some awareness of the book's shortcomings, the publisher includes in this edition a CD-ROM with all the books in the series, in several formats.  I would have greatly preferred a better book without the CD-ROM.<br /><br />Bujold is a superb writer.  I am sorry that she and Baen decided to go ahead with this inferior book. It is a sad commentary that only the sketches serving as an epilogue bear any relation to the depth and quality of her earlier work.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|This show's blend of horror-flick fervor and soap operatic complexity makes a worthy successor to the 1960s schlock TV classic [[ASIN:B000060MVN Dark Shadows]].  It's boisterous, unsubtle, hilarious, philosophical, and grim all at once.  Loosely based on Charlaine Harris' first supernatural crime novel, [[ASIN:0441019331 Dead Until Dark]], this redneck vampire showdown taps common human fears to create a narrative arc which scares more with creeping dread than with startles and jumps.    Sookie Stackhouse has no luck with men, even though she looks just like Anna Paquin.  Maybe it's because she hears others' thoughts.  Bill Compton's brain is mercifully silent, since he's a vampire.  But just as Sookie and Bill's romance starts to build real heat, a killer strikes her hickish Louisiana town.  As bodies mount up, vampire evidence becomes hard to ignore, and the violence circles closer to Sookie and her family.    Family drama and hard-boiled crime dominate this story; the vampire element (and some other supernatural angles that are pretty poorly concealed) seems almost ornamental.  This story is about characters who fear losing control, and tremble as they see their lives spinning further from their grasp.  We share their fear because we can imagine ourselves all too easily in their situation, struggling to maintain equilibrium while pity dies on the vine before us.    The story does occasionally threaten to disappear up its own navel, primarily toward the middle of the series.  Perhaps the writers needed time to recoup their strength.  The characters' exaggerated mannerisms (and accents!) become distracting when the show doesn't give them enough to do.  And the show introduces several plot elements which, I can only imagine, come to fruition in the second season, because they're nonstarters here.    But when a series demonstrates this much energy and thought, I shouldn't nitpick.  I don't rattle easily at TV, yet this show had me clutching the arms of my chair as itshot from one bizarre circumstance to another with the ease and restraint of Space Mountain.  It's paced like a rocket, urgent as a heart attack, and spirited as a rodeo clown.  If more shows like this appeared, I might make time to watch more TV.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of THE best scifi series in recent years. SHAME on Fox for cancelling the show after one season.  The characters are what makes the show tick. They are typical of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Very imperfect, flawed with a streak of humour that, as far as the characters in the story are concerned is not intended.  If you get Firefly, follow it up later with the movie Sernity. It pulls together all the story threads left hanging at the end of Firefly.  AUS

B001I82RVS|3.0|I've been a fan of Tokyo shock for a long time, but this was a failed execution of what could have been a damn good movie. Scenes took way to long to play out, and the \\"story\\" took forever to move along.    With that being said, the action and gore scenes were pretty good. Nothing to nuts for a Tokyo shock film, but I think at a certain point it just gets dumb. Which happened a few times during the movie. But hey, you watch shock for that reason don't you? As I've said, if the scenes were edited down a bit for time, I am sure it would have been a damn fine movie and a lot of fun. But it just kept dragging on and on. Here's to hoping their next flick has editors who know how to make a film progress quicker.

B002ZG9788|3.0|When it comes to Ray Harryhausen there is no bigger fan of his work and films. When I heard about this remake I was excited, but after reading many reviews I decided to wait until it came on cable before seeing it. I happened to come across this Blu Ray very cheap and I took a chance. To my surprise, this remake isn't as bad as many have claimed, but does nothing to improve on the original either.<br /><br />The special effects are a highlight in both versions, but in this film they are used sparingly. You never get a good look at the monsters, only quick cuts and fast motion I assume to hide the cracks in the CGI work? I know the younger generation see Ray Harryhausen's(RH)work as old fashioned or even quaint, but he is one of the pioneers of the craft and has and will continue to inspire generations of film makers long after this remake disappears into obscurity. It was fitting of the makers of this fim to put in a cameo of BoBo the owl as a nod to RH.<br /><br />The story has been changed, but not for the better, only adding confusion and depriving us of a real hero. In RH's original film the story was more straightforward and even though a little corny at times, it did a better job of keeping the motives of the characters more believable.<br /><br />Back to the special effects as this is really the reason to watch any Harryhausen film remake or not. I'm glad that they kept RH's design for Medusa as is it one of the coolest interpretations of her, even though not accurate by Mythological standards. As far as RH's stop motion work, I really don't think people are aware of the amount of work that RH put into the Medusa sequence in the original. Medusa's snake filled hair, her tail and all body movements are painstakingly done with the upmost finesse and skill. Even more amazing is that the flame lit lair is also something he had to take into consideration. Switching the light reflection frame by frame to make it look like flames flickering. Add in the fact the man was in the twilight of his career at almost 70 years old! It was nothing short of breathing taking in its time and I doubt it could ever be duplicated. If we factor in the money and time allowed to create this and all the other creature effects, it is unbelievable that it was completed. I would have loved to see what he could have done with a budget of the remake!<br /><br />The Medusa in this film looks very good, but I think there is more tension in the original scene with her slowly stalking her intruders. In fact, most of the creatures in this remake serve only as a reminder of how great Harryhausen was at his craft, giving his creatures life and personality. The original film suffers from budget restraints that actually effect the look of the film, as all the prints I've seen of it are dark, grainy and the matte shots stick out like a sore thumb, so naturally this remake looks incredible by comparison.<br /><br />The original has more creatures and the story is told in a more entertaining way, but the remake has some impressive special effects and a story that is not as corny. If only we could combine the two to make one great film. Clash of the Titans is a solid action adventure film with some nifty effects, but I will watch RH's version far more times than this one.was in the twilight of his career at almost 70 years old!

I would have loved to see what he could have done with a budget of the remake!<br /><br />The Medusa in this film looks very good, but I think there is more tension in the original scene with her slowly stalking her intruders. In fact, most of the creatures in this remake serve only as a reminder of how great Harryhausen was at his craft, giving his creatures life and personality. The original film suffers from budget restraints that actually effect the look of the film, as all the prints I've seen of it are dark, grainy and the matte shots stick out like a sore thumb, so naturally this remake looks incredible by comparison.<br /><br />The original has more creatures and the story is told in a more entertaining way, but the remake has some impressive special effects and a story that is not as corny. If only we could combine the two to make one great film. Clash of the Titans is a solid action adventure film with some nifty effects, but I will watch RH's version far more times than this one.
B003EV6DBW|2.0|This is not the first time that a wonderful show has turned the corner and gone off the path.  The last Doctor is hard to replace so I did not expect someone to try to be him.  The new doctor is a good actor and appears to read the lines with some energy, but he just is not into the role.  He has no expressions what so ever.  Many of these episodes involve monsters and those are not very good.  When there is mostly people involved the Dr. and the stories are at least pleasant.  His new side kick is a twenty something who looks 17 and adds little to the show.  Once River Song shows up there is relief from the slow moving slog through a season long storyline.  In my opinion the last 4 episodes are pretty good.  THe first 9 not so much.  When paying $60 plus for a season of a show why do we have to be subject to advertising that is hard to get around?  This season actually makes Torchwood seem like a better show.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|How can you go wrong with a cast like this? Apparently you can't! Stallone joins forces with Statham and a whole lotta more action heroes from the past 35 years to make one fun over the top action flick! The story isn't anything new and you know how it's going to end, but you won't care because it is all done with a sense of humor. Cameo's from Schwartzenegger to Willis and some WWF superstars make this one a must for action fans.
1932073221|5.0|It was called Creating Money: Keys to Abundance. I haven't really thumbed through this edition, but looking through the table of contents, the chapter headings are very similar. I can't imagine that they'd rewrite the whole book, but just update parts as necessary. The original was great. Anyhow, the older edition was great as it was more about the psychology of wealth, what it means, and how it affects us on a spiritual level. Money can represent many things and this books goes at length about the various meanings of money like abundance, well being, etc. It's a great book for clarifying the essence of what you want and making peace with money, understanding the cycle of giving and receiving, the ebb and flow of money. This book is really about how to deal with money in a spiritual way. It does offer a magnetic coil exercise to attract money, but this technique did not resonate with me. I need to approach manifestation in a way that connects with my soul. And I've found better techniques out there, at least for me. I would just read this book and try it out. It's definitely worth it for the understanding it gives you about the spiritual aspect of money. But if you would like to try some other approaches to manifesting abundance, I would look at [[ASIN:1401907997 Ask & It Is Given]] and [[ASIN:1615775285 Telementation: Cosmic Feeling and the Law of Attraction]]. \\"Ask\\" is great because it goes at length about the topic of relief and how to manifest things through that. But I feel that \\"Telementation\\" really offers a superior approach as it helps you focus on your desires like a laser beam. I do have reviews of both of these books, so you might want to check them out.

B0034KZE9U|5.0|I bought these for my husband who works in a restaurant and stands on his feet up to 8 hours at a time. I was a bit hesitant to order these due to some bad reviews, but I'm GLAD I ordered them. They were shipped fast, and my husband loves them. His feet don't hurt even after 8 hour-long workday since he started wearing these. Moreover, he loves that they are non-slip and wants the white pair now :)
1433502410|5.0|Most of the problems (if not all) concerning the modern state of Christianity in Britain and America is because of the following undeniable truth: most people who profess to know Jesus Christ do not really know who the God of the Bible is. Most persons who confess to be God's have little idea even what that means. Being so wide-spread amongst us, this has led the British and American church into a pretty poor understanding of the true nature of sin and man's natural hatred for God and for his Christ and most importantly, how a person can become a genuine follower of this God.     I will not write an essay, as it looks like I am about to do, but I am deeply concerned about the kind of Christianity we preach today and I believe that the ESV Study Bible might just be one of the instruments which God is going to use to lift us out of this dirty mess and lukewarm ness. We need to get back to the old ways, with a strong focus on the Reformed and Puritan understanding of Sin, Redemption, Holiness, etc. Such key doctrines as the Atonement, Propitiation, The Nature of Man under sin and Salvation under the Lordship of Jesus Christ are essential to our faith. Without them, we may as well not name ourselves \\"Christian\\".     If we are honest in the sight of our God, we also need to know our Old Testament better. How did some of us ever come to assume that the Old Testament is not as important as the New? The ESV Study Bible contains great study notes on the Old Testament books (and of course on the New).     I bought this Bible because I was using only the King James at the time. That is still my preferred translation, but some passages of it are certainly difficult to understand. I fancied an ESV to turn to at those difficult points. But I spotted that the Study Bible was only about £10 more. I am so glad that I purchased it because I use it almost every day. There is always a word I need to look up, or a passage I need help with. It is really useful. One day, Lord willing, Ihope to read through it all very slowly - notes and all.     It contains extensive introductions, which set the scene for the reading of the book. Everything you could imagine a biblical introduction should contain, it is here included: how this book of the Bible fits into the theme of Salvation; how the literary structure of this book works and why; who wrote it; when; where - almost everything! Plus, at the end of each introduction, a full outline of the structure of the book, which the notes then follow.     It puts the text, not in two columns on one page, but in one single column - as it should be!     It contains good cross-references (though some may find the letters within the text unhelpful).     The biblical text is a lovely and very comfortable size. Others seem to think so also. The notes are far smaller, showing us that those who published this work do not consider their notes and additions to be more important than the biblical text, though they are very able scholars.     In the study section for the notes, it brilliantly breaks the text up into its sections. The structures of the biblical books can be clearly seen. The notes have been written by lovers of God and experts in the book they have been assigned to comment upon. It is like a running commentary. The notes include anything from key Greek and Hebrew words within the text, to difficult words, to application - it's very well done. It is also very readable and interesting and certainly not too complex at all. It has clearly been checked time and time again to make sure it is as accurate and faithful to God as possible. It is essential not just for new, but also for experienced believers.     It contains maps on the page of the scene. For example: let us imagine that you are reading some of the battles King David had; on the pages of his battles, the ESV Study Bible contains the maps! You need not go to the back of the Bible. Yet, also at the back of the Bible are a collection of superb maps.For difficult issues, such as the Millennium, the ESV gives all views and puts forth which views use which scriptures to back-up their claim, explaining them well. It is a very interesting approach, although I think the Study Bible itself has ultimately decided to thrust forth those great Reformed doctrines concerning salvation (which is great!) and they tend towards a more Amillennial stance. But please do not let this put those of you who disagree off. Like I said, it is very fair to all millennial views, presenting them accurately and faithfully.     At the back, it contains a collection of the times the Old Testament is used by the New. Thus, the reader is led to the conviction that without the Old Testament (and all of it) there would be no New Testament at all. Yes, this is true, even with Leviticus! Also, the creators of this work have included at the back a \\"History of Salvation Summary\\", which goes through key Old Testament texts and shows how they point us to Christ and his Work!     If you are unaware concerning the translation itself, the English Standard Version is very good. It is accurate, although, it is not perfect. But having this Study Bible has the advantage of the comments, which explain some Hebrew or Greek words and let you know about controversial passages, e.g. Mark 16.9-20. You sort of feel that you are in safe hands.     One final point is certainly worth you reading this review. The ESV Study Bible contains cracking articles at the back, after Revelation. These articles are very well written, by some extremely well-respected theologians. So, you can read these and understand some more in-depth, yet foundational and very interesting units of Theology. I am at Bible college, but after buying this I remember thinking: \\"I could have saved myself a lot of money!\\" Seriously, the entire volume, if you gradually work through it over years, is worth ten times the price it is being generously sold for. You will find a very solid foundation here -far better than most other study bibles on the market.     With the publication of this great title, which explains the wonderful doctrines of our faith and helps a believer to accurately understand those difficult verses, passages and entire books, I believe God might just raise up some youngsters who will \\"go into all the world and make disciples\\". We are in such desperate need of this and I pray that your eyes might be opened as you read this fabulous Study Bible, for I believe that God has had His hand upon this publication. May you be blessed.
B0042816YK|5.0|I'm writing on my husband's account, so this is a female perspective.    I disagree with one of the reviews that said it's not about the main character saving herself.  The movie is wonderful!  I enjoyed it very much!  However, the book gives more detail about how it is very much about  the main character saving herself.  While it is about breaks ups, it is also about her finding herself   when she is feeling the most lost.    She finds she doesn't want the life with her husband, but  she needs to figure out who she is.  In that way, it is all about saving herself.  Anyway, that is my two cents.
B0041KOVUU|5.0|This is the second of 11 EP's coming out in the next 5 years or so from the Smashing Pumpkins. I personally thought the 1st EP was great but this one blows it away. Every song on here is worth it and the B-side track \\"Cottonwood Symphony\\" sounds like something out of the mellon collie era. It truely is terrific. This is a must have for any fan of the Smashing Pumpkins.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|First of all, let me say that I am a die-hard hip hop purist.  I REALLY hate what \\"rap music\\" has done to the hip hop culture, but every once in a while I find a new person that I think is not completely bastardizing the artform.      Today was NOT one of those times.  I keep hearing people say how sick this girl is, so I KEEP giving her chances.  Time and time again, I have been shocked at just how wack & talentless she is.  Her voice alone is enough to make you want to stab someone, but to add in all the repitition, stupid accents, and growling just makes her unbearable.      This MIGHT be a good pop CD.  I don't really listen to pop so I can't speak on it.  But if that's the case, she needs to no longer be marketed as an Emcee.  It's insulting to the real ones out there.  Just call her what she is - rap music's Lady Gaga - and keep it moving.
1553655427|5.0|Dambisa Moyo's masterpiece is an economic blueprint intended to serve as a paradigm for weaning Africa off the debilitating aid-dependency syndrome that has kept the continent in perpetual economic stagnancy for decades. Using dependable statistics, Moyo argues that government-to-government or bilateral aid (which should be distinguished from charity-based aid) to Africa undermines the ability of Africans to conceptualize their own best economic and political policies. As she puts it: \\"The net result of aid-dependency is that instead of having a functioning Africa, managed by Africans, for Africans, what is left is one where outsiders attempt to map its destiny and call the shots.\\"(66) Foreign aid does not only undermine economic growth, it keeps recipient countries in a state of endemic poverty. It is itself an underlying cause of social unrest and possibly even civil war.        Moyo notes that the \\"prospect of seizing power and gaining access to unlimited aid wealth is irresistible.\\"(59)  To buttress her argument, she refers to Grossman (1992) who contends that the underlying purpose of rebellion is the capture of the state for financial advantage, and that aid makes such conflict more likely. In the past fifty years, Moyo observes, over US$1trillion in development-related aid has been transferred from the rich countries of the West to Africa. Yet, aid has helped make the poor poorer; economic growth slower.      According to Moyo, the notion that foreign aid can alleviate systemic poverty, and has done so in Africa is tantamount to a myth. Millions in Africa, she notes, are poorer today on account of aid dependency. Indeed, aid has been and continues to be, an unmitigated political and economic and humanitarian disaster for Africa.  Aid is not benign--it is malignant. In short, aid is not part of the solution; it is the problem. And here is how.     Aid breeds corruption in Africa. If the world has one picture of the African continent, it is one of corrupt statesmen. With very few exceptions, African leaders have crowned themselves in gold, seized land, handed over state businesses to relatives and friends, diverted billions of aid-money to foreign bank accounts, and generally treated their countries like giant personalized cash dispensers. According to Transparency International, Mobutu Sese Seko of erstwhile Zaire is estimated to have looted the State to the tune of US$5billion.     Roughly the same amount was stolen from Nigeria by President Sani Abacha and placed in Swiss private banks. The list of corrupt practices in Africa is endless. However, the point about corruption in Africa is not that it exists; the point is that foreign aid is one of its greatest aides.  Aid creates a vicious cycle of dependency in Africa; a cycle that chokes off desperately needed investment, instills a culture of kleptomania, and facilitates rampant and systematic corruption, all with deleterious consequences for economic growth. It is this cycle, Moyo posits, that \\"perpetuates underdevelopment, and guarantees economic failure in the poorest aid-dependent countries\\" (49).    Aid creates a fertile ground for rent-seeking, that is, the use of governmental authority to take and make money without trade or production of wealth. Because foreign aid is fungible--easily stolen, redirected and extracted-- it facilitates corruption. At a very basic level, an example of this is where a government official with access to aid money set aside for public welfare takes the money for his own personal use. Examples are legion in Africa.  Foreign aid programs, which tend to lack accountability, and check and balances, act as substitutes for tax revenues.      The tax receipts that aid releases are then diverted to unproductive and often wasteful purposes rather than the productive public expenditure (education, health infrastructure, etc) for which they were ostensibly intended. Moyo points out that in \\"Uganda, for example, aid-fueled corruption in the 1990s was thought to be so rampant that only 20 cents of every US$1 of government spending on education reached the targeted local primary school.\\"(53)     Strangely enough, Larry Diamond (2004) observes, Western aid agencies, notably the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, continue to give aid to African states, with notorious authoritarian and corrupt governments. His list includes Cameroon, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Gabon, Angola, Eritrea, Guinea and Mauritania. Africa is the region that receives the largest amount of foreign aid, receiving more per capita in official development assistance than any other region of the world.     Yet her social infrastructure is in a state of utter decrepitude! Moyo notes that any large influx of money into an economy, however robust, has the potential to create serious problems. With the relentless flow of unmitigated, substantial aid money to Africa, these problems are magnified, especially in economies that are, by their very nature, poorly managed, weak and susceptible to outside influence, over which domestic policymakers have little or no control.     Moyo contends that increases in foreign aid are correlated with declining domestic savings rates. As she puts it, \\"As foreign aid comes in, domestic savings decline; that is, investment falls.\\"(61) She further observes that with all the tempting aid monies on offer, which are notoriously fungible, the relatively few people who have access to it, spend it on consumer goods instead of saving the cash.  As savings decline, local banks have less money to lend for domestic investment.     Worse still, foreign aid has an equally damaging crowding-out effect: although aid is meant to encourage private investment by providing loan guarantees, subsidizing investment risks and supporting co-financing arrangements with private investors, in practice it discourages the inflow of such high-quality foreign monies. Moyo points out that empirical research has shown that higher aid-induced consumption leads to an environment where much more money is chasing fewer goods.\\"(61) This almost invariably leads to price rises--inflation.       Over and above, aid chokes off the export sector. This phenomenon is known as the Dutch disease, as its effects were first observed when natural gas revenues flooded the Netherlands in the 1960s, devastating the Dutch export sector and increasing unemployment. Moyo argues that aid inflows have adverse effects on overall competitiveness, export sector (usually in the form of decline in the share of those in the manufacturing sector and ultimately growth).     In the oddest turn of events, the fact that aid reduces competitiveness, and thus the trading sector's ability to generate foreign-exchange earnings, makes countries even more dependent on aid, leaving them exposed to all the negative consequences of aid-dependency. In countries with weak financial systems, additional foreign resources do not translate into growth of stronger financially dependent industries.     So if foreign aid harbors such adverse effects for African economies why are donors bent on doling it out? And why aren't recipients sagacious enough to put an end to the lethal cycle of aid? Moyo's Dead Aid model provides solid answers to these intriguing questions. She notes that \\"Africa is addicted to aid. For the past sixty years, she says, Africa has been fed aid. Like any addict, Africa needs and depends on its regular fix, finding it hard, if not impossible to contemplate existence in an aid-less world.\\"(75) Her book provides an antidote, a road map for riding Africa of aid dependency.     Arguing that the aid program in Africa has not worked precisely because it was never conceived with the intention of promoting the economic development of Africa, she proposes alternatives to foreign aid. She notes that like the challenges faced by someone addicted to drugs, the withdrawal is bound to be painful. Nonetheless, if implemented in the most efficient way, the solutions offered in Dead Aid will help to dramatically reduce Africa's reliance on aid money.            Moyo cites Botswana as an example of an economic success story in Africa. Botswana began with a high ratio of aid to GDP but used the aid wisely to provide important public goods that helped support good policies and sound governance and laid the foundation for robust economic growth for the country.     She says this stratagem can be replicated all over Africa. Her alternatives to aid, predicated on transparency and accountability, would provide the life-blood through which Africa's social capital and economies will grow. Her Dead Aid strategy leaves room for modest amounts of aid to be part of Africa's development financing strategy. Systematic aid will be a component of her Dead Aid Model, but only insofar as its presence decreases as other financing alternatives take hold. The ultimate goal, as far as Moyo is concerned, is an aid-free Africa.     In a nutshell, Dead Aid proposes radical solutions to the pressing economic problems of our time. It offers a new model for financing development in Africa's poorest countries, one that offers economic growth, promises to significantly reduce endemic poverty, and most importantly, does not rely on aid. Though Moyo is not the first economic pundit to take Western aid donors to task, never has the case against aid been made with such rigor and conviction. She does not pull her punches.     \\"In a perfect world,\\" she writes, \\"what poor countries at the lowest rungs of economic development need is not a multi-party democracy, but in fact a decisive benevolent dictator to push through the reforms required to get the economy moving.\\"(xi) Her most radical proposal comes in the form of a rhetorical question: \\"What if,\\" she asks, \\"one by one, African countries each received a phone call...telling them that in exactly five years the aid taps would be shut off permanently?\\"(xi)
0810982862|3.0|I'm a bit shocked at the lack of concept art in here.  For a movie as wide, sweeping and design heavy as Avatar was, this book is very skimpy.  I know they released a making of book not too long ago but I found myself disappointed by that a bit as well.  James Cameron has put out some of the best science fiction films ever, yet he never oversees a decent \\"making of\\" or \\"art of\\" book for any of his films (no ALIENS, Abyss, Terminator making of at all...what up with that?) or when he does put one out (Terminator 2) they are immensely underwhelming.  The AMP suit design in the Avatar alone could have taken up 2-3 pages if not more of space yet was given next to nothing.  A very mediocre book for such a grand movie.

We promptly watched the show from Season 1-10 through Netflix. I loved it so much that a few years later, I put it on my wishlist. And waited...Well, my husband just gave it to me. We will be alone this Thanksgiving, and I had made a comment about how fun it would be to stay home together and watch all of the hysterical Thanksgiving episodes. It arrived today and tomorrow we will snuggle and once again laugh ourselves silly. Happy Thanksgiving to all! (And put it on your wish list!)
B000050HTO|5.0|The biggest criticism I seem to see of this album is that it's not nearly enough to represent Dylan's near 40yr recording career at the time of this cd's release.  Well, to that I say... duh.  Every Dylan fan has their personal favorites and those combined with the OBVIOUS choices that have to be included easily add up to more than 2 discs.    But rather than complain about what's not here, I prefer to evaluate what IS here, which is 2 hours of rock solid Dylan from his first album on through 1997's Grammy winning \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" and 2000's incredible soundtrack contribution, \\"Things Have Changed.\\"    All in all, one could argue for this track over that one and 'how could they leave of \\"Masters of War\\"??!?!\\", but in the big picture, every track here is a hit, an essential album cut or just a good song from an era of Dylan's career that otherwise would not have been represented.    As a 2-disc collection, it is clearly not aimed at die-hard fans who have all the albums, but at more casual fans interested in getting the hits in one title, but who want a more career-spanning option than something like \\"Greatest Hits Vol. I\\" (it's interesting to note that since this 2cd \\"Essential\\" set was released, there has been a single cd career-spanning title \\"The Best of Bob Dylan\\".  I'm betting that's REALLY got the old fans up in arms....)    Bottom line, this is a solid set of great Dylan material than any newcomer will like.  Some more than others and this is FAR from ALL the good stuff Dylan has done from 1962-2000, but it's a great introduction to the deep catalog he has created.    The ONLY complaint I might have is that neither disc 1 nor disc 2 are maxed out at 78 or 79 minutes. So while everything here is good, there was room for more, meaning \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" and a few others that some have complained about missing could have been added in without having to sacrifice other songs.  Still, 30 tracks on 2 discs including some not available on hisalbums, all at a very affordable price, so... hard to complain.  FIVE STARS!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My wife & I went to see this film in its 1st run back in early 1966. It was our 1st date and my wife (girl friend then) was 16!

B00428ZRFE|5.0|WOW. i thought after rated X cd....what a dud, I never felt Rihanna could get back on track.....but damm, But  after hearing LOUD. I have to say the song California King Bed is a number one hit, if they dont put this out as the next single, then there crazy. I have to say, i love the whole cd, s&m, fading, with its enya like sound. It the kinda cd that hits all the right sounds. Just the strong vocals on Complicated is worth the money. Its a cd that flows and works. Cheers Rihanna, make California King Bed your next single....its a number one hit. off the hook. Rihanna fan, you heard it here first. welcome back Rihanna. Love this cd. GREAT.
B003OF3R0S|4.0|I have to admit that the only reason I bought this CD in the first place was because my favorite drummer, Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), joined A7X for this album and tour, after the sudden death of The Rev. Well, now we all know that he quit his band of 25 years during the Uproar Festival, but I don't know if he plans on staying with these guys.<br /><br />Anyways, Nightmare is a really good album from start to finish. It has a nice mixture of metal songs like Nightmare, Welcome To The Family, Natural Born Killer, and God Hates Us, while balancing itself with some mid-tempo rockers like the old school Metallica sounding Buried Alive. Most important of course, these guys can really play. The drumming is outstanding as expected, the vocals have enough variation to remain interesting, and the guitars, while heavy at times, keep the technical aspects on display with some nice harmonies and solos. I'm not usually into the more recent class of metal music, but Avenged Sevenfold has the talent to keep them going through another decade and beyond.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I was unsure at first about watching this movie. I asked a friend about this film and he sid that it was one of his favorite movies. Since my friend and I have the same taste in movies for the most part, I gave this movie a chance and I am glad I did. This movie is very moving in the tale of the life of Charles Foster Kane and the search of his last word \\"Rosebud\\". Orson Welles takes on a journey of the people that were in Charles life and the stories they had of Charles. It is not until the very final scene you find out about Rosebud.     The filming was outstanding, the directing above the rest and the cast was incredible. Citizen Kane is one of the greatest motion picutres that I have ever seen and will have to own very soon.
0439023513|5.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" was an incredible finish to a remarkable trilogy. The second book showed there might be more to the arc of the story than we thought. This third is a fitting conclusion and refinement.     Not all readers are happy with these books. Like mockingbirds and jays, the books' appeal is not in their ability to sing pretty songs or fly soaringly - it's in their character and uniqueness. Many folks deride and even shoot these birds as \\"trash\\" birds. That just goes to show...    I finished the trilogy appreciating it more than ever. I dragged the time out, reading this last book; I didn't want it to end so I savored and considered each smallish chunk I'd read before moving on to the next. Each time I returned to the book my appreciation of the author's skill and inventive maneuverings of plot and characters stayed steady. I was never once let down. But then again, I wasn't expecting the book to be written the way I'd have written it.    The negative reviews here are kinda funny: they seem to have been written by people judging whether the book told the story they wanted, expected, hoped to read. The major complaints are about how the main character failed to act as *their* hero, mythical and perfect. \\"She wasn't heroic enough\\"; \\"She should've...\\"; \\"The plot should've....\\" You can almost hear these reviewers saying, \\"Well, if *I* had written it, it would go this way...\\" Wish fulfillment is poor criteria for reviewing.    But in my opinion the trilogy succeeds because it has its own true voice. It has imagination, it shows thoughtfulness, skill and - if you're the sort who likes to exercise empathy - heart.    Empathy is crucial in appreciating fictions. If it enters your heart and fits all the right places, then that's entertaining and fun. But if it draws you into its own heart... A mysterious, dark, and often unsettling experience, sure - but *that* it does is a mark of good storytelling.    Some people just want a good plot - a toy - you can tell they just want a fine-running machine sparking and whirring across the floor. And some people just want to be told a good bedtime story, that confirms in the end how everything will be \\"happily ever after\\" or at least comforted by having their expectations met. And some people want to explore character, to get inside a character's head and heart and soul, to feel what's different, and feel what makes them tick. I thought The Hunger Games meets two of those three audience's criteria.    Some reviewers complain the book didn't wrap things up (or wrap them up pretty). Maybe they think that's what makes something a story, entertaining, and what a story should do. I wonder what they think of \\"Anna Karenina,\\" or \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" \\"A Separate Peace\\"? (If they even read up to that level.) Their complaints would fit those books - and most great books. Not that I'm saying The Hunger Games is great literature, but I think the impulse and the intentions are similar. When a book or a movie deals with death, dying, and with those who send others to their deaths, it touches a strong nerve. Some folks shy away; some are drawn closer. Some who're drawn closer are voyeurs; some come away the wiser.    So if you're deciding whether you ought to read a book or see a movie, learn what it is the author or director was intending to show you. If that's something that interests you, then do it and see what you think. There are far worse ways to decide what you want in your life, far worse ways to spend your time. I think, if you've read this far, you'll definitely be rewarded reading The Hunger Games.
B003WE9WRI|5.0|This zombie survival guide really brings scientific evedince into the equation. Whether or not the evedince is true is up to you. All i can say is that if zombies were real this is what the book that would tell you exactly what they would be and how to survive it. Also it keeps religion almost completly out of it along with magic and voodo. It is worth the full buy and personaly i think it should be worth double the current price. Good job Max Brooks.

B001HN694K|5.0|A very creative (some may say bizarre) take on Alice's return to Wonderland.<br />Some may say bizarre.<br />But it beautifully ties up the story as the 19 year old Alice returns to Wonderland (Underland) to see some of her old friends and fulfill her destiny which is to end the reign of terror by the White Queen.<br />The young Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is an independent minded and head strong girl who suffers from a recurring night mare.<br />At a garden party she is expected to accept the proposal of marriage by the toffee nosed young Lord Ascott.<br />She excuses herself before following the white rabbit once again into a grotto (the same one she had entered 13 years before) and once again falls down the whole into wonderland.<br />There she stumbles across Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse) and the remarkably strange and wonderful Mad Hatter in a role that seems to be typecast for Johnny Depp.<br />She enters the court of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who mistakes her entirely for someone else (who she refers to as Um), while all the time the Queen is after Alice.<br />but it is through battling wild creatures such as the Bandersnatch and dodging the forces of the evil Stayne, the Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover)<br />Leading a rebellion against the tyrant Red Queen she flees with her friends, the Mad Hatter, the rabbit and various other characters from the original to the court of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) where she is to fullfil her destiny as a dame in shining armour to battle the Jaberwocky<br />While there are scenes where you may wonder where the movie is going it all comes together beautifully.<br />Just the right dose of the bizarre and dark for the slightly philosophical yet entertaining adventure that the director was aiming for.

B0049D1TCM|5.0|Honestly, I've been a hardcore rap/hip hop fan for a decade now, and Nicki is the most appealing female artist I've ever heard, ever. I don't understand why there are so many 1-star reviews. How can you say the album is bad? Did you not listen to her dozen mixtapes that have come out? I think you shoulda kind of known what to expect... If you honestly liked her mixtapes, there is no way you could not like her new album. Therefore, I think it's safe to say that these 1-star reviews are written by haters, people who have probably never listened to her. But here's my honest opinion of the album: Best female rap/hip hop album of this era, period. Thanks Nicki. Honestly, what female rapper can you say has had a better album in recent years? I'll wait.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|The TV I do all of my film watching on now is fifty inches. I have my eye on the possibility of upgrading that to a sixty-five inch set in the semi-distant future.    Digital copies are provided only in 720 by 576 (at best), and they look like garbage on my 13.4-inch MacBook. So how much use do you believe a DVD is going to get in my house?    If you guessed anything other than \\"to stub cigarettes out on\\", \\"to test if the microwave is still working\\", or \\"as a one-use frisbee\\", you are wrong. Not just wrong on the level of believing MP3 sounds anywhere near as good as an uncompressed CD, but wrong like you have invested your retirement in a European bank.    So once again, let me congratulate the SD-pusher studios on turning what should have been another guaranteed sale to me into an annoyed search elsewhere. Stop playing favourites with DVD buyers for crying out loud. DVD died the day that the electronics companies wised up and realised that televisions need to be made progressive.
B000JMLKCG|5.0|a riveting read from the first shocking chapter. an amazing kindle read. thomas hardy has a profound grasp of human nature and sugarcoats nothing. this is a great novel.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|This one is a \\"back-to-the-basics\\" kinds of movie and does a pretty good job of re-inventing the original Predator concept with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I would say its almost as good as the original. There is plenty of action, plenty of weapons and does not require a lot of mental energy to watch. This is the kind of movie to watch on a day off from work and just relax. Adrien Brody does a respectable job of playing Royce as the lead character and there's also a samurai sword based fight scene. What more can you ask from a movie?
B0042O85ES|5.0|i read several of the reviews of Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones.  I concur with the 5 star comments.  This show is well worth the money.  I bought both my copies from Amazon, regular dvd and blu-ray, and I while I don't think the blu-ray is actually any better than the regular dvd, I really don't care. I am just so thrilled to have it.  It looks good enough; it sounds even better.  Mick Taylor is the creme-de-le-creme of 70s guitar players.  His finesse is amazing.  Being able to watch him pick through his lead riffs is such a treat that I can hardly believe my fortune. I found Jagger's performance to be a bit trite, almost silly, but the rest of the band is amazing.  It could have been longer.  It could have had more special features.  It could have been free.  I'm just glad to have it, and I truly think that anyone who gave this dvd one star is a rock 'n' roll idiot.
0060555661|5.0|Buy this book if you are at all interested in the stock market or investing in general!!!!  I've read a few books now on investing and stock market strategies and am also an economics major and I find this book to very useful.  Everything that I've read in other books seems to somehow be originated from this landmark title.  Well worth the price plus shipping; and buying it from amazon.com I saved at least 15 dollars!
B003XTUZIM|5.0|They've done it again. Steven Wilson has remixed this disc (in both stereo and 5.1 surround mixes) for maximum effect. This is one of Crims \\"difficult\\" albums. The album is a hodge podge of ideas and there is no flow or continuity. Each track could exist separately. This is one of the Crims least beloved lineups even tho they were capable of more free-jazz improv than any previous or subsequent incarnation of the band. The remixes open up the sound field and really put the emphasis on the vocals and the guitar. I'm hearing things that used to lag in the background. Each instrument is given it's space and has more depth and clarity. The trumpet and string bass sound like they are in the room with you. Also note that this collection offers a wealth of extra tracks of outtakes, alternates, rehersals, live cuts and a Fripp remix of \\"Ladies Of The Road\\" that puts his solo in a new light. The set also contains the 30th anniversary remastering of the original album mix. Add to this some incisive liner notes and pictures from that era in the booklet and you have a great way of celebrating this remarkable and misunderstood entry in the King Crimson discography. I can't wait for the new \\"Wake of Poseidon\\" to get here!
B002ZG999U|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't bad at all. In fact I hope they come out with The Expendables II. Perhaps the next one might be bigger and badder than this one.
B000084T18|5.0|When Get Rich or Die Tryin' was released 50 Cent was hardly new to the game, nor was he the megastar that he is today.  he was just another artist looking for a piece of the pie.  Well, yes, but more like an artist looking to take the whole pie.  He wanted it all.  And, with this album, he was well on his way to doing just that.    This is a very worthy *debut*, with a couple hot tracks (Patiently Waiting, In da Club, Heat, High All the Time, Like My Style) and a many more greats.  Here's my breakdown for each.    2. What Up Gangsta 4/5 - nice beat but that's about it  3. Patiently Waiting 5/5 - great from start to finish, sick Eminem verse, 50's finally verse is killer  4. In da Club 5/5 - the first official, fresh club beat that keeps you moving  5. Man Men (Wish Death) 4/5 - good, but not one of my favorites  6. High All the Time 5/5 - one of my favorites, great beat and nice flow  7. Heat 4/5 - good track, a banger  8. If I Can't - 3/5 - not a favorite, dislike most of it  9. Blood Hound 5/5 - another great one with a Young Buck verse  10. Back Down 5/5 - nice diss track, 50 brings it, don't really like the guy at the end, not a funny as he hoped  11. P.I.M.P. 3/5 - I do not like this song, it's not very good  12. Like My Style 5/5 - great song, perfect for the egomaniac that is 50 Cent  13. Poor Lil Rich 4/5 - another good one with a great opening  14. 21 Questions 5/5 - a more thoughtful and restrained song than the ones that came before, it's great  15. Don't Push Me 4/5 -- good, with some great verses from Eminem and Lloyd Banks  16. Gotta Make It to Heaven 3/5 -  decent, but not one of my favorites  17. Wanksta 5/5 - a classic, 50 at his best  18. U Not Like Me 3/5 - pretty forgetful  19. Life's On the Line 5/5 - another classic 50 track.  Great beat and lyrics.    If you're a fan of rap music, you check it out.  If you're wondering whether or not to check out 50 Cent, you can't go wrong with this one.  Just steer clear of the overindulged [[ASIN:B0007NFL18The Massacre]]    Highly recommended.
B002ZG98UA|1.0|The 1 movie was good, the second was great. After that it all went down hill.  I was really hoping that this last RE movie would be better than the third RE but it was even worse.  Jesus, the producer have in their hands a very successful franchise and don't even bother to make a decent movie!?  What up with that?  We are all seeing good movies being produced based on comic book heroes so it can be made.   Truth is, I think the producers of RE know that fans of the game are probably going to watch it anyway so they just don't care much if the movie  has a good plot or if it's good at all.
0399536108|1.0|I really did.  Based upon the other reviews and the synopsis, it seemed right up my alley.<br /><br />But it's been done before, and done better.  This book was long on \\"You can do it\\" with equal parts of \\"Look at all the great stuff I've done\\" but way too short on specifics to be useful to anyone.<br /><br />The 1 star is for the positive attitude and spirit.  But that's not enough to make the book worth it.  Even reading the blog this book is based on contains more useful information.<br /><br />And what is with the Kindle version costing 10 bucks but the book version costing like $7?  Stupid - I know that's not the author's fault but unfair pricing is a legitimate reason to negatively review a product.<br /><br />I feel bad giving a book a one-star review - I never thought I would do such a thing.  If I dislike a book I usually just don't review it and put it out of my mind.  But in this case I feel it is my civic duty to warn people what they're getting when they buy it.  My suggestion:  Save your money or buy \\"4 Hour Work Week\\" by Tim Ferris.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|When a distinguished British diplomatic is about to edit his memories, a ghost writer is hired after his predecessor was found mysteriously drowned. And since he is hired a set of events will be emerge to reveal unpleasant connections with the CIA.<br /><br />The absorbing drama will be progressively increasing until its sudden and unexpected finale.<br /><br />All the cast is splendid except an only flaw: Pierce Brosnan (The best Bond after Connery) who took total command from this role to depict the well reminded British Prime Minister. Perfect cast and firm hand in this thriller directed by Roman Polanski.
0307474275|1.0|The main character Robert Langdon was such a self-important snob that I soon found myself rooting for his enemies and cheering every time he would get into trouble.<br /><br />The author is as much a self-important snob as his protagonist. The book's entire premise is based on exploiting the modern reader's ignorance about the history of religion and the Western civilization as a whole. Brown's pretentious narrative is replete with historic distortions, inaccuracies, lies, twisted logic, and the worst pseudo-science imaginable.<br /><br />Brown has also created, perhaps, the most politically correct villain in all of pulp fiction: a fanatical giant albino monk. Not only is he \\"white\\" - he's super-white! Not only is his brain mudled by the \\"opiate for the masses\\" - he is a zealous member of an ominous Christian cult! He is the embodiment of all what's \\"wrong\\" with the Western civilization, which in the author's mind apparently continues to force its \\"patriarchal and misogynistic hegemony\\" on the rest of the innocent humanity that otherwise would have been happily worshiping \\"the sacred feminine.\\"<br /><br />I read this book only out of curiosity about all the noise that surrounded it. Otherwise it was a waste of time.
