B00BEZTMFY|3.0|This DVD was purchased from Amazon and given to me as a gift.<br /><br />In a nearly three-hour film Peter Jackson never gets to the point and ends it abruptly. He plans two more films to finish up the story (and to milk his audiences of a lot of money). He must have an awful lot of left over scenes and special effects to recycle from his Lord of the Rings films. The opening scenes were obviously cut and recycled from Jackson's LOTR films. It was painful and yet funny to see Martin Freeman plod around in furry clown-shoe sized hobbit feet which he obviously was not used to wearing. A few of the dwarves actually looked like dwarves and the others looked like miniature people - but then there was never any comparative scale so you rarely knew what you were actually seeing.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch was advertised as The Necromancer and he literally has about four seconds of screen time and then only as a fuzzy silhouette. Pretty bad.<br /><br />The cgi effects were overcooked and overlong. I watched this film with a group of people and halfway through the escape scenes from under the mountain everybody began to laugh and titter because the constant repetitive violence and long-shot special effects were so silly.<br /><br />Apparently Jackson decided that he could improve on The Hobbit by gutting the story and adding characters and scenes that are irrelevant (and apparently he could make more money by stretching it out this way). One egregious example: Radagast the Brown smoking marijuana and eating hallucinogenic mushrooms? Puhleeeze! Give me a break!<br /><br />Did I enjoy the film at all? Well, somewhat - as a fantasy but certainly not as The Hobbit.
160774273X|5.0|I have been baking bread for a while including Pizza. I have always used the fermentation method with a poolish starter etc. This is the book to have from beginner to self content with your abilities. You will really learn methods that will improve your ability. Yes I read other reviews about this author talking a lot. Yes and it is boring but you can skip thru it. In the first five minutes reading this book I learned how to make breads that other wise would be impossible with my previous methods. Technique is the most important skill needed for success and you will learn it from this book. Remember a carpenter is only as good as his/her tools. That is a fact, so don't cry over the fact that you may need to purchase some additional items for your bread making arsenal. I highly recommend this book. Practice, Practice, Practice!!! You will not regret it.
B0027VTMAE|3.0|Let's face it: Polanski has five, maybe six, movies that have brought him fame in his long career, and \\"The Ninth Gate\\" isn't one of them. While I enjoyed the intrigue and the riddles behind the engravings found in \\"The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows\\", I didn't care for the ambiguity I felt when the credits rolled up. Polanski has left a few obvious questions unanswered, and based on some of the reviews I've read here, I'm not alone in this boat.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />To break through my confusion, I had to watch the DVD a few times and read the screenplay. I'm not going to state that I understand the minutiae of TNG, but I think where I'm at in understanding the movie, it's good enough for me.<br /><br />One big question mark for me and many others was the identity of \\"The Girl\\" with blond hair. Was she \\"The Whore of Babylon\\" as some have claimed, or a \\"witch\\" in league with the Devil? Based on clues I've dug up mostly in the script and what I saw in the film, I'm convinced she is the Devil.<br /><br />Another unanswered question had to do with Andrew Telfer's suicide. Why did he hang himself? Polanski provides a not-so-obvious clue by using the character of Baroness Kessler to state, \\"If he ever finds out what his wife gets up to in these gatherings, he'll probably kill himself.\\" Moreover, it's my opinion Telfer found out his wife only married him for his money and to further her Satanic pursuits.<br /><br />There's more but I won't go into it in this review. Half the fun of watching the movie is in trying to figure out what's happening. And that's what Polanski wants you to do. But I think he enjoys trying to be clever and it shows in TNG, but someone should tell him he's really not, and in trying to be clever, he's made the film ambiguous enough where the masses want to tune out.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />While it's a straightforwardly based-upon-a-true story, THE IMPOSSIBLE still has its share of surprises and turnabouts. The cover blurb from Mary Pols (TIME) says \\"Emotionally rich and life-affirming.\\" I agree, but it should also be noted that this film earns every bit of its various life-affirming qualities. The initial scenes of the tsunami and its aftermath are heart-stopping in places: This is definitely one of the more disturbing PG-13s that I've seen. It's also the first film I've seen in a long while that honestly brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Even though the pacing could use a little more of this and a little less of that, THE IMPOSSIBLE is expertly filmed and acted. Lush scenery too: It made me want to go to Thailand in spite of everything shown here. Fine performances by Watts and McGregor, with special kudos going to Tom Holland as eldest son Lucas. The Special Features are all worth a serious look.
B00AZRBLHO|3.0|A little preachy in places but provides a well rounded and grounded intro. The story telling approach is unusually refreshing.
193700788X|4.0|The story followed the guidelines set up in previous books.  The ending was predictable but satisfying.  A good series that I thoroughly enjoyed.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great series! The ending was just what I wanted. I highly recommend these books for anyone. I want to read them all over again. The last book is not really what I expected, but was still great.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|Love this movie. Saw it 6 times with six different dates in the 60's. Amazing actress, amazing set designs, fabulous fashion designs in wardrobe and exquisit music.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My son and I love playing this app! Gotta love Disney. Hope to find more awesome apps that my family can play together
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think that this app is so fun , I use this all the time when I am bored<br />So if you get this app please rate
1885167776|5.0|I know some people are naturally able to know what is most important and stay with it.  However, a lot of us are a little scattered, drawn in many directions and try to do too many things.  I love this book and have found the advice very helpful to me.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We have seen all the other &#34;ice age&#34; movies and this one keeps all the fun going and as always had a very funny store line.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Cant go wrong with this series of Batman/Dark Knight.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I think this is clearly one of the best movies with this james bond. The action was great and showed how good Craig is as a actor which is outstanding.
1452110581|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson's thirteenth birthday.  He hasn't found the time yet to put it down and share with me!!<br />From that incident alone, I'd say it's a hit!!!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|The story line is interesting in itself, but then goes into downright phantastical territory: nazi experiments for a fourth Reich and  Brazilian military special ops. I was just waiting for Aliens or Zombies to show up...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is the most amazing game ever! I was constantly playing it for like 2 days constantly if you want a fun game then get this!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|So far this app has been really great. I love having the sounds on the go, especially for our baby.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Was worried that the military and age of the kids would bug me but I found myself really enjoying the writing. I visualized the children as being older than their characters - and the ending was a surprise - which I loved. Definitely recommend this book!
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|CD arrived soon after release date,in good condition.<br />Beth Hart & Joe Bonamassa one of best dous to come around in long time. I would recommend this album to all fans of both artists.
B00846REIS|5.0|It will not take you long to read this book because you cannot put it down. I am really enjoying this story. It is better than Fifty Shades of Grey. My feelings while reading this book are similar but it is not as kinky. I strongly recommend this series.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I like how they have great examples of cases that have been helped by following this movement. The ideas behind are practical  and sensible.
B0091REZMW|5.0|i like the way it is set up. ez to use. fun to play. i would tell other ppl to play it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Easy read, I finished it in one day. Makes you think twice about your life. I'd recommend this for any age.
B000QCS9NM|3.0|Interesting read, but not one that I felt I took anything away from.  Since I can't recommend it, I can't give it higher than 3 stars. Fight Club was awesome, Choke was intriguing...
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Just when I thought that out of all the films in this impressive franchise, none would top Fast Five, I was dead wrong. Fast & Furious 6 is completely worth your time, and absolutely worth the price of admission. SERIOUSLY. When this movie was over, I was left feeling excited, relieved, and blown away. Rarely do sequels improve and not miss a step, but I am glad to say Fast & Furious 6 does not miss a step or a left/right turn. Returning are Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Gal Cadot, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Elsa Pataky, Sung Kang, and Dwayne Johnson. They make these movies so much fun to watch that it is almost ridiculous. They all did an outstanding job in this movie, every actor was on point and Tyrese and Ludacris bring even more humor this time around. New additions include: Luke Evans as the primary bad guy Owen Shaw and Gina Carano as Riley. Now on to the story line.<br /><br />Some may be ashamed to admit this because of the type of movie Fast 6 is, but there are lessons and values to be learned and appreciated in this movie. Family is important and Family comes first. That is the key lesson in this movie. And Fast 6 succeeds in getting this point across. Another thing I want to point out, yes there are a few emotional moments in the movie. And finally, If you did not get anything else out of this review, know this: Fast & Furious 6 is Truly a Great film for its genre. Everyone should see this movie and if you are a fan of the franchise like myself, you are in for one Awesome surprise.<br />And even though we still have quite awhile until Fast 7 hits theaters, It is on my highly anticipated list already. Vin Diesel and the crew will be going up against one surprising yet great addition to the cast. He is a very familar action star; a damn good one at that. His name is..........well you'll see.<br /><br />5 stars
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I am a big fan of Smash!  It's a musical in a TV show.  I can't believe they cancelled it after two seasons!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|J.J. Abrams really does know sci fi. Boys and Girls, Star Trek Into Darkness is excellent. The visuals, the sound, the story, and more importantly the realism to the world of Star Trek Into Darkness.  For the most part, we have the usual characters comprised of Chris Pine as Captain James Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock (he was born to play this character) , Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and Karl Urban as Bones (hilarious). They all did great. There are new additions including a very gorgeous blonde Alice Eve as Carol Marcus. But the surprise standout performance definitely goes to Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison or for you familar Trekkies, Khan. He has the eyes, the personality, the stance, and the voice that you would want your villan to have in this movie. I expected the sequel to be just enough to be better than the 2009 remake, but Star Trek Into Darkness took what was already good in the 2009 reboot, and made an even better sequel. I am an avid sci-fi fan, and this is one for the ages in my opinion. The story line is good. After the first 30-45 mins of the movie I thought the main focus for the movie would be Kirk to prove that he is still worthy to be called Captain, but it is not. The film goes deeper than that. But in short, It is sensationally terrific.<br />My closing remarks for this review will be: Star Wars Episode 7 is in excellent hands, and without a doubt, it will be great. And once again, Star Trek Into Darkness DELIVERS!!<br /><br />5 Stars
B0002VFXFE|4.0|As a novice, I was taking everything very carefully.<br />Did my research, bought some tools, hardware, software and this product.<br /><br />Recently updated an old laptop.<br />Dell Inspiron 1525 Vista 32bit.<br />Slapped in some new memory, new OS W7 and new processor.<br /><br />That old laptop is now buzzing around with much better performance.<br />Should have done it a long time ago.<br /><br />Of course, I gave it away to my aunt since I purchased a new laptop.<br /><br />Almost kept it though. :)
B0089LOG02|5.0|First book that I have read in a while that kept my interest from start to finish. What a great auther
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I waited a year to jump on the GOT bandwagon. Friends kept bugging me to read the books and watch the first season. At that point, the 2nd season was in full swing.<br /><br />So I purchased the book set and burned through those large volumes. Just incredible writing!<br />Loved the depth of each character and given the amazing writing, each character had some memorable lines.<br /><br />Then I jumped into the series. HBO has not disappointed. Of course, due to time constraints, the tv series moves faster than the books did in pace. But if you're a fan of both, you really are so glad to see this in both mediums.<br /><br />To those who are still weary of jumping in, let me just say that you won't regret it.<br /><br />Just a piece of advice:<br /><br />If you think this will have a happy ending, then you haven't been paying attention.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Like it! I like to be walking around the house with no-cable with a powerful sound!<br />Now I can hear music like never before!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it! The costumes and sets are fabulous, the acting is great. I really enjoy watching British TV series.
0439023521|5.0|the must definitely read kind of book!! got it as a gift for my boss and he loved it as well :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This a very fun game if your bored and looking to pass the time it is very enjoyable and its free which make the game even better
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|This short story is cleverly tied to the author's novel 'The Gordonston ladies dog walking club'. The focus is towards Oscar night and one of the nominees for best actor in his role as one of the characters in a film adapted from the phenomenally-successful novel--you guessed it, The Gordonston ladies dog walking club. The story is carried by Terry Sparkes, a has-been actor who admires and envies the nominated Sir Michael Brookes. Unbeknownst to him he's the person instrumental in Brookes becoming the top actor he is today.<br /><br />The story is terrifically told with the crescendo towards the denouement steadily building.<br /><br />Well worth reading and not dependent on having read the novel, although it may well spur you to do so.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book started off good and held your attention the whole way through with a surprise ending. Makes you think.
B005JPXLCU|3.0|It was probably my fault that I didn't know it was going to be so small.  I had seen the regular size books and liked them so when theses came and  I realized they did not have all the pages as the larger one I was disappointed.
B002BY77CW|2.0|It was ok. I liked how it was really easy to read. It was like watching tv. Nice job Lauren!
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|My husband and I are both pinball fans, and these tables are fun. It took over a week of playing to get good high scores. Sound effects and graphics are cool, and true to the movies. Recommend for anyone looking for a fun, licensed pinball game that isn't too easy.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swift Key is great! It's as if it can read my mind, and it always knows what I'm TRYING to say.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is very good. The best of all camera apps. I love it. I'm glad that I found this app.
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|Jessica Chastain was excellent in this film - she's immensely watchable, and the whole film was quite good until the last 15 minutes.  It wasn't what happened at the end as much as how it happened.  Way too much was crammed into the ending for my tastes.  I was thoroughly entertained until all \\"that fur started to fly\\".  3.5 stars would be about right for this film.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read this book in less than a day. It was impossible for me to put down. It made me realize that even the smallest things you do can snowball into something way bigger. We don't always know how much of an effect the things we do have on other people. This book has inspired me to try to be a better person and be nice to everyone, because you never know what else they could be dealing with. Everyone needs to read this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like how the game gives you different quest to complete to keep you envolved. good way to pass time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had fun and really good story line but I hope the next addition keeps this story line going. I wish there where more rooms I just didn't want to stop. It's just awesome and great job to Fireproof Games
B000002WPH|5.0|I read some negative reviews regarding quality of the pressing but I could not notice any of this, really glad I bought it.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|This was ok for a rental, but it's really not worth a second watch, and they knew it. For the longest time, this and Zero Dark Thirty could not be resold here.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I had been reading all of the Kate Morton books.  This was my last one, of the four she has written.  Although I still think it was a really good book, it was my least favorite too.  I really enjoy the format this author uses, just when you think you are going to find 'that one thing' out the next chapter is decades later/earlier.  At the same time, there are other things that you learn right away and she spends chapters explaining how that came to be.  This book was not a let down in that respect.  I just had a harder time getting in to this one, but once I did I enjoyed it as much as the others.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It was an adventurous story about a boy who embarks on a quest for gold and treasure and he ends up finding it and returns home safely as to Captain Silver be is never to be seen again
B005C9YZIW|5.0|beautiful beautiful beautiful....this show is enchanting and mesmerizing....and who wouldn't want to sit and listen to David Attenborough all day with amazing images of nature???
B001G8XON0|5.0|The music, the story line, everything in this movie is perfect, it is very interesting from beginning to end, 100% recommended
B006FE83UE|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC IN IT SELF. THE EXTRAS ARE GOOD TO.MR. PECK GIVES TALKS ABOUT HIS MOVIES AND THIS ONE<br />  THE ACTRESS WHO PLAYED THE GIRL SHOWS UP IN PART OF THE EXTRAS.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Funny and romantic, i think boys and girls would like it the same, a bit un-realistic but that what makes it hilarious
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I bought the first season a couple of months ago from Walmart and I thought it was alright but I decided to watch season two--- I had already watched a few episodes here and there --- and I was instantly drawn into the story. There are some plot holes in the story line but it felt more thought out than the first season and I loved how you begin the season with the strict and cruel Sister Jude but end with a woman who has been through hell and back only to get what she had been searching for her entire life: family and happiness. With that said, I can not wait for season three!!
B000F9RB8A|5.0|I loved it, i you are considering getting this i would recommend you to see Shaolin Soccer, both will make you laugh a lot
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a very good book. Nicholas Sparks is a great writer and I've read many of them and I think this one is in the top 5.
B008P9M614|5.0|It is house, what else do i have to say, one of the best series i have ever seen and for sure a good one to have in my collection
147674355X|5.0|WOW! Had to wait a few hours to review this one. I read it in two sittings yesterday and into today. I did not want to put it down. Colleen Hoover, I bow at your feet. So totally not what I expected after reading Slammed and Point of Retreat. Much different, but still absolutely riveting. The swerves, well, I only got taken by one of them and half taken by another. Loved the characters and all of their stories. I don't want to say anything that might spoil the story for anyone so I will just say, you must experience this story.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer left me wanting the next book as I could not put this one down and it was so worth the wait.
1476715904|5.0|My first Colleen Hoover read.  It was a wonderfully written story that made my heart want to explode at times.  I loved the story of Will and Layken.  Some wonderful life lessons.  This book could be enjoyed by girls as young as 13/14 without parental fears of being overexposed to mature content.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This was the best game I have ever played in my life I don't think I'll ever play another game like it. Let's just say it is AWESOME!!
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|Nice game...<br />would like to be able to obtain different weapons..and would like to be able to fly around a bigger house with more things in it..and maybe a radar to see your enemy.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I loved this book it was hilarious and sweet and great and John green needs to write more books before I explode!
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|It's just to early to tell if this app really works or not. I've only Had it 2 weeks and really haven't noticed any real change in performance on my kindle fire tablet.
B004TMPJP6|2.0|i was attracted by the sync between devices that didn't require a 3rd party, as other programs. unfortunately the todo list function isn't there yet. A really useful todo list has facility for subtasks that are treated the same as main tasks, since they are equally important; have their own start/due dates, notes fields, etc. in wunderlist, you could just as easily enter subtasks in the notes field for the main task. the subtasks don't have any more facility than that (well, they do have a check box).  You should be able to sort on due dates, next tasks, etc, regardless of whether an item is a main task or \\"sub\\"task.  they all are equally important when getting things done.<br />I can't comment on how well the syncing function works, since when i saw the deficiency in the program, i didn't complete the registration or install on other devices.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great album of Kelly Clarkson's hits. Sounds good a it came with Amazon MP3s on them all. Put on the headphones and rock out!
B0042XA2U4|4.0|This book was ok. Cute in some parts, cheeses in others. I was a bit disappointed in the ending though....
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Nice CD of Garths hits. No mp3s of Garths songs, even if you buy em. I like his music, but he needs to re-examine his sales model. He's losing a lot of new fans.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It's a cord.....what else is there to say? I just wish that it was a little longer. Perfect for Kindle Fire
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|A fun game.. Objectives will make you want to keep playing even though each match is kind of similar other than more difficult Ai.
0439023521|5.0|This book was a used book but came in perfect condition!! We have seen the movie and my son wanted the book.  Excellent buy!!
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|I read the book and wanted to see the movie. The movie was delivered quickly and the quality was great but I did not like the movie itself. It was disjointed. The book jumped around and I guess they had no choice but to make the movie the way they did but I feel like they left out a lot of details that left those who hadn't read the book in the dark. My husband had a hard time following it. Also they changed some things from the book to the movie. That is common but I wish they hadn't done it in this instance. In the book some parts, especially the end of Somni-451's story are slightly more poignant. Honestly if you read the book and have not yet seen the movie go get it for 15$ at Target or wait til it goes to Netflix or something.
B003NB8KE6|5.0|Looking for some support for soreness and recovery as I ramp up on training a few more times a week. Was looking at a few other brands and tried them on at my local store, these felt the best right away. I was not experiencing any serious pain just some soreness in my calves after long runs.<br /><br /> After having a few weeks to try them out I am really impressed. I like wearing them after a long run or bike, the guidance is to wear them for at least 3 hours at a time, but they are comfortable enough that I generally just wear them overnight as well. They are also flexible enough to wear them under your normal clothes if you need a little support the day after. They have a little extra space of non-compressed material in the crotch like a pair of long johns which definitely helps make them more comfortable for extended periods unlike most of the non-recovery tights.<br /><br /> Overall they have a nice fit and feel good even after wearing them overnight or for a full day at the office under you clothes. Would definitely recommend for anyone doing any training, it is amazing how much better they make your legs feel, you will not be disappointed.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Good movie. Not as great as Iron Man 1 or Iron Man 3, but decent nonetheless. I got it on blu-ray and the quality was great and Amazon sent it out quickly.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like it a lot! Fun and various ways to play. My fun passer of time and entertainment. Get it now.
0375507256|5.0|Good book. Some chapters (especially those about Zachary) are harder to read because of the dialects involved, and I read often. It took me longer than usual to finish considering its size. Don't bother with the movie though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has awesome decor. I love all the details. Just looking at the game is interesting. But playing the game is more fun.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|Watchmen is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. I originally ordered it on blu-ray but I could only find the director's cut which is not nearly as good as the theatrical cut. Those editors did their jobs. Would LOVE a blu-ray version of the theatrical cut.
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|If you are a Thin Lizzy fan you should get this. Scott Gorham is still putting together great songs as he did in the Thin Lizzy days. The guitar parts are for the most part awesome, with a lot of dual harmonies. Ricky Warwick has a great voice we can all hear, but his lyrics are what puts him over the top to be fronting this band. I like the whole album and have found myself rocking out to it in very much the same way as I do to Thin Lizzy. 'Kissing the Ground' is a really good song - the beginning of the solo almost has a 'waiting for an alibi' type of feel. 'Someday salvation' sounds like 'do anything you want to' or something like that with the bouncy drum patterns. So yeah I could see Philip Lynott singing along to music like this in a modern day incarnation of Thin Lizzy. Sadly we can't always get what we want, but Warwick does an honorable job. The album has all the elements of a good rock and roll album. This band is what the music scene has been needing for a long time. This album far exceeded my expectations as there will never be another band that can live up to Thin Lizzy in my opinion but it's still pretty good and worth owning. Scott Gorham, from a production/song writing point of view is one of the most underrated guitarists ever.
B00785P2QC|4.0|You can spend a lot of time playing this game. It is fun and free. One of the better games out right now. Try it out.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Really surprised by this one. Very entertaining fantasy adventure. Good performances all around and some pretty impressive scenery and special effects (though the giants could've looked a little better, but I'll take what I can get). Definitely worth watching if your into the old tale.
B009A9SULS|5.0|I love my Kobo mini because of its small size and its long battery life which decreases quickly with wi-fi use.  True, it does not have a backlight but I bought it for using at the pool over the summer.  My original ereader still works quite well and is in color but its battery life is only two hours.  So, the mini does what I need it to do.  The speed is a little slow and the browser leaves much to be desired.  The e-ink screen is great because I can read it in bright sunlight which is something that is virtually impossible with my sharper image literati ereader because it has a lcd screen.  All in all, I love my Kobo mini because it has gotten me back to reading again and which is something I have not done in a while because of being in nursing school.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|If you're one of those people who think that the action film has sunk like the Titanic, gone the way of the dodo bird and disappeared like the Edsel (older folks will understand that reference), don't give up hope.  Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his return to the screen in what can only be called a fun-filled, action romp where you know the good guys are going to win and the bad guys will get what they have coming to them.  The fun is in watching it get done.  This one harkens back to when Chuck Norris, Arnold, Sylvester Stallone and others took a great deal of delight in dispatching the bad guys with tongue firmly planted in cheek, all the while making it look serious.<br /><br />\\"The Last Stand\\" isn't one of those movies that's going to make you think a lot and it's going to make you sad to see some beautiful cars get destroyed, but for 107 minutes it certainly keeps you entertained and isn't that what a movie is supposed to do?  Lots of blood, guts, body parts, bullets flying everywhere and not a single moment of gratuitous sex tossed in - yep, not a single second of nudity or semi-nudity but with a movie like this, who needs it?<br /><br />It's a return to yesterday's action flicks and let's hope Arnold decides to make some more.  He certainly doesn't look like someone in their late 60's and is surely good for at least one more romp through action-movieland.  Get it, enjoy it, you'll be glad you did!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Definitely a page Turner. Would recommend to any one interested in a true mystery. Can't wait to read the next book
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Only 98 pages, so a quick read. Very timely theory concerning the relationship between the economy, employment, and the rapid advancement of technology. Plausible explanations for the slow recovery from the most recent economic downturn. I wish I shared the author's view that \\"all will be well\\" eventually.
0770437400|5.0|I have a HUGE library containing every genre imaginable. And World War Z is the ONE book that STILL haunts my nightmares, 3 years after I read it. I worked through the book twice over the period of a week. It is one of those damn books where, it is 3 am, you can barely keep your eyes open and yet, you keep saying, \\"Just one more chapter.\\" I can QUOTE sections of the book and some parts really crawl in deep and creep me out. The warning message between doctors when \\"patient Zero\\" is found in Dachang, the poor little redheaded girl living in a mental istitution and her mimicing the moan of zombies that scare everyone who hears it, the ex wrestler accomplished zombie hunter who folds  and cries because of the scent of an overturned truck of cheap perfume.And the monkey who chatters at the Indian guy and then pisses right in his face. Dead monkey.Zombies scratching on the hull of a submarine. This is the single creepiest book I have EVER read. And i have read Shelley's Frankenstein, Stoker's Dracula, Clive Barker, Stephen King, Poe, Lovcraft. This story is the nastiest, spookiest one of all. And why? Because you follow the Zombie Apocalypse from the beginning to the end, and how individuals met and won against overwhelming odds.By making it personal, by going into the minds and lives of every day people, Max Brooks weaves a story that literally has crawled into my nightmares more nights then I want to count.I truly HATE Max Brooks for writing this book, because I now have to see the movie and they are going to DESTROY it. And, I now know that Max is the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft? He is as talented with horror as his parents are in comedy and drama. BUT, damn, MAX, maybe do something more like your mother? Brooksfilms could use your talent,Fatso, Elephant Man, The Fly were all excellant work. Or maybe a little comedy? I have every Brooks comedy released on dvd and the rest scammed off cable on vhs.But, ENOUGH ZOMBIES! Because, if you put out another book like World War Z, I am NEVER going to get any sleep. And then I will have to hunt you down and beat you senseless with a sock full of nickels. John Ira Russell aka Dr Bedlem
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my kids when they were young and have continued to give it to new parents.  I still cry when I read it.  So sweet.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|This story has a young woman with a sweet and pure heart facing the challenges that superficial and shallow friendships can bring and opposing them with friends who are sure and constant.  Austen's flippant characters are much like people we all associate with.  We tolerate their inconstancy out of being polite, and sorrow as they get themselves into greater difficulties.  But we also rejoice with friends who truly care for us, and enjoy seeing her describe such friendships in her books.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Not much I can say about this book except this: It is flat out one of the best memoirs I've ever read. I won't recap the story line or give details about the Cheryl Strayed's magnificent journey across the Pacific Crest Trail or her own journey into her \\"heart of darkness.\\" I will say that Strayed is a brilliantly talented writer. Girl can write. Damn can she write. I've waited my whole life to read her words and hear her writer's voice. She will be a force for women writers going forward, and I cannot wait to read more of her work. Enough said. Read it. Live it. Love it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I really liked how it's just like the movie. And how fun it is having the character that Steven Tyler plays in the game.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|The screen is so small (I guess it would have to be) that I'd rather be using a smartphone and the wifi... but the 4 second delay on the wifi is another story. At least with the LCD you can frame up a shot in real-time.<br /><br />4 stars for value vs. cost.<br /><br />My main justification for this is the times where I won't have a phone on me... or when I want to toss the cam to somebody else and they can see what they're shooting.
B008B68IUY|5.0|Very nice car! You can put two dolls. Well and firmly packed. Thank you. The baby is very pleased at.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love this programme am completely addicted to it.Have to play it every day or I get withdrawal symptoms.Drives my husband mad.
193700788X|4.0|I've read all the books and couldn't wait to finally read the last book.  I enjoyed the entire series but when I finished reading the last book I was hoping for a different ending.  Now...  don't get me wrong it was still a good book  and the ending made sense,  I just envisioned the ending to go differently.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|A little easy, but very welldone... a fun litle time waster that can get addictive. Similar to Cut the Rope or the like, it has a timesuck that is pleasant and fun.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Quit reading and get it. It's.free for a reason- cause it's fun as hell!! I'm thoroughly addicted to this game and a dinosaur lover
B003DT194G|5.0|Great musical composition and very suspenseful story. Love the train station opening. Henry Fonda was amazing as a BAD guy. There are a few seemingly useless scenes but they don't detract from the good too much.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Nothing new in this game compared to previous, does not even worth to try and better find some other funier games.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What an enduring story with such richness and depth. It'll have you laughing & crying. I very highly recommend it.
B008IZ62IS|5.0|\\"Dexter\\" is my favorite show on Showtime, and this next season is going to be the last one, I think.  I've used this app to catch up on all the shows that I missed, starting with Season 1.  I can put in my earplugs and just watch it on my Kindle Fire while my husband watches whatever reality show he wants.  This particular season, Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks, was the \\"bad guy\\", and for a long time it didn't seem like he was really that bad - but he was!!  \\"Dexter\\" is pretty gory and definitely R rated, but I love the show and the bits of humor that are thrown in!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so good i love it the game changes as you level up so your not doing the same thing over and over and over again
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I had tried a couple of other piano apps on my iPhone, and didn't like them at all.  This one is pretty good, especially since it does have more than one octave.  But, let's face it, it's not really a piano, and playing it just isn't something I do very often.  I mainly got it so I could pick out some notes on sheet music, and it does work well for that.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It's nice for a middle schooler or something like that........ it's sort of  bad because of the upgrade costing something, why don't they let it come with it????:(
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Although I totally enjoyed the movie, I was more than a little &quot;disturbed&quot; that one of the &quot;tasks&quot; of this game was to &quot;challenge&quot; a neighboring community to a battle.  How disturbing is that, considering the &quot;message&quot; from the movie is that  they are &quot;many leaves, one tree&quot;? Nice message.  I also found it &quot;interesting&quot; that my community was &quot;attacked&quot; at some point when &quot;normal play time&quot; is over (i.e., after 9:00 p.m.) or at least for an 8-year-old (which is who I downloaded the game for).  Needless to say, I was disappointed and will be uninstalling this game.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book is awesome and filled with adventure to the very end and it should  deserve 5 stars.  Their life so far may be bad but the movie would be/is great.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Love the music. The characters were so weird, they're lovable. Location was so important to the story line, it would not have worked anywhere else.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing. This is so fun! I like how it changes where you surf! You should totally get this app! It is even better than temple run!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game!  It is just like playing real life bingo....the number you need is hardly ever called!  Hahaha
B005K17RU0|1.0|Upgrade is unstable &amp; frequently drops out when changing screens,  it is incredibly slow,  cumbersome to use,  and has entirely too much data for use in a simple Kindle tablet.  The prior version was much better.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Complex characters, details but not too much police procedural/ excessive beating around the bush.<br />Gillian Flynn has a knack for creating off the wall women.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Two such diverse people who helped each other obtain the best life had to offer.<br />Best movie I've seen in a long time.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|This DVD set is great. The picture quality is obviousyl great because of the Blu-ray but put together very well.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|One of the best star trek movies, I have ever seen. Excellent from start to finish. A must see and a must buy (in blu-ray HD).
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Somehow, I wanted all the characters to live.  Their untimely deaths were worth watching.  They portrayed their characters to the &#34;end&#34;.
0143113100|4.0|Doidge's presentation about the brain's malleability is amazing! It's full of studies and theory on the subject, but each chapter tells a fascinating story of individuals and researchers and their impact on the science of brain plasticity.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|didn't like it at all would please better movies& TV programs on the prime(free shows) please I like to see more of Fringe 5th season for FREE and many others thanks!
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Unbelievably, it's been a quarter century since Agnetha Faltskog has lent her stunning voice to original material, but she has lost none of her exceptional songcraft. Some of the tracks on \\"A\\" are stronger than others, but her deeper, more mature voice shines on songs like \\"When You Really Loved Someone\\", the first single from the album.  And her duet with Gary Barlow (Take That) on Barlow's composition (\\"I Should Have Followed You Home\\") recalls her exceptional talent for harmony, honed with Frida Lyngstad during their ABBA years. I cannot understand Universal's failure to release the Barlow duet as a single.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the first two. This series ended well in my opinion and would greatly recommend it
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Terrible acting - no real plot - awful writing - complete waste of money and time.<br />I am a fan of the last few Die Hard movies - but this one is the worst of the worst.<br />Bruce Willis has no chemistry with his stupid kid, Jai Courtney - how can this stupid kid be an operative of any kind?<br />The joy and humor is lost. There are complete action sequences that are cut together that also make no sense.<br />A 15 minute car chase...what the hell is going on Bruce??
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It did have a good ending, but not a book that I would recommend. Too much info about a football team, over and over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You have to get it!!! its better than temple run or anything alike. You can connect to facebook and compete with ur friendz on facebook. ITS SOO FUN GET IT NOWWW!!! its bo$$ ;)
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is much better then minecraft  because there are real animals that attack you if you hurt them this game rules
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|If you have liked all the Angry Birds so far, you will like this one too. They have created this one for challenging your,  as the name aptly titled friends for online weekly tournaments. This is really geared towards Facebook and inviting people to play as sometimes that is a sore subject, because I know people who hate invitations to play games. There is a practice mode you can play by yourself offline. I give this 4 stars because you play the same boards unless you are in a tournament. So if social is your name, then this is your game!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down, reading til after two in the morning to finish it. Definitely a suspense filled tense thriller. Compelling read. Pulls you in and doesn't let go. Leanne is a craftsman, I like his work as much as a like my favourite  author, Stephen King. And the twist at the end is wonderful.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Even with all the \\"long awaited\\" hype aside there are a number of un-Punk like tracks.  There is even steal guitar (sample or not, does it matter?) on one track.  More an easy listening than the high energy that they used to show.  I don't recommend this album, too bad I did not listen to it first, purchasing it on their earlier material.  Would not have purchased.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Entertainment and laughs abound.  The cut scenes between levels hold true to the characters and the humor of the movies.  Very pleased with this game and have a tough time putting it down.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It was a good movie. Not his best. It looked like they were trying to save money in the production. How about you go for Quality and not greed.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|i thoroughly enjoyed this, it show earth of the future as well ,  i love the secrets in the movie , the characters  were  well acted, but  it is non stop action  which i love. you won't be disappointed.looking forward to more movies, mr . abrams  did a fantastic job and just like the first one he did , were great , he put a new twist on it .
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Although it took me a while to really get hooked, once I did I couldn't put it down and absolutely adored this book.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|This is a very good album with excellent arrangements of classic songs.  His helpers only add to the theme, not detract from it.  Very good choices of friends!  Unlike most albums of this sort, every cut is a keeper.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|When I first heard about Dexter I was appalled by a tv show that glorifies a serial killer and never had any intention of watching it. I saw an episode at a family members house and was instantly hooked. Good acting and suspense. My wife and I just finished season 7 in four nights. I'm going through Dexter withdrawals. Can't wait for season 8.
0718178130|5.0|After reading this book, I'm more than convinced that the 'Asperger narrator' is now a genre of novel. The Rosie Project describes Don a 30-something professor of Genetic s whose social obliviousness must make some kind of record.<br /><br />Simsion, doesn't push too hard on the heart strings, or delve too deeply into emotional issues in the Rosie Project but takes a more humorous approach as he describes Don's attempts to find a wife. Despite the laughs, not once did I feel ASD was being poked fun at, or handles in an insensitive way.<br /><br />The Rosie Project is one of the more satisfying novels I've read for a while, and I haven't rooted so hard for a protagonist to score in my life. I don't usually have much buy in to romantic comedy (or romantic anything really) so I guess what I'm saying is THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Great story and wonderful camera-work. The film was exciting and the main characters convincing and strong. See it again and again<br />Bryan Pokras
1452115567|5.0|It was a huge hit.  Was perfect for her graduation and starting out on a new journey across the country.  Oh, and her name is Maddy, so I asked her to stand on things and take pictures on her westward adventure.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Beautifully produced. Cinamatoghraphy spectacular. Actors were excellent and a fairly good storyline. Main battle scenes were well done and the movie moved on without fluff right up to the end.<br />Bryan Pokras
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Fantastic music!  I only just discovered this group a few months ago, and quite by accident.  They appeared on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.  I was in another room and heard this marvelous voice coming from the t.v.  I quickly went out to see who was the owner of this magnificent voice to see Brittany Howard and her boys performing.  I was hooked!  I then saw them on the Grammy Awards and ordered this album.  I can't wait to hear more from them.
B008JFUP0I|1.0|If you didn't realize this movie was awful after the runway scene. God help you. The first movie was kind of decent because it was down to Earth and tried to depict the street racing culture, etc. Somehow, over the next few movies, this street racing crew has somehow gotten into saving the world. Utterly ridiculous. The movie has become an insult to everyone's intelligence. This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Absolutely no thought was put into the physics of the stunts. The nonsense started in the last one with the bank vault scene. It managed to get worse in this film. The masses are a little bit slow, but it will take another movie before they start to figure out that these movies aren't worth going to see anymore.<br /><br />Funny thing is too, for a movie that prides itself on depicting street culture, it got London all wrong. Almost every English person in the movie is stuck-up or evil. You can count on one hand all the minorities that are shown in London. It's really sad that the crew didn't bother to interact with any of the East Indians, Africans, Caribbean people, Arabs, Bangladeshis and other ethnic people that greatly inhabit London now. I think they entered London with this impression that it was like Downton Abbey and just ran with it. What a missed opportunity.<br /><br />I won't be watching the next one, even if I'm bored.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is one of the few apps that I purchased, basically wanting a handy calculator.  As a one time engineer, I really liked the way it offers 4 function calculations in the portrait mode on my Kindle Fire 7 and then switches to scientific (yes it does sines and cosines ) by rotating to the landscape mode.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is one of the deepest I've played in a long time.  If you like story you're in for a treat.  However if you're the more action oriented gamer then you might be a little bored in some parts of this game.<br /><br />This game cycles kind of between being an exploration/ character development and then action.  It's an interesting mix that I enjoyed deeply.  This game reminds me more of the old school JRPG's then a lot of newer titles have.  Even though I guess technically this is an older game.<br /><br />Anyway, controls and gameplay are great and the sound / music never get's old.  Be warned though.  This game does get difficult.  I did not find the difficulty jump on par with a Dragon Quest, but it's definitely more difficult than most other casual games.
B009ME47H2|5.0|This mike has a great sound.  There is a click when you start and stop it and it is sensitive to holding it.  The mic stand slot would work well to hold it.  The lite sound editor included gives you basic sound editing (removing the start and stop clicks for example).  Obviously having the dual microphones as close as they are reduces the ability to record stereo but for a lot of voice applications it is not a problem.
B00130UFY2|4.0|No surprise, the end of the trilogy brings Jason Bourne back to the beginning of how he became Jason Bourne. Good conclusion to the trilogy and a must-see if you've already seen the first two.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This downloader only permits you to download the songs that youtube is offering, probably for a fee.  The ability to actually find a song you want (Patsy Cline - Crazy) doesn't exist as far as I can determine.<br /><br />The old saying that nothing is free is true here.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|An interesting look at history.  However, tends to be slow and dark.  Focus on issue we knew little about, the battle for the 13th amendment.
B003DXSXCI|5.0|I know it is old, but I really like this movie.  Good acting, great plot and very good music.  This is a classic.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|A great movie. I had saw this before and knew that my brother would love it as a birthday gift!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is probably the most scariest game in the apps store. Slender man in this game is awesome looking when th you see him. The buzzing on the screen can nervraccing yet anoying.IT IS AN AWESOME GAME  (Tyler Evan Suter)
0385474547|5.0|This was required reading in a college class I had many years ago.  There is a reason it was required reading.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Very fun don't worry about graphics don't matter game play and story worth it the items you can get are very cool it'
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game! It is fun challanging fun for the whole family! When I pick it up I can't put it down!! It don't cost money to play and that's the best thing!! I really like the different back grounds! And the change all the time!! Never a dull moment in this game!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I like the complex storylines and surprises of the Christopher Nolan movies. This one does not upset. I wish the Amazon rentals lasted more than 2 days because I felt rushed to watch this movie.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|An eye opener for the curious mind seeking intellectual challenges and questioning faith. Arguments are well thought and presented with style.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. It is a city building game with the characters from the movie Epic
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This movie had a couple of unexpected plot twists, and I wish there were more similar-type movies. I would recommend it.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I like the app but you can't delete anything.  I downloaded and set up the app while I was out of town and I want to delete that city and make my place of residence my current location...it won't let me do that. :(
B005FISBTO|5.0|As Dexter tries to balance his life of being a single parent with channeling his dark passenger, he begins to feel the overwhelming stress and becomes a little reckless. Despite warnings of caution by his late father Harry, Dexter plunges ahead to find and destroy the Doomsday Killers, who try to bring about the end of the world by re-enacting literally the tableaus found in the Book of Revelation..<br />I have been hooked on Dexter since I received Season 1 as a gift this past summer and have been devouring each seaon to catch up to the finale of Season 8. I have been pulled in by each of the characters and their strengths and weaknesses. I now see Dexter's dark passenger taking on a bigger role, as Michael c. Hall demonstrates so well in his acting and facial expressions. I worry about Deborah, going forward, how she handles the challenges she faces.<br />I have recommended Dexter to everyone I know, but it is not for the squeamish!!
0307944689|5.0|Meets my requirements. The only thing I don't like its the type of paper used for the prints. Love it!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I do a lot of traveling and carry an alarm clock that makes the same sleep sound as this app.  Now I don't have to pack my clock.  This one will do much more than an alarm clock.
B000000HSU|5.0|one of the best punk bands ever hardcore at its finest if u like similar type music u will love this
B004GFN11A|4.0|The WordPress app is a lifesaver. I've used other apps to publish my blog in the past, but this is the only one that does everything I need it to do. If I'm away from home, or even just away from my computer, this app can get everything done to get my thoughts out into the world on time and fresh. I don't think I could live without it anymore.
1616550414|5.0|My boyfriend is a huge Legend of Zelda fan. I got him this book on a hunch he'd like it. I mean, why wouldn't he, right? When I gave him this book for his birthday, he flipped out in joy. He said it was the best gift out of all the ones he received. So, if you're considering getting this for a Legend of Zelda fan, it's the right choice.
B000001ESF|5.0|Rush is always underrated. 2112 is probably one of the greatest albums of all time. I think it's a shame that Rush was one of those truly great bands that was lost to time in the culture. I've noticed some signs of them reemerging in the modern culture, and that excites me. Not nearly enough people have heard them to appreciate how good they are.<br /><br />2112 is probably the best album they have, but that's one of those things that's a matter of taste, I imagine. In my opinion, it's the best album to intro new listeners with.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Easy to use, works right out of the box, improves volume, improves sound quality. I had the e5 but lost it, this is even better.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This classic tale is the best long distance car chase ever. Man machine and a determend fow. Spend a little time and fall in love with muscle cars again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really liked it. I was thrilled she ended up with Sam. I was hopeing all through the series they would get together.I am realy sad it is ending though.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Great movie. Would recommend watching. A movie I can watch over and over again. It has a twist at the end.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|When the product arrived, it wasn't connecting properly to the power port in my car.  Eventually, I was able to get it to work by moving it around and positioning just right.  I would have to do this each time.  I received an unsolicited email from the company asking what I thought of their product.  When I responded with the above concerns, they immediately apologized and sent me a second unit without having to return the original.  The new one works great.  The true measure of a company is not whether they make mistakes, but how they respond to mistakes and this was the perfect response.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|Mika has perfect pitch and beautiful tone and clarity.  His songs are fun to listen to and the music is beautiful
B0070DOHQS|1.0|Did not do what I was hoping for so I uninstalled it. May work ok for you just did not for me,
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I must say that this is a difficult one, each and every character held their own. This one goes to the collection series vip status.
B00BEJOMIW|3.0|I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie again.  My husband and I remembered it as one of our favourites from the past.  However, during the movie, I kept on thinking that something was missing and my husband is convinced that a good part of the story was cut out of this version.
B0068FZ0YM|5.0|Just Purchased a Sony 3D Blu-Ray Player and wanted to have the Blu-ray version. Great acting and story. I like this movie very much.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app every day!  I absolutely love it.  It is far more accurate than my local weather report, especially in the 10-day forecast.  I get alerts for bad weather as well as high allergen levels in my area.  I can load other cities' weather across the country, or in other countries, to keep on eye on those areas, too.  I really enjoy the background screen, which reflects sunny skies, cloudiness, starry nights, etc.  It's simply fabulous.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|this is very good for young girls and it is free Wichita means its just the right price definatly a great thing to do with your girl.on a rainy day
B006FE83UE|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit that I'd never seen this film.  It was awesome!  I found it to be a mirror of our governance today.  People lying, people looking out for their own self-interests instead of the &#34;underdog&#34;, people making back-room deals instead of being fair and ethical, people letting prejudice rule their decisions rather than clear, level-headed thinking.  I think every member of society should see this in 2013 and ask themselves, Why has nothing changed over the years?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A fantastic homage to the 1980s - all dimensions: music, movies, toys, games, pop culture... all wrapped-up into a fabulous, contemporary riff on yesterday's great cyberpunk novels.  This quickly displaced longtime favorites as one of my all-time favorite light reads.<br /><br />Also, a GREAT showcase of Amazon's Whispersync for Voice.  I bounced back & forth between the [passionately read by no less than Will Wheaton] audiobook, Kindle app on my phone, and e-ink Kindle device.  Magically, they all kept in-sync.  Amazing!  The future of reading.  (...to activate this feature, just use your Amazon ID to log-in to Audible.com).<br /><br />But - regardless of how you choose to experience it, it was an incredibly fun read.  Can't recommend enough.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|a love story like ive never read before. incredible and breathtaking. i couldnt put it down! an absolutely amazing book!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is well written and kept my interest through the entire book. I highly recommend reading this before you read &#34;The Hit&#34;

B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's about time that the creators of this game created a local multiplayer, I've been playing with my two younger brothers nonstop, or online and dying.  If they can I would suggest that the creators make it so you only fight players around your level, it'd be good practice and gives actual chance for anyone.

B0010SEMP0|4.0|It's commonplace for romance novels to have an adventure story as their framework, and it's similarly common for adventure novels to have romance as a significant subplot.  Jeaniene Frost gives the two parts a more equal weighting, creating novels that don't clearly lean to one specific genre, but need to be considered as a cross between both.  Only readers who are fans both of fantasy adventure stories and also of steamy romances will properly appreciate this series.  Those who are fans of just one of those two genres (whichever it is) may get frustrated by the amount of time and attention given to the other genre.<br /><br />As a romance novel, the sex scenes are much too detailed for my taste.  The author doesn't seem to have realized that less is more, and that such a scene can be far more compelling if there's at least something left to the reader's imagination.  This series (at least the first couple novels of it -- all I can comment on so far) doesn't allow any involvement by the reader's imagination.  Every slightest movement or sensation is described at great length in pornographically explicit detail.  Steamy, yes, and I guess some readers may like that, but for me it just makes that aspect of the book fall rather flat.<br /><br />I found the book far more compelling, however, as a fantasy adventure novel.  Even there, however, there were issues with it.  Some are minor enough to just come across as odd.  (For instance, in at least a couple different passages the author uses the word \\"translate\\" as though it were a synonym for \\"understand\\", which of course it isn't, and neither of those passages involved anything being translated.)  More significantly, there are numerous inconsistencies in the story:<br />* A series of events that occur early in the book are brought up later in the book as having been two years ago.  Yet later still, they're said to have occurred just three months ago.  (Based on all the events in between and the time they're said to havetaken, the \\"two years\\" version fits better than the \\"three months\\" version, yet the three month duration is significant to its portion of the story despite being inconsistent with the rest of the story.)<br />* The group makes a daring plan to deal with an enemy, but then changes part of that plan.  The strange thing is that they still go through with the most dangerous aspect of the original plan despite it serving no purpose in the new plan.<br />* A character gasps in amazement at the stunning revelation of something that she's known all along (and in fact was present when it happened).<br />* In a room full of vampires, one vampire accuses another of actions which, though illegal by human law, shouldn't be any issue by vampire law.  These accusations are quite unaccountably taken seriously, although no reason is given as to why they would be.<br />* The most troublesome inconsistency occurs in the climactic chapter.  Without getting into spoilers, I can only say that it involves a wager placed on the outcome of a contest.  The outcome of the contest is very clear, and the winner receives the prize agreed upon.  Yet just moments later, the loser of that wager claims rights to what he would have won had he won the wager, and accuses another of trying to steal it from him.  The remainder of the chapter is a series of back and forth one-upmanship regarding what types of claims have precedence over what other types of claims.  Yet at no point does anyone point out the obvious fact that the loser of that wager had no claim on its prize in the first place.<br /><br />With so many inconsistencies, it somewhat surprises me that I could enjoy this book as much as I did.  Yet the writing is vivid, the story is gripping, the characters are well-fleshed out, and throughout it kept me eager to read what happened next.  Objectively, I should probably knock off one star for the way the romance was handled and another for all the inconsistencies, and so give this book just a three-star rating.  But in the end \\"I like it\\" is more accurate than \\"It's OK\\", so I'm going to go ahead and boost my rating to four stars.  And now I'm going to go buy the next book in the series.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app. I have used it extensively. You can read the Bible in just about any version you want. It also provides daily, weekly, or monthly lessons of all kinds. You can bookmark where you left off, and it will tell you what you need to catch up on (if you haven't been in for a while). You can also highlight and make notes wherever you want. It even has an audio read, and the voices are pleasant. Some lessons even have videos.

B000FC13Y0|4.0|Near perfect! Everything about this book is enchanting. The end of the book made me sad though. I prefer the movie ending to the book ending but that is the only thing I'd change about the book. No offense Mr. Gaiman.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I sometimes think Tom Cruise plays caricatures of a type of character.  In this movie I saw his acting skills be used in such a way that I didn't feel like I was watching Tom Cruise.  I felt like I was watching Jack Reacher, who-ever he turned out to be.  I am not familiar with the book series so I came to it free of preconceived notions.  As a movie it was very entertaining and well done- I was intrigued the whole time and although there is violence it was not the kind that made me [offended?]- To be honest I had to watch it over again to follow the details of the plot- but I enjoyed doing that!!

0893860468|5.0|I AM THAT, Talks with Nisargadatta Maharaj<br />Translated by Maurice Frydman<br />Revised and edited by Sudhakar S. Dikshit<br /><br />I was 18 the first time I bought I AM THAT, but I was 39 before I was able to read it.  For this reason, I thought I might give a little advice about how to keep company with this book, a very beautiful and peculiar one, and unlike any other.<br /><br />You will find your own way, as many others have before you.  After all, this is the favorite book of many of the strangest people you will ever meet.  In fact, there appear to be a significant number of people who do nothing, except read this book, and then accost strangers in caf&eacute;s to tell them about it.<br /><br />If you are new to this way of thinking, and you wish to read I AM THAT, or are struggling to read it now, it would help tremendously to first read a friendly introduction to Advaita Vedanta.  Nothing too ethereal, steer clear of the Neo-Advaitins for now, perhaps Arthur Osbourne's Ramana Maharshi and the Path of Self-Knowledge , or any basic text on the life and teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi.  Sri Ramanasramam publishes a great number of useful books.  Aim for something rooted in the life of a person, preferably someone long-dead, and not a rarefied philosophical summary.<br /><br />If you seek a living teacher, please be wary.  These teachings have been commodified to a degree difficult to believe.  Advaita is now big business.  Genuine teachers are available, but you'll need your wits about you!<br /><br />Above all, if you are struggling to read I AM THAT, I suggest abandoning a front-to-back reading for hopscotch.  (I do not doubt some people have attained enlightenment while hopscotching around this book.)<br /><br />Where to begin?  I suggest Chapter 48: Awareness is Free.  Then turn to the chapters which focus on Sri Nisargadatta's own experience, such as chapters 57 and 78.  Then you could turn to chapters which address essential matters in the clearest possible way, such as Chapter 25: Hold on to `I AM', or Chapter 70, renouncing desire, or Chapters 95 and 8 on inner peace and cultivating acceptance.<br /><br />Besides this, I found it very useful to create, among the end pages of the book, a personal index of what I found most useful and most inspiring.  A combination of reading and rereading is very well-suited to I AM THAT.<br /><br />At some point in the process, you may find your sense of life and yourself and the world disintegrating.  This is normal.  Just take it easy, OK?  Take long walks and, for goodness sake, keep your mouth shut!  Otherwise you'll soon be cornering strangers in caf&eacute;s.  \\"I read the most mind-blowing amazing book.  It's called I AM THAT.  All the mysteries of life are in it!  I think I might be enlightened.  Shouldn't we be sleeping together?\\"<br /><br />The crazy people are not wrong about this book.  The mysteries are indeed here, with stunning clarity and endless determined good humor.  It's an adventure to read I AM THAT.  But if you get stuck, don't feel you have to read it back to front, play hopscotch.le way, such as Chapter 25: Hold on to `I AM', or Chapter 70, renouncing desire, or Chapters 95 and 8 on inner peace and cultivating acceptance.<br /><br />Besides this, I found it very useful to create, among the end pages of the book, a personal index of what I found most useful and most inspiring.

B0041X90D0|5.0|Slider and Electric Warrior are two of my favorite rock albums. But, I cannot stress how important the backup vocals were. Listen to Metal Guru and tell me that those beautiful back up harmonies MAKE THAT SONG SHINE!!!! It's all FLO AND EDDIE!!! OK, at the time they were still just plain ole Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan from The Turtles and The Mothers of Invention, but to me, THEY WERE GODS!!! Get It On was also enhanced by their vocal gymnastics. Once you realize it's them, you will never miss those wonderful vocal sounds that are behind almost all of the tunes. No one ever mentions them and I feel compelled to do so! The Reet loves them with all his Reetian heart!
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I look forward to this show every Sunday! I got this for my sister since she read the books. If you start watching it, you must watch it in order and that's perfect in DVD format.

B001DF68MA|5.0|I love this bike seat. We first started using it when my son was about a year old and are still using it now that he is 20 months. I'd highly recommend it for anyone who can do relatively flat, low-traffic bike rides. I do have to point my feet out to work around the seat, but for easy bike rides that's not a problem. My son loves being on the bike and asks to take rides almost daily. I love the fact that he's in front of me and we can talk while we ride. So much fun!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Contact has been almost a friend to me. Its my go-to movie if I'm feeling nostalgic or needing to ground myself. I love the Science behind it, the adventure of it, Jodi Foster is at her best, and I can admire Matthew McConaughey before he got weird. What's not to love?

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Quell was one of the first games I picked up for my kindle fire, and I snatched up the sequel as soon as it was out.  I've been anxiously awaiting Momento since its inception, and it's every bit as awesome as the first two.  It's the best two bucks I ever spent--a deceptively simple, absolutely gorgeous world, seamless, intuitive gameplay...buy yourself all three of these games, and immerse yourself in a relaxing, yet challenging universe that you won't want to leave.  Quell is a must-have addition to your App collection.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|after reading jims review I was shocked. I am 66 and love the beach boys . I certainly realize their voices are not what they used to be. but this is a delight to listen to . and the songs are representative of many years of great songwriting. so come on jim don't criticize a group that is just doing what they love to do . and with a net worth of 50 million dollars , I don't think mike is just in it for the money.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Reading the reviews I was hoping for a fun action packed movie.  But, I expected it to be not so great.  Let me count the ways...<br /><br />1)  Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher.  Has he read a description from the book?<br />2)  I am going to give Ms. Pike the benefit of doubt and say the writing for her character was a mix between \\"boobs, damsel in distress and deer in the headlights\\".  Her part was pretty awful, delivered in a wooden and non-believing way.  Like, \\"I can't believe these are my lines...really?\\"<br />3)  Cruise as three character faces and they all look about the same now days except for the level of jaw clinch.  I liked him better when he smiled and joked a bit.<br /><br />Not a good script, painful to watch, I found myself blushing throughout in embarrassment for the actors.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me literally laugh out loud! It touched my heart in ways a book has never  been able to accomplish. However, not only did I laugh, but I cried. I bawled. I cried  for over two hours trying to continue to read through my tears. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It hurts and it touches and it uplifts and it takes you out of the world that you think sucks so much, into a world that should be hated and resented, by  instead it's cherished and feverent to be made the most of. Seriously. Read this book.
B00BD62X14|1.0|I was disappointed with this album. The only song I didn't mind was Mon Raymond. The other songs were bland if not boring.

B00992CF6W|4.0|Who doesn't like Minecraft? The only negative thing that I have to say about this app is that playing it on a tablet via touch screen proves to be a bit challenging and at times is increasingly frustrating. It is difficult to control and I have suffered death by zombie more times than I can count simply because I could not move out of the way. My own personal preference would be to play in on a console or on PC, but for $6.99 you can't really go wrong. Especially if you are looking to try the game out and do not want to pay $20 to play it on another medium.

B0063M22QO|5.0|one of my favorites games to play and like the tiles. I like that you can pick how many tiles to match pergame. Alot of fun
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|What a great story .Very different and contemporary. I really didnt want to put titdown. So true and realistically written with some very sad & moving parts.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A book I could read over and over. I can't wait to watch the movie to see how it compares to the book. Books are usually better, so we'll see.
B004OC07GM|5.0|Loved the book, and other reviewers have given my reasons more eloquently than I could.  So I'll just rant about the Kindle: Like so many books I've read on the Kindle, it struggles with layout.  Too often, the referenced tables and diagrams are pages away and without hyperlinks to get you back & forth - requiring too much page flipping.  Less annoying, but also noticeable, is sloppiness with bulletized lists that are so easy to read in a real book.  For whatever reason, the Kindle editions don't include bullets, dashes, etc. to identify each point.  Can't they figure out how people actually read books?
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love playing solitaire and this is a very different spin on the conventional game. You have to really think about all of the moves that you can make
B009R6GN22|4.0|I finished reading this book yesterday, which would have been her 87th birthday. A nice coincidence. There is no plot or story to follow here and it jumps around a little, but it was a fascinating read. Mr. Spoto debunks all the rumor's and conspiratorial nonsense surrounding her life and death and presents a well rounded biography of her career. I never realized what a troubled woman she was and how dependent she was on those who mostly wanted to control her and bath in her limelight. At least two people should have gone to jail over her death. Read the book and figure out who they are.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|This was okay.  I was actually bored with in the first series!  I guess I enjoy knocking things down vs floating around space.
B005NNML6K|2.0|my 30 year old copy has less skips and pops then this &#34; new&#34; one.This is a poor quality reproduction.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|This is a fast paced game and so much fun to play!  I just think it is kind of hard to play on a kindle for someone who has carpal tunnel or maybe stiff hands from arthritis.  However I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys cute peguins and fast paced games.  If anything I think you should at least try this one.  Well worth the time and effort.
B00CTJ7KKS|2.0|This is one TV series that I found impossible to take seriously.  The over-theatrical poses that the leading character struck reminded me of \\"the Coon\\" character from \\"South Park\\" so often that I had to laugh at the silliness of it all.  The plot, the characters, the dialog is all very two-dimensional.  Perfect for a comic book, but not for a TV series.  The most interesting thing about this was guessing the various cityscapes shown throughout the series.  Other amusements were watching Stephen Arnell act just like the Coon, and talk like a character straight out of the SNL \\"the Californians\\" sketch for no apparent reason during the desert island flashback scenes.  If only this comic relief was intentional...<br /><br />Another thing I cant stand is when the SFX is a thousand times louder than the dialog.  Does the dramatic orchestral music score really have to be at ear-bleed levels?
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy this game although it is taking me a while to learn the matching seasons. The suggestions are helpful even though I'd rather not need them.  I would find it easier if I could see the tiles better. Maybe I need to get a larger Kindle. Or glasses. I found free hints-- just touch an unavailable tile and it will dim them all - leaving the playable ones bright.
B0037VNX44|2.0|I really was disappointed by this movie.  It is billed as a man against the system but through out the movie the system worked to help him.  The protagonist (?) was a man with no value to anyone even his family living a pointless existence he was not clever, and always beaten into submission in less then a minute.  Formulaic writing with typical tiresome British dialog.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Is funny, ease to read, with soft action and a quote  of humor.<br />I recomend to young lawyer. Is a good book and you learn about the legal argon
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|How did so many stars get involved in this Lemmon? The movie was hard to understand both because of the storyline and the way the actors had to speak in certain segments. Don't waste your time like I did.
B00AMHFMIG|5.0|I loved how good condision it was in I just absulantly love it hope u get season four in soon
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Victor Hugo's French novel of misery, redemption, and self-sacrifice has been read and re-read by four generations of admirers. Everyone can find some life-altering experience or personality trait embedded within the electic group of characters to compare with their own lives and emotional history.<br />The movie is more of an operatta than a musical since there is mimimal spoken dialogue.  However, the superb acting talent and singing ability exhibited by the star-studded cast (Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Amanda Seyfried, just to name a few) bring this story to life in such a way that the viewer cannot help but become emotionally involved in the unique struggles and pain experienced by each individual character.<br />One need not be familiar with the novel to thoroughly enjoy and understand the storyline portrayed in the movie.  Even though history buffs will already be familiar with the outcome of the student refolution's efforts to overthrow the Napoleonic monarchy and restore the Republic as originally established during the French Revolution, they will not be able to resist cheering on and admiring the heroism and dedication of the young participants and their supporters.

B000VHVGM8|5.0|No matter how many times I see this movie I still crack up! It is one of the best comedies in my estimation. Kevin Kline as Otto is awesome, Jamie Lee Curtis as Wanda in those oh so tight jeans that only she can wear so well,. John Cleese is at his best as the slightly stuffy bumbling lawyer, and Michael as the animal loving  K-K-Ken plays it straight but just has me in stitches. My husband and I often quote lines from this movie at each other!! No matter if you are British or American the humor translate well.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I think pudding monsters is a really fun game. I used to have only minecraft and other crafting games on my kindle,but I thought that I would try something different and now I love this game.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I would recommend this movie for anyone who read the book! Even if you haven't read it, you will still appreciate this film and the message behind it.<br /><br />More book-to-movie adaptations need to be co-directed with the author of the book.  It makes the film that much stronger.

B006MW3UZW|4.0|I really liked this masterpiece. It is a refreshing departure from most of what is being presented in this day and age. The story line is very much believable and relates to what could have happened then and now in real life.  One other good thing, all without vulgarity. I would like very much like to see Season 3 on Prime now. Thanks

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am only 1/3 of the way through this book, and already I do not want it to end.  The writing is so engrossing and colorful, it really puts me \\"in\\" the story. I LOVE this book. Great summer reading.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Adds ,adds, Adds, adds...Too many adds, but okay for free one free one, other I am sure will be okay..try it
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This was a family Christmas gift that was enjoyed by everyone leaving us glued to the screen with the characters right in our laps in vivid 3D that was so stunning. Great story and amazing sound.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|does photos<br />does editing including cropping<br />I am much happier with this app than the last one I bought- MY CAMERA HD
0670020745|5.0|She taught us how the brain works.  Gave us insight into her experience.  I have recommended this book to many who have had stroke victims in their families.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Here's the basics. If you enjoy Robert Downey's acting, or action packed Marvel superhero summer blockbusters, you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Is it better than the original? First, how many sequels are? I enjoyed the original better, but in this case some like this one better. My opinion? I'm not sure if this is as much a sequel to the first Iron Man as it is a set-up for the Avengers, considering the importance of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) and Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) in the plot, not to mention the mention of The Avengers Initiative towards the end.<br /><br />Some people like me are familiar with the Iron Man character from the comic books (in my case, in the mid-seventies). There are differences between the Iron Man I grew up and the one here, such as the appearance and origin of this episode's villain, Whiplash, the skin color of Nick Fury, or that in the old days Tony Stark kept his identity secret except for his inner circle (\\"Happy\\" Hogan, though not Pepper Potts, and including Don Blake/Thor). But if you're not a purist, is this pure escapist fun?<br />Maybe not pure -- it has Tony Stark dealing with some inner demons -- but for the most part, yes.<br /><br />If I had a choice between which to see again between this, the first Iron Man, and the Avengers, this would be an uncontested third place. However, if I go to a friends house and he puts this into the DVD, I'd sit back and enjoy.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book was so detailed I felt like I was in the book. It also made me cry and weep
B009NY43NY|2.0|Totally not what I hoped the last Sookie book would be. There were so many loose ends and confusions. Maybe I need to reread it. Anyone else agree?
B007EE4XKI|4.0|First off, it took me a while to get used to reading star trek rather than watching it. David Mack does an outstanding job of building very convincing stories and dialogue that are true to the Star Trek form. I think that the stories he writes are better than any of the stng movies.  The dialogue fits perfectly with the well established characters and I can easily imagine the lines being delivered by the actors...  However there are a few things that rankle my nerves every time certain things are mentioned. Worst of all is when ten forward is referred to as the Happy Bottom Riding Club, which I don't care if it is or isn't canonical, it's stupid and annoying. Next is whenever they say that starfleet will be unhappy with a decision, Mack changes the line to \\"the admirality\\" which I can't ever recall hearing in any of the shows or movies, just  say star fleet command like normal and let me enjoy the immersion in the story. I don't know why, but whenever these little things pop up, they just annoy me enough to break the \\"spell\\". Don't let that stop you from reading the books though, I have already read six of Mack's novels and thoroughly enjoyed them...  But I wish I could do a spell check revision and have every instance of \\"happy bottom riding club\\" replaced with \\"ten forward\\", and \\"admiralty\\" with \\"starfleet command\\". Which is really just one of my own personal neurotic problems, of which I am not lacking in any way.<br />Anyhow read the books, you won't be disappointed.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|a bad movie from a wonderful director. It was even dumber then I remember it being when I saw it on the big screen. It was like some four year old with terrets took all the dumbest ideas from the last ten years of funny books. I just love watching movies about crippled superheroes who die lame deaths. Yeah!
B003OJBWGK|5.0|Did not take long at all to get to my house. I always buy used CDs on Amazon and this was one of the better experiences I've had. This had obviously been opened before but everything was in great condition. No scratches or skipping and the CD booklet wasn't messed up at all. And if you're a Best Coast fan, you HAVE to have this one.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is so awesome. I play it all the time. It has the right amount of strategy to keep you playing.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This an extremely well produced DVD. The concert is excellent. Even Joe Walsh, who I am not a fan of does a good job.
B00406O7YK|5.0|I saw this for the first time in a very old theater when it came out i sat in the balcony in the grand theater in Bellingham wa  i still love it to this day 55 years old this year watch it once a week
B000ZOSMTW|4.0|Great music as always. The video portion is ok, but not great. I have a lot of music DVDs and this would be in the middle of the pack.
0547569653|4.0|I found this book because I read Born to Run (which I loved). I happened to see that Scott Jurek had a book too, and so I was intrigued to find out what he had to say. I enjoy the recipes at the end of each chapter and how he tells you a little bit about why certain foods are beneficial. The main thing that I will take away from this book is that it doesn't come easy but there are powerful tools that we have, if we would just take advantage of them. It is hard to read the book and not want to go out for a run or change your diet. Change your whole life, really.<br />While I will take plenty away from reading this, I was a little let down at the end. I don't know exactly what I was hoping I'd read, but it wasn't there.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Worth seeing especially after all the hype, but I had thought the six who escaped did use disguises, and I don't believe the events depicted at the airport during their departure were factually accurate. I was also offended somewhat by the over abundance of cursing. Nonetheless, it was entertaining and okay, and I'd recommend it to others as such.
B004SIP98S|4.0|Helen Mirren is marvelous, if you didn't  know better you would think is was really Queen Elizabeth.  Makes you think that their life is certainly not all that grand
B0030MM68O|4.0|Worth seeing. Acting was very good, and so was character development. Moreover, the directing, photography, and editing served to allow the viewer to intimately relate to the story. An easy movie to recommend to others.
B0026QC0YU|5.0|I love Tom Cruise and his movies I sort of watch the franchise backwards as I saw Ghost Protocol first and then went back to watch 1-3.  Loved them lots of action and just the right amount of Tom with his shirt off.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Just what I need to help shutoff my mind at the end of the day and get a good night's rest. Also helps me relax during the day if I am too wound-up or stressed. Great app!
125000098X|2.0|I agree with other reviewers that this was not as well written as the first two books.  And I thought the ending was just really bad.  Since this was billed as the third of the trilogy why end it like this?  And if there is another book I don't think I'll be reading it.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a very slow, tedious movie. You'd have to really be in the mood for it to enjoy it. First things first, the movie is VERY slow. I don't mean like &#34;oh maybe just the beginning is slow&#34; I mean like, the entire movie is slow. Second, its kind of odd. It's the type of movie that might weird out some people and scare them off, but to me it was beautiful. Third, It makes you think. At least, it did for me. That's why I liked it so much, I love a movie that after I'm done I can sit back and think &#34;Wow, life is so complex&#34; which got my desired result from this movie.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Only purchased it for my daughters collection. Haven't even cracked the plastic yet. seven more words required, thats all I had to say
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for horse people and non horse people I'm not a horse person but I love this game
0765325950|5.0|Have been riding the wave of these stories for a very long time. I was very sad when we lost Robert Jordan but Brandon Sanderson honored his memory and brought the series to a beautiful conclusion
B006YTTVHO|2.0|I read this front to back, and was extremely disappointed. I was looking to gain a few tips on how to approach people and be friendly, but all this book did from the beginning to the end was tell you want not to do. That should of course be said, but that wasn't what I thought the whole book would be about!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Loved the movie.  Big Judi Dench fan. She never disappoints.  Respected British actors, great, romantic story.  I highly recommend the movie.
B00417HV14|5.0|Nothing like watching a guitar virtuoso, seeing his emotion and love playing blues/blues rock in Blu-Ray on a large 1080P screen!!!<br /><br />I'll have them all soon! You should, too!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Loved the movie!  Lots of action, mystery, a little 'love' between the hero and scientist.  A must see in the series with Avengers series.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|This is a simple concept. It's one thing to record a killer album in the studio. Players tend to be more reserved in a studio environment. It's a whole new ballgame when you step out live!! You have to bring it!<br /><br />KWS gets it done in a big way! I love the more cut loose, raw sound of live. This a killer album!!<br /><br />If you're a KWS fan, you have to have this! He has released several albums since this live one. I wish he'd do another live!<br /><br />He's got a new album due out in 2013. A return to the roots kind of thing. It should be really good!!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this game Is sorta like gta people who rate it 1 don't no how to play it.....it is the best
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Nothing like watching a guitar virtuoso, seeing his emotion and love playing blues/blues rock in Blu-Ray on a large 1080P screen!!!<br /><br />I keep watching for Joe to play somewhere within a 4 hour drive from my home. He's always 8 or more hours driving time away, so these Blu-Rays keep me satisfied until such time as I get to see him live and in person!
B00005JLO2|3.0|My all time favorite movie is Four Feathers directed by Alexander Korda, circa 1930s.<br />This version did not follow that story line at all and improvised a different plot. It was interesting and watchable, however it did not come any near the standard of the original movie. The final scene was a downer.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|If you're a blues lover, you got to have this! If you're a fan of Joe, then you have to have this album, too!<br /><br />This is straight up blues, in Joe's way of playing, with his unique voice and screaming licks. Not blues rock, but blues, man, its the blues!!!!<br /><br />Fire up the tube stereo, grab a beer and drift off into bluesville!!
B009POHHR6|4.0|Where is/was comrade Solomon Grundy?  Was difficult to read on a kindle but enjoyed the story.  Lots of twists.  Worth the cost.
B00992CF6W|5.0|wen I got this app it was a little boring but then it got better rhett told me about this app buy this app!!!
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|this  film had alot of things going on and yet it ran  far longer than it should have  and who didn't see this story turning out how it did? Problem is  that it went into a  area of trying to tell other storys and making the film more longw=-winded than it needed to be.  and Justin TImberlake  might cool on a tv comedy, however as a  actor on a big screen he is a lightweight on the  big screen.  the Kriss Kross part  was cool.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is great my mom had this app 1 to get Luna you have to activate all the elements!!!!!!!!
B004QYZATW|5.0|Like him, don't like her, but this movie abounds with excellent chemistry between them (more and better than in &#34;Mr & Mrs Smith&#34; in my view).<br />I didn't 'guess' who he was. Was very surprised by the ending.  I actually watched this 3 days in a row and ~10 times in 6 months...may rent it again here soon.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Another excellent book in the Honor verse series. I love the series and the action. Usually there is more action than verbiage. The conversations between characters are usually not to long or involved and most of the tech info is understandable.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I was fortunate to be offered a free showing of the first two episodes of HOMELAND , provided by my TV Cable provider.  In those two episodes, I got hooked on this show.  I just had to order the first season, so I could &#34;catch-up&#34; so to speak.  Thanks so much!!
B007XELMO4|3.0|I have two different type of carrier by Cotton. The back-pack add-on type is handy and carries a camera as intended, but when hiking, the camera touches my arm on every step. This device is not ideal for a long hiking.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci has done it again.  Puller is a great character, similar to Oliver Stone of the Camel Club series.<br />While he has his flaws and some quirks he is above all an honorable man.  Well done!
B008VBYN80|2.0|Anyone playing this needs to be aware that you will not progress unless you spend real money. I don't understand how the developers think that in these times of austerity people will want to spend considerable sums of money for what<br />Is a decidedly average in all respects game! The money you could spend on this could buy you an Xbox or PS4 with decent games etc
B004SIP7US|5.0|beware of the region for your-blu ray player, as all blu-ray players are not set up for all regions! read all customer review all customer reviews before you buy anything. beware of some reviews that try to use a garden rake as a tiller. seriously!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Acoustic enough said! The man continues to amaze. It doesn't matter what type of music, rock, blues, etc Joe is the man. Checkout the new Beth Hart collaboration, very good
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun for all! Super addicting. Coins add up fast and allow you to purchase upgrades. Requires some skill which makes it fun for adults too.
1603427244|4.0|Worth every cent! Clear pictures of what each cast on and bind off will look like which is what I'm concerned with. Lots of options for multiple types of projects!
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is the consummate story teller. I totally enjoyed this book. Can't wait to find out how this all plays out.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Great graphics that remind you of the movie.  Fun to play and challenging but not too difficult.  Great game for everyone.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Excellent movie I guess that's why it won the Academy Award. I've recommended this movie to many of my friends.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|we now have seasons 1-7 cant wait for season 8 to be on dvd and for season 9 to start on TV. Best TV show I've seen ever. I have laughed and cried and can't get enough of Castiel.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game u can build your own city and have trucks transporting good to different factories. There is also busstations
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Very good. When I started reading I thought: \\"a sex book. \\"  And while the sex is plentiful and detailed, the story is captivating. It is well written, something that can't be said  for the  Grey series. I am waiting for the next edition
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game. Easy go navigate. Low build times. Quick advancement. Decent graphics.  Lots of options. Can lose many hours of the day if not careful.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|I think it was beautiful. I feel sad for those who said they couldn't/wouldn't keep up with it. It's supposed to get you thinking, not bore you into mindlessness.It's supposed to make you think.
B008JFUP8A|4.0|Although many people did not seem to like this 2013 movie, I thought it was decent.  OK, it was no award winner, but I enjoyed it and did not feel like I wasted my time (hour and a half approximately) or money.  It was obviously a Smith family film, with Will and son Jaden acting, Will and M. Night Shyamalan on the writing team, and Jada Pinkett Smith on the production team.  If I saw right, it was filmed in Costa Rica, Utah, and Southern California.<br /><br />The time period is long after planet Earth (hence, the title \\"After Earth\\") has become desolate, and long after the aliens who fed on humans have eradicated the human race on Earth.  We meet the Rangers, a military command from another planet.  Young Jaden is a Ranger Cadet, but seems to have some issues and just cannot achieve Ranger status.  I believe they are fear issues holding young Jaden back.<br /><br />I am guessing that Jaden is supposed to be around age 15 or so in the movie.  He has spent most of his life growing up without his dad, because dad was away on Ranger duty.  Jaden blames himself for his sister's death, so he is carrying heavy baggage.  When Will comes home, and before he retires, he takes Jaden off on a trip with him, to spend some guy-time together.  The plane hits an unexpected asteroid field and is forced to land on Earth, which is a dangerous place to be.  (All of this happens in the beginning of the film.)  The plane breaks in two pieces, about 100 kilometers apart and since Will is injured, Jaden must travel alone, but with Will guiding him from the ship.  The objective is to retireve a working distress beacon from the distant wreckage section and send the emergency signal for help.<br /><br />Although the first part of the movie is a bit slow, Jaden's journey is where it takes off.  I would love to say more, but you have to watch the movie now.  The CGI was pretty neat as they successfully blended it with holograms, bio-technology, scenery, and animatronics.  Although young Jaden's performance was not exceptional, I thought he did a good job. He played a young man who needed to listen, learn, and face his fears. I believe the movie captures that nicely.<br /><br />There are some great underlying messages in this storyline, the most penetrating being Will Smith saying to Jaden, \\"Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.\\"  Will goes on to explain in a simple paragraph that fear is an illusion which does not benefit us and we must choose how we respond to it.  He explains to Jaden that he must \\"live in the moment\\" and that fear is a projection of future events that might never even happen.  THESE ARE VERY WISE WORDS.  There are also parts of the movie that imply the son is reading his father's mind.  You will also see the father has taught his son to stop, ground, and center himself.  There is also an amazing scene where one of nature's creatures repays a debt to Jaden.  Let me also mention the underlying message that the earth has become desolate because we failed to take care of it.<br /><br />Nice movie. I do plan to buy the video when it comes out and watch it again.  I think the lesson about fear is priceless.  And although some reviews seem to want to bust Jaden out for not being as good as his father, I think the boy played his part well. When you watch the movie, I believe you will see that was part of the concept.  Instead of having a seasoned actor go out into the forbidden area, the boy character stretched himself to achieve above and beyond his fears and that added much to the story.  Actually, the more I think of the embedded messages in this movie, the more I like it.  Wouldn't it be great if we could all teach our children \\"Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.\\"<br /><br />6/9/13 - On a side note, yesterday, I found myself starting to worry about something and suddenly heard Will Smith's words to his son again.  He reminded me that fear is an illusion of the mind, where you are wasting time and energy getting upset over something that may never happen.  So I shifted my focus and went on about my business. . .mething that may never happen.  So I shifted my focus and went on about my business. . .

B003WKOU0G|5.0|i think we get too wrapped up in our modern society and for get how simple people are living still today.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This version is a joy to play. There are some tough situations to figure out and if your a person that cares about the star count you will be redoing puzzles till cows come hone.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I liked it and don't in the least regret renting this movie. This was Arnold without the Hollywood ego tripping crap like continually saying \\"I'll be back\\" or some other buzz phrase that ends up in 2 other movies. He appeared at ease and I liked how he interacted with the rest of the town's inhabitants. Most of the humorous parts were during those moments.<br /><br />The violence wasn't overstated with too much blood and they pretty much kept it separated from the humor. Pet peeve of mine is when ya get these stupid buddy/detective movies and they are cutting up like idiots right in the middle of a gun fight. I can suspend disbelief only so far.<br /><br />The rest of the cast fit in well and the plot was decent. Really the only thing missing was a cool dog, again my spin on that one.<br /><br />It flowed well enough that I didn't get bored. It's worth seeing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't normally write reviews..and I read a lot of books.  This book was funny, sexy, and I could NOT put it down.  I read in the bathroom at work on my iPhone!  I was addicted!!  Loved it from Drew's perspective!  I would love more Drew and Kate...they are a great couple!<br /><br />Bravo Emma Chase...I can't wait for book2 and more of your fresh writing :)
160309007X|5.0|I've been enjoying this series since the beginning (esp. the first two books), and now Alan and Kevin have turned out one of the best in the last three books - it had gotten rather bogged-down in its own experimentalism, but this edition perks up the story a bit and pushes the narrative forward more than the last few chapters.  Good art, good read.

B000SEFNMS|4.0|When McCandless was doing  his grand journey across the USA which eventually led to [Spoiler alert!!] his death by starvation. (Was it intentional or accidental?) your humble correspondent was nearing the end of his 4 year enlistment in the army. (Obviously I re-entered the active component of the army in 1999) In a lot of ways I was a lot like McCandless. Entry into the military was for me a bold and adventuresome thing well beyond what I thought I could physically or mentally endure. I met my fair share of men like him during those 4 years.<br /><br />I think a bit more of a psychological autopsy could have been done on Chris/Alexander Supertramp. I realize that would be difficult and perhaps beyond the author's intention.<br />This was from all I have read a young man with a deep vacuum in his life. Was it spiritual/religious? Did it stem from a paternalistic overly controlling family? Did he all along have some type of treatable mental illness?<br />Being \\"On The Road\\" and roughing it likely appeals to lotsa folks, not just folks like McCandless or Jack Kerouac and his associates. It's a shame that he could not have dedicated his life and resources to something more substantive than a solo romp across the country. The clipped 3rd person style of journal entries do not to me sound like a man in full possession of his mental competencies and that makes him a more pitiable character and thus more sympathetic. Perhaps he could have instead went off to teach or do some type of humanitarian missionary work in a 3rd world country if he was so all fired-up to renounce western ease and affluence. Rural India or the mountains of Central America would have benefitted greatly no doubt from his zeal for grunt labor and perhaps such a stint would have made him realize just how well he had it.<br />Lotsa young men learn all about outdoor camping and \\"roughing it\\" in the army as RANGERS. Who knows? Perhaps Chris could have become Bear Gryllz or some other outdoorsman?  The factthat he set out on this sojourn with so little in the way of accoutrements only underscores the profound tragedy. Even on his motorcycle trip up from Argentina Che Guevara was at least able to get his mother to wire him money. McCandless didnt even have that luxury.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Once again this book was good. If you liked the first two you will love this one. Only wish it didnt end and that it continue with Christians story.

B000FC146C|5.0|Colleen McCullough has crafted an amazing story that encompasses the settling of Australia to the 20th century.  She writes the story of the Cleary family as they migrate from New Zealand to Australia to work on the family ranch of 250,000 acres of prime sheep raising land.  You travel with the Clearys through Australia (which is amazingly varied).  You feel like you are actually there with them.  Everything she writes makes you feel like you are actually with the characters whereever they are.  This is a definite read!!!!
0307279189|5.0|My daughter read this book and was so inspired by it that she had her sister read it, and recommends to anyone who would wish to educate and inspire ones self! Am looking forward to reading my own copy (as she has re-read hers so much it is very used now) because she so loved it that i feel I should read it too! Everyone I have heard of reading this book has liked it. Guess that means I'm next!
B00AIBZM40|5.0|this movie is a really good movie, I've watched this movie a couple of times, this movie is worth buying

0765325950|5.0|they last book of the (very long) series. Well worth getting into if you can locate the whole thing. Very recommended.
0316017930|5.0|I've read other books by Malcolm Gladwell, and this one is just as fascinating as all the rest! His ability to ask unusual questions &#34;outside the box&#34; gives new insight on what makes a person successful. Loved the book, couldn't put it down!

B007N85POS|3.0|I thought it was funny but could not figure out how to play well, i am more of a board game person I think.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it. I can't wait to see the movie when it finally comes out. It was so sad yet nostalgic and beautiful.

B007TXN4TK|4.0|Fun, funny i could not keep up but had lots of fun playing around with this. My kindle froze and not sure I have it anymore.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is a really run app, despite how fast it takes up battery life. This is a fun strategy,game, the Random Mission add extra fun,and so do the Special Missions. The regular game play is also fun, and there are many maps to choose from. It is slightly annoying about how much Monkey Money some items cost. (Monkey Money is a make-believe currency used in the game.) But this is a great game, and a 5 star rating is rarely given out by Pikmin. You should get this app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Does not disappoint if you enjoyed the first two seasons.  The writing is still sharp and witty, though the plot leans toward the melodramatic like the second season.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game but it does not have all the stuff that the 360 or computer version has. But if your traveling it is a great substitute for the full version.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is the best.  The accuracy of the predictive text is uncanny.  I like that even with a physical keyboard,  the suggestions still pop up, and I can still save time by selecting the words as they appear (usually within the first three letters,  after it &quot;learns&quot; you.)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Looks great on my Galaxy SIII. Play is very smooth with no glitches that I have encountered. A very addictive game.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|No storyline, bad acting, offensive in your face 3D shots and way too long.  This might have made a cute 90 minute (including credits) TV flick, but wow it creates entirely new depths of $200 million dollar bad movie making.  The absolute worst film I have seen in many years.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed the book's technical descriptions and how he used his head to solve problems.<br />They appear to be very real circumstances like the kind of luck I would have.<br />I did not enjoy the frequent \\"F\\" bombs and other poor language used, which in my view point didn't help the book one bit.<br />In fact I fought the urge to quit reading numerous times because of it but wanted to see what happened and tried to ignore it.<br />I guess I'm old fashioned but I don't like such language. The book would be better without it.[[ASIN:B00B5HO5XA The Martian]]
B004LQGXPA|5.0|Accurate in depiction of character and events...Patton was tough and Mr.Scott pulls it off fabulously. With Karl Malden as co-star it is probably the most accurate depiction of WWII events prior to Saving Private Ryan
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely not what . I expected in the end but overall a pretty great book. The book is well written and certainly starts to get entertaining and more interesting right after Amy \\"disappears\\"<br />. I don't know how Gillian Flynn could think of such a normal yet manipulative, conniving wife but that's where all the entertainment comes from. Loved it! Give it a try and you might like the psychotic relationship between Nick and Amy.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Entertaining movie but not something i would spend some more of my time watch again. Decent plot and acting and somewhat funny.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I really have to give it up to G5.  Even though its a game that requires some REAL funds to advance,  its still a fun,  thinking persons game, regardless. Its free,  so download it and enjoy!
193700788X|1.0|*Spoilers*<br /><br />Having faithfully read this series since well before True Blood, I wanted to like this book.  True, the last few books were disappointing, but I hoped Charlaine Harris would end the series with a book I could rate five stars.  Unfortunately, I couldn't even come close.  I had to knock off one star for each of the following:<br /><br />Mystery Plot Holes<br /><br />The plots against Sookie just didn't make sense, never mind that they all happened at the same time.  Why would Copley sell his soul for a wish for a magical object to make a wish?  Why would he then want to ruin Sookie just for using that magical object she had no idea he wanted, especially after being warned off by the devil who has his soul?  Why would Glassport hate Sookie because she \\"nearly\\" ruined things for him (but didn't succeed) and didn't try to save him in Rhodes (but he survived anyway )?  Why would Claude need Glassport and Newlin to help him \\"track\\" Sookie; he knew exactly where she lived and worked?  And why wouldn't Niall, who had sent Claudine to protect Sookie and been following her via Eric for even longer, neglect to warn Sookie that Claude was back?  Saying that \\"Putting himself in someone else's shoes is not the Niall way\\" is insufficient explanation.  Also, since when can fairies be killed with regular bullets?  That would make them a much less formidable foe than they've been portrayed in past books and short stories.<br /><br />Although this doesn't relate to the mysteries, there is also the glaring hole of why Sookie thinks vampires will leave her alone after a year of Karin's protection.  Or why other supes (and even humans) would let her live a normal life.<br /><br />Pacing and Tone<br /><br />There were too many times when the story seemed to meander and drag.  The change in POV itself didn't bother me, but what did feel \\"off\\" was the coy use of \\"medium man,\\" \\"tall man,\\" \\"New Orleans businessman,\\" etc.  Why not just use their names - especially Copley'sand Tyrese's, as they were identified a few pages later?  And there were passages like, \\"I had that icky sensation of sweat trickling down between my butt cheeks\\" and \\"we slid together like seals\\" during sex, that were particularly cringe-inducing.  Of course, my biggest \\"Oh, how could she do this?\\" reaction was for letting Appius, a rapist and pedophile, win and sell Eric into sexual slavery.<br /><br />HEA<br /><br />Much of the fan disappointment with this book has centered around Sookie ending up with Sam, which is perfectly understandable given the *way* in which that was done.  The build-up to the romantic resolution, which has been such a fundamental part of most of the series, should not have to come about because of a magical device changing feelings; that's extremely sloppy plotting, especially if Harris has been planning this outcome for 12 years throughout 12 books.  And, even with the cluviel dor, Sam was only Sookie's *second* choice.  (\\"I guess that Eric read you better than I did.  He knew that *if he let me go*, you were standing first in line waiting.\\"  Doesn't that mean that, if Eric had *not* \\"let Sookie go,\\" she would have happily stayed with him?)  Sam was rendered a rebound.<br /><br />Moreover, this HEA required rewriting canon (although Sookie said she couldn't read Sam's mind here, in the short story that follows, \\"If I Had a Hammer,\\" she reads his thoughts clearly) and that Sookie expressly not care that her feelings for Sam might be caused by the cluviel dor (and that his definitely were), notwithstanding that she had spent *five books* worrying about whether the blood bond was influencing her feelings for Eric.  (It wasn't.)<br /><br />Perhaps most unbelievable to me is that, in order to get bail money from Eric, Sam would agree not to court her.  (Nor is it ever explained why Eric would impose such a condition, nor why it was so hard to come up with the money.)  Surely, if Sam were truly in love with Sookie, he would not agree to giveher up permanently in exchange for a little time without bail.  (Sookie's house could have been put up as collateral the next day.)<br /><br />Sookie<br /><br />My biggest disappointment is the change in Sookie herself.  In Dead Reckoning, Mr. Cataliades explained her \\"essential spark\\" as \\"an openness to the other world.\\"  Sookie lost that in this book.  She became intolerant (\\"Maybe there was more truth to Eric's accusations about my prejudice against vampire culture than I'd believed.  But vampires were users of humans\\").  Compare that to what Sookie told Sam in From Dead To Worse (\\"People aren't any better or worse than the supernaturals\\") or in All Together Dead (\\"two years ago . . . I didn't know that vampires were as different from each other as we are\\").  She also became self-absorbed; she had no sympathy for Jane in jail, finding it \\"disgusting\\" that \\"she was sick from both ends,\\" notwithstanding that she realized that \\"Jane was at heart a kind person\\" who wanted to help Sookie.  Compare this Sookie with the one who risked her life in Dead Until Dark to rescue Bill, the vampire she had just met, from drainers.  She even showed no appreciation for the fact that Eric agreed to an extra 100 years of slavery to keep her safe.  In this book she also suddenly - and repeatedly - swore.  Finally, although Sookie ends the book by saying that she would be fine alone, her actions showed her jumping into bed with Sam when her \\"previous lover had barely left town,\\" the day after hearing about Eric's sacrifice.  So, not only did Sookie not *grow* in this book, as I would have hoped at the end of a series, she actually regressed.<br /><br />What a disappointment!
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I don't know exactly but I believe I lost count after Four.<br /><br />Not withstanding the terrible story issues (WoW only 8 minutes flight time or so to warp half-way across the galaxy or whatever)...  JJ Abrams is a loser director that has completely destroyed the intelligence behind StarTrek, now on his way to destroy Star Wars, and also has some serious ego problems Donald Trump would himself be jealous thereof.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this game quite a lot. The graphics are good for the hidden object and the adventure mystery was a challenge. Highly recommend.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|If Steven Wilson had already been inspired by artists such as Pink Floyd, Yes, Camel, King Crimson, Frank Zappa, etc. etc.  He then time traveled back to the 70's with this fantastic album.  All  of these bands would be opening for him.  I know it's a stretch, \\"mainly because it is just a joke,\\" but that is how highly I feel for this album.
B001S86J0I|5.0|One of our all time favorites. Okay for all ages. Just a fun silly story of overcoming the bad guy...ooops did I just give it away. Just watch it you will... enjoy

B005LB1MY6|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for the last 2 weeks while on vacation with family.  Not only through my earphones at every chance, but also as playback in my head when I'm bored riding in a car with no tunes. Yes, the tunes are very memorable! When a friend turned me on to Justice a few weeks ago, I started by listening to Cool Cats and then Cross.  But Audio, Video, Disco is bar far their best album even with the release of Access All Arenas.  I'm old enough to remember the various stages that YES went through and enjoyed them all including 90125 and Tormato which were later releases. Justice reminds me very much of the post Wakeman era of YES, but with a bit of Daft Punk's electronic disco funk vibe added in. As I'm a big fan of all of YES regardess of who was singing or playing guitar. I enjoy Morgan Phalen's singing on selected tracks of Justice's AVD.  He definitely has that John Anderson/Trevor Horn lyric tenor. The lyrics might not be as trippy as what was being written by YES or ELP in the era of LSD, but the tight sounds of Gaspard and Xavier of Justice really hit the acid house sweet spot.<br /><br />All said, the album is a tribute to legendary sounds I grew up on but with a electronic twist that makes them fresh and very enjoyable.

B002N9MK8G|5.0|Sinatra in 1966, I believe. The sound quality is good. Basie, along with mentions of Quincy Jones and Sammy Davis, Jr., soften Sinatra's bravado. My favorite is &#34;Don't Worry About Me&#34;. when he drags down and then up on the line&#34;LOOK OUT for yourseeeeeelf should be the rule.&#34;  Just MY opinion.
B000SGGUWS|1.0|This is not the style of reading I enjoy  at all and I could not even begin to get into it.  Since I am hearing impaired and had seen this on TV, I was curious, so bought the book..  I should have tried a sample first!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|You either love Boz Skaggs or can't stand him.  I am fortunately in the first category.  This new album is a treasure.  Smooth, fine music.  Listen to the whole thing from start to finish, then listen to it again.  I defy anyone to tell me they don't love this.  &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia&#34; and &#34;Gone baby Gone&#34; were especially delightful surprises.  Get this album.  You can't go wrong.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fun read, excellent story.  Detailed research.  Great merging of characters in certain parts wish there had been more on the shadier members of this book
1909313033|5.0|This book is so much fun, especially for those who are dogs lover.<br />After reading it, I am now interested in the author's other products. Simply love it.
0143122061|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />It sat on my shelf for about a year because I wasn't all that impressed with Fergusons's Ascent of Money, which I thought was both a little dry and a little too conservative. I thought this book was much better, but it still suffers from what I call Niall Ferguson's emphasis on conservatism-that is, he often resorts to saying history happened a certain way because it was more or less inevitable, whereas I see things as being more defined by chance and accident, history's grand themes needn't have turned out the way they did, in my opinion anyway.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the very wide coverage of ideas. I have long wanted information on e.g. the French Revolution (why did it go so bad after such a useful basis at least?), what Marx was really up to and about, why China and the east in general lagged the West from the Middle Ages, why North and South America developed so differently after the arrival of Europeans in the 15th century, and continue to do so, what is the main reasons for Africa's under-development, why soviet communism eventually failed, and why China is now the fastest developing nation on earth, and what all this means for the future. There is a wide coverage of ideas here, some unconventional, some not, but excellent examples and idiosyncratic tales are a strong point of Ferguson, making it thoroughly entertaining at the very least.<br /><br />The ideas are way too many to outline here. So much so, I intent to read the book again, to take it all in. Here are some selected examples:<br /><br />-John Locke had a good understanding of how best to set up government and its associations.<br />-South American cultural heritage of a strong caste-working class and elite social structures hinder and preclude truly representative and democratic governments, particularly in the realm of property rights.<br />-The consumer society tends to work to the betterment of everybody.<br />-Western Medicine has hitched the ride with various forms of colonisation and development, leading to better living standards.<br />-The origins of social Darwinism and Nazism can be found in imperialism in Africa in the 19th century.<br />-The origins of the first world war may have had something to do with cultural norms developed and fostered under African imperialism<br />-Jeans and rock music are two of the things that under-mined soviet communism. 'Russians don't need this cacophonic noise'.<br />-cultures which facilitate trust in business and venture capitalism tend to do much better than those that don't, for a variety of reasons.<br />-the west's moral (protestant) work ethic was a good preparation for secular capitalism, and might be argued to be a natural progression (Weber).<br />-China and the east in general have a chronic tendency to look inward. Only two ports in China allowed some selected foreign ships in Adam Smith's day.<br />-For a variety of reasons, a variety of Chinese Christian religious cults led to the deaths of millions under various 'rebellions' in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, however the growth of Christianity in China is profound.<br />-the Islamic tendency to denigrate scientific development has led it to consistently under-develop in comparison to the west. (thorny area this), particularly militarily.<br />-A fundamental difference between Christianity and Islam is the statement: 'render under Caesar the things that are Caesar's and render unto God the things that are Gods'. Ie the separation of church and state, deeply embedded in Christianity from the very beginning.<br />-Chinese issued grey pyjama-lookalikes under communism, and Islamic scarves and veils have something in common.<br />-there still isn't a free press in China, Russia, and Iran, for example.<br />-The French revolution's decline towards violation of it's founding principles and development of a military dictatorship was written into the very seeds of its' birth. Unlike the USrevolution, the French tended to elevate the general will above the law, they tended to implicitly trust authority, French society was also highly centralised and authoritarian, and the revolution itself originated in the bureaucracy, not the lower and middle classes. (They chose Rousseau instead of Locke, Ferguson puts it).<br /><br />One could go on and on. You get a whiff of Ferguson's overt conservatism in the above, but he argues and backs it up very well. It is a better book than one might think at first, and deals with many deep issues. Worth reading twice.revolution, the French tended to elevate the general will above the law, they tended to implicitly trust authority, French society was also highly centralised and authoritarian, and the revolution itself originated in the bureaucracy, not the lower and middle classes.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a delightful story that is amusing and at the same time very thought provoking and touching. I was cheering each character on, seeing and feeling the beauty and depth of them all. And the end . . . my oh my .... what a wondeful ending!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A game that makes you use your noggin! Love it! Please give me more; but please make it longer. A bit short for a buck.99.  At $1.99 per room, I'm not doing the whole house.
0517548232|2.0|Hazlitt approaches the economics of his peers quite correctly -- they don't think things all the way through and consider all the effects of their decisions. He assumes that they just don't do it, but, then and now, I don't think his peers of either time actually have the capacity.<br /><br />His problem, the problem with this text, is that he then himself applies the principles of economics so shallowly that his explanations of how things should work end up false or completely inverted.<br /><br />An excellent example of the current thinking corrupted leaders at the top use to mislead dumbed down shallowly educated right wing voters though.
B000JBXY1W|1.0|Doesnt play on blue ray or Dvd players not even a ps3. I was very disappointed. Lesson learned hd doesn't work.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|Paul Krugman is one of my favorite economic authors. A true pragmatic altruist. And he's mostly right again -- we could end this 'contraction' (not a depression) now. And he explains exactly right, exactly how... but it will never happen. Because the application of economic principles at the top of the economic system, in order to be applied, have to match up with human incentives at the top, not just what's right or wrong economically. The incentives are corrupt, and so has the system become corrupted. Keynsian economics only function well in an ethical system. (Maybe that's why the too far right hates it so much.)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game! I can't wait for the next one. The puzzles are challenging and fun. I highly recommend THE ROOM.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|All the funny parts are in the trailer. It was boring until about 20 minutes left in the movie. Very predictable.
0345525558|4.0|This book was not what I was expecting and that combined with good story telling made it a very enjoyable read!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have used it a lot and works great. Fast shipping. The Kindle looks like it was never touched before i got it.
B001K3KK0Q|2.0|It's often called a classic, but it's really not old enough to be a classic. The book gets most of its attention as assigned reading in American literature classes. But when you see it on the screen, it starts very slowly, and never picks up speed or interest. But Bruce Dern does a great job playing a heel.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I love diary of a wimpy kid books because I feel like I  am reading a diary,not a book. I would give this 5 stars.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Overall it was a quick read, some parts were a little boring, but it's worth the wait in the end .
089867154X|5.0|just what i needed:) great quality, but I would have liked it to be worn in a little bit more. When i opened it it felt new, but there was minimal damage on the cover. Other than that thank you!:)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I'm new to this show - decided to watch it because it was included in the prime instant video.  It's a very engaging show - the characters have quite a bit of depth to them, and the story lines are engaging. It's not the kind of show I feel I have to binge watch (the way I did with Alias, the last series I watched because of prime instant video), but that's why I like it.  I can watch one episode at a time, and look forward to the next time I can watch another episode, without having to sit glued to the tv for hours at a time.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks...this book speaks of tragedy, but more importantly it speaks of Hope. The characters come to life and you are thrown into their world like a  character on the outside looking in. Every emotion and life experience these characters went through you felt.<br /><br />I could not put the book down....now I can see the movie. Thanks for another great story.
0738727326|5.0|I collect and use hundreds of tarot decks, ranging from the antique and rare, to more modern and quirky.I enjoy themed decks and this deck is among the most delicately designed that I own to date, to say that it is lovely is an understatement. The cards are perfectly sized and glossed, and all of my clients ask for this deck on a regular basis.This is actually my second set,as the first was loved to death.
B00364K6YW|5.0|It's much easier to understand what is being said in the restored edition. There are also a few more scenes that connect the story line better than the miniseries episodes I had recorded. I love having this DVD!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Typical, great le Carre'. Sadly, this is how things are done now, and the author does his usual bang-up job of making it make sense.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|I like this movie but sometimes had a hard time hearing the dialogue because the background music / sound effects were too loud.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Very tastefully done and truly heart gripping . A need to read experience, with 5 stars.
1442300051|5.0|I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  You'll see behind the wizards curtain.  You'll never look at Wall Street the same again.  Greed, stupidity, arrogance, you see you at all. Michael Lewis is down to earth and really keeps it real.  I definitely recommend the audio version. I highly recommend this.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Some might find it quite boring, but I always enjoyed both the book and the video set.<br />Dr. Bronowski has the ability to see significant points in history with a fairly unique perspective that is very enlightening and stimulates further though.  This is an excellent educational series for children, probably starting around 13 yrs or so.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's a fun game but it gets too hard too early on. It should be easier and progressively get harder. Otherwise it  a great game!!
B00004VVND|5.0|Very good restoration of an old sci-fi classic.<br />I always loved this movie, and view of the future that it brings.
B009NY43NY|1.0|OMG!!!!!!! What a waste of time this piece of crap was. I faithfully read the series and supported CH all these yrs and this is the slap in the face I get. How the heck she justifies charging all this money is beyond me. I for one will be crossing her off my well liked authors list and I vow I will never buy another piece of crap from her again. She got some nerve.......JUST HORRIBLE.......worst book I have ever read.

1878424319|4.0|The book reads smoothly w/ interesting stories..HOWEVER, there really isn't anything new. It seems to combine Judeo-Christian principles with those of Buddhism, islam  mormonisms, .I have read more books which encourage you to write what you believe more forceably and passionately
B00475AYJQ|5.0|That in itself means 5 stars what with the length of this book. I also read the name of the wind. The ending is a little bit confusing... but leaving things to our imagination is part of what makes it satisfying. The ending is not all wrapped up like a package. Instead it just goes on. Perhaps leaving ROOM for a sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you love horses and simulation games, look no further. gems are expensive, but you can earn them pretty fast so it isn't so bad. and for free, what more can you ask for?
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Having scanned through all the one-star ratings there isn't much I can add.  Yes, it really is that bad.  In fact, most of those reviewers have been too kind.  But this book isn't just bad, it is bigoted and dangerous.<br /><br />There is a serious issue with the book that I only saw one brief reference to in other reviews.  The gay characters are negative stereotypes.  One untrustworthy, insecure, amoral, cruel and selfish, the other effeminate and ineffectual.  It seems the only reason the author wrote them as gay was to beef up their villain cred.  One more reason to hate them.  I can't complain that they are one-dimensional since all the characters share that.  Especially in young adult fiction, if the only gay characters a gay or questioning teen sees are negative images, the author is carelessly adding to the gay teen suicide rate.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Dear John,<br />  Thank you so much for writing this amazing and heartrending book. It's one of those books where you just stop and look at your life, and you see how it compares to your life. I now realize the even deeper contents of cancer because of you. I will probably read this book over and over again, just as Hazel read An Imperial Affliction over again.<br />  But I was thinking... it would be awesome to know what does like for Augustus. What Gus thought of when he first saw Hazel, what Gus felt when he was suffering, everything. I'm sure this has crossed your mind already, but it would be amazing to have this book in Augustus' point of view. I completely understand if you don't, because it's probably for some greater good life lesson or something, just as van houten didn't write a sequel to An Imperial Affliction. Again, that was such a wonderful book and you've touched many people's lives with it, including mine.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a fantastic, hysterical read!! Loved every chapter...and that drew.... sigh .... loved him!!! Def recommends this book!! 5 stars
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book was very well written. The author kept you on your toes throughout! It had very unusual twists. I particularly liked the end. It definitely was a different take on the psychological novel!!
B000G7PNAE|5.0|What a great voice, tone and feeling in his singing,  so if you do not care for all the songs, you will love that Voice.
1478978082|5.0|I love all of the Harry Bosch novels.  All of Michael Connolly's novels are great!  I have read most of them twice
B006WAIV6M|4.0|If you like Freakonomics or Malcom Gladwell books, you will enjoy this one. It's easy to read, and allows you see the world from a different perspective.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the most funest and the most cutest game ever played .you get to play with the horses and feed them<br />.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|This is one of my favorite Danny Kaye movies. Maybe not as well known as some of his others I think this film is great humorous fun.
0553382152|5.0|I was given this book by a friend who asked me to read it and then talk with her about life after death.  After I read it, I felt more calm and certain about the existence of an afterlife.<br /><br />Shortly after reading it, the author was on Oprah Winfrey.  Unlike many other authors, she was not seeking celebrity nor validation, nor even monetary gain.  She was a very simply spoken woman who wrote about her near death experience and what she believes lies ahead for all of us.  From a life accounting of all the pain we have created for others to a realization of the joy we have also brought to others' lives, to a greater understanding of those 'deja vu' moments we all have, this book is an account of her experience of life after death.<br /><br />I have given a copy to many people who have lost loved ones (especially when those who have died were young and full of promise).  All of them have responded with the same sense of calm and reassurance that we are here until our purpose is complete and then our lives end.<br /><br />It gave me a new perspective in looking daily at what my purpose might be.  Not a bad way to live.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Like Bleak House only a little more upbeat.  Always enjoy Matthew MacFayden in everything he does.  I have already watched it 3 times in two weeks!
1616550414|5.0|I've been wanting this for a long time thanks so much. I had no troubles with ordering as well.<br />Thanks!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app its just like smurfs village. I would get it if I was u thank u hopefully you will like it to bye
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I had purchased the season sets back in the 90's, and these are by FAR the best you'll ever see TNG on the screen.  Superbly remastered by CBS, I'll be buying all of the seasons.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is really fun but when it's time to upgrade to a different place it doesn't do it a lot of my friends have the new city weeks before I get it. They need to work on the upgrades on the kindle Fire for this game.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel is always a joy to watch; but this movies was just not what I expected.  This movie is more a personal drama.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really awesome book and series, I really recommend it even if you're not into Greek mythology. Can't wait for the next one!
B0030B621W|5.0|I have watched this movie several times, I love male innocence, quiet strength, empathy, silliness, anger, honor, and with this; the emotion that comes with the characters' realizations.  I love that all this comes from one actor, Sam Rockwell is brilliant in this film.  It has become my favorite quiet time/ easy to watch /uncomplicated movie:)
B004GYY714|3.0|I'm not getting the stations that I enjoy most.  It's great for just having music play in the background when playing various game apps. Maybe I'm expericing problems with finding what I need.  Either way it's just OK.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I like scary movies that are more suspense than gore, ones that involves weird little kids are the best!<br />Worth watching if you feel the same...
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Too much on characters and too little on plot.  Very difficult to get into and only became interesting halfway through.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|got this to watch with my daughter on movie night and it was a success!! bringing me back to my own childhood when I watched it with my mom.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.  Old app worked well and looked great.  The new update not so much.  Wish I could get the old look back.  Guess I'll be looking for another weather app.
B000LY8NXQ|3.0|very sad movie. Weird how they tried to make it a happy story when it is really a tragedy. we will never forget
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|There really is no downside to this movie. The characters are memorable, the animation is top notch and the message is just great. Summary: My daughter is 3 and cannot watch this movie enough; I am 42 and I watch it every time with a smile on my face.<br /><br />Every character in this movie will stick with you. There are no \\"ok\\" characters. Every one of them has been carefully crafted to appeal to an child AND an adult.<br /><br />The animation is great. It is the subtle things, like the cake splatter in the penthouse looking 8-bit, the way characters of certain vintages move and act. Classic. If you hung around an arcade between 1985 and 1995, you are going to experience some serious nostalgia.<br /><br />I do not want to spoil the end, but suffice it to say my entire family, including two of my friends, got misty eyed with admiration. Ralph is the man!
B003719GGS|5.0|The love languages book is really informative.  It truly helped how important it is to communicate love in ways my wife receives and appreciates.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Based on the trailer, I was expecting a lot more action......which there was not:(  Also waited for mind blowing plot twist at end........no, pretty cut & dry.  Was really hoping for better performances from Wahlberg and Crowe,  really just mediocre.<br /><br />Don't need to watch it twice
B00BESFWBY|4.0|Great movie to watch with the family. Inspirational story. I will probably purchase the movie to add to the family collection.
B00BF11STU|4.0|A little unrealistic in depicting an analyst as giving operational orders to Navy Seals in real time during an op, but all-in-all an engrossing film adaptation of a fascinating search and operation for OBL.
0871403633|4.0|The Social Conquest of Earth is a difficult book for a lay person such as myself to evaluate. The author is a renown Harvard professor and specialist in his field and writes in a style that is more academic than necessary. One problem I have with the book is that Professor Wilson starts and ends with the artist Paul Gauguin but he is irrelevant to the main thrust of the book and the reproductions of his paintings are poor. I did appreciate learning about social insects and marveled at their organization and effectiveness, yet I do not think we can make a direct connection between the behavior of these insects, which after all, is instinctual in comparison to human behavior which is largely based on conscious decision making.  The ant has no choice, humans do and that is all the difference.  I would also challenge the assertion that eating meat was a prerequisite for human development. Professor Wilson may be eminent in his field but he is hardly a nutritionist.<br /><br />In sum I would say that a lay person can get some valuable information from this book but much of it will be difficult to understand.
1476733953|5.0|Wool is by far one of the best reads I've had in a very long time. It is simply amazing! Everyone should make this a must read! I quickly snapped up a few of Howey's other books to see if he could recreate this kind of literary magic; this writing style and creative brilliance that I had swiftly fallen in love with. I made very short work of his Molly Fyde series too! BRILLIANT! ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST WRITERS OF MY GENERATION... and yes... my new hero!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game!! Unlike Ice Age Village where u had to purchase acorns this gives u everything u need to have a great little village! Cant stop playing it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was on the fence but this game won me over. Great mini games and a fun rewarding experiance. Check it out for yourself  and see.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I am a total sucker for mazes. Always have been. The weirder and more fiendish, the better. Hedge mazes, cornfield mazes, video game mazes, paper and pencil mazes-- I just like the sense of being lost in an alien place.<br /><br />As such, the setting is what drew me to read The Maze Runner. A maze miles across, with no apparent exit, walls that shift every night, and bizarre monsters roaming its pathways, is instant sign-me-up territory. It didn't disappoint-- the world Thomas wakes into is an excellently strange and creepy one, and easily kept me up until 2 am.<br /><br />The action scenes were fast-paced and exciting. I'm not always a big fan of books relying heavily on action-- it can be tough to write well and keep interesting for very long-- but Dashner managed it. It helped, I think, that the Grievers were really disturbing. I don't say that about a lot of monsters in YA, but I didn't want to come face-to-face (well, okay, face-to-mass-of-shapeless-flesh-and-whirring-blades-- see? disturbing) with one of these critters any more than Thomas did.<br /><br />I had slightly mixed feelings about the actual plot. For most of the book it wasn't really clear what the everloving heck was going on. I was okay with that, because bits and pieces were presented in a tantalizing way that sort of fit with the feeling of being trapped in a maze-- a twisting, seemingly arbitrary place where it's very difficult to get a grip on the big picture. I enjoyed following along and wondering where it was all going.<br /><br />The ending, though, didn't bring the clarity I was hoping for. While it was sort of explained what was going on, it wasn't really clear that the explanation made any sense at all. Of course it's the start of a series, and there's plenty of time for things to become clear later on. But going solely by the contents of this book, I'm not convinced that the underlying reasons for everything are going to make any more sense no matter how much more they're explained. That said, I'm still hooked and will definitely read on to find out.<br /><br />I wasn't completely a fan of Dashner's writing style. He does action and setting very well, but when it comes to characterization his writing can get kind of flat and tends to tell rather than show. I didn't feel as connected to many of the characters as I'd have liked, and as such certain scenes didn't pack the punch that they might have. Most of the time that would be a dealbreaker for me; in this case, the other aspects of the book kept me turning the pages fast enough that I didn't really mind. But it was unfortunate-- I think stronger characterization could have turned this from a good story to an outstanding one.<br /><br />So, not perfect. But if you're looking for a fast-paced, intriguing read in an awesome setting, definitely give this a shot.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Exceptionally well done.  It is a masterpiece of movie making art, it does not disappoint.  The music, the sets, the characters were all done with professional perfection.  Bravo
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I am answering for my husband who is a WWII veteran.  I know he enjoyed this book very much because of the human elements described.
B008Y5N3O8|2.0|This one did not float my boat at all.  Pretty dark and way too much cursing.  Just about every sentence.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really like the step by step experiements! It is easy to foloow and interesting.  It is great for building confidence too.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle has to be one of the greatest shows ever on TV. The chemistry between Castle and Becket is something seldom seen on TV and I eagerly await for each new show.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|this is a great movie but it should have a different name the theme is the same as the book but Colombo puts in a totally different middle the outcome and beginning are the same but after that they are totally different i understand where the theme is from but they omit key characters and give other characters bigger roles it is horrible if you are basing it on the book but a good movie if you are rating it by itself
1400052173|4.0|This book's storytelling format is an easy and informative read .  It peaks curiosity encouraging the reader to learn more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but this book grips you right off the bat. This author knows how to toy with your curiosity, as evidenced by this book's very competent exploration of human behavior, vulnerability and leadership. Very well written and leaves doors open for sequels, yet leaves you satisfied and content to wait for the next one. Bravo, Hugh. Will definitely check out other titles.
0802473164|5.0|perfect in every way<br /><br />great info that I didn't know, after a life=time of reading self-help books.

B00BRBJSHC|5.0|Fogerty appears to have laid old ghosts to rest here with some genuinely creative arrangements. These revitalised evergreens display a mastery that makes `revisited' attempts to sound authentic ridiculous. This is an exceptional and varied work with two excellent new songs. Highlights (on first listen) include Tom Morello's guitar on `Wrote A Song', Seger's nightish-moves and Proud Mary's big easy arrangement. `Wrote A Song For Everyone Too' will be a triple.<br /><br />Green River  - John Mellencamp<br />Keep on Chooglin'  - Mungo Jerry<br />Bootleg  - Bob Dylan<br />Rock and Roll Girls  - Rosie Flores<br />Looking Out My Back Door  - Dwight Yoakam<br />Cross Tie Walker  - Robert Gordon<br />Down on the Corner  - The Rolling Stones<br />It Came Out Of The Sky  - Dave Alvin<br />Don't Look Now  - Iris Dement<br />Travellin Band  - Bruce Springsteen<br />Wish I Could Hideaway  - Emmylou Harris<br />Hey Tonight  - Dan Baird<br />Rockin' All Over The World  - Katrina And The Waves - yes them<br />Where The River Flows  - Gillian Welch<br />The Old Man Down The Road - The Rainmakers<br />Gunslinger  - Willie Nelson<br />Broken Down Cowboy  - Rumer<br />A Hundred and Ten in the Shade - The Iguanas<br />Walking in a Hurricane  - AC/DC<br />Rambunctious Boy  - Peter Wolf<br />Big Train From Memphis  - Sonny Burgess<br />Southern Streamline  - Carlene Carter<br />Comin' Down The Road  - Jerry Lee Lewis<br />Déjà vu All Over Again  - Steve Earle<br />Run Through The Jungle  - BoDeans<br />Effigy  - Green on Red<br />Premonition  - Chris Isaak
B008Y7GSS4|1.0|Exceptionally bad performance. Very poorly written and haphazard story line. Actors seem to be struggling all the time with their dialogues.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Creative, fun, high energy, love love love them! I hope they do a US tour soon, maybe after baby? Their covers of recent hits are better than the originals because they put great creative spins on them.  I love their videos too, so fun to watch!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Not everyone who purchases this game has played other versions. This needs a tutorial level or any instructions at all! Thank God I didn't pay cash for this. I got it on sale using my free Amazon coins. I don't understand how this continues to receive great reviews. It's very difficult to place blocks to make anything resembling a building. Difficult and confusing controls. Very unhelpful 5 star reviews! I'd like to know more about WHY people find this addictive and fun. I'm very disappointed in this app.
B000SINT52|3.0|I like Michael Moore for his reports on various topics and uncovering of how the scammers take advantage of us the American people. This is in my opinion just ok however..
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is very addicting so unless you have free time don't play it. I got it just for something to do but ended up playing all night so it's a fun game but if your extremely busy it might not be the best for you
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I could not put this book down. The vocabulary was quite descriptive.  It was a fast read and brought up issues I had never before considered.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great show, I just wish there weren't so many long hiatuses. Even so, I'll certainly be waiting for each new episode.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I needed to show a friend this pilot, and this was the only place to go. iTunes doesn't have this one for free anymore, and my copy is acting up. Stupid iTunes.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I uninstalled this app because game kept freezing . Hard to play when it keeps messing up. Don't bother downloading
B00785P2QC|3.0|This app is fun and addicting but if you have a delay when purchasing in-game items, you don't  receive the item and you get charged.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful!<br />It took me time to find the organization of the stories. Such a creative way to tell a story over a time. Infused in the stories, is information about the different time periods.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Although I had no idea what was going on, this book held my interest throughout the whole story. To have such an incredible imagination and ability to weave this tale is truly admirable. I highly recommend this one!
193700788X|3.0|Pretty much a let down for me. The story felt rushed. That all the things going on in the last few books were wrapped up in just a few pages were seemingly incomplete. The idea to end was good but again thrown together and way to many characters were introduced just to end their part in the series.<br /><br />Don't get your hopes up by this book
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is very addictive. I have it on several of my devices. I wish there were even more stages and vehicles. Thanks for a great game!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I loved this movie! Rodriguez, the man, his music and this story are so incredible! I recently saw him in concert.....his voice remains hauntingly beautiful, he didn't get the opportunity to blow out his voice the past 30 years. The movie is well done.....I loved the part in the movie when the South African man is speaking on the phone to Rodriguez.......' it was the best day of my life' :)
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Fun game for when your bored also places chalenges so there's more to do all in all a good game I can tell they spent time on it
034580404X|4.0|The raunchy sex exploits were interesting, sometimes tiring. The proof reader should be sacked as there was poor editing standards. It was not a serious read. It was a  fun girly read and a tease once you got through the first book that put you through passages designed to shock and some may have given up mid way through book one.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love this show! So glad I could order it on Amazon! I missed it on TV the night it aired.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's so cool. It's so real love it LOVE it you should buy it so much fun yay good for any age
B004LWZW42|5.0|make my collection complete, already have x-man one, two & three, now I can watch them went ever I want to
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I've been waiting for this for months so it's safe to say that i had high expectations :D and it does not disappoint! Kind of obsessed, like how i was for the first two quell games.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|It is well written and easy to read. It is just not my field of interest so was unable to finish it.
0399213015|3.0|We absolutely love this book, the only problem is that it is way too small especially for a toddler who loves to look at the words and pictures.  I read it to her a lot and she loves it but probably won't be able to use it to practice her reading skills since the words are SOOO SMALL!  Pay attention to the description!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game. It's fun and there's no glitches. Not blurry at all! This game would be good for horse lovers!!
0596009208|5.0|As somebody with a history in C, C++, and PHP, Head First Java's unique format was an excellent change of pace for me.  Many books on programming bring up new concepts and follow it up with very large example code to show what it does, and include a CD/online resource expecting the reader to compile the code on their own machine to work along.<br /><br />Head First Java skips this step, and instead goes in depth into the components of a new concept, giving psuedo-code/partial code rather than pages of examples.  Using simple language but stressing the appropriate terms, the unique humurous format makes this my first programming book that I can simply read for an hour and leave with a good grasp of what was covered.<br /><br />I would not recommend the book for somebody that has no experience/limited experience with other languages, due to the lack of deep example code/follow-along style formatting.  However, if this is your 2nd programming language, or possibly your second book on Java, you should definitely give Head First Java a look.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Just epic very wel played and i know a lot of people will get this game it's a lot like real life very nice and organized
1594204217|5.0|This book was transformative to my thinking in many ways.  I've read most of Pollan's other books on food and plants and this ranks among the best.  Also, great recipes throughout!  I'm inspired to try my hand at some fermentations now... This book is empowering!
B00CATSONE|3.0|It was inspiring, but I expected there to be more info on Tesla and his inventions. I also want to know what happened to his inventions. Are they in a museum?And where is he buried? This book left me wanting to know more, but it was entertaining.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Loved it<br />Great combination of CD and DVD of many of my favorites.<br />Loved having both just the music and the option of seeing the videos as well
1419701533|5.0|The books kept my kids quiet In the car for about a week!!! My kids were glued to the books
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I really love it. I think it could be for everyone!!I love it.  ;) I really recommend you to get this app.
B00C6TUXN2|5.0|I am biased because I really love Willie Nelson. Needless to say I was not disappointed in this album. He takes some daring liberties with some standards but he puts his own signature on the tunes and if you love Willie's style (as well as old classics) you wil love the album.
B0023P1D8S|5.0|I've had this original album for years. The Deluxe version is great because you get to hear these classics in various stages of development. Perhaps not essential to all, but very interesting for Black Sabbath enthusiasts.
B005R32L66|5.0|It usualy works well and free in most instances.  However, I have found it very difficult, actually impossible, to purchase skype minutes.  You should consider switching to Visa, MC or American Express.
0385736002|4.0|The Alchemyst (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel) was a good book.  It was a little confusing sometimes, and it said it happened in a few days, but it seemed like way too much for that amount of time.  Other than that, it was really good.  The characters were well-written, and there was a lot of action.  I would recommend it if you like Harry Potter.  There were a lot of mythological creatures.  I liked it, and want to read the next book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A really masterpiece that exposed the life and intrigues of two differrent social classes. You will admire and hate some characters.
B00499NHLC|4.0|I like how they updated the Sherlock Holmes series for this time period.  However, Jeremy Brett's old Shelrlock Holmes' series is still best.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Why am I even reviewing this? I'm embarrassed that I downloaded this game. It absolutely blows sandy horse poop. No thanks.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I ordered this on Amazon after hearing \\"Little Talks\\" on the radio and listening to some samples of the other songs...it is a masterpiece from beginning to end.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|it was very fun and addictive, but sometimes the screen would freeze. Also when u passed a level you could not go back to those levels. It made it hard if I was stuck on a level, so I would end up having to download the game again. overall it was very fun and enjoyable.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|If you're a West Wing fan, this is the absolute coolest way to buy it. And the show, even with a couple of weak seasons, has a frenetic pace (still love watching the walking meetings), intelligent (and intellectual) humor, and some of the best actors/actresses in the business. And Aaron Sorkin's writing (mostly in the first 4 seasons) is nothing short of brilliant. Every so often, I do a marathon viewing of all 7 seasons, just because there's nothing like it on TV<br /><br />The extras on the DVD's are loads of fun to watch. The faux portfolio case is kind of fun.<br /><br />However, I ran into one problem. The DVD's fit into paper slots, and I found a bunch of scratches. I had to return the first one and get a replacement. I'd almost take a star off, but the show is just too great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought the game was fairly decent and the graphics excellent. I would definitely play this multiple times as I already have.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|This movie has no plot.  It's not funny, it's not a good drama and the acting is terrible.  The characters are very, very, unlikeable.  I really can't think of anything good to say about this movie. Sorry.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game. I have seen dress up games that are horrible&hellip;this is DEFINITELY. not one! I liked the free version,  so I though &quot;What the heck&quot; and bought the full version. its only 1.99 and definitley worth it! (P.s I'm I teen)
B000FDVOXO|4.0|The fact that it was the Terminator that was sent back in time to rescue John is a real twist, and the T-1000 is fantastic and it's destruction  was immminent
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I viewed this film with expectations that were never met; the \\"3D\\" presentation was abominable.<br />The \\"acting\\" was stilted and easily anticipated. Having watched \\"StarTrek\\" rise from an excellent flight of fancy into constant adaptations and variations: this rendition is the worst.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I got this because I read a lot of pdf files and books that I can download off of the internet.  If I am reading a book on my iPad in this reader and have to close it, I can reopen it directly in the app and I am immediately back where I left off.  On my Kindle I have to search for the document all over again and then find the page I left.  That is the same problem I have with the Kindle reader when using it to read pdf's given the choice I am much better off sticking to the Kindle reader since it is just slightly faster loading.  The only pdf file listed when opening this app is the instructions how to open a pdf file.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best puzzle game ever! Love the 3D effects! Very challenging but not too hard. Can't wait for a sequel! You will not be disappointed.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Anne Frank shows an extraordinary writing ability in this diary. Her prose is Pulitzer-worthy. I find this to actually be a tough book to review: It can't (very fairly) be denounced based on its plot, since the author had very little control over that, so I rated and reviewed it based almost entirely on the quality of its writing, which is phenomenal for a 13-year old.
B003B02O3C|5.0|Kept me reading.  Funny book, and although a bit predictable, it was entertaining enough to want to finish.  I recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so I've played this when it first came out. I had it on Pc. then xbox. and now on tablet
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have been waiting for this app for my KF for quite sometime.  This app works at least as well as the app on my iPad and my iPhone. I will be doing a lot of my ebay-ing on my KF now.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was so fun, just like the last one. It's all the characterization of the original (albeit in an earlier form), plus big action they could never achieve. (I still enjoy TOS and the first 6 movies, though)<br />Seeing these new crewmates stumble through epic disasters and succeed is a thrill from start to finish.<br />Don;t listen to the haters. Nitpicking tech that's supposed to exist hundreds of years from now is the poorest excuse to spew internal hate and self loathing.<br />Go see it.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one, hopefully on the 50th. If JJ can't he will find a suitable replacement. Maybe Brad Bird.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|I knew about 10 minutes into this movie that I'd just wasted $4.99 to rent it on Amazon.  What is wrong with Hollywood when garbage like this is being made?
B000002OZY|4.0|It was great when it first came out and it's still great.  (Sounds even better on a CD than on vinyl.)  Pete Townsend is a genius.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love hungry shark revelotion it is sobfin and it is a relief. changer(and it is not for children under 6)
B003QO8TDC|4.0|I didn't purchase this for myself.  It was a gift for my 16-year-old granddaughter.  I liked the movie when I was younger and thought she'd like it because she's interested in dance and in all things retro.  It turned out to be a good gift idea!
B001CTDH76|4.0|I have always longed to see the very first show of the Mentalist, where I presumed it would show Patrick appearing on TV, then going home to discover the murder of his wife and children.  On videos on several websites on Simon Baker I had seen intriguing glimpses  of the distraught man first appearing in the offices of the CBI, with gaunt face, wrinkled shirt and appealing to them to talk to him.  I had hoped that this First Season would finally show me the full Pilot, or have these scenes as part of the First Season, since it was advertised as containing the Pilot in the series.<br />It doesn't.  It just starts out with Jane already working for the CBI, with no background to speak of in any of the episodes.<br />Very disappointing.  If I didn't love the series, and the personality of Simon Baker, and the respect of him as a superb actor, I'd rank this much lower.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Anything by Dr. Seuss is wonderful.  This was a gift for my 2-year-old granddaughter.  She loves it and watches it at least once a week.
B000002IWR|5.0|i chose a 5 star rating because Rush Counterparts is a great album and the tape played great, the artwork was in great condition, the case has some very minor wear.I would recommend this product to anyone who would usually listen to ,90's Rush or anyone who just loves Rush in general.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|I don't know what it is about this CD that inspires an almost religious fervor in me.  Every track unfolds in a surprising yet completely logical way. The songs break your heart and allow you to  heal at the same time.  Matt Berninger sounds like Leonard Cohen with a range, and drummer Brian Devendorf achieves the same sort of nervous mastery that Paul Motian exhibited in jazz.  You may also recognize the influence of Roy Orbison and David Bowie and U2 and even Daniel Lanois, but somehow what emerges is an original and luminous masterpiece.  No rock music that I've ever heard before --- even from The National --- is quite so breathtaking.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader and for me to read the whole book is a big statement!! I couldn't put it down!! Looking forward to the next book in the series and goin to start reading it as soon as I get done with this!!!
B001EN71CW|4.0|pro...... good quality of sound and pic<br /><br />con.... no episode list.....thank goodness wickpidia has it<br /><br />worth getting if you are a serenity buff
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I like ho games &amp; this one is fun, but when you just get interested you can't go farther without paying. I wish it would show the price for unlocking the game. I'm hesitating to do it because of that. I played another game &amp; got to this point &amp; unlocked thinking it would show how much &amp; give you the option to continue or cancel but it just automatically charged you.
193700788X|2.0|Spoiler alert!! Details of this book are in this review.<br /><br />  I have loved the Sookie series, it has been such fun reading. Well, OK, the last few books were getting to be a stretch. But all and all, I wasn't expecting this series to go out with such a whimper, instead of a bang.<br />  I am shocked and dismayed that Charlaine ended this wonderful series on such a bland, off putting note. None of the characters seemed to behave with their usual personalities and drive.  I read the entire book, wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt, even though I almost stopped reading when Sookie was arrested for murder. Oh please, tell me this book gets better. But it really didn't.<br />  Most of the book left me saying \\"huh?\\" I do wonder if this is really Charlaine writing this at all??? There are outright contradictions in Sookie's abilities (suddenly she can't read Sam's thoughts?) But mostly it was the tone of all the characters, like pale one dimensional versions of their old selves. Eric just submits to the new arrangements, even agreeing to add an extra 100 years to the marriage. No fight, no revolt. I suppose if more books were forthcoming, he could get his Viking warrior mojo back and stage a coup, but this is how it's ending?!<br />  I have always suspected Sookie would end up with Sam in the end, so she can have children. At least all the readers knew it was a possibility. But there was no real bridge from long time good friends to suddenly passionate lovers. Use of the Cuviel Dor is the suggested bridge, but the interaction of Sookie and Sam after she saved him was just downright weird. So there was absolutely no build up of a shift from friend to lover.<br />  Then there was the appearance of Claude as one of the protagonists. That whole scenario was just weird and senseless. The other protagonist made no sense at all either, Amelia's father.<br />  I gave this book 2 stars rather than one, because I did enjoy a trip back into Sookie land, albeit a disappointing one. It was nice to see a reappearance of old friends come to help her in a time of need. Sookie wonders if anyone will help her, and she finds out she has many loyal friends after all.<br />  The vampires seem to make only cameo appearances in this book. None of the normally conniving, rascally, self serving antics we have come to know and love. Sookie's triple attraction of beauty, mind reading and part fairy blood should have had a mile of vamps and supers waiting in the wings to woo such a prize once she was divorced. After all she doesn't seem that upset about it. Maybe numb, but certainly not devastated. Even Bill, who professed undying love for Sookie, doesn't even make a stab at it.<br />  While I can see Pam taking over Fangtasia, I was nonplussed she automatically became sheriff too. What about Bill being Sheriff? Where's the vamp power struggle?<br />  After this book, I don't care anymore how Charlaine projects the future for her characters. I can't trust her to finish the life story of these characters true to their original presentations.<br />  Very sad and disappointing  way to end this series.
0307200477|5.0|This darling simple book is so sweet and perfect for toddlers age 1-2.  All 3 of my children have read it lovingly with Daddy, as they love to feel &#34;Daddy's scratchy face.&#34;  This version is larger and includes some extra spreads: shake Mummy's button box, squeak the dolly's ball, and look in the mirror.  I have no idea why these pages would have been excluded from previous versions if they were part of the original.  Note that the book is necessarily delicate, so you will want to keep it away from the baby when you are not reading together.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it.  Taking a trip, waiting for someone in a public place and even at home, I read whenever I get the chance.  Convenient.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great plot and superb action; plus awesome SFX!!!  Great movie both to watch again & again and to have in one's DVD collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it, it's very fun and it's my favorite game.<br /><br />I love horses too, and the game is awesome!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I've really liked these guys ever since I found out about them a few years ago. I'm not exactly sure how you could classify their sound, but you can hear the Zeppelin influence. It's worth the money to buy the digital version just for Gold on the Ceiling, which, in my opinion, is one of their best songs. I definitely would purchase this album again.
B006WPWH4E|2.0|There r better versions my husband said. He didn't like this version at all. He has 2 others on his Kindle.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|this book was a perfect end to this saga, could hardly set it down. as a full series this a M U S T read
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Useless, unless U r @ home to use a Wi-Fi or sitting in a restaraunt/fast food when eating. I got it for waiting @ appointments/car rides for the kids & us. I'll keep looking for a app to use without being connected.
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|it is so hard to move it around and I keep getting shot down because my gun won't move when I move and a real helicopter is better than the game.
B0086700CM|2.0|The boys read the directions, then my husband did. Directions for kids should b easy to follow & short to enough to remember.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game overall is great. But on creative mode I wish  u could use the crafting table.And I like how u have unlimited arrows.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Best movie for me. Something to watch when you need to kill some hours on a lazy day. Simply the Best!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|it is best i recommend any one that liked first one to by this its the best but needs online game play and it wold be better
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!! Had so much fun watching this movie. It kept you going from start to finish!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Such a great read! It is a quick read that keeps you engaged and thinking. One of the best books I've read recently!
B00BKBCM4A|5.0|I had already heard some of the tracks from the album. It has a relax mode feel to it, smooth.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Not near as funny as the sneak previews.  It was okay but not many laughs.  Of course his Mother was played pretty much the same as she does in the Fockers.  Overbearing, kissy, kissy, etc.  Would not watch again.
0142406112|5.0|I admit I came to STORMBREAKER through a back door: I'd just read the new YA spy book  [[ASIN:1933608528 Agent Colt Shore: Domino 29 (F.a.L.C.O.N.)]], which was great, but the next one isn't out till next year! But many of the reviews talked about how the Colt Shore series is different than the Alex Rider series, so I thought I'd better check this one out.<br /><br />They were right, the series ARE different. Alex Ryder is almost super-human, being highly trained by his uncle without ever noticing it was happening. Alex is like James Bond, in that he's a loner and the stakes are earth-shatteringly high. The action is non-stop, and I enjoyed (in both books) the opening how-a-teen-becomes a spy story. I have to admit I felt bad for Alex from the start. He loses his only family, he's brutally blackmailed (by the government!) and he never wants to be where he is. You get the feeling from the start that happiness is just not in the cards for this kid. But maybe I'm wrong--I hope I am! Glad to have so many other Alex Rider books to go. Horowitz is a master at keeping the action coming and the stakes rising.<br /><br />I'd have to say that I agree that Alex Rider and Colt Shore are much different kids. Colt is more of a \\"real\\" kid with a wry sense of humor. I'm not sure Alex would know what to make of him. But it would be fun to put them in a room together! Undoubtedly Alex would save the day, and Colt would have the best one-liners.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game. Worth the purchase. Adventure game with puzzles and hidden object scenes plus a suspenceful plot. Please keep them coming!
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|I like the style it has but I don't think Russians were allies with Nazis atleast not well enough nor long enough
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It was sad and yet humorous. However, I don't believe it met my very high expectations. I'm still glad I read it!
014241493X|5.0|John Green is a great author and I purchased this almost immediately after reading &#34;Fault in our Stars.&#34; Delivery was very fast and book was in great condition- even though listed as used.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it it is a very good game, to play' I would recommended this game to everyone so they'll rate it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging without being frustrating for those who need a brain break from the day!  Hope to see the next Room available soon.
B005LAII80|5.0|Karl Urban brings Dredd perfectly alive. The plot is good.  I watch the movie a lot. It would be great for another movie from the same people and Karl Urban with a more complex plot.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I watch this show every night.  This characters are so funny.  However, I know just like previously I liked 2 and 1/2 Men, eventually it will not be shown as frequently.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I would have given it five stars, but I wasn't enthralled with the ending. I wanted to know more about what happened to Laurie. Thoroughly enjoyed the author's writing style.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the subject material. As a seasoned professional, I found new advice in the book to pursue both a professional career and a personal life.
1449320104|5.0|This is a great book for people getting into C# writing.  I wouldn't suggest it be the first book for someone new to programming, it can be a lot to take in, but you learn quite a bit. As I've been learning C#, this book is constantly at my side.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|&#34;The Way Life Goes&#34; is the best rock album I have bought in years! If you like real rock'n roll, you are going to LOVE this album. It has the perfect mix of hardcore rock songs that you just want to turn up until your speakers blow out and beautiful ballads. The lyrics are amazing- so insightful and honest. I listen to this album every day and recommend it to everyone who likes Cinderella, Rolling Stones, Aerosmith and the like. Keep on rocking, Tom!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Honestly, I had SO much fun reading this book. I laughed so hard. It was the most fun I have had since reading Wallbanger, which is another one that had me giggling throughout.<br /><br />Tangled is told in first person narrative. Drew is talking TO you. You are seeing the events through his eyes, and experiencing his feelings on them. How many romance novels have you read that are from the hero's POV? Not many, right? And Emma Chase NAILS it. Absolutely nails it. It's like she crawled into a dude's head and lived there for a while.<br /><br />A few epic quotes so you see why I am so enamored of this book:<br /><br />\\"Edward Cullen can take his stupid heroine and OD on it. Kate is my own personal brand of Viagra.\\"<br /><br />\\"Did you know that if you put a frog in boiling water, he'll jump out? But, if you put one in cold water and heat it slowly, he'll stay in. And boil to death. He won't even try to get out. He won't even know he's dying. Until it's too late.<br /><br />Men are a lot like frogs.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mackenzie raises her hand proudly. \\"I have a bagina.\\"<br />I smirk. \\"Yes, you do sweetheart. And someday, it's gonna help you rule the world.\\"<br /><br />See? Pure awesomeness. I am in love with Drew, that witty bastard. Well, I guess I can't say he's a bastard... he redeemed himself when he realized that falling in love wasn't all that bad. In fact, he was happy to do it because he finally met the woman that made it worth it. All the playboy fun in the world couldn't compare to what he felt for her.<br /><br />What I really loved is even though Drew fell in love, he didn't lose who he was. Yes, he made grand gestures...but he didn't turn into a wimp. His character was still true to who he was.<br /><br />If you want a fun, entertaining HEA story run out and get Tangled. Seriously, you won't be disappointed.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great app! Does exactly what it is supposed to do and works while the kindle is in sleep mode :) very useful and reliable. The alarm tones aware also great, none of them are too annoying. The alarm is over easy to set and turn off.
B00006JKOL|5.0|i love Jethro Tull and everything they ever did! but this one Minstrel In The Gallery, is my favorite. why you ask. because of one song One White Duck on the Wall!!!!!!!!:&#62;))))))))
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm not sure this was the best way to bend the book. I expected more at the ending and also didn't see her love life going this way. I was always a huge fan of these books but this one was not a good way to end it.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Tom Cruise is an absolutely amazing actor and his performance in this movie did not disappoint. Jack Reacher was such an action-packed and funny movie at the same time, that it definitely falls into one of Tom Cruise's best movies (Though he never really makes a bad movie). All in all, if you like Tom Cruise then you'll definitely like this movie; it's on my Top 10 movie list and definitely  a 5 out of 5.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best game ever. I am addicted to it. I have unlocked and fully upgraded everything in the game including stages. I recommend this game to everyone. It is beyond cool.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I have always been a huge Star Trek fan, so when the 2009 Star Trek film came out I was super excited and the movie did not disappoint at all. The music for it was incredible and I immediately purchased the soundtrack and loved. When the 2013 sequel, Star Trek: Into Darkness, came out I went and saw the midnight premier right away. The movie was twice as good as the first one and the music was amazing too. I've read other reviews about this soundtrack and though some people say that Michael Giacchino didn't do as good of a job on this soundtrack I totally disagree. Though some of the songs are &#34;twisted&#34; versions of the original soundtrack the music was absolutely incredible and definitely helped make this Star Trek sequel a success. Michael Giacchino is an amazing music composer, with a lot of talent, and this soundtrack is definitely worth buying.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book!!!!!!!!! It's a little confusing at first but it's awesome!!!!!!!!! You should read this book! I love the ending
0981951252|5.0|Darren Hardy is one of today's most outstanding leaders in personal development.  This audiobook was very nuts-and-bolts...not high level theory I can't use.  As a bonus, Hardy has provided the link where you can download for free the worksheets that are at the end of the paper book chapters.  So I can listen in my car and do my homework at home;  Awesome.  Anyone in network marketing - or really anyone wanting to make positive changes in their lives should check out this audio or book.
B008RNYNDM|4.0|I had to get this. It was on my wishlist for 20 some odd years, as I adore (d) Ken Russell films Lisztomania does not disappoint with weird phallic high jinx eluding  that every musician is a stud muffin with insatiable lust for something/anything. There are weird eerie drippy Davy Jones lovesick slurpee parts that left me cold. But it beats Rocky Horror in  sheer phantasmagoria. Real women with breasts (you remember them?) The bwana papa wanna dream sequence ,just great  with subterranean subversive Satanic mayhem.  And just gets worse when Wagner comes to his adulthood. I don't want to give it away. Rick Wakeman segue way is gonzo. Add a star if you thought Roger Daltrey was your own private heartthrob . I saw The Who 11 times live in the US before 1971, this isn't for you. This is for Ken Russell fans with a smattering of classical music history. In this respect, I hope you will thoroughly enjoy this golden egg. Keith.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played on my tablet. It's a must. The developer deserves whatever rewards they get and I'm definitely looking forward to 20000000 and 30000000...

193700788X|1.0|This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It was boring. It felt like Harris was just going through the paces to wrap up the series. Every character who was ever in these books was given a cursory mention, then dismissed. The drama, if you can call it that, lasts for 10 pages and was so incredibly formulaic, you know exactly what is going to happen. Sookie gets shot. Yawn. There is someone in the woods, the good vampires save her. (Rubs eyes to stay awake)<br /><br />And the ending? You have got to be kidding me... It was literally along the lines of ....no matter what happens, I know I can survive it because I'm Sookie.<br /><br />Barf.<br /><br />So glad this series is OVER! Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money, or reward Harris with your money for such crap. Get it from the library or borrow it from a friend who got suckered into paying for this book, like me.<br /><br />I want my $15 back and the two hours of my life I wasted on this, ahem, &#34;book.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i like thos game it is awsome i love it most challenging just like temple run i just love it love love it i love this game thank you so much killo games

B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Let me start this by saying I'm a major Studio Ghibli fan as their films are all superbly done and have stories with characters that matter to the viewer. This one is no exception. I particularly like that it is set in the early 1960s, a period before Japan had become the economic powerhouse that it is today. As usual, the characters are delightful and the ending is equally a treat. It looks at how things used to be and if you have every lived in or visited Japan during this period of time, you will recognize a great deal of the surroundings. Enough from me. Buy this one. You will be so glad that you did. I've viewed it at least a half dozen times in the last few weeks and it is just as delightful the last time as it was the first.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is early Johnny Depp, with Depp at his most daring best. The plot is a bit far-fetched at times, but the acting is always superior. A great DVD to wind down a turbulent week at work. In a sense, a tribute to those of difference who make a difference--not necessarily for others but for themselves--in their own world of mentally and psychologically challenging experiences.
193700788X|5.0|I think Charlaine Harris writes the best end of series books that I've ever come across. She takes care of her characters. You know that life will go on, and that they will have other things happen to them, but at the end of her last book in the series book, you are satisfied that the character you have come to love has come to the right stopping point in the series.<br /><br />And that is what this book is. Maybe I knew what to expect because it isn't the first end of series book that I've read by this author? Maybe I was one of the people who continued to enjoy the series well past the first 4 or 5 books?<br /><br />I'm not going to bother with a plot summary. Frankly other people do that better than I do. But I am going to try to explain something I've learned about Charlaine Harris' main characters.<br /><br />Somewhere out there, right now, there is a girl, living in the South. There is something weird about her. Maybe she can hear what other people think? Maybe she is recovering from major rape and abuse? Maybe she is extremely short, and a bit odd looking, and no one takes her seriously? Maybe she has been struck by lightening? Probably it is some other situation and problem, because Charlaine Harris is probably writing about her right now.<br /><br />Something in her life is going to come to a head. And there is going to be a situation, probably an ugly murder, but possibly something else. And at the end of the first book in that series, that girl will have turned a corner of some kind, but it will take the entire series for her to have remade her life.<br /><br />That is also what Sookie did in this series. If you go back to the beginning you will find a very fragile and frightened girl, clinging to her grandmother, and barely making it through her day. One thing I can say about the end of this book, because it really is not a spoiler, is that Sookie is no longer fragile or frightened and she has a world full of friends who value her.<br /><br />And that isone of the reasons I loved this book and the entire series. I liked living in Sookie's world. I liked the person she became over the 14 years that Charlaine Harris wrote about her.<br /><br />Can't wait for the first book in the next series. Meanwhile I just might read all of the old ones one more time.
055380684X|5.0|If you're a teacher, parent, coach, group leader, musician, athlete, artist or anyone interested in learning, I'd suggest picking up a copy of Daniel Coyle's \\"The Talent Code.\\"<br /><br />I've been reading quite a few books on learning and creativity lately, and unlike some that rely on perceived experience and a certain level of speculation, Coyle's work here provides a good bit of documented research, and he has frequent, useful footnotes and a substantial endnote section on sources. Many pages in my copy are dog-eared for future reference; a great sign for a book.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great apparently.There's an abundance of information and fun word games. I love it, and would recommend it to anyone who uses a dictionary and/or loves the English language.

B004EWFV9K|5.0|In THE TROUBLED MAN,Henning Mankell brings to a close the fictional life and times of Swedish police officer Kurt Wallander. Throughout the series, Mankell has constructed an eminently believable account of an ongoing career of a policeman who seems to have been created fully formed as a career law enforcement officer who solves crimes while all the while battling personal demons. He drinks too much, eats irregularly, has a dysfunctional relation with his father, daughter, and wife, and refuses to take even the most elementary precautions to preserve his health. Yet in novel after, novel, Wallander gets results. The bad guy is always apprehended. Mankell's legions of faithful readers have grown to expect no less. But here, Mankell shows us a truly troubled man. Is this man of troubles a high-ranking Swedish naval officer who disappears and Wallander is tasked to find out why? Or is he Wallander himself who early on in the book shows increasing evidence of a creeping onset of dementia? Wallander is continually falling asleep during daytime, suffering mental blackouts, and forgetting who he is, where he is, and even why he is. This is, of course, most depressing for readers who might wonder why Mankell is so determined to portray a previously indestructible hero as yet one more victim of the cruel ravages of time. And cruel these ravages are. They weigh so heavily as a suffocating blanket of nihilism that one might be forgiven for thinking that Mankell's real purpose for this final entry was not to provide a satisfying exit for Kurt Wallander but rather to write a polemic disguised as fiction. Still, as I read through this long last look at Kurt Wallander, I was reminded of the Wallander of the previous books. THIS was the man whom I shall treasure as the essence of Mankell's vision. The Kurt Wallander of the final chapter was a bitter reminder that no one may safely and eternally pursue his dreams of a better society without the possibility of failing to uncover all the subtle clues of one's own fate.the subtle clues of one's own fate.

B003719G40|3.0|I was given the option of reading this book or marriage counseling before I got married last year. Chose the book. It was a good read but I can't say I agreed with everything in it.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|J.J. Abrams understands how to visually create highs and lows, excite people with his visuals and style and keep a story moving. I will give him that, but I would argue that he doesn't understand the first thing about what makes a story, good. I reviewed his version of Star Trek and I stand by that and because of that I had to, at least, give this one a chance. So I did and this was left wanting.<br /><br />I don't need to restate the excitement factor that J.J. Abrams clearly understands, it is the story of this film (via Orci, Kurtzman, Lindlhof and by extension Abrams) that fails so miserably. In an attempt to remain spoiler free. Many elements of the story are included for what only can be determined to be for their excitement factor and visual style. Often, the actions of the characters make little or no sense in the greater context. Scenes exist only because they are pretty. *Keeping this review spoiler free is trickier than I thought* Sure, we can point at almost any film and laugh and/or poke fun at its inconsistencies and lapses of logic, but this film seems to put that on display, as if to rub our faces in it and say, \\"This is exciting isn't it? I dare you to say its no good.\\" And yes, it was an exciting film, yet it was no good. It insults us by lowering the bar on what we should expect from our entertainment, as if to say one element (storytelling) isn't nearly as important as the other (excitement). But it is, at least to me. If you went to this film to simply 'ride a roller-coaster' than I say you got what you paid for. If this would have simply been a film without the Star Trek universe overlayed on top, I dare say I too would have enjoyed it on that level.<br /><br />From a 'Star Trek' perspective, I am doubly insulted. J.J. Abrams and his writing team clearly have no basis or strength in Science Fiction and have nothing creative or original to add to Star Trek. The most frustrating part of this film for me is that there is nothing new here. It is simply a rehash of old Star Trek storytelling ideas and concepts, capitalizing on the 40+ years of pop-culture influence, while avoiding almost everything related to its original genre of Science Fiction. Kind of strange considering they wanted to 're-boot' the universe. Instead we are getting the same-old, same-old yet with less emotional impact as these characters don't share the same history as the original ones. It is simply baffling.<br /><br />As for the secret of Kahn in the media and the magic blood others mentioned? Well, I am left speechless, or wordless as the case may be. Ugh.<br /><br />Judging by its mediocre opening and lack of staying power (it is fading fast), I can only hope this is the end of J.J. Abrams being in control of Star Trek. Home Video brought this sequel to life (why do you think it took so long to get made?) I can only hope this film will not repeat that feat. Perhaps (I can dream) J. Michael Straczynski will finally get a chance to truly reinvigorate this franchise.<br /><br />Despite the bile that rises in me when someone mutters Abrams and Star Trek together in the same sentence, I am actually looking forward to see what he can do with the Star Wars universe. That is a genre I feel he is better suited for.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I was skeptical about watching a movie on slavery and bounty-hunting, but the movie turned out to be great. The acting was excellent!!! The comedic timing was a work of art.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it contains an excessive usage of the N-word and blood. But, hey, this IS a Quentin Tarantino movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game!!!!  It has awesome graphics.  The puzzles are challenging, yet solvable.  I can't wait for the next one.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|It was excellent. I would recommend it to everyone I know because it was suspenseful, well presented and full of messages. It deserved all of the awards that it received.
B009KG7EMC|5.0|WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE WHEN YOU PUT A RECIPE OF ALL THE GREAT ACTION STARS OF ALL TIME ON ONE FILM.  IF YOU ENJOY ACTION FROM START TO FINISH THEN THIS IS FOR YOU.  ALSO SHOWS HUMAN SIDE TO THIS BAND OF DEFENDERS.  LOVED IT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the coolest game that has a horse in it. Maybe the coolest game in the world, maybe even in the galaxy.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A beautifully created series that has helped to educate the students in my husband's Earth Science class and has provided quality entertainment for our family.
B0035G0U2O|5.0|I loved the movie, which is horrible to say since this movie is about a series of catastrophic natural disasters. And yeah, I know the storyline is a cliche but the graphics for this movie were great (and so was the acting). So, I guess five stars for the graphics and 3.9 stars on the storyline. Overall, I recommend watching it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I liked the character of David - a kind. ,caring  ,and most of all --he was honest. What a better world this would be, if more lawyers and politicians were more like him. He treated his wife, friends, coworkers, family with respect.<br />As for the book altogether, I couldn't put it down, and if I had to, I couldn't wait to get back to it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a smart, cleverly written novel written from the male point of view. I found this to very fun, fast moving, and enjoyable. Well done. I want more from this author.

B0063GORYU|4.0|Great game lots of fun and all at a price that can not be beat.  I would definitely recommend this game.
193700788X|1.0|I cannot express how glad I am that this series that I once loved is now finished. I'm not sure why the series had to decline so sharply in quality over the last few books, but it did. And with this last book, it continued that decline. No, it didn't continue that decline; it jumped off a cliff and sank to the very bottom of the ocean in quality. It wasn't just a little bad. It was horrible. It was awful. It was a cross between mind-numbingly bad and just plain torturous.<br /><br />I know that some have been quick to say that the backlash related to this book has to do with who people 'shipped Sookie with. Even though I'm a Sooric (Sookie/Eric shipper), I can honestly say that that has nothing to do with my distaste for this book. And I'm a bit perturbed that people think that upset fans are really that shallow. I would have been fine with her ending up with just about anyone in the franchise, as long as there was a proper build-up to the relationship. And even if it ended with a sudden relationship, like it did, I wouldn't have dismissed the book as being bad just for that.<br /><br />No, the reasons that this book sucks are a bit more complex than that.<br /><br />1.) For the first nine books, Sookie had a definitive voice. She was likable. She was funny. She wasn't always the brightest or least-self involved character in the world, but she wasn't the most shallow and she wasn't horribly rude. At some point in the tenth book, this changed. Sookie became more hateful. She became more judgmental. She became obsessed with the most idiotic things. She became a character that disgusted me. By the time I finished this book, I felt like I had been reading from the perspective of the villain for the last 13 books. She was just rude, bigoted, and selfish. She tried to make it seem like she was a good person, but it was quite clear in her attitude and dismissal of certain characters (and their species' in general) that she was just as bad, if not worse, than the antagonists. Oh, and she wasn't just judgmental of bad guys. No, she even judged Tara for still being two sizes bigger than she was pre-pregnancy. She just had twins and Sookie is judging her for not bouncing back quick enough. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. Oh, and everything that Eric does in this book is somehow wrong. He comes to Sookie's house to tell her that he still cares for her and is leaving someone outside to protect her since he can't, and she gets pissed. He bails her out of jail, she gets pissed. He wants to keep her in his (un)life, she gets pissed. He agrees to being away from Pam and Karin for a longer period of time to keep her protected, she gets pissed. He makes it so that she can't be hurt by any vampire ever, she gets pissed. She is just so pissy in this book.<br /><br />2.) For a character who has been sexually assaulted and a writer who has as well, the lack of compassion for Eric being sold into sex slavery with his marriage to Freyda was appalling. (His being forced to have sex with Freyda is described as a cushy benefit of his job.) What was also appalling is that even after Bill attempted to rape Sookie in Club Dead and after finding out that their whole relationship was built on him using her, meaning that any sex that she consented to was consented to under false pretenses and was, therefore, akin to rape, Sookie is still attracted to him. She describes his kissing like it's magical and wonderful. She lets him in her house whenever he wants. She doesn't care that he brings along a character in the beginning of the book that is actually out to possibly impune her character. She gets all googly eyed when he's around. If she can so easily dismiss Eric for being a vampire and therefore soulless, evil, etc., then why can't she do that with Bill? Why is he immune to her bigotry?<br /><br />3.) At one point, Sookie says that she doesn't think that her relationship with Eric was meant to be because he wanted to save it using the cluviel dor. She doesn'tthink magic should be used to save or create a relationship. She then turns around and hooks up with her \\"HEA\\" because the has opened his eyes to the fact that he wants to have a relationship (with wild seal sex) with her. If magic can doom her relationship with Eric, why can't it doom the relationship with Sam? Because, technically, the only reason for their hookup is that she used magic.<br /><br />4.) For twelve books, Sookie was the sole narrator. For twelve mysteries, we only knew what was happening in the story based on what Sookie knew. For twelve books, that format was good enough for all involved. Why, in the thirteenth and final book, do we have to go from first person (Sookie) to third person? It was annoying. It made it harder to read. And it just seemed lazy.<br /><br />5.) Speaking of laziness, there were times when it seemed like CH just half-assed her way through chapters and scenes. Either we were being told every single mundane thing that some random character was doing, or we would get one or two sentences that seemed more like they were part of an outline for the story. It was annoying and I can't believe that someone along the way didn't pick up on how bad that made it look. Of course, there were other editing issues with this book, so I'm wondering if maybe the editor just ignored all the issues that were going on in the book.<br /><br />6.) When Tyrese is given HIV as part of a Faustian deal (on page 17), I got a bit pissed. Using an illness as a punishment for someone selling their soul is just wrong on so many levels. It makes it seem like it is okay to say that anyone who ends up with a disease, especially a deadly disease, is somehow responsible for ending up with that disease. It makes it seem like diseases are punishments from a supernatural force. Equating the cause for having a disability with selling your soul/sinful behavior? It is offensive. Absolutely offensive.<br /><br />7.) The character interactions were off. The whole story lacked flow, but the character interactions were some of the worst. It was almost like watching a student film where no one in the film actually knows how to act. Basically, reading the interactions was like watching a trainwreck...in slow motion.<br /><br />8.) Speaking of the characters, was it really necessary to have so many of the less-important characters from past books in this particular book. Did we really need Barry and Quinn and Mr. C and Diantha and Amelia and Bob and Copley and Johan and on and on and on? I know that Charlaine probably wanted to have Sookie have this one last battle with all her friends and enemies, but it wasn't really necessary. Sometimes less is actually more, especially when it comes to ending a series. It just seemed like overkill.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy this book. I can't imagine anyone who has been a fan of the series enjoying it. I can't even imagine non-fans enjoying it. If there were a way to give it an even more negative rating, I would because it deserves it. This book was nothing but a waste of time. It makes the whole series, a series that I used to enjoy, seem like a gigantic waste of time. Avoid this book if you can. Even if--no especially if--you loved the series.think magic should be used to save or create a relationship.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|The story of the escape was predictable and the story of surviving an apocalyptic scenario is trendy. However, I enjoyed the read and the goal of suspense was positively achieved.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|i just adore this set!  It has the perfect range of Ms. Streisand's talents spread across a 3-dvd set and spanning an incredible career that began in the 1960's.  It is handsomely packaged in a 3-dvd set plus a booklet,  describing what lovely things you will experience while listening to the music. Even though i knew Ms. Streisand was older, i was surprised to find that her voice has lost little of its fantastic range or power.  In the 2006 concert, she seems to truly enjoy pleasing her audience, as well as in the other discs, where she shares stories about her youth, even photos of herself as a teenager.  There is a wide range of her music as well, from show tunes to ballads, to songs she has made famous in movies, even including a couple of songs she herself has written, performed, and made famous.  One disc also includes the process required to put an album together, which i found fascinating. It seemed to me she put her very heart into each and every song she chose for the album. For anyone who enjoys this genre' of music, for any Barbra Streisand fan, this set is a \\"must-have!\\" It is truly delightful! i have listened to it again and again, always looking forward to listening to it again!<br />net mcclintock

0399165274|5.0|Frederick Forsyth's latest thriller concerns the search for a top jihadist terrorist who is targeted for assassination.  The bureaucratically named Technical Operations Support Activity masks a secret government organization whose purpose is to carry out such tasks.  The lot concerns the identification and location of the terrorist who is hidden through a morass of intricate computer defenses which are described, as usual with Forsyth n considerable detail.  This author has the remarkable ability not only to describe technical details but to make them both intelligible and fascinating to the non technical reader (amongst whom this reviewer is very firmly numbered).<br /><br />Forsyth always surprises with intricate plots with twists and turns.  It is quite remarkable, given the density of plot and detail of the processes, organizations and equipment contained in the novel that it, nevertheless, proceeds at a rapid clip, never losing the reader's interest.<br /><br />I recommend this thriller unreservedly.<br /><br />Enjoy the read.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I love the way the content is presented - well organized, intuitive and thorough.  Can specify that you're from the US and news is prioritized accordingly, though the British perspective and flavor aren't lost.  Sports, of course, include cricket and plenty of football (aka soccer) ... just hope rugby is given its fair share of column inches. App is a keeper and stays in my Kindle's favorites / carousel for daily reference.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I found 'Oz the Great and Powerful' a very enjoyable movie.  Yes, there are flaws, but, I felt the movie on a whole outweighed the little things that bothered me. I got a kick out of certain details from the book and/or '39 movie...one being, the horse of another color :)<br /><br />Like many, I grew up with the '39 flick and had seen it on the big screen during film anniversaries and on tv, plus I own one of the many deluxe editions. I've always hoped that the movie industry would leave this iconic movie alone and not do like they've done and still doing with so many, make a redo. Much like the other big '39 film...Gone with the Wind....Wizard of Oz....could never be redone and still hold the magic of the original even with all the flaws.<br /><br />To me, Oz the Great and Powerful, adds to the magic without touching the original..it kind of enhances it, explaining how some of the things seen in the original came to be. Yes, it's not perfect, like some of the CGI parts or even some of the acting...Mila Kunis comes to mind, but, again, as a whole, this movie enhances the original. Also, the movie brings in parts of the books that the original didn't..one example being, Glinda the witch of the North in '39 movie is Glinda the witch of the South from the book.<br /><br />There are definite errors in this movie. Again, the CGI gets irritating at times and some obvious mistakes, like the brush is dry when gluing the china doll and rope/burner issues on the hot air balloon just to name a few. But, even with mistakes, it was still a great movie...at least to me. By the way, look up the goofs for Wizard of Oz '39 on IMdb or any other movie as it appears that really no movie is screw up free ;)<br /><br />The bottom line for Oz the Great and Powerful. If you enjoy fantasy films and are not stuck on every technicality out there and just want to enjoy a flick, then by all means, give this one a shot. But, if you're looking for a dead on right down to the detail from either and/or both the '39 movie/Oz books, then this movie isn't for you...
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you liked Hunger Games, you will enjoy this book.  Author is very creative and keeps you interested until the end.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This felt short & forced like she was trying to tie up too many loose ends so she decided to make one big knot. And then decided she didn't really like the knot so she cut it off.<br /><br />I like the series as a whole and a lot of the characters. I can't imagine how hard it is to create an entire imaginary society let alone the several that exist throughout the series so I commend the author on that and her characters alone. This book however was not able to mask the fact that it was likely written to appease the editors & fans demanding more, and to get the author out of Bon Temp without banishing her for life. it was a good run that just lost its steam
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a good HO game. The graphics are clean and clear and the storyline is engaging. The monkey is a bit odd, but I'm just not used to having a 'helper' in a game. The HO scenes didn't take over the game - this is a story with some HO games within, but they don't take over the game. I prefer the games like this - there are HO scenes, but you have to do a lot more than search for hidden objects to progress in the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book for almost all ages! Around ages 11 and up... this is a breath taking novel! It's a must read! If you like the book watch the movie. I guarantee you'll log  it!!!:)
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I had heard so many positive reviews about this movie, so I was looking forward to something stellar--or close to it, but this movie disappoints for the most part. First of all, it's really long and the first 1.5 hours are just boring--they just drag on and on and are kind of depressing (Yeah, yeah--I know that can be artsy--and I can dig that kind of artsiness, if done well--but this was just uninteresting). On the plus side, Robert DeNiro and Jennifer Lawrence (who is generally unimpressive, in my book) were both really excellent in their roles (esp. DeNiro). It just felt like the kind of movie that was trying to be deep/intellectual/touching...but was actually pretty dull. It's a bit of an &#34;Emperor's New Clothes&#34; situation where it seems like everyone is supposed to say how great it is b/c it makes you look non-intellectual or not deep enough if you don't like it, but I'll put it out there: this movie just isn't in the arena of truly deep, thoughtful, artistic films (even the popular ones).
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I started reading the book but found it confusing, so I ordered the movie through Amazon (it was only $3.99 as opposed to $6.99 on Dish Video on Demand).This is a movie that will really make you think about the way the world is heading today. I highly recommend it.
B0095P33IW|3.0|If you like lots of shoot 'em up beat 'em up movies you'll like Captain America. Personally, it's not one of my favorites.
B00BDSRFG0|5.0|This is the real deal, just a timeless hunk of straight ahead Metal/Hard Rock, take it from a cat that saw ALL the masters in their prime live, these boys GET what this style is all about. In a crowded market of other bands TRYING to nail this kinda thing, the BEGGERS do it justice, and with a second CD of kick butt live stuff, this is indeed value for money, haveta say that it's perhaps time for Michael  to ditch ARCH ENEMY and just do this stuff full time, Apollo can sing rings around Angela Gossow, this is a genre just made for classic guitar/organ workouts, and this CD doesn't let up from start to end, so what more can you ask for, great singing/playing, value for money, and great production, just do without something this week abd score this sucker ASAP!
B003UESJHO|4.0|good movie. Parts were a little violet for my taste and the language wasn't the best but the overall plot was good.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|I've had a few problems with it not loading/crashing, but once it loaded, I love it! Finding the jewel in various levels is fun, and over all, the game is different enough from the other Quell games so it's not more of the same, but similar enough that it's still Quell! Once I get passed the loading issues, I'll give it a 5 star rating!

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Thirteen is a good album for the most part.It is a mixed bag of different periods of megadeth.The song new world order is updated and re recorded from the countdown/youthanasia period.A few other gems for me were black swan and guns,drugs and money.Megadeths' newest album super collider blew me away as i purchased it today and listened to it whole.I have read alot of negatives from fans stating that i was another Risk,I can honestly say that there is absolutely no way the two albums can be drawn in comparison.While the album is no Endgame it certainly retains where they were headed with 13 and if anything else they nailed it with the record being more consistent and overall the flow of the album from one song to the next.I recommend 13 but if i were to pick between the two of them i would definetly go with super collider.I was there when peace sells was released and in 2013 I am amazed that Megadeth not only survived the changes in the music landscape and longevity,but they are still recording great music and are still inspired to push the envelope even at their age!...While these are not p.s. or r.i.p or even c.t.e,they are megadeth 100%!...I wish i could say the same for Metallica but at least we have Dave Mustaine and the great talents that complete this amazing lineup of Megadeth(Chris Broderick,Shawn Drover and Junior(Dave Ellefson)...\m/
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Ah yes, much critical verbiage has been poured forth in rightly praising this magnificent album.  BUT, the truth of it has yet to be told.  It is really about my little city and the redneck hills nearby--immortalized by Dylan as Scarlet Town, especially the amazing and horrifying story of my brilliant, cultured and seductive Romanticism professor, and the downward spiral and death of my mother, the finest teacher and the finest person I have ever known.  It chronicles the obsessions of several of my friends, who became, tragically, our enemies.  It is a miniature epic poem--beginning \\"in medias res\\" as the party continued throughout the carnage.  It is Spencerian, \\"A while / the smile of heaven descends,\\" and Dylan has a date with The Faerie Queene.  He drags \\"Hector's corpse / Through the mud.\\"  There are between two and five meanings to each line, but each one has a primary meaning.  I am quite certain of all of this, and others are too, here in Scarlet Town.  My mother is no more.  It is more than I can bear, but Dylan has captured all of the confusion and horror of the past two years in art forever.  I'm just glad it makes me feel anything at all.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I think the writing quality went down in the last several books. Her first books were fun, witty, and sexy with really good characters. The writing style, tone, and even the characters changed against their original characterizations in the last few books. There is no fun. There is no wit. There is no fire.<br /><br />She seems almost lazy with the actual writing to get her plot where she wants it to be. She did end the series as I think she sought out to originally, but I honestly haven't truly enjoyed the series since book seven. I think that was the last book that Harris stayed true to her original tone, writing style, and characters.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I wanted a tribal bellydance video that really broke down all the different moves, since I consider myself a beginner (took about a year's worth of belly danceclasses).  This wasn't it.  BUT, the workout and the format are so great that I've gotten a lot out of it.  I like Rachel Brice's lightly playful demeanor, I like the layout and sequence of the workout (yoga to drills to dance), and what she can do with her body is inspiring!  I do this video about once a week for an hour and a half, fast-forwarding to the parts I want.  I don't think of it as a &#34;workout&#34; (though it is), but time for myself.  I always feel better after, emotionally and physically.

B00CW665VI|5.0|An eye-opening journey into the warped, misguided and ridiculous mind of a self-centered man!<br />You will laugh out loud, cringe, roll your eyes and shake your head while you follow Drew's journey to deal with feelings he's never had before. I loved Drew and Kate's relationship and how they fought as they were battling the obvious feelings they were developing for each other. Drew reminded me a lot of an Archie Bunker type, but the relationship he has with his niece, Mackenzie, was touching. It takes a child to reduce a macho man to jello!! But for every lesson learned, Drew wouldn't disappoint without his quick wit, chauvinistic view and inappropriate advice! Case and point: \\"For God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break.\\"<br />You will love this book! A true testament that when you find true love it can turn your life upside down and tame even the wildest of souls!

B008XG1X18|3.0|The game is OK but too confusing with all the options for adding and using coins. Would like to see it simplified.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I loved the story but was disappointed because I expected a real work of science fiction. This really is a young teens book, and a very good one.  But the protagonist is too perfect and unbelievable.  It reminded me of the \\"twilight Series\\". Obviously not for the story line, but for the age group for which it was directed.  I expected more, but am still giving it four stars because it was very creative and fun to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first bought the book i didn't know what to expect. I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, so I already know what happens, but this book answer so many questions and confusions I had watching the movie. Took me 2 days to read!

B00COGZ8FU|3.0|This movie is a lot smarter than I expected- the plot was complex and well thought out. Tom Cruise is as good as he usually is, though never rising to great. Wouldn't it be nice if all action stars could be like Tom Hardy, who in so many movies proves that the \\"action\\" label doesn't excuse mediocre performances? He was perfect as Bane in the last Dark Knight movie.<br /><br />There were also some possible plot holes in the story line, though I'd have to give the movie a second viewing to figure them out. I'm not sure if I'll bother. The movie was definitely fun to watch at least, so I might watch it again. Still  not sure!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Fortunately for me, I watched the movie first, and THEN read Suzanne Collins' books.  If you want to get your kid interested in reading the book, this would be a good entre toward that end...but if you loved the book(s), you'll probably be disappointed in the movie.

144234430X|5.0|I bought this a while back & have it loaded on my mp3 player but have only gotten like 3 chapters into it as I 've been on a music kick lately & have forsaken my books on cd! I love the new format they have begun with some books by recording them specifically with mp3 data that transfers directly from the disc right onto my mp3 player without first having to be &#34;burned&#34; & saved on my computer!! I love it!! It takes like a 3rd of the time it used to to download the book on my player & uses hardly any memory at all as a huge book can be recorded on just a few cd's. For example, a book on cd recorded in the old way can take up to 15-20 cd';s to record, but the new transfer method will only use 2-3 cd's for the same amount of data. This also cuts the cost of the book way down  as they are using less cd's. Makes sense to me!!

B000000992|1.0|I love this album and I picked it up on wax. I only get things on vinyl I know I like and in retrospect, I shouldn't of got this. There's no gate-fold, no lyric sheet, no 180/200 gram pressing, no nice labels, no digital download (as of now, Amazon doesn't offer AutoRip on this either) nor artwork except on the front and back cover. Plain white labels and sleeves and standard press. *yawn*<br /><br />But I know a lot of you don't care too much about that and only care about the sound quality. I agree, I knew it came with nothing but just wanted to hear it on vinyl and I was *very* disappointed. It's mixed poorly. Lacks bass, muddy in clarity and at times tinny. Just get the CD and hold out for an anniversary or a 180 gram version. I'm holding off getting anything Tool on vinyl until they get their act together.

B00B52F278|3.0|Spartacus has been somewhat of a tumultuous ride throughout the show's history.  It began on the wrong foot, showing off generic action against bad special effects while characters spoke cheese.  A certain John Hannah carried us through the show until it hit its stride and there became one of the best shows on television for a season and a half until we faced the inevitable: Andy Whitfield was dead and not coming back, as was the character Hannah played.  Suddenly the show relied on a new actor in the role of the show's namesake to take up arms against a villain in Glaber that proved incompetent at the best of times.  They tried, bless their hearts, but the show struggled and lost direction.  Roman soldiers suffered Storm Trooper syndrome, being proven so weak compared to the escaped gladiators that any ten were not worth even a single of the weakest gladiators while Spartacus' character devolved into slow motion screaming and bouts of random speech-giving while intricately-planned battles between equal opponents and character development were put on the backburner.<br /><br />So here we come to Spartacus: War of the Damned, the final season of this epic ride, and almost immediately it became the tale of two shows; the good and the bad.  The good is the villains of the piece.  Crassus is easily Spartacus' most formidable foe yet, and gives a nuanced portrayal that at times can make you love or hate the character in a similar fashion to Hannah's Batiatus.  Much the same with Caesar, whose young arrogance is quickly proven to be well-deserved in a surprising way.  Meanwhile Crassus' son Tiberius provides someone the audience can properly despise.  This is a good set of villains most stories would beg to have as characters who can drive the plot forward and give the heroes of the story something realistically formidable to face off against.  So what's the problem?<br /><br />The problem is the rebellion side of the show.  The former slaves.  The problem begins immediately from the very first scene.  See, it's been months since Vengeance left off.  Spartacus' army has grown to the tens of thousands, if not more, and they trounce around Roman territory defeating big Roman armies.  What's the problem with this, you might ask?  Vengeance, you see, was very favorable toward our protagonists.  All the goals they had set upon joining the rebellion or escaping into freedom were met.  Spartacus got his revenge, Crixus got Naevia back, Gannicus redeemed himself to Oenomaus and everyone else, the couple HUNDRED or so who followed Spartacus, was safely free as they had wanted.  So why are they now an enormous army randomly smashing occasional Roman armies?  What is their new goal, or motivation?  This is never once answered until only a couple episodes are left and then they only name those goals to tell use that they've changed.  Just as bad, the characters are more like caricatures, a bunch of people just going through the motions of what the audience expects while occasionally given a slow motion jumping/screaming sequence.  It's bloody, it's violent, it's sexy, it's boring.  Midway through the season they decide to focus an episode on the Roman camp and it wasn't until midway through that I realized most the rebels had received all of three of the fifty minutes given the episode, and that I did not miss them at all.<br /><br />Such is how it goes for most of the season, as the Romans carry the show while rebels go through the motions and we're left cheering on classic Spartacus and his stubborn invincibility, or classic Gannicus and his drunken partying, or classic Crixus and his passion, without much real development happening.  This begins changing in the final few episodes, where they begin focus on furthering the development of certain individuals, but it is too often abridged (as in the case of Crixus, who is given months of glorious battle as he strikes out on his own...told in the space of under ten minutes) or worse (as in the case of Gannicus and Sibyl) it is completely forced.  All the while we struggle figuring out what these characters actually WANT, what they desire the end result to be.  On the flipside, the Roman camp becomes a mess of tangled plotlines, largely thanks to Crassus' personal slave Kore whose storyline slips into far too many others, pulling them together and going a whole lot of nowhere.  By the end I'd call the episodes some of the worse in the series since the original pilot but for a fantastic finale which tied everything together in almost the best it possibly could given everything which came before.<br /><br />What then to make of Spartacus: War of the Damned?  It is certainly enjoyable.  If you loved the characters before then you'll more than likely keep loving them and want to see them to the bitter end.  It has plenty of enjoyable action and sex scenes to grab your attention.  The Romans are a pure joy to watch and I would not mind at all tuning into a spinoff series focused around Caesar, Crassus and the like.  BUT, the season suffers from a lot of major storytelling issues and is poorly focused upon developing too many new characters and plots and is not the season-long sendoff one might hope it would be.

034580404X|1.0|Reading this book made me laugh and laugh and laugh! You have got to be kidding me!!! This book should come with a warning -- \\"Orgasms are not guaranteed in any of the sex acts described in this book if  you choose to attempt to try them with your lover.\\"<br />But falling victim to all the hype, I have to admit, I bought and read ALL 3 books - to give the author the benefit of the doubt. Plus - I welcomed the comical entertainment as I'm reading. IT IS comical if you think about the male hero character, a philanthropic, solve world-hunger type, 26 yr old self-made billionaire frolicking with a 22 yr old virgin, the non-stop orgasms they manage to have (on a daily basis)and the comic relief is endless!<br />From a marketing side, this book made tons of money (romance or comedy category), ergo, kudos on the success! On the literature side--- I'd like my money back please!<br />In the end, I was hot and bothered, not by fantasy sex but the whole story itself! Seriously??? Get REAL! Because of books like these, relationships fail and falter because of unrealistic fantasies and dreams that we idealized our partners to be.<br />After reading it, I looked across my husband (whom I have loved and adored for so many years) and for a moment thought \\"holy cow - why are YOU nothing like Christian's sexual preferences & romantic inclinations?\\". But I'm a realist and not some silly teenager with illusions of grandeur and fantasy hoping for a knight in shining armor who happens to be a billionaire -- I slapped myself across the face until I started laughing (and no I didn't get orgasmic)...GET REAL! Oh my... BUT what about those silly young girls who will actually think men like these or at least have 0.01% of Christians's traits ACTUALLY EXIST in our society???? OH dear, the disappointments to come in their lives when they don't have orgasms EVERY SINGLE TIME with their lovers! So sad, I can see them chasing ghosts at the end of a rainbow....no man will ever be good enough.

0307895475|5.0|After my experience attempting to play Oblivion with no help, I decided that with Skyrim, I would try out the guide book. Best decision I've ever made!! I've broken it down into the pros and cons below.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Comes with large, removable map with EVERY possible location marked. (This is my favorite part-- I don't think I could've survived long without this!)<br />- Divided into sections clearly labeled: Quests, Bestial, etc.<br />- Every faction you can join (Theives' Guild, Companions, etc.) has a quest line. This book explains them quest-by-quest in great detail, including maps and pictures of people you'll interact with. (Also, at the beginning of each quest, there's a cautionary note indicating the \\"spoiler level,\\" so you don't accidentally ruin the ending!)<br />- Full index of people, places, and objects to find what you're looking for quicker/easier.<br />- Full maps of every location with important rooms/areas marked and brief descriptions. (Meaning, even if the location you're at isn't described in detail as part of a quest, these small maps in the back of the book will still help you.)<br />- List of every alchemy item & potion (what they do, where to find them, etc.)<br />- List of every weapon and piece of armor (where to buy them, what power(s) they have, etc.)<br />- List of every \\"baddie\\" you'll fight (detailing their level, special attacks, weaknesses, and items you can collect off of them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The Quests section is divided further based on what faction's quest line you're working on. You have to flip through and find the pages labeled \\"Thieves' Guild Quests,\\" \\"Companions Quests,\\" etc.<br />- Also, when trying to find a \\"Misc. Quest\\" (such as people in town asking you to retrieve something for them), these can be tricky to find. I've spent several minutes flipping through the Quests section before I found what I'm looking for. Luckily, the Index in the back really helps with this!<br />- Not every single little detail is explained. There have been a select few times that I've had to resort to searching the internet for help. (Examples include solving dungeon puzzles, and finding a way to the location you're trying to find.)<br /><br />All in all, the pros definitely outweigh the cons in my opinion. Without this book, I wouldn't have gotten very far! If I had to pick my absolute can't-live-without favorite parts, it would be the detachable map, the bestiary, and the alchemy section. (So nice to know who you're fighting, where they're located on the map, and what to mix together without wasting ingredients!)etail is explained.

0307291146|5.0|Anyone who reads learns quickly not to judge a book by its cover. And in this case it is doubly important because neither the look nor the title serve as any indication of what is inside this classic tome. It could be argued that it is impossible to \\"master the art...\\" by reading a book, and I would agree. What is important, however, is realizing the breadth of understanding that can be gained by a careful reading of this work. It is an important work not only because of its timeliness when it was in its infancy and first published, but because it shares a timeless look into the history of the culinary arts as seen through eyes shaded by French gastronomy.<br /><br />I watched the movie \\"Julie & Julia\\", the theme from which was derived from the over five hundred recipes in this two volume set, and I also remember some of the episodes from Julia Childs early television career. I truly enjoyed the movie, but the early Julia Child television stuff was not something that modern television producers would consider a first class effort. I think, perhaps, that we become somewhat jaded by modern television and the almost universal accessibility of convenience based communication.<br /><br />Thankfully, bound printed journals such as this do not suffer the decay that is so prevalent in today's digital world.

He has a wonderful sense of humor and, even though this is a rather sad story of a little girl whose parents don't love or understand her, he has made it lighthearted and fun.<br />  Whether you see the play or read the book, you will be rooting for this high-spirited young heroine.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|It is very good. I loved the cd and I liked so much listen it. I hope to buy more cds.<br />about her I recommend  and thank u so much.
B0091REZMW|5.0|wow I love this game though you have to make sure you have a tablet or something like it<br />r
B00CWM3F4C|2.0|I have now listened to TDPDH five times through. Ironically, I had the exact opposite reaction to this album that I had to BGWTB. I liked all but two or three songs on that album, but over time thay grew on me (Much like my favorite band Rush, who by the way also employs Nick as producer, AICs music has a tendency to grow on you). Not so with Dinosaurs from the Devil. I like two songs on this album. \\"Voices\\" is the absolute strongest track, followed closely by \\"Scalpal.\\" \\"Breath on a Window\\" & \\"Choke\\" are \\"do-able\\", but the rest of the album is fodder. The lyrics on this album are simply, well, stupid, at least on some of the songs. \\"The devil put dinosaurs here/Jesus don't like a queer\\"? Or \\"Breath on a window/ showing tic tac toe\\"? WTF? Maybe they can write a song next about playing Chinese Checkers in an outhouse on a mountaintop!  My 14 year old writes better verse.<br />Okay, maybe I'm being hard, but having been a Layne Staley fan in the 90's, I was extremely pleased with AIC's first album in 14 years with Black Gives Way to Blue....that was a solid album throughout. But I believe the real Impetus behind that album was the memorialization of Staley. Now that that has been accomplished, the new line-up is gonna have to find it's own sound. They haven't jelled yet.<br />This album could be compared to, &the here I'm gonna show my age, \\"For those about to Rock\\" by AC/DC in 1980. It was an okay album with new vocalist Brian Johnson...but it couldn't hold a candle to Back in Black. A BETTER COMPARISON would be \\"Condition Critical\\" as the follow up to \\"Metal Health\\" by Quiot Riot in '84 - '85.  To end on a positive note, Devil put Dinosaurs isn't as bad as \\"Van Halen III\\" but not many albums are. I hope that AIC will get back on track by their next release.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|A routine commercial flight from Orlando to Atlanta goes dreadfully wrong when a flight-control malfunction occurs.  The aircraft's pilot, a former naval aviator hopped up on booze and drugs, does what should've been impossible - recover an MD-80 series aircraft from an uncontrollable dive and with his first officer manage to land it in a field, near a church, and right across a stream from where baptisms are occurring.  Alas, one of the flight attendants dies, which means the NTSB must investigate, putting the pilot's career in jeopardy and leading to a major crisis in courage.<br /><br />In real life, an Alaska Airline MD-83 aircraft, a relative of the MD-80, did experience such a failure, putting the aircraft into an extreme dive, in early 2000.  Though the pilots were able to recover from one dive, they couldn't recover from a second, even when they tried to roll the aircraft inverted.  Eighty-three passengers and five crew members died that day.  Which means that when the MD-80 in \\"Flight\\" tried the same thing, it should've all been over.<br /><br />\\"Flight\\", then, is a movie built around a premise that it simply cannot sustain.  In fact, everything after the crash is essentially a moot point.  All this despite normally reliable star power than includes John Goodman (who was grating), Don Cheadle (who was wimpy), and Denzel Washington (who did not have Rosario Dawson, Chris Pine, and 2,000 tons of locomotive to bail him out as he did in \\"Unstoppable\\").<br /><br />A much better movie in a similar vein is \\"The High and The Mighty\\", which is considered to be one of the prototypes of the modern disaster movie.  It starred John Wayne and Robert Stack as two pilots who run into trouble with their DC-6 during a routine flight from Honolulu to San Francisco.  That movie blends mechanical trouble and human pathos into a satisfying story.  The folks who made \\"Flight\\" would have done well to watch it before they started.
B00123NXL2|4.0|All around great album from one of the great Kings of the blues.  Some of the recordings are better than others and there are one or two songs where the vocals seem to fade out, but over all it's a great album!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I installed this on my daughter's Kindle.  She has a great time taking care of her horses.  I find it fun as well!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|A lot of fantasy books lose me at about the half way mark, the story just seems to die. Blood song kept me until the end, I read it in about 18 hours. Great characters. Good flow. Masterful story. Very well done, cant wait to get the 2nd book.
B004J4WL50|5.0|I would've loved to read more about the difficulties and mistakes made along the way since that is way mor insightful
B00821OX98|5.0|How can you go wrong when Steven Spielberg is producing? Good characters, well-paced action and good special effects on the aliens.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is fun really to play, but it is addictive. It actually seems to be taking over my life. I do wish the Team Lava would improve the way you invite &#34;neighbors&#34;.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Awesome. For a book about zombies it was really good. If you like anything about the undead then you should read this. Can't wait for the movie.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This App is terrific. Since I buy and sell on Ebay every day, it is a great way to save time.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Do I really have to explain PATTON. It's Patton people. The best part is when he yells at Rummel &#34;I read your book!&#34;.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This story,once you get into it, is about survival and the human spirit and how adaptable it really is when necessary.  Wonderful!
B00B19DW0E|1.0|It would be hard to imagine a worse movie than this one.  The storyline, dialogue, action and characters were terrible. Don't even bother with this one unless you need a nap and like some background noise.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is fun really to play, but it is addictive. It actually seems to be taking over my life, since i can't seem to cook enough food fast enough. I do wish the Team Lava would improve the way you invite &#34;neighbors&#34;.
B00B70SDXS|5.0|This was a great season - **spoiler alert if you read between the lines, though I won't specifically name characters**** BUT some much needed kill offs of massively annoying characters - you all know who I mean! One of the last kill offs was disappointing because I would have liked to seen some more character development beyond a last ditch attempt at redemption because I think that kill off was just too predictable, but the scene that got it done was riveting with the family dynamic. I get it that this is a blood & guts show, but some of the violence was unnecessarily gross, in my opinion. Seeing the special on how they made the zombie puppets thoroughly explains why they spent so much time stomping heads in! Gotta get their money's worth there!! Overall, loved it... good suspense, times when I literally jumped -- very unnerving!!! Cannot wait for next season!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|But I wish we could collect them blue gem things a lot more. Takes way to long to get them.
B00867GK26|5.0|I was very excited to purchase this movie for my son, and I was in no way disappointed. The movie has a great story, and wonderful animation. Can't wait for the next movie, Finding Dory!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|So great app!!! I don't need any other picture apps because I can just go on this...... I should be 99 cents, at least..... worth it.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I had been wanting to add this musical to my collection since I first saw it on the big screen years ago. The movie has not been available at the local stores But, I saw it on Amazon & now I have it. Thanks for sending it promptly.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I bought this for a friend of mine in Botswana. He is loves anything about nature. This was very speical and of course David Attenborough is wonderful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best i have read in a while. Put it down just to pick it up again..  i will look for Wool 6
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Good story line but not particularly well written. I have not been inspired to read any other books  written by Susan Kierman-Lewis as I belive a good editor is required.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is way too fun even for mature adults like me.  Like the idea you can progress to more difficult patterns.  Of course all the children think it is great if you play it like them.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Gone Gone Gone is my favorite on the album, but all the songs are great... Phillip Phillips is an awesome musician and I can't wait to see what he comes out with next.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I wish there was a app to read the temperature of indoors. This app is great I love it. The most used app on my fire. It just sucks that I can't figure out what my house temperature is. I have yet to find a app that can do that for me.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|this review is on the 2D blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 3.4 - 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />good but not great take on a new version of the wizard of oz.<br />great video and audio quality on this blu ray all around.<br />a must have in your collection for the oz fans out there.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|This is a great CD. JT is at the top of his game on this one. Great music to work out to.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is so cool and funny!  If I made this book I would be very happy. I love this book
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I downloaded it mainly to install Adobe Flash player on my Kindle Fire HD. But it has not worked properly as expected and I could not install Adobe Falsh player.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Love her books, so sad this is the last Sookie book.  I'm happy she ended it the way she had planned and when she did, it was time. Thank you Charlaine Harris for these wonderful books.  I look forward to your future stories with other characters.  :)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's easy to use, has large buttons. Great for e every day<br /> use around the house or at work. And it's free!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game it passes time I play it all of the time. But it needs to update
B00992CF6W|5.0|You couldn't find anything better.It's like the real minecraft but just  less stuff, you can't go to the nether but you can make it like you did  but I would recommend getting block launcher too
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Keep your mind sharp with this puzzle challenging game. I could not put it down. Looking forward to next ROOM!!!!
B009EANE3M|3.0|When The Script came on to the music scene a few years ago with their first single, Man Who Can't Be Move, I was immediately a fan.  The whole CD was great. Their second CD, Science and Faith was good too, yet nothing as stellar as  'Man ' or the follow-up single, Breakeven.  Their third release, #3, in my opinion, is the weakest of the three.  The single 'Hall of Fame' featuring Will I am is good, but overall this album lacks the magic the band seemed to have in the first two albums.  Hopefully they can rebound on their fourth. I'm keeping an open mind and my fingers crossed.
1878424319|5.0|This is one of those simple but effective things to implement in ones life to make my life experience a better thing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been delighted, this game is SO MUCH FUN!!!! I have made so many new friends playing it. The best bingo available!!!!
B000PMLFRA|3.0|Well the picture and sound are fabulous which is expected for blu-ray but.... This needs to be the original movies!!! I'm a huge Star Wars fan so I had to get them cause I want them in my collection, I still love watching them. However i will repurchase them if they ever decide to give us  fans the original movies without re-edits. It shouldn't be that hard to convert the original ones into blu-ray... Here's to hoping we get an original movie blu-ray set and that we won't have to wait much longer. Disney since theyre in charge of the franshise now need to hear the cries of fans!! George Lucas surely hasn't  and that's sad!!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Great game, very addictive, and fun. Some are challenging but always enjoyable for those boring days that we all get from time to time.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|This show is absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful dialogue, special effects, acting, music, sets, clothing, cinematography, food, etc.<br /><br />If you are looking for an intriguing and engaging series, this is it. One of the best shows currently airing on t.v. and an absolute breath of fresh air. I haven't been this excited about a show since \\"Heroes.\\"
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book drew me in from the very beginning and kept my interest.  While the story itself is somewhat dark, the main characters are warm and likeable.  I highly recommend it.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Light-hearted and fanciful, The 100-Year-Old Man chronicles the adventures of Swedish explosives and atomic bomb expert Allan Karlsson as all of Sweden, it seems, wonders what happened to him after he disappeared from his old age home and how he apparently aided in the murder of three people.  As some reviewers noted, the book drags at times, especially when Allan's backstory takes circuitous twists and turns.  No, it's not The Great American, er, Swedish, Novel, but it's not meant to be.  In fact, I had the impression at times that the author's rambles into far-flung historical events was his satirical way of spoofing The Great Serious Swedish Thriller, but that may be just my take.  Anyway, it's a fun read if you don't take it too seriously.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Some people say that Christopher's style of writing isn't very good. But I think that it makes the book what it is. A wonderful price of.literature
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Les Miserables (2012) is beautiful, heart wrenching, and uplifting. I've seen the play 6 times since 1990 and I love this movie.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|What a great game. It was a joy to play. I was a bit skeptical in the first world, but was quickly sold. You will be happy with your purchase
1451613512|5.0|I started reading this book, borrowed from our library.  Quickly concluded it is a \\"must have\\" reference for my library!  I'm a peer of Stone's, age-wise, and have resisted being recruited to the herd mentality we are immersed in through the media since I was nine and learned the \\"kiss your ass goodbye\\" drill\\" for the A-Bomb in my school.  It struck me, then, that I'd not agreed to be in a \\"cold war.\\"  I'm one of those National Merit Scholars who dropped out and later took my degrees at Anitoch University ... so Stone's \\"my kind of guy.\\"  I'm sure the right wing has a lot of b.s. to say about this book -- but don't believe a word.  I learned a lot.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|We can forgive the sappy title of [[ASIN:0156030306 Flowers for Algernon]] only because of the fantastic novel Daniel Keyes has given us. For the most part the characters are robust and transformative. Apart from a different title, more showing and less telling would rocket this novel to greatness. Still, it is one that makes us laugh and cry. A must read in literary fiction circles and a novel that should be remembered for a long time.
1451695195|5.0|I thought this was an amazing account of Eben Alexander's experience whilst in a coma when all medical indications pointed to the fact that consciousness was a miracle.  It really make one think of mortality and life beyond death from the physical body to life in the spirit form.  I recommend everyone should read this as this man was almost an aetheist,
B001OSIV62|4.0|Quietly remarkable. I am sooo paralyzed by heights, I could not watch the entire film without hysterics and over-the-top anxiety, but what I did see was an artist, possessed by a passion, fulfill a dream. Why do we dream what we do? No spills here, but if it's your thing, plenty of thrills.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|A must read for anyone who enjoys classic fiction. Such a novel story and interesting premise. One can't help but be drawn into the story
0312427999|5.0|I'd been confused:  Why dismantle government?  Privatize all sorts of services, including roads, military KP and public schools?  Why the big, never-ending push to eliminate a social safety net?  This books diagrams the whole outrageous process:  A not-so-bright economist with an over-simple slant, the sort of tack that Ayn Rand's heroes all subscribe, became the \\"intellectual\\" rationale behind the corporate drive to become world masters.  Corporations backed this wing-nut's formula for \\"perfect capitalism\\"  --- fund Cato, Heritage, endow chairs in economics, psychology, while, at the same time (and for a long time,) paying the salaries and expenses of those in politics and media who buy this \\"line.\\"  Sound like conspiracy?  Well, corporations live on forever.  Their goals are limited to growth, self-aggrandizement and dominating  markets. i.e., \\"slicing up the pie,\\" or having all of it!  People exist as investors, as management, as labor, and as consumers.  The aim of corporations is to allot and to retain as much value as is possible to only the investor class, while paying management in proportion to how well they restrict what goes to labor and into the product.  This is not secret.  Best book on this topic. .
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I bought a new ultrabook that doesn't have an RJ75 port. This solves that problem easily! I don't use it all the time, but sometimes when I'm traveling or visiting friends I need to use a wired connection instead of wi-fi. This required no effort to set up, and worked within a minute of opening the package. This is the perfect solution.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|I heard so much about this movie, I decided I had to see it for myself. Now I want my money back and I watched it for free on HBO...
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|great board game app. sqme as the original game. I have it on kindle and on android phone. 5 stars
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have only had this completely downloaded for a short time & this is busy time of year so I have not had lots of time to play...also have a couple other extra bingos to play.  When I have time I ususally enjoy WORDS first & then to bingo maybe.  Am not going through FB so I play alone & that is what I enjoy!
B000ME5B30|4.0|Had to watch for a class assignment, learned more about what is really going on with our envirnoment, and how long this information has been researched. Recommend the movie - there's lots a statistics too.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|As I said with season four I love the completed season one through five of Merlin, it's worth all the money I paid for them all, if you love this type of setting with King Arthur's time line you'll love watching Merlin the tv series they have great actors and it's enjoyable to watch each dvd and I'm glad I have the set of the show's.  Thanks Amazon for having them all.
B00BB22GQM|3.0|I've listened to this four or five times since I got it.  Decent middle-market popular music. Enjoyable, but not a lot of substance to either the song writing or the musicianship.  Check out The National's new album. That has substance in spades.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Well done control interface for touch screen. Auto firing allows you to play the game with one hand. Fairly similar levels but with enough powerups and other variety to keep you interested
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I like this game it is good for all ages it's worth a $0.99 I like all of the challenges and how u have 2 things now is cool
B0012HRJEA|5.0|Choose this rating because this was cool way of see Romeo and Juliet. The music was great and each character was a different way of presenting themselves. It stayed close to the original book written by William Shakespeare, and other movie watched. I had to watch two versions of Shakespeare videos,and this one, I liked the best.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Yes season 4 of merlin met my expectations, I love this season I have all 5 season's I'm sad to say that it has ended but as all good episodes they end.  Folks if you love shows like Merlin you'll love this collection one through five it's worth the money for the complete set.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|I've had this album on a loop for the past few hours.  Insane, I know, but it just really grows.  Definitely the best thing I've heard this year.  Such a delight to get something this good.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Pros - Wireless can transmit through walls 20ft away!<br /><br />Cons - Sound quality and precision is horrible. Sound is louder in the right ear, which I found out is a widespread issue. The wireless usb transmitter didn't work in Logitechs own usb extension device. Had to use two different usb ports. Fake leather pads don't let my ears breath, making me sweat.<br /><br />Had a Corsair HS1 before. Was way more comfortable, sound quality and precision was leaps and bounds better, MIC quality was better, comfort and noise cancellation was way better, and had a 2 year warranty that I used (due to dog) and they replaced the headset with no questions asked.<br /><br />returned this headset within 2 days.
B001MW0J2Y|4.0|The Empyrean is a great journey, and one that merits revisiting.  Here John is working from his home studio (in which he's amassed plenty of pro-grade vintage gear) and the freedom of that technology has allowed him to make what it perhaps his most lucid and expansive record.  There are wonderful mixing choices here, and always a total unwillingness to compromise his artistic vision.  It's actually hard to believe this soul was in the somewhat banal Red Hot Chili Peppers; the music here easily trumps his old band in aesthetic value and ingenuity.  \\"Unreachable\\" is a great entry point for this album, if you are merely pursuing-- consider the way its verses rely mostly on an organ/bass/drum arrangement, and how this evolves into a gorgeous psychedelic guitar breakdown, that leads, finally, into guitar/synth triumph.  It's a wildly fascinating structure, pulled off so gracefully you could mistake it for being simple.  The whole album is full of head-spinning performances and unexpected gestures.  I give it four stars because, frankly, some of the pieces here veer toward \\"very good\\" rather than \\"brilliant.\\"  It's an essential album for Frusciante fans, as well as anyone interested in sprawling guitar rock and/or emotional, psychedelic rock.  You could buy Shadows Collide With People, The Will To Death, and this... and you'd be pretty well versed on Frusciante's 2000s period.
B0056JJXOO|4.0|Watched video for English 9 class. Liked that it stayed to the book we read, The custumes and scenes were what I thought they should look like too. Would recommend this video because it's just like the story Shakespeare wrote.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I can spend hours playing this game.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes match games.  It's great to pass time while hubby watches sports events.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I like that the MP3 is easy to use and the fact that not only did I get the CD but the MP3 was automatically downloaded and ready to use, like a BOGO.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wow, Eva and Gideon  crazy relationship a the highs and lows that keep you wanting more and more. I can't believe this is my third time reading it and it was like the first time again. Got suck into it so fast. Can't wait for more.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Funny kid book about a middle school's kids life also great pictures and Actions about what to do in middle school
B001F0VHEM|5.0|What a great CD.  Pink does it again.  She is one amazing singer and songwriter.  Good CD for the car.
B0047BXRB2|5.0|A classic.  And Anne Francis, oh my.  I believe that Forbidden Planet created the &#34;Space Sci-Fi&#34; for generations to come.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|This review is for the CD version. Be aware that the digital version is english dubbed. This shows that a good suspensful thriller does not need all the Hollywood big special effects to be good. This movie was remade by Hollywood as Quarantine. If you are going to watch both, I suggest this one first. You may also check out Phase 7, it's an Argentinian production based on the same premise (read that as copycat) but is has it's own sarcastic twists.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Harry finds his future in up in the air and out of his direct control, His home is beyond his ability to save and his whole life turned upside down. Of course, this is when he is at his best. Truly, the last coyote is in exactly the position to do his best work. As he follows the winding path of clues surrounding his mothers' murder, he finally finds the twisted and sad truth.
B000I62JBE|5.0|Marlon Brando plays a high rolling fence whose time has simply run out (and he knows it). One can imagine Brando's character in his youth, reaching for his gut and crying, I just want \\"to be a contender.\\"<br /><br />In Score, Brando has become more than a contender, but now he is older, tired, over extended,  scared, and just looking for \\"some slack\\" that never comes. There is a short scene in the basement of Brando's empty mansion, Brando is sitting by his unused pool, his killers waiting in their car out front. Brando reaches deep in his gut for that same pain that he used so well in Last Tango in Paris as he cried before his dead wife's casket and makes a desparate cry for help from his friend: \\"Nickie,\\" he cries, That cry haunts me to this day.<br /><br />To experience that one moment is worth the time spent watching 100 other movie masterpieces.
B00005J73X|5.0|I love buying greatest hit CDs.  If you love Bon Jovi like I do, this a great CD of some of their greatest hits.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Unfortunately it's almost impossible to say anything about this book because everything's a secret - not just the husband's (and which husband?). Just about every character in the book has something to hide or something they need to find out, either about themselves or about someone they care about deeply.<br />So, sorry, you'll have to read this entrancing, profound, funny, biting, brilliantly written book yourself to find out!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Received this book at midnight the day it released! For certain the way to go when you have been waiting a year on a book.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I have used this product as an additional search engine for my Kindle Fire HD.  It was easy to install and has worked well.  It is a product which requires more exploration on my part but it seems to work well as a browswer for the Kindle.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy have accomplished a true tour de force with \\"The Presidents Club.\\"  One cannot read the book without coming away with a profound reevaluation of presidents from Truman to Obama.  Many pay lip service to how difficult is the job of the president, but never have those pressures and crises been explored through the eyes of the members of this most exclusive club.  Our country is more and more divided along ideological lines with compromise becoming a mortal sin.  But regardless of one's political ideology, this book offers an in depth and apolitical analysis that transforms our often two-dimensional memory of past presidents into three-dimensional people who cared deeply and struggled against extraordinary odds about doing what they saw as best for the country.<br /><br />One may violently disagree with a certain president's domestic or foreign policy, but after reading this book, no one should fail to recognize how much the president struggled with seemingly intractable issues.  At a time of divisiveness and ridicule, \\"The Presidents Club\\" challenges us to stop demonizing those with whom we disagree and rather understand how and why decisions were made in the most lonely of jobs.  We see in fascinating detail how all of them believed in making our country a better place.  We also are shown the extent to which they put aside politics to offer support and encouragement to the current office holder.<br /><br />Quite simply, a book that should change the way we think about our leaders.
B00B935SUY|5.0|I kept watching the trailer for this video and telling myself I would watch it soon.  Finally, Amazon had a 99 cent special and I had no choice than to watch it now.  After watching, I completely regret not watching it sooner.  It is worth the rental price.  This documentary creates a great conversation on whether digital is better and whether the ease of technology now weakens the music or strengthens it.  The movie is narrated and guided by Dave Grohl (who is linked to sound city in more ways than one) and has interviews that only someone like Dave Grohl could put together.  From Fleetwood Mac to Barry Manilow, the studio has recorded so many of the most influential records we know it should be preserved in a museum.  Towards the end of the movie it focuses on a new project that Dave Grohl has released \\"in honor\\" of the studio.  This part was a little slow and probably a few minutes too long but overall this still receives 5 stars from me because it has me pulling out all my old albums right now.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Alice in Chains has done it again. Not only have they made a fantastic album that is well over an hour of music and chock full of great guitar work, melody, tempo shifts, and two part vocal harmonies, but it is RARE in this day and age where the industry is not what it once was and rock music as a whole has taken a backseat in the mainstream for an album like this to ever see the light of day.<br /><br />Because of this it's quite an event for me to sit back and take in everything TDPDH has to offer; especially from a band that for all intents and purposes should've died along with the tragic death of Layne Staley. Yet here we are, and here AiC is as strong as ever with what has to be one of their best releases to date. I felt compelled to give my track by track take on the album:<br /><br />  Hollow - This song is 5 months old for me and despite that it still stands up as one of the best on the album. It's an interesting leadoff track as they don't usually open with something as moody and dark as this song is, but it works. The lyrics are very poetic (also dark) and when the second part of the chorus kicks in at the midway point it really takes the entire song to another level (which is also a sneak preview to how several of the songs on this album are structured). Great guitar solo by Jerry on this one (the first of several).<br /><br />  Pretty Done - The first time I heard the grungy power riff that starts this song off I instantly thought of Tripod. Then the sheen of Duvall's sleekly produced vocal comes towering in on the verse which is also very reminiscent of how they made Layne sound on that album (Again comes to mind specifically) and it confirms that this song could've been lifted right off that album. Lots of tempo shifting throughout after the second chorus and it's hard to pinpoint a conventional song structure (the first of several on the album). Really dig this song and love how it closes out with the extra vocal bit and slightly faster tempo at theend.<br /><br />  Stone - The other well known song that's now been with me for over two months, and it also still stands up as a strong addition to the album with its intense and just wicked pulverizing riff. Like the song structure as well on this one as there isn't really a conventional chorus but just the tempo shifts that happen in the verses themselves. The soaring guitar solo from Jerry is one of the best in their entire catalog.<br /><br />  Voices - STRAIGHT OFF JAR OF FLIES. The amazing and atmospheric intro/outro of this song is one of those detail oriented things that take a song from good to great (or great to amazing if you're talking about this song as far as I'm concerned). The verses are very pop sounding in the delivery of the two part vocals but the power of the vocals behind the simple acoustic riff really sets the tone of the verses (and the song itself). It continues as the chorus comes swooping in out of nowhere and grabs your attention every time it appears. The urgent sounding melodic riffs that periodically appear just simply puts the icing on the cake. This is the type of song this band has always done extraordinarily well, and this one is definitely no exception. Not only a favorite but probably a new entry into my top 10 AiC songs ever.<br /><br />  The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here - I was skeptical about this song going in as I've never been the biggest fan of the title, but my skepticism quickly disappeared as soon as I heard it. The metallic sounding main riff is one of the most hauntingly ominous riffs I've ever heard. I really like how the vocal delivery in the verses are structured and are equally as haunting and just as ominous as the main riff itself. The rest of the guitar work and solo are also just top notch. Very original and effect laden song (the small riff that could pass as a dinosaur is a nice touch) that doesn't let up or get stale at all during its 6 and a half minutes. Another song that features a great outro as well.<br/><br />  Lab Monkey - This song starts off at a very slow pace and continues down that path for the first 2 minutes.  Just when my interest starts to wane the song shifts into something completely different with a very melodic groove and then after an even higher tempo change slows back down to some interesting sounding breakdown. Definitely one of the more interesting AiC songs and it took me a few listens to really `get' it, but once I did it's up there for me with all of the rest.<br /><br />  Low Ceiling - `Old Mr. Fun is back...wonder where he's been hiding at?' Love the melodic intro to this song with the classic Layne style (AHHHH) vocal over the top (that also gets repeated again before the solo). One of the more upbeat songs on the album relying on a simple melodic progression in the verse and then vocal rich chorus. Guitar solo would sound right at home on an Aerosmith or Slash album. Great song, and yet another one that progresses into a great outro.<br /><br />  Breath on a Window - HUGE highlight for me. Another upbeat song that starts off with your vintage Jerry riff and chorus that wouldn't sound out of place on one of his solo albums. What comes just after the 2 minute mark is where the song gets put into a completely different stratosphere. This was briefly previewed on the Itunes sample and cuts off JUST as this part was starting, and I thought to myself then that the song sounded like it was going somewhere really cool. I wasn't wrong. The melodic riff that kicks in here is great and continues for a bit, and then goes into some riff that reminds me of Whale & Wasp off JOF. Then it shifts into this FANTASTIC melodic outro that I won't even try to describe because I simply wouldn't do it justice. Quickly has become one of my favorite ever AiC songs.<br /><br />  Scalpel - Acoustic number that is almost bordering on being country-esque. When the electric guitar comes bellowing in over the acoustic it really gives it a nice touch. Bridge is a nice segueway into the great two part vocal harmony in the chorus. The tempo shift in the middle before the final chorus gives the song some unpredictability which is obviously a strong point of this album as whole. Another song that wouldn't sound out of place on a Jerry solo record.<br /><br />  Phantom Limb - Not sure what's better in this song, the earth shattering tempo shifting smash your teeth in guitar riff or the amazing vocal delivery by Duvall. They go hand in hand remarkably well as the song takes you on a journey telling a story of what sounds like a desolate sounding wasteland. Then it all comes crashing down for the chorus before it blows back up again with a phenomenal guitar solo. This is probably my favorite song on the album (which is saying something considering how great this album is).<br /><br />  Hung on a Hook - ABSOLUTE VINTAGE AiC, and another song that could've been pulled right off Tripod. Slow melodic intro is great and the Layne style `AHHHHH' throughout the song is an amazing touch. The two part chorus really lifts off the song after the soft vocal delivery from Duvall in the verses and makes it another favorite. The guitar solo/closure is rather unique and sends the song off nicely.<br /><br />  Choke - The acoustic/electric guitar trade off in the intro is awesome, and sets up the moody sounding verse nicely. The two part harmonies throughout the chorus again really make the song what it is. Another awesome guitar solo and overall great  and fitting sendoff to the album.<br /><br />My one criticism of the album is that there is again too much Jerry featured and not enough Duvall. I don't think it's a coincidence that the best songs on the two albums now that they've released with this lineup are songs that Duvall has fronted and/or co-written (Last of My Kind, Phantom Limb, Hung on A Hook).<br /><br />There isn't a single song on the album that I wouldn't classify as great so it's also tough to pick favorites (although if I had to PhantomLimb, Voices, Breath on a Window and TDPDH have probably been played the most so far).<br />Just an amazing album...THANK YOU AiC.
B004CS7R70|2.0|Glasses were of no help in letting my mother see the TV.  There is very little adjusting on each lens-not at all like a pair of binoculars.  They were very cheaply made.  If they would have helped her to see TV, I could have overlooked the low quality.<br />They were not worth the large amount of money they cost.  I have returned the glasses and I am waiting for my money to be returned.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've never read a book before where the main character talks to the reader.  The main character, Drew Evans is telling his story, narrating his story, to US...the reader.  He speaks as if we're sitting across the table, shootin' spitballs (shootin' the breeze).  It was interesting, and took me a few chapters to acclimate myself to this Author's style.  But I liked it.<br /><br />Drew Evans is a partner at one of the top investment banks in NY.  He's devilishly handsome, and arrogance personified.  He's beyond selfish and spoiled.  He's accustomed to getting his way, HIS WAY.  He feels he's \\"the star\\" of any show, and God's special gift to all women.  Drew has no interest in a long term relationship.  He's a player.  He doesn't believe in marriage (for him) and he believes in love even less...or the occurrence of \\"falling in love\\".  As for him??...won't ever happen...at least that's his motto.<br /><br />So when he DOES fall in love, he's so stunned and scared that he's unable to form speech.  It throws him into complete and utter frightening confusion.  When he realizes just what exactly has happened to him, he compares the realization to a camera's lens being out of focus for so long, to coming into instant clarity.  It's a brilliant analogy especially for someone like Drew....someone who lives his type of lifestyle - - hopping from woman to woman, bed to bed as if there's no tomorrow.<br /><br />Katherine (Kate) Brooks has just finished her internship in business and has landed a prestigious position as an investment banker at Drew's place of employment - - the bank his father helped establish and the bank Drew is partners at.  Kate is dedicated and driven.  She's committed, ambitious and has no interest in Drew.  She's engaged to someone else and faithful to her fiance'.  She's extremely attractive and men notice her in a crowded room.  She has no clue how beautiful she actually is.  For Drew, she's a challenge he's determined to conquer....nothing more.  Just another notch to add to his bedpost.<br /><br />GAME ON!!<br /><br />For me this story really took off after the break-up....yes, there is a relationship and a break-up.  It's only after the break-up that Drew is forced to take two steps back and take a look at himself....he finds his humanity and slowly becomes somewhat likable.  The downside is there really is no substance to the story.  The entire story is simply about a \\"player\\" trying to win the girl.  All about Drew's shenanigans to \\"get the girl\\" that got away.  There's no mystery or intrigue, generally no substance.  Yet I enjoyed reading how this guy get's shut down for the first time in his life and has to cope with that fact....then decides to dust himself off and try again.<br /><br />I especially liked all the \\"sidebars\\" that parallel analogies.  It was superb how this Author stops everything, and Drew asks us (the reader) to take a good look at what's happening.  Then goes on to explain and compare the situation.  It was hilarious at times and always kept me captivated.other notch to add to his bedpost.<br /><br />GAME ON!!<br /><br />For me this story really took off after the break-up....yes, there is a relationship and a break-up.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|First on purchasing...<br />The price was right for this movie since it is quite difficult (if not impossible) to find in-stores.  Although at one point the movie trading company told me they could order it, I prefer using online tools so that the items are shipped directly to my home.  This product came when promised and was packaged properly, with no defects.<br /><br />Now on to the important stuff...<br />This is one of my all-time favorite films.  My husband and I rented it on a whim when it was first released and were always glad we did.  I was recently looking for reviews on other movies (it is so hard to find something with a real story and little to no sex, violence, ghosts, demons, vampires, etc. these days) when I was reminded of this one.  Luckliy Amazon had it!<br /><br />Departures is very touching and well acted.  The main character, Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is very expressive and entertaining to watch.  You can really see his emotions in his face and body language.  He really begs for your empathy for his plight and fosters a deep adoration for him in the midst of his triumphs and failures.<br /><br />Although for me this movie is a real tear-jerker, it is not the kind that leaves you exhausted at the end.  It is so full of hope, love and forgiveness, I feel very peaceful every time I watch it, with an appreciation of the relationships I have (with all their ups and downs).<br /><br />I believe there is a little something for everyone in this movie as it focuses on all types of relationships... husband/wife, mother/child, father/child... and the loss, turmoil, redemption and forgiveness that each relationship can have.<br /><br />Parental guidance notes:<br />This is really a movie about adult relationships... I'm not sure that many (younger than their 20s) would appreciate it as much, as it deals so heavily with complex and sometimes painful relationships.  However my teenage daughter did watch and enjoy it.<br /><br />There are scenes that include a public bath house and in a few of these scenes you can see various people (including the main character) nude, from the side.  Nothing explicit is shown and although I do not approve of nudity in films, I was not offended by any of the scenes in this movie.  In fact in one with the main character, he is washing himself to remove more than just physical dirt and I believe was a good way to show what he was going through at that time.<br /><br />There is also a touching scene between the husband and wife where she thinks that he is trying to be romantic with her in the kitchen, which she finds inappropriate and a little frightening (because of his intensity).  However the scene is really not about sex, it is more about the tenderness and affectionate needs he has for his wife (and needs from her) at the time.  That being said, it is not something I would find appropriate for most children/teens to watch as they could not possibly understand what is really going on.<br /><br />I highly recommend using IMDB to research specific parental guidance topics before watching any movie.  There is a detailed one for this movie, which I found very helpful the first time I watched it.include a public bath house and in a few of these scenes you can see various people (including the main character) nude, from the side.

B006TVQU6C|3.0|This is replacing an old chieftec case, which I which sets a high precedent.  Both have elements of tool-less design.  The antec is truly tool-less, though the cheiftec had latched doors instead of thumbscrews. I don't know why no one makes attractive non-gamer cases with latched doors. Still, the antec has some odd design choices. It's supposed to be able to hide some of your cables, but it puts the hard drives access on the other side, so eventually you have to remove both sides. You, can't really trace where the cables go from one side, so both are needed to be removed. The front fascia looks more plasticy than the pictures. I like the air intake removable filter, that's a nice addition. The fans are very quiet, but not the best quality. It came with studs already in, so installation was very quick. It does USB3, but has adapters for for your old USB2 board. Everything worked.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Best line from the book:<br />\\"It's official. Brace yourselves. Hell has actually frozen the f^%$ over.\\"<br /><br />My Review<br /><br />Wow what a fun and exciting read. This is a wonderful read that a lover of romance doesn't want to miss.<br />Written entirely in the male perspective. It gives you a look into the mind of an alpha male that has never been seen before.<br />Liked:<br /><br />What I liked the most was how completely flawed Drew is. And although he feel in love it didn't change who and what he was. It only made him better. Also Emma was funny and strong, and she didn't give anything up to love Drew.<br />Wonderfully written and funny.<br />Disliked:<br /><br />Its a truly well written book when I am hard pressed to find anything I really disliked about a read. But if I had to pick one thing, I would say that 'The Bitch' wasn't a bitch. She was scary, but her love for her brother drives her actions. And I didn't think she was a bitch at all. I actually loved her character, Drew was blessed to have her.<br />Overall<br /><br />One of the great reads of 2013 for me. Don't miss out on this one.<br />??Recommend??<br /><br />I would highly recommend this read. That being said, please keep in mind that it has amazing hot sex scenes. So if you are looking for something with no behind the bedroom door scenes this book isn't for you.<br />Rating:<br /><br />I am giving Tangled by: Emma Chase a happy 5 out of 5 stars.

B00C061HZY|5.0|I adore the new DAFT PUNK album...Thank God I bought the vinyl! I love the mix of old and new, so glad they did an acoustic album. This sounds so good on my turntables played nice and loud.... the way it was made to be played. Kids today need to drop those \\"IPODs\\" and \\"Dr. Dre headphones\\" or those horrible computer speakers and really listen to music on a good sound system... out loud!<br /><br />I'm so glad I grew up in a time when we heard music in the streets from our \\"Boom Box's\\" and then came home and played our new records so loud all summer long...I miss hearing music in the streets...Thank you Daft Punk.

B002N1AEN2|2.0|I stumbled across XX's opening track (“Intro”) a few months back and was impressed enough to check out “Infinity”, which was also fairly decent.  I made a mental note to revisit the band, and when I recently needed to increase an Amazon order to qualify for free shipping, I took this as a sign that it was time to dive in.  Little did I know how shallow the water was.<br /><br />How this album got elevated to such high stature eludes me.  I get the “mood music” angle, and if the intent is to provide aural atmosphere slightly more interesting than a white noise generator, then The XX has clearly achieved their goal.  But all those 5 star reviews and top ten lists indicating that this is some type of musical masterwork?  I'm sorry, but this album was meant to be heard, not listened to.  Should you try to actually listen to it – and it's no trivial task staying focused on most of the tracks – the experience isn't worth the effort.<br /><br />The album opens with “Intro”, a great track that is almost out of place on this album.  “Intro” then gives way to “VCR”, arguably the worst song on this and maybe 100 other randomly selected albums, featuring the lamest lyrics I've heard in years: “I wanna find myself by the sea, in another's company......”  C'mon, seriously? I'm trying to imagine the musical context into which those cringe-worthy lyrics could reasonably be placed and, with the exception of an album entitled something like “Sing along with Barney & Friends”, I'm drawing a blank.<br /><br />“Crystalised” comes closer to being almost memorable, as well as using VCR's “sea” metaphor to less embarrassing though equally ineffective results.  I kind of liked the dramatic pause in “Islands”, and how it transitioned to a simple drum and guitar wrap up.  That is until I realized the “pause” was just the gap between “Islands” and “Heart Skipped a Beat”.  They sound like they could be the same song (and may have originally been the same for all I know) , but when the silence between tracks is mistaken for artistic effect?  That's not good.<br /><br />“Fantasy” isn't worth commenting on, but “Shelter” does deserve a serious listen, though not from this CD.  Google Birdy's cover of “Shelter” and listen to that.  Listening to Romy Madley Croft sing “Shelter” gives the impression of a bored millennial lying on her couch watching Dr. Who reruns and phoning in the vocal track during the commercials.  Birdy (all of 15 years old when she recorded her cover) delivers “Shelter” with more soul and raw emotion than is contained in the entirety of this CD.  And that's the problem here: the music is lifeless and the emotions seem detached at best and forced at worst.  When Romy and Oliver Sim “sing” at each other, we get romance that's more tepid than torrid, and heartbreak expressed on the same level of disappointment felt when one discovers the paper towel dispenser is empty.  As another reviewer mentioned here, The XX is just “Xanax” without the middle three letters.  The remaining tracks (except “Infinity” as previously mentioned) don't add anything worth noting.<br /><br />XX is not a bad CD, it's just not good.  Okay yes, “VCR” is bad - laughably bad in fact - but I can't trash an entire album over one track.  Even Radiohead's iconic “OK Computer” had “Fitter Happier”, and though I don't think The XX's intent with “VCR” was comparable, in both cases the albums would be improved by removing those tracks.  But the similarity ends there.  Radiohead insists that we listen, while The XX is clearly suggesting that we not bother.  So I'll take their suggestion and hit the eject button.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|great movie, a lot better than I expected it to be. very good acting. will have to watch it again
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Great personal story with lots of humanity. Interesting, strong characters set in a real world on 2nd world war history. Fantastic read.
0385737424|1.0|My twin 11 year olds both hated this book. They found the characters dull, the storyline depressing, and they couldn't relate to life in 1970s New York City. If you have an introspective child who likes science fiction, this book might appeal to them. If your child likes action, adventure, comedy, fantasy, or history, look elsewhere. I have found that Newberry winners are often written for adults, not children. I'd love to know how many of the 300 or so positive reviews for this book reflect an adult's view of the book, rather than a kid's take on it. Not for us, nor for most kids I know. And my kids are avid readers.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found this to be a multifaceted story line with unexpected turns.  The human spirit can endure despite cruel circumstances.  I loved the Irish dialect, the customs, and the author was able to paint a mind picture with the colorful dialogue.  I recommend it to anyone interested in Irish life on the farm.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Loved the music of Tron Legacy, so was glad to get CD.  Excellent music and well worth getting for fans of this type of music.  I would recommend renting the movie first to see if it matches your tastes.

0062014102|5.0|I thought the book was great! But, maybe because of my own lack of evidence, I have put on the back burner the following--the Universe being hologram. It may very well be. In any case, there are other things I found fantastic. I actually wrote about it in my second book. That is, eventually, we will realize that we don't need to kill anything to live.

B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|I received this app and it didn't take but 5 minutes to get it up and running. I was flying the helicopter like a pro and fighting against an enemy copter. You have machine guns and missiles. The first levels are easy allowing you to get a little air time for the tougher levels. This is a good game and I will keep it in my collection of apps.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such an amazing conclusion to an amazing book series. It never lets you down,not even for a second. I loved this book series  and the conclusion made me love it even more. I feel like a part of my life has finished now that I've finished the series but if Katniss taught me anything is that you have to use the things you seen in the past to keep you moving into the future.

1878424319|1.0|By all the great reviews I thought I was in for a real treat with this book. Wrong!<br /><br />In the beginning Mr. Ruiz delves into how we are programmed(fed what he calls \\"agreements\\" that are not are own and are self destructive which he calls us as a people becoming domesticated) as a child. We all know this, as a kid our brains are sponges blah blah. The funny thing about it is, he's just further enforcing agreements that most of us were taught as a child. One thing he is spot on with is right from the beginning we are taught by a reward or punishment system. This follows us into adulthood where we feel like we have to constantly reward or punish ourselves and other people based on actions, looks, etc. I agree with him that we constantly punish ourselves, as a society our self-esteem is crap and we should work on it.<br /><br />1. The first \\"agreement\\"- Be Impeccable with Your Word. (First chapter he quotes the bible which in my opinion is the most force fed programming you can recieve as a child.) But anyways, in other words he's saying if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all. If you say something bad to someone, i.e. call someone fat or ugly its only because your insecure with yourself. I truly believe, with all these obese people moping around this world today, someone needs to plant some, as he says \\"black magic\\" into their ego.<br /><br />Favorite excerpt from this chapter: \\"Example: I see a friend and give him an opinion that just popped into my mind. I say, \\"Hmmmm! I see that kind of color in your face in people who are going to get cancer.\\" If he listens to the word, and if he agrees, he will have cancer in less than one year. That is the power of the word.\\"- Are you kidding me dude.<br /><br />2. The second agreement and as far as I got in this book before considering it utterly useless was- Don't Take Anything Personally. Ok, everyone elses point of view comes from all the programming we recieved during our domestication process. So if someone calls you fat or obese, its because that person has problems not because you are actually fat and obese. He goes on to talk about how he doesn't need to feel accepted, he doesn't need for someone to tell him how good he's doing. So guy, whats the point of the first agreement? Should the first agreement be keep to yourself? But because everyone elses opinion is their problem not yours at all, dont pay it any mind. Even if your heavily into drugs and need people think you need serious help, dude, its their problem not yours.<br /><br />Favorite excerpt from this chapter: \\"Even if someone shot you in the head, it was nothing personal. Even at that extreme.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't read beyond the second chapter. The book is pretty much telling you to get into your own little world with lollipops and gumdrops, don't let outside factors bother you. Well the world can be a cold and dangerous place and choosing to numb yourself to others opinions or keeping what you really want to say depressed inside of you and not telling it like it is, is probably not good for you or your self dovelopment. I would like to hear a psychologists opinion of this book. I could compare this book to the movie \\"the secret\\" it is that outlandish. Save your money.if someone calls you fat or obese, its because that person has problems not because you are actually fat and obese.

1401937519|5.0|Mrs Moorjani gives a verty literate account of her experience and it was verified by experts. She is non-dominational with her experience which gives it an ayre of believeability. A very good read wheather you are a believer or not.
B004YEJGEO|3.0|Reflect, refract, combine, extract. Mix, split, and redirected colored beams of light into colored receptors to solve the puzzle. It is a serviceable puzzle game which doesn't have much in the way of fancy graphics for extra content.<br /><br />Not that that's bad, mind you. Sometimes, you just want a puzzle game for the puzzles. It works okay here, but on my small phone screen, I've fat-fingered some of the smallish game play elements. Perhaps don't play on screens smaller than four inches if you have big fat meaty fingers.

B005529BDK|3.0|This is a puzzle game that reminds me of some arcade puzzle game with a similar rows-of-items-advance-from-the-top-clear-them-before-they-get-you thing.<br /><br />What this has going for it is the ability to flip individual tiles to change combos. That wouldn't have been possible on an old arcade game.<br /><br />Good job game, cookie for you.

B0085YNML2|3.0|...but the execution is juuuuust off. Not by much. But it feels like an inexpensive game for inexpensive smartphones. This is probably because it IS an inexpensive game for an inexpensive smartphone, but that is beside the point. I can't quite put my finger on WHY exactly it feels this way. I think it's the art style? Perhaps the menu? Well, in either case, it is worth a shot. Just don't expect AAA amazing out of it.

B00CW665VI|2.0|I really had no idea what to expect when I started reading this book. Sure I had friends who kept suggesting Tangled, and how much they loved it. But not everyone had the same taste in reading material . So I reluctantly decided to give it a try. Less than 24 hrs later ( and might I add I never finish a book in 24 hrs 48 maybe, but not 24) I was immersed in the life of  Drew Evans, playboy extraordinaire . I could NOT put this book down, and I wouldn't have except for a tiny thing called sleep. I totally and completely fell in love with this book, with Drew and with Kate!! Wow what a genius Emma Chase is telling this fabulous love story from a mans point of view!!! And Drew, omg what a witty , romantic man. All I can say is........ READ THIS BOOK!! You will laugh , smile and sweat ( oh and did I mention the sex scenes? HOT HOT HOT) thru every page!!

B00821PCJS|4.0|Character development was excellent.  It left me eager to learn more about the characters' pasts and invested in the characters' futures.<br />The special effects were as I would expect from a TV series.<br />The cinematography was excellent; I felt like I was part of the story.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first season; looking forward to watching the second.
B00008RH3L|5.0|A masterpiece of a gangster flick. Set during Prohibition era, 'Miller's Crossing' never gets old - it actually seems to get even better with each viewing. The film stars the awesome and legendary Al Finney as mob boss Leo and it revolves around him and his off-the-boat lackey (Byrne) doing battle with an ambitious Italian Mafioso (Polito) trying to muscle in on Irish turf. It has an old-school feel to it that is rarely perfected elsewhere, and everything from the sets, costume design, dialogue and screenplay is superbly crafted and balanced by the Coen brothers. The scene when Leo turns-the-tables on the gang of hitters intruding on his sprawling mansion with Danny Boy playing in the backround would have made even Cagney weep with envy. Don't just see it, own it. For you will certainly want this is in your movie collection.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Nothing less than I expected.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is the best comedy show on tv today! I love all the geeks and especially Penny! I can't wait for the new season!
B00867GHS8|3.0|This was a wonderful movie. The 3D version uses more of a (3d depth) visual effect as opposed to a (3d pop-out) effect.<br />In that aspect, I was a little disappointed as I personally prefer a combination of depth with little more pop-out 3d.<br />Still a beautiful HD movie.<br /><br />My Set-up:<br />3D TV (passive)<br />3D Blu-ray Player<br />HDMI Cables.
B005SAYRA6|5.0|This was a great movie. Can't wait to se Fast & Furious 6.  The clarity and HD was absolutely amazing.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|An all acoustic treat. Joe Bonamassa has even hooked my mother, who does not like electric guitar pieces (they hurt her ears and set her nerves on edge, she says). But when Joe picks up an Acoustic Guitar (why so many guitars she asks) he is even more proficient than on the electrics, I think. Excellent. I think this is my favorite of all Joe's works, so far.
B00AG297GK|2.0|I couldn't pay attention to this movie. I expected it to be raunchy and stupid so I read a book while it was on. My partner is more likely to be entertained by this kind of humor and he couldn't find anything to laugh about either.
B005P06AAO|3.0|good plot, good ideas. sometimes sad, sometimes enlightening and sometimes halarious. The biggest drawback is is the the censorship of the language programs on the DVD. It's a DVD!!!  whats wrong with these producers? There is little consistency in the censorship either. Can't have teenages swearing on the program cause other teenagers who buy the DVD might figure out what the actors are saying but the adult actors swearing is not bleeped out so it's now okay for people to swear so long as your an adult? Some shows will have loads of swear words and nothing or very little bleeped and some will have loads of swear words and everything bleeped. I don't think MTV knew what they were doing when they censored this cause they were morons. Disappointing really. It would have got 4 stars had it not been for the idiots who did the censorship. Don't buy it if you don't like the script to be bleeped a dozen times in 22 minutes.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|A heartwarming father/son story with very few over-the-top fantasy elements to get in the way. Great story and wonderful characters.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I remember reading the book on which this movie was based. I have been a Jack Reacher fan for some time and have read most, if not all of  the Reacher books. The movie was enjoyable, though I thought Tom Cruise did not quite fit the part, although his acting, as usual, was good. The discription Lee Childs gives of Jack Reacher is a 6'5\\", 225 lb. guy with hugh muscles and hands. I thought the man who plays John Reese in the TV serial, \\"Person of Interest\\" might have been a better choice.<br /><br />I was disappointed, when I saw the credits, that I missed seeing and recognizing Lee Childs who did a cameo as a desk officer in the film. I might have to go back and see it again.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I was completely TANGLED up in this well crafted, highly addictive and wildly entertaining story. I was literally glued to my kindle, quickly gliding my fingers from page to page, grinning, chuckling and high lighting as I read along, totally entranced with Drew. Never have I read a first person narrative from the guy's point of view that made me feel like he was actually speaking to me directly. Not only did I know what Drew was thinking and feeling, but he also knew instinctively what I was thinking and feeling about him and his actions. This narration style made me feel closely connected to this very likable, delightful character, with his witty repartee and \\"tell it like it is\\" attitude. He was very funny and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the TV show and movie references that he used to explain his situations. They were hilarious and so on point. Now, as for Kate, I LOVED her. I appreciated that she was well educated, smart, competitive, driven and confident in her professional abilities. It was refreshing to have a heroine that could go \\"toe to toe\\" with the male counterpart in the boardroom and make him step up his game. The sexual tension between the characters was palpable, the verbal foreplay was intense and the chemistry between the two was scorching! I highly recommend you get yourself TANGLED up in this great book. I loved it and look forward to reading much more from Emma Chase.
1416972250|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this third book in The Mortal Instruments series more than any of the others. Though the book was not perfect, the characters were more compelling, the action increased, and the revelations and resolutions were done well. I think eventually I will continue on to the next book and I hope that if I do read any more of Clare's books in the future, they will continue to improve on what I've seen so far.<br /><br />*8/10*
B0091REZMW|2.0|Beautiful scenes but would be better if were larger or had a way to make screen stretch. Can't hardly see items to find. Poor designer.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read ALOT.  This was one of the beat books I have ever read.  Highly recommended. Not the average love story.(BETTER)  I live how it's written in Drews point of view.  I have never read a book written like this. (Amazing).  I will invest more time in reading this author .  The store has some great twist and turns.  I laughed more in two days then I have all year.  I told my husband we have to read this together... and I don't share my love stories with ANYONE.  You will enjoy this book.
B008NMT684|5.0|My twin grandsons love this.  One of them plays it over and over, he loves construction vehicles and puzzles also.  It is great
1416972242|3.0|I got pretty much what I expected from this book, so I was neither disappointed nor surprised. I will probably continue the series on audiobook as it was definitely easier to put up with the book's faults that way. I can see and understand why some readers are such fans of this series, so the elements are there, and this definitely isn't the worst thing I've ever read, but I'm not a convert. I am, however, still looking forward to the movie, so we'll see if my mind changes in August.<br /><br />*7.5/10*
1476719071|1.0|After being beyond baffled at the almost 5 star rating on Amazon as well as goodreads I couldn't stand it anymore and had to write my own review. Most people I'm noticing are commenting on the \\"dangerous\\" subject matter, something I honestly didn't even bat an eye at in comparison to the GOD AWFUL writing. I have read dozens upon dozens of young adult novels, some good, some bad, some that I couldn't get past the first few pages of; this book stands on its own because I somehow couldn't stop reading it despite how awful it was.<br />First and foremost, the writing is beyond words. There is no way, NO way something this awful should have been published. Fifty Shades of Grey comes to mind when I think of similar horrendous writing, but even the editor of those books I doubt would have let writing like this be put onto shelves. The dialogue is horrific, resembling not even a trace of reality or even believability. Her descriptions that commingle with the dialogue equally make no sense as the characters go from yelling to being described as \\"beaming\\" in the same sentence. There is no sense between why one thing happens to the next, the characters have no depth and it's almost impossible to grasp an understanding of who anyone is. There is literally no descriptive language at all alone from the sex scenes and how short and sexy the dresses are that Abby wears in ever other chapter. I've read longer books in a shorter amount of time than this one took me because I had to barrel my way through it. When I finally finished I felt like i had wasted an incredible amount of my time on a  true piece of garbage. This may seem harsh, but I think that it is truly awful that a book so horribly written and thought out could be getting such good reviews. The author in no way deserves so much praise.

1250007208|4.0|Cinder completely exceeded my expectations! Based loosely on the Cinderella fairytale, this futuristic story is a fun read with lots of elements to love. Great characters, an interesting world, and smooth writing make this one a book everyone should try out.

0385360169|3.0|It was okay because there was only one reader (Becca), which she reads great, but I felt a male reader was needed to read the parts of Christian Grey and the other male characters to make it more interesting.
B0019GJ4EC|5.0|This movie is as I remembered it, a great moody horror film told in an almost story book manner. There are some beautifully framed shots in the movie like the long staircase leading down to the lighthouse etc. The transfer is decent, then only thing I didn't like is this international release? formatted disc which prompts to pick a region/language and US is not listed so i had the choice of Australia or United Kingdom, I'm not a Brit!
0553385445|4.0|The sequel to The Wolf of Wall Street.  Whilst it is a good story to read, here's the message - be careful who you trust.
1416955070|3.0|This book seemed exactly up my alley, so I was disappointed with how everything came together. The writing is fine, and there are lots of interesting things within the world Clare has created, but I don't feel drawn into it in such a way that makes me anticipate what's coming or suffer and rejoice with the characters. It seems like a lot is riding on the romance, which felt forced to me, and the quest/goal aspect is under-developed. I eventually did continue to the second book, [[ASIN:1416972242 City of Ashes (The Mortal Instruments, Book 2)]] and the story does get a bit better, but it took a long while for me to try this series again.<br /><br />*7/10*

B000KIRT6A|1.0|Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. I just didn't want to spend $100 on the Boss version, but you get what you pay for! Another thing that I hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the Boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. I also bought a Behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out.
1594481717|3.0|Good book by Daniel Pink.  But just a bit of light reading really with nothing explained in any great level of depth.  Nonetheless worth the read.

B000008JUM|4.0|On its face using the songs of Cole Porter to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and money for combating it by using contemporary artists seemed a bit of a stretch.  Certainly his songs are very much in the cannon of \\"those in the know\\" and Broadway babies, but the question was how translatable to modernity these songs could be.  \\"Red Hot & Blue\\" answers that question to widely varying degrees and it quickly becomes an answer to the question about High Risk/High Reward for the artists involved.  Clearly some of the artists have nothing to lose by playing fast and loose and taking chances with Porter's songs and the payoff is quite often spectacular.  Right out of the gate Nenah Cherry serves up a chilling yet scintillating version of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" the summons up the horrors of HIV/AIDS at the time.  Her take on this classic is spot-on-the-money and I wouldn't change a note as she truly gets the material.  The shift from Nenah Cherry to the smooth R&B of the Neville Brothers is a bit jarring, but Aaron Neville's gorgeous falsetto over the restrained yet lively arrangement is truly a beauty to behold. Sinead O'Connor serves up a decided retro version of \\"You Do Something to Me\\" that is a refreshing take from her other output at the time and showcases how lovely her voice is given the right material.  Roland Gift likewise shows what a great vocalist he is with \\"Love For Sale\\", a similarly nice restrained but lively take on that well known track with his band at the time (Fine Young Cannibals).  The odd sequencing really pops here as the smooth styling of Fine Young Cannibals bumps up against what is probably my absolute favorite track from \\"Red Hot & Blue\\" \\"Well Did You Evah\\" pairing up Debbie Harry and Iggy Pop.  Whoever cooked up this idea is a bloody genius as the two play off each other masterfully in a raunchy playful manner that is thoroughly modern and sounds like they had a blast in the studio.  If only the rest of \\"Red Hot & Blue had this much life, vitality, and energy!  From here the rest of the tracks slowly start to peter out as a bit lifeless an perfunctory.  David Byrne's \\"Don't Fence Me In\\" is a bit intriguing and fun and Annie Lennox's mournful take on \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\" is a profoundly moving tear jerker.  While U2's \\"Night and Day\\" was a single I still find this a bit of a snooze despite his menacing vocals.  K.D. Lang's \\"So In Love\\" is another profoundly moving take on Porter that really showcases how great a vocalist she is...I truly wish she would do an album of songs like this!  From here things go a bit downhill as the big groups/artists of the era take a stab at Porter with no real effort.  The Thompson Twins, Erasure, Jimmy Sommerville, and Aztec Camera all make appearances but their versions are so slight, sluggish, and perfunctory that they all come and pass with scarcely a moment's notice.  Lisa Stansfield is the sole standout in this section and as with K. D. Lang she REALLY should do an album of pop standards as her voice is ideally suited for this.  All in all \\"Red Hot & Blue\\" is a bit like a Whitman's sampler...it's designed to appeal to a broad section of people but not everything is going to delightful or to everyone's taste.tality, and energy!

I have nothing against the kink. But every three pages there was some kind of sex scene! at first it was kinda funny. Then I got so bored with the sex sex sex that I started skipping those parts, and realized that if you took all the sex out this book had no real story line. So in short, it sucked.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to be published.  It was worth waiting for.  I enjoyed the previous Clifton Chronicles books and will follow and purchase every Jeffrey Archer book ... Archer is THAT GOOD.  The book does not pick up exactly where the last book left off, but that is fine.  During the story, Archer fills in the blanks along the way.  Fabulous book!

I won't give away the twist, but the movie starts off as a commentary on the pharmaceutical industry, and the therapists who make money by making deals with companies that potentially endanger the mental health and lives of their patients. The film also comments on the materialism of upwardly mobile New Yorkers. However, the social commentary disappears towards the end in a plot about an individualized scandal, as opposed to larger social themes. In addition, the film suggests some things about lesbians that is very old school. Nonetheless, the film, even its conventional plot twist, is engaging.

B002JXK5VU|5.0|I wish they would bring back the funniest SciFi series ever.  When we find the time, will watch all seasons.  Amazon Prime rocks!
0060531053|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book for people getting into homebrewing, or even long term brewers.  Goes over everything from the science and history to recipes.  Papazian is truly the father of homebrewing in america.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really got caught up in the main character's plight.  Through all the challenges of his time on Mars, I was drawn in completely.  Just enough science to make it believable.  Very highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever can't stop playing it unless my parents tell me to go do something outside would recommend it for everybody!!!!!!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Frankly, I have been crazy about 'The sound of music ' the movie when I was a eight-year-old boy. This limited edition is one of my favorite gift.Especially, the fabulous post cards and music box.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was one of those stay up till you finish type books. Couldn't put it down. Mr Howey did a great job fleshing out his world and characters. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love playing but not as easy as on the computer.  The response time isn't as quick on the kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter (7) enjoy playing this game after completing her homework.  It's a great way to enjoy watching the kids play.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Loved every minute of this book. Read it all in one sitting. Great story, engaging characters and interesting plot! Can't wait for book two!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book I've read in so long. Finished it in two days. Definitely reading the second and third book
B003L77GGA|3.0|Item arrived quickly but I kept it unopened for a few weeks because it was a gift for someone in the household. When it was opened by the recipient, the inside of the disc case was crushed into pieces so that it does not hold the discs. The discs were undamaged and played fine but we are looking for a replacement case to transfer them to.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter looks forward to playing Temple Run 2.  I thought the challenge ended with Temple Run 1 but I was wrong.  She love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. I love it so much. and hope I can keel it forever and ever and ever. I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS!
B002JCSWVG|5.0|Inspirational efforts of a few have nationwide impact in the information age.  Movie is on par with Miracle, The Blind Side, and Invincible.
B004I7IPL2|5.0|Jigsaw does it again.....I love his wife Jill Tuck.....she is the ultimate woman. You will be shocked and amazed at the will people have and how stupid they can be.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is turned out to be really great, the kids enjoy playing and I would recommend it too anyone.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS CD. MY FIRST TIME HEARING THIS GROUP. WILL BUY MORE. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT ALBUM.
193700788X|3.0|This book wasn't as terrible as all of the 1 star reviews I'd read led me to believe it would be. I didn't like who she ended up with at the end, but it was as well written as the rest of the series. It did feel somewhat rushed, and she took what I felt was the \\"easy out\\" with some things just to tie it all up. All in all, it was ok.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This book is hard to put down once you pick it up. I can't wait to start the next one
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter loved it!  what a way show off your imagination on how to build!  I would recommend it to everyone.
1584233494|5.0|All like combine! Product very very very good! I recomend this book and other 'Obey art' for all! Thanks a lot!
B003TTKB5I|5.0|A great way to start off the season, awesome HD quality on Amazon for streaming and its Free if you have Prime!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Got interested in this series after finding out the movie 'Jack Reacher' was based on a book. Then found out it's a series. So I got a sample of the first one for my kindle. About 2 pages in I figured I didn't want to wait to see if my library had it (I rarely buy books for my kindle because there are a ton of good free ones) and I bought this.<br />No recap of the plot...you can read that all over, I'll just tell you if you like a good thinking murder mystery detective type story, look no further. Jack Reacher is the character for you. Kept me entertained, didn't insult my intelligence, and I wanted to keep on reading. And now I must go buy the 2nd one. Who knew Lee Child  would turn me into a book buyer! :)
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a great game!! It is very addictive!! It is sometimes very challenging but most of the time its good!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This is an interesting kidnap,ransom featureing a band of private special forces on one side and Jack Reacher on the other.  Jack wins.  A really fascinating look at the world of 'mercs&#34; with a psychopathic commander.  The scenes vary from NYC to rural England.
B0042TV4IC|5.0|Suffering from Downton Abbey withdrawal?  Indeed, I was Suffering from Downton Abbey withdrawal and in need of a Brit-fix [other than the brilliantly revived Doctor Who (2005-forward, also recommended)] -- I lucked upon Lark Rise to Candleford and became INSTANTLY CHARMED and addicted to this cast of eccentric and (mostly) lovable characters.<br /><br />Their back stories are thoughtful and humanizing, reminding us that not everything/or everyone is as it may first appear.<br /><br />It's so well-conceived, well-written and -cast. The acting+ is close to perfection in this sophisticated-town-vs.-simple-country-folk period piece (don't let that put you off). Lark Rise to Candleford (especially the town's postmistress) enchanted me and quickly became one of my biggest weaknesses!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I'll not recap the plot, you can read that elsewhere. I will say that I enjoyed the Jack Reacher movie, saw it was based on a book..but then found that it's a series of books, so I read a sample of the first Jack novel..and then I bought it for my kindle. (I rarely pay for books...there are a ton of good free ones, so why bother?)<br />Liked the first one so much I wanted to get right into the next one.<br />Bought 'Die Trying' and got sucked right in. Life chores and responsibilities get in the way of reading!<br />It's a good book. Lots of smart action. I like that Lee Child teaches me things...but I also like that he doesn't dumb his novels down.<br />I shall now go do a search for the 3rd one. Guess I'll be buying another book...which is high praise from me. I love action/murder/mystery books with detective thinking. This hits the spot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best app for on the go action run jump roll move left and right it is beast and cool or amazing
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a great book for discovering that you do have the power to create...create your life, create the experiences you desire and create things. The introduction information is very detailed and sets up the reader to have a good background for the exercises. The exercises are perfect for setting intentions and creating the energy to manifest the desires. Highly recommended!
B001M3LG84|5.0|This is one of the best.  New York Memories is my all time favorite and Australia is next. Keep these wonderful dvds coming
0345529057|5.0|These books were amazing, however, they are very adult, in all the senses of the word. X for violence and sexuality. The author tapped into a deep level of writing, at times you could not read his words, but most of the time the books moved very fast and held your interest, because of his attention to each of his main characters. An emotional read.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|I believe the movie is based on a actual events in LA.  Cops went after gangsters and violated every law in the books to drive out crime.<br /><br />While everyone did a good job acting, I just didn't connect to the movie.<br /><br />Ok to rent when alternatives are few.  Fast paced and hard hitting the movie beats cable TV offerings.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|it crashes... alot. i love how fun this game is being able to replay levels and get new goals, but it might crash in the middle of you playing. i would recommend to patient people :)
B005F6NA5G|4.0|I really like anything by this artist, so this was a great addition to my collection of George Benson's work.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What's not to like, love the book and loved the movie! All the characters were great, would have loved to see more of the dwarf humor and sarcasm, but the Hobbit and Gandalf, just the best! What a journey, can't wait for the next one!
B004B8DH98|4.0|Based on the novel &#34;A Very Private Gentleman,&#34; this is the story of a man planning to retire after this last job.<br /><br />Clooney plays a man who has been an assassin and who builds weapons for assassins.  This is not an action-packed movie, but rather the movie revolves around a quiet man who wants to retire.  A lot of the movie and the background of Clooney's character takes place in silence.<br /><br />This is a great choice and a great alternative to cable TV.  Warning:  you have to sit and watch the movie and can't be walking around, playing with your computer, reviewing your cell phone messages, etc.  If you do other stuff, then you'll have to start it over and watch it to have the experience - I know because I had to start it over.
B00992CF6W|2.0|it's hard to control and the menus are hard to navigate. the maps are very small and you're better off getting the pc version
B001NHNG64|4.0|Lee Child is a wonderful writer and storyteller.  I enjoyed this book a lot.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's hard to review A Memory of Light without making mention the entire series, but what I got most out of the book was how well the series ends:<br /><br />- Sanderson wraps up major storylines/characters very nicely.<br /><br />- It's a warfare novel but still manages to maintain the magical mood of the previous books.<br /><br />- Prophecy becomes reality.<br /><br />- Couldn't put it down.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert)<br />The outcome of Bela, the original Energizer Bunny, made me cry more than the outcome of any other character.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics. Very realistic. Impressive story line. Not of useless running back and forth. Puzzles were entertaining and not impossible to solve without assistance. Very logical progression of events. Wish it had lasted longer as I'm bummed that it is over.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|i... just don't know what to say. it was just horrible, i wish i knew that before getting this game
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is one of the best Pink Floyd DVD's (concerts) I have ever listened to. The album covers the most of the top hits and although some favorites are left out this is a must have for Pink Floyd fans.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After watching season 1 I was hooked. Love the history behind the story and all the interactions between the characters. One frustration was (and I am sure it is my slower IE connection even though it is DSL) that I live in a rural areal and sometimes the jam up on the connection causes a lot of buffering or restreaming. My determination to watch through it is tough because I don't want to miss a thing. So I give this a 5 Star!
B0012GMZDG|4.0|Jeff Beck experiments with electronic backing and some atmospheric sounds here. His unmistakable and inimitable style is what saves the recording, though. Beck shines in a band of real people playing non-programmed instruments. Given my age, I am spoiled by real, physical drum sets and drumming with sticks and skins. Electronic percussion strikes me as unpleasantly artificial most of the time. But it is still Jeff Beck. Moreover, there are a few tracts (one live) without the electronica.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|After playing this game for about an hour, I truly think that this is one of the better games on the app store. Bonus: It's FREE!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My Kindle stays at home but it is great to get the same book on my phone so if I end up waiting or just bored I can pick up right where I left off on my Kindle by this app being on my phone. then when I get back to my kindle it takes me right back to the page I left off on.
B003DXSXCI|5.0|Have always enjoyed Steve McQueen. This was one of my favorites. Truly a great actor! Sorely missed. Thanks for keeping up with the Steve McQueen movies. I love the nostalgic feeling when watching them!
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|What a pleasure to read a book written by a master of his craft. Where others pad out their text with endless repetition; he is brevity itself. Others use tricks for generating suspense; he weaves a story so spellbinding that you literally cannot put the book (or Kindle) down. Others regurgitate endless, detailed research verbatim without attempting to bridge to the tenuous story line; he has deep and intimate knowledge of his subject, the British foreign service, but does not condescend or patronise us, his reader, but converses as with an equal, a fellow insider. Others struggle to describe people, places, situations resorting to video like transcriptions; his light, deft touch is illuminating, amusing and delightfully informative. Others paste disconnected story lines together through artificial coincidences; he weaves a plot so dense, so credible, so involving, which builds as the tale progresses, culminating in a crescendo at which point he deliberately pulls the rug out from under our feet in true, inimitable le Carre Spy from the Cold style leaving us wondering what happened next to him or to her, innocent bystanders inextricably woven into a web of intrigue, where decency breeds downfall; deceit success; governments collusion, dissemination, murder; and good old England and her values under siege from within and without due to greed, fear and control. Where others have you checking page numbers regularly to determine how much longer you must endure the torture; he has you cleft between wishing it would go on for ever and being released from the unendurable suspense.<br /><br />John le Carre has penned some if the greatest spy books ever written. This is one of his best.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|my original album was stolen, when I got this I played it for at least a day, sounds great , price is right, the information in the package is a bonus. it's great to hear the whole album again. if you don't have the whole album, it's just not the same.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|lots of choices and you can target specific areas or let the app play all to get a long work out covering all parts of your body and aerobic workout also.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Alexander writes a very credible and sincere account of his near-death experience.  The details are riveting.  In the last couple chapters, however, some of the medical/scientific terminology was difficult for a &#34;layperson&#34; to understand.<br />  The ending itself was rather disappointing.  I felt it would have been more powerful if the author had included an epilog, bringing the loose ends of his story together by describing how his experience has impacted his life going forward and influenced his wife, sons, sisters and perhaps even colleagues and friends.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is perfect for the person who loves deck building games. As a huge fan of games such as Thunderstone and Nightfall, this game is perfect when I can't get a group together to actually sit down and play. The balance is great and there is enough here to keep one occupied for quite a while. Fully recommend buying this game.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Video direction is wonderful.  Jessie Norman has a beautiful voice, but is a bit of a stretch visually as Sigmund's twin.  The whole production is impressive, with James Levine's conducting outstanding.  Loved the casting.
B006ZOGM2A|5.0|Only on vinyl, this show from feb. '75 is a must have for any serious Springsteen fan. Shows the intimacy between a great band before they went on to larger venues. Blast to the past.
B004FLKV5O|5.0|If I were to choose two complete &#34;Ring Cycles,&#34; I'd pick Bernard Haitink's as a studio recording, and Barenboim's as a live recording. Both are incredible. Barenboim's is recorded live at Bayreuth, but without an audience, so there isn't a lot of coughing, etc., and even the stage noise is minimal. The acoustics at Bayreuth will leave you breathless. The orchestra is glorious throughout, and if there's a complaint it doesn't have to do with the orchestra, but the way the singers were miked: In &#34;Die Walkure,&#34; every time a singer turns away from what must be a directional mike, the voice fades and the orchestra appears too loud. This problem is addressed in the other operas.<br /><br />What can I say about this &#34;Ring's&#34; singing? That the singing is so good that it's classic in many roles. John Tomlinson makes a terrific Wotan, Graham Clark as both Loge and as Mime is simply awesome. His voice reflects the characters' thoughts exactly. Poul Elming suffers only from the directional mike issue mentioned earlier, but apart from that his Siegmund is wonderfully beautiful, not a yell at all. Nadine Secunde as Sieglinde is also marvelously expressive, and well paired with Elming. Anne Evans as Brunhilde is at her first entrance a bit too light in tone: It sounds as though she came onstage without warming up. But this passes, and what is wonderful - and unique - about her Brunhilde throughout the whole cycle is her lighter, more lyrical singing of the role than I've ever heard. It's really wonderful. And all of Brunhilde sounds easy for her, full of expression.<br /><br />This recording is also the best I've heard Siegfried Jerusalem sing, as an awe-inspiringly beautiful Siegfried. He's still fresh in voice, extremely expressive, and the rigors of &#34;Siegfried&#34; don't affect him at all. It sounds easy for him. Same in &#34;Gotterdammerung.&#34; The recording is worth it just for that singing alone. I venture to say that, much to my shock, Jerusalem surpasses even Lauritz Melchior in the role, no mean feat!<br /><br />In all, this recording deserves its 5 stars. And I'm gladdened to have a &#34;modern&#34; recording of the Ring that surpasses the old, classic recordings of Melchior and Flagstad, for example. It is a wonderful experience.m surpasses even Lauritz Melchior in the role, no mean feat!<br /><br />In all, this recording deserves its 5 stars. And I'm gladdened to have a &#34;modern&#34; recording of the Ring that surpasses the old, classic recordings of Melchior and Flagstad, for example. It is a wonderful experience.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I have to pace myself when I read now. And it is really hard to do so with these books.  I could not keep up with Suzanne, which is great.  I was constantly being surprised by the direction she was sending me.  Including the ending to book 2.  WOW!!!!!<br />Absolutely loved this book and the first book.  Ready for number three, and I will be disappointed when I am finished because I am selfish and will want it to continue.<br />Lastly, this is a teens book, however I, at my age, loved it.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Get it! You can listen to unlimited music!!! For free plus its smooth and fun to use<br />Great for amateur dj or wanna be!! Fun to fool around with too!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Much more action than last season, but at this point, I don't care if anyone in the core group dies, except for Daryl.
B003YZU53A|5.0|I seen the preview,and it caught my interest I wasn't disappointed.This movie covers issues that matter today.Religious tension and prejudices judging without knowing a person.How we can over come it and love one another at least try to.Killing doesn't solve any issues anger eats you up alive only love can free a person.<br />Beautifully written Shah Rukh Khan was excellent playing his character.It had me in tears at times heart warming sometimes triggered anger we all feel when misjudged and treated unfairly.<br />This movie is for everyone to see it will open people's minds and make them think.We are all connected in this world we all hurt and all suffer and actions of bad people do not  mean all are as guilty.
1847879071|5.0|Seriously this book was my best friend in graduate school. This book is great to have when what your professor says doesn't make sense, or you need to explain statistics to someone (such as an undergraduate class or a professor not well versed in stats).<br /><br />This book does a great job of breaking down the fundamentals and walks you step by step in SPSS. It begins with basic stats but will go through regression, factor analysis ect.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|I listen to music as I work to block out all of the background office chat and this is at the top of the play list.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I love the fact is contains a thick booklet with a suprise story (won't spoil for you)<br />amazing videos from 2 concerts and newer songs<br /><br />a must buy- for any layne / mad season / pearl jam / alice in chains fan!<br />=)
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed the book quite a bit although it had a slow start for me.  Once I became committed to the characters, I had a great time reading it.  I think I learned more about World War I from this novel than I ever learned in any history class.  It was a great education!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Tarantino is pretty much all about revenge. At least the Kill Bills, Inglorious Basterds and this very satisfying slavery revenge saga are. He picks great evil to avenge and the great evil here is US slavery and it certainly qualifies. Anything committed in avenging these horrors seems like an honest catharsis of these evils. He says and does things that are raw, bloody and horrible. But it always seems like it's an appropriate response.  This is fantasy.  It's catharsis. But it's a reflection of our national pain, still with us and still killing people and destroying lives.  This is one part of an opening dialogue.  He certainly has the guts to portray what we all need to face.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read other books by John Green and this one is amazing as the rest. Maybe even more. It will make you cry that is not a lie but with that it will also make you laugh. I think everyone can take something from this story. And every one should read it. I never read books more than once but I would read this over and over again xx
B0033TJATW|5.0|I grew up watch Michal Jackson and since my duaghter loves music figured she'd love to listen and hear him too!
1451627289|5.0|I am a HUGE Stephen King fan, and this book was a great read.  He is the master at character development, and this book was no exception.  I loved the premise of the book, and as usual the tragic but appropriate ending was very satisfying.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved the entire season and look forward to seeing the next one. This really is a Masterpiece and I hope there is a season 4 and 5.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show! we do not have cable, so this is the way to go to keep up witht he season.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|THANK YOU! My daughter saw this in Japan and when we got back to the States just had to get her a copy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like that the cards are dealt one by one.  The game is fun and the hint function is very helpful for new players.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|[[ASIN:B00CRS88IO The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada]]I just finished this book and was compelled to tell everyone how much I loved it. My friend read it first and then gave it to me and we both couldn't put it down. We loved `Skyfall' and were curious about Ian Fleming. It's astonishing that he created James Bond in 1953 based on his own experiences in World War 2 because the James Bond character is still so popular 60 years later! This book details all the inspiration that went into creating 007 by recreating the<br />adventures Ian Fleming (or `17F' as he was known) went on as a spy fighting the Nazis when they invaded France. The research is incredible. I loved all the period gadgetry and hardware. There's something here for everyone. There's a great romance sub-plot and lots of sharp humour. My favourite scenes were the ski chase and the helicopter sequence.
B005I548B4|4.0|I've read quite a few Nicholas Sparks books now so you start to get a feel for how they'll play out.  There were some similarities to another book he's written but I still enjoyed this one as it ended quite differently to what I expected.  If you like Nicholas Sparks then you'll find this book is another good read.
