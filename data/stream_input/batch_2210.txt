B007TXN4TK|4.0|I downloaded the Christmas version of this app, which I prefer more to this one, but it gives you some nice songs to choose from. You do have to buy additional songs which isn't fun. Another complaint is that it is harder to play the difficult levels on a Kindle Fire, mainly cause you can only press two keys at the same time. That is simply a Kindle issue though.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|the story of the most humble lyrical genius. i expected nothing less than amazing given its oscar win, and i got it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I had the original temple run and loved it and downloaded this when it first came out. It is very addicting!
0553801473|4.0|Having just finished A Dance with Dragons, I can say I was not disappointed. It may not have been my favorite book in the series so far, but I wasn't disappointed with it the way some people were. I didn't find it overly slow, though some perspectives move slower than others. Or maybe it's just that I find this whole series to be slower than your average book? I usually finish a book that I'm really enjoying within a few days, a week at most. With this series, each book took me a solid month to read. This wasn't really to do with the length of them, it was mostly to do with the changing in perspectives. I love the different POV style, but it allows you the break between stories in which to put the book down and go about your life. This slows the pace of the book a lot. However, that being said, I was never tempted to read anything else in the meantime. The world that Martin created, and continues developing in this most recent installment, is so detailed and amazing that it's hard not to want to know what happens next.<br /><br />I think what it comes down to for me in this series is the level of detail. It is unbelievable how much detail there is, from the geography and climate, to the names and houses, to the many different fantastic characters. But the changing POV aspect kind of prevented me from being completely and utterly sucked in. It isn't that the changes are abrupt or jarring, but it is a little disruptive, as I often forget where the new character's story has left off.<br /><br />Reading this series a bit of a commitment, so if you don't want to spend several months with it, I wouldn't recommend it. If, however, you do decide to read it, I think patience is kind of key. You have to kind of bear with Martin as he wades through the interwoven stories at a rather ponderous pace. It's worth it though. Absolutely worth it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun and addicting app. There is a second version that recently came out as well that is equally as fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a good game. it is a fun verity of games. I like random games like this. ok bye.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is addicting and lots of fun. I had another app very similiar to it and this just gave me more levels to play.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book used too much ugly language. I don't enjoy books with bad language.<br />It would have been a pleasure to read minus the bad language.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I do love this film but, I cannot imagine the lifestyles these people led.  The environs are great as with Martin Chuzzlewit.  The characters are upsetting.  I suppose maybe Dickens meant for the characters to be upsetting as Charles father spent some time in the Marshalsea and I imagine Charles was very upset about that.  Anyway, it is my belief that this film is great and I would recommend it to anyone.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It was quite a journey that Dr.Alexander experienced.  His retelling of his encounter is one that enjoyable to read, different from other journey tales and mingled with Christianity and Secular ideals.  Dr.Alexander discusses his faith beliefs before and after and his significant change of opinion.  He discusses his frustration with the inability to be able to discuss his experience without being seen as a quack or a person with a brain injury.  A fascinating experience worth the read.  A definate American Christian experience throughout.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 picks up where season 2 lacked and that is in the area of intensity.  Every episode leaves you wanting more as you are hanging off the edge of your seat.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out and was knocked out by all the visual effects that were very cutting edge back in 1979.The helmet sequence in the begining with all of its weird sound affects really jolted you out of your seat and this series done here in stunning blue-ray and 5.1surround sound will knock your socks off,for real.This is a must for all you sci-fi buffs,because this series of films are the ones that raised the bar,and plus Sigourney Weaver is a goddess hero in all these films,and she really kicks alien butt big time with fantastic action.It starts out with Alien,the first of the series,well acted ,great characters and acting,really well done story.Then came Aliens,done masterfully by James Camron,a sequel that was worthy of the original and even better.The action is none stop with multipul aliens plus the Queen of all the aliens,hold onto your seat because your in for one incredible ride and you'll never want to get off!The other two are a little dark ,they are a little too edgy, but they fit in with the first two,I personally like the original and sequel better,but thats just me,so enjoy and re-live great movie making,thanks,Mark
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was very spell binding and I enjoy good love stories.  I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.. Linda
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I give this book 5 stars!! I would recommend this trilogy to anyone and everyone. Absolutely loved it.  Truly sad that I'm done.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|One of my most favorite movies as a kid growing up... Made me dream of far off adventures and a great use of my imagination :)
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Interesting and captivating. I really really really enjoyed reading it and recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
B007HACDLK|1.0|On the advice of a friend, I was told that Flynn was a sure thing. Not so much. I never had a more difficult time trying to finish a book. Boring would be the best way to describe this.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Its a simple device that does what they sat it will do! Will give the color needed and protect the lens! I'll tell all my divers to pick one up!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Always wanted a horse but don't have the means to so this takes care of it. I even let my kids play it because they love horses to.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|If you are looking for a display arm that you can constantly re-position, this arm is *not* for you.<br /><br />With that said, if you just need to mount a display on your desk and leave it in that position (as I do), this unit is great.  I use it to hold my second display, as I have it positioned vertically, as in portrait mode, next to my primary display.  A vertical display is great for web pages, and I use it to hold my tool palettes for creative work.<br /><br />But as for the Neo-Flex arm, once you lock it into position, it does not move, as in it doesn't slowly tilt down, etc.  It's truly a \\"set it and forget it\\" unit. And for that use, it's perfect.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I've tried several Sudoku apps on various devices.  This one is one of the best.  There are thousands of puzzles, many levels and tons of variants.  It's easy to see and use.  The hint generator tells you where to look and not just fill in a number.  All in all this is a winner.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard this show was great, so I tuned in and was immediately hooked.  All of the characters suck you in and you find yourself routing for all of them (well, not quite all of them). I can't wait for season 3 to come to Amazon!
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|The photography is beautiful.  The boat scene lasts forever. It is a fascinating story. The best part is the connection between the tiger and the boy.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This is the most original show I've seen in years. It really takes me back to the 60's, when I grew up. It shows how much attitudes (and fashion) have changed. Even though all the characters are flawed and, in most cases, unlikeable, they are fascinating to watch. It is interesting to see how they evolve over the seasons.  Some may find this show depressing, but it is certainly thought-provoking, and every show has a theme which leaves you thinking about the issues.
B007VPLNGW|2.0|On level 19 you have to skip it. I think that is the hardest part in the game. Save up<br />for that level it is  800 coins. By!
1609419693|4.0|If she does your kind of humor you won't go wrong.<br />Fun listen and interesting and entertaining.<br />Good insight and 'behind the scenes' info on the making of television.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I mean<br />buying peanuts with real $$! And now I have one left!!<br />Do not by it!!!!!<br />And I mean it I repeat. Do not by it!!<br />I wish I could rake it 0 stars!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was an enjoyable movie with great historical accuracy. Well done. Watch it. You will not be disappointed even though you know the ending!
B00122A28A|5.0|This album sounds just as good now as it did when it was first released. Just when everybody thought Madonna had done it all she showed us she was just getting started
1433530848|5.0|It looks exactly like the picture. It's a solid bind. The text is small, but it doesn't bother me. There are incredible colored maps and architectural diagrams. Great bible and the way it was made gives it a modern-&#34;sacred&#34; feel to it.<br /><br />The commentaries are not on par with MacArthur's commentary in my opinion, because there have been serveral verses that were overlooked when I needed to know more, but the commentary content is top notch nothing to worry about there.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|THE PERFORMANCE WAS GREAT. LOVED THE SONGS. MOST OF ALL LOVED THE OUTFITS. CHER KNOWS HOW TO GET YOU MOVING. IF YOU LOVE CHER. YOU WILL LOVE HER FAREWELL TOUR.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I love this game.. The graphics are gorgeous, movement is smooth, very 3 dimensional.  Only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because you cannot track your scores, and that is very disappointing. How about it developers...should be an easy fix.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its temple run, but better. it looks nicer, has a good variety of upgrades and abilities. and I just fun to play
B0086700CM|2.0|I have tried this game, but I am not impressed.  I don't suppose I'll get addicted to it.  I wll try it again to se if I can really like to play it.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Great pack - used every day! Handle has a metal cable through it and lost of pockets for camera and kindle with my computer!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This is a keeper.  I will re-read man times.  I am glad it was not expensive and I have shared it with friends.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Lots of fun. A lot like old Mario but a whole lot different all the same. Fun game for kids and adults.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The stories are so well played out, and to think this was only a hundred years ago.  The formality is surpising, it's hard to imagine a life style like this.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|We enjoyed the movie, but none of the Bond movies have earned &#34;I love it&#34; from me.  Maybe if my husband was completing the review...there would be more stars.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I have watched all of the seasons so far and am quite addicted to the show.  Wonder why I never checked it out before.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I get a kick out of this show.  If is funny and easily digestible.  A nice way to relax and have a chuckle
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I loved the first book, the second was pretty good, but the third got kinda ridiculous. I still liked it and read it all. It was very entertaining and well written... the third book just got kinda outrageous. Very easy to read and suspenseful.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Course we know that Sherlock turns out to be on the side of good, and just just excitement because we've read the books.  But in Season 1, that remains a question.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I've love Lindsey Stirling's music form the get go, and it's so great to finally own some of her quality work for myself.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|but when I compare it to some of the other British shows that I've loved (Foyle's War, for example), it doesn't earn five stars.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Not sure what I can say more: Sulic & Hauser are brilliant musicians, and put out a really fun, easy to like album that's all about what they love to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best ever this is awesome get it I love I recommend it to anyyyone.  get it nnow I love the game
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Hi have read most of the Nick Sparks books and they are beach or airplane books. I do not need to give my full attention because all of his have books have similar characters, plots, and settings. I love a mindless book when flying or sitting on the beach. His books let you multitask.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the stories and I watched every episode. Some are better than others, true, but overall, if you are into this type of family drama, this is right on. I enjoyed it very much, was worth my time.
0765325950|5.0|beautiful book high quality paper and the book was an excellent read. Robert Jordan out did himself again! Purchased this as a gift for my youngest son..hoping this isnt the last series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so amazing. I loved it some much I love the limited time things in the store and the daily challenges. This game is truly amazing. I don't feel that I need to use actual money to get more coins. My only problem was that I am not really drawn in. This game is cool and fun but it takes so much time to unlock things that it gets repetitive. You run and then you die and do it again. This game will be fun if you enjoy setting goals achiving them but if you like to constantly be achiving them then DON'T BUY.  This game is great for little ones however because it slowly speeds up so they won't get boord or angry. All and all this game is great a real good buy. Glad it was free because I personally didn't like it. Don't let my opinion get in the way though. Get it and try it out if it even sounds remotely good. Great time passer for airplanes.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|This is my new favorite anime I am a collector of anime this is my new favorite.  zombies, gore, guns, swords, comedy, great character development, and all with hot women dressed in short skirts and armed to the teeth.  You gotta love it.  make sure you watch past credits each episode does not end until after the credits I know strange but well worth it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|fast... gives basic info without a lot of qualifiers... accurate for my area.. have not tried it in another zip code
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Do not think this is just another &quot;It won't work&quot; review. I have tried installing this app multiple times, only to be disappointed once again. The only reason I gave this app 3 stars was because of the fact that my brother has it on his iPod and it is AWESOME. P.S.Why does android always get the glitch version of apps?
B00BKTFABE|4.0|takes a good clear quality picture altho so far i haven't figured how to line it up to take a picture of different objects.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMG! This game is the best app on my kindle. It's fun and very entertaining. BEST APP EVER! Luv it!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Pros  It was entertaining<br />Cons  Language moved a little slow<br /><br />My husband enjoys the old cars that seam to show up in his movies.  The last one was better faster moving.  Can't remember the name.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game. I enjoy wasting time playing this game every minute. Need to start off with more money.<br /><br />Ffffffffff fighter Gregg fight chaff chaff chaff g high high Johnny Chubb fffff :/
B0015RFCZ0|1.0|It never showed up on any (TiVo, PC, or iPad) so I unable to watch.  Very frustrating as this happened on other videos ordered.  All requests for help never acknowledged.  Help sure be appreciated!
B00127RAJY|5.0|i am currently at level 2 and omg this is an intense 20 minute workout. level 1 was tough but level 2 is exponentially harder!!!
B000060MMI|5.0|This is by far our favorite Flogging Molly CD-we are a big fan and have been to a few of their shows and they rock!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Though I was somewhat horrified by the psychology of the characters, the writing kept me interested and glued to the page.
B004W10S9G|5.0|The legendary story of Nero burning Rome coupled with outstanding actors:  Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov and Leo Gennmakes makes QUO VADIS a movie that is definitely worth watching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Usually I avoid any show that features footmen and women wearing big hats but this series is different. In this season, the Great War  plays a pivotal role in the lives of all the characters. Strongly recommended.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|i love my mic :) i use it for many shoots i record alot on my canon 7d dslr camera
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have seen all of the Bond movies. This one ranks among the top ones and Craig is excellent as Bond. Exciting, current, provocative, and the characters we developed and presented as they should be.  Sorry that M leaves. Keep working as Bond, DC, as you are terrific.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|One of the most beautiful films you will ever see. Having seen Cirque de Soleil live I can say this is as close as you can come to actually seeing it in person. The story is practically devoid of dialog, which of course is how it should be since the story is told in a purely visual manner.  It does require some thinking and interpretation of the almost staggering amount of symbols throughout the movie. But it is not as complicated as one might assume, since the main story line is very simple. Even at that, it is so beautiful and at times so breathtaking that you just need to sit back and enjoy. You are constantly amazed by staging, the colors, the costumes and above all by the artistry of the performers. Let's not forget the great music of the Beatles and its both humorous and wonderful interpretation in the film.  If you have been lucky enough to see Cirque de Soleil in person this is a must have movie, if not, this film will make you want to attend a live performance of this wonderfully artistic show. Wish I could give it more stars.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Make me busy and happy. Definitely recommends this to my friends, also I'm ready download this in my mother kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like that it;s so life like.<br />And easy to play. With lots of challenges and quests. It great to play and very addicting.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Item was in great condition as described.<br />I am very satisfied and content.<br />The Lumineers's music is really great.<br />I would recommend this album to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. The graphics are so lifelike. It feels like you really own this horse. The different prices you can buy in the store are nice and you can customize however you want.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show for evening dramas with the family and even learing a bit about British history and the gentry from an era gone by.
B00BEQZK5Y|5.0|I have almost every Strato CD and to me they always have a few great songs on every CD but also have a bunch of filler.  With the departure of Tolki  you could definitely hear the sound change and get more complex but I think they were able to still deliver some catchy melodies.  Polaris has 2 great songs (Deep Unknown and Higher We Go) but also had some songs I always skip.  Elysium was better for sure but not perfect.  Nemesis is great from beginning to end.<br /><br />Guitar playing is amazing as expected but his sound is much better, more raw and heavy.  Kotipelto's vocals are better and a little less out front in the mix.  The most apparent change here is the modern/techno keyboard parts that really work and add rhythm and interest to some of the songs.  Halcyon Days and Fantasy are good examples of this.  And you have to get the mp3 version to get Fireborn - more crazy keyboards and cool guitar slide and of course another catchy sing along chorus.<br /><br />Probably going to be some debate over this CD and some metal fans might be turned off by the keyboards.  But if you like Stratovarius you already are OK with a lot of keyboards in a metal song.  This CD has everything you want from Starovarius and is more consistent all the way though than their past releases.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|this is a rip off i bought the extra collor and got nothing i dont even why you would buy it
B004FX51J8|4.0|Just picked up Last Look At Eden along with the new one Bag of Bones.  Last Look has 3 stand out songs (Last Look At Eden, New Love in Town and No Stone Unturned) with the rest more bluesy &#34;new Europe&#34; style songs.  I do like the new Europe style and John Norum's guitar sound.  There are some real cool tunes on this CD, but this CD for me is all about the 3 stand outs.  New Love in Town is really a great song and a shame no one in the US gets to hear it, unless you are a die hard Europe fan.<br /><br />If you likes the last 2 releases this one is even better even if it didn't have the 3 hits.  I think Bag of Bones might be an overall better CD then this one but doesn't have any real stand outs except maybe Bring it On Home.
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|Absolutely the best book on CSS that shows you all the things you wish you knew and wish you could do. Now you will and can.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really addicting and is really fun to play...it is pretty easy and the things you can get for your person are pretty cool. I really like this game so you should definitely download it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Never boring. Kept you wondering who did it. It was a page turner! Kind of disturbing sometimes, but a great mystery.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I can't imagine how they would write a screenplay from this as most of the story goes on in his head.

B00012QM8G|5.0|awesome movie ....just as it was it was years ago when i saw it for the first time way back in the day
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|The kids love this and have more fun playing this together. They giggle and laugh while playing. I myself have not tried it, but the kids love for it says it all to me!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Easy to use interface.  It has a boat-load of options in the settings to individualize it, but default is just fine.
B0038KHTGC|5.0|What can I say?  It's an Avantasia album, so you're guaranteed a good listen.  Like most, if not all Avantasia songs, they're extremely catchy and the musician ship is amazing.  Not much to say  (well, not really, I just don't want to take awhile), but GET THIS ALBUM!  NOW!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hunger games books have been the best series ever and thii a great ending to it. A little gory in my mind
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love Jillian Michaels' workouts.  These 3 are great, because the first one is fairly easy, the second one is a good workout, and the third one is really good.  I like that they're not too long, either, because I have 1 and 3 year old daughters, so some days it's hard to squeeze in a long workout.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Awesome game wish you could level up faster. Have so much fun playing with my boys. We have so much fun trying to beat each other to the next levels.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|There's really not much on the air like this show - epic zombiepocalypse. While zombie have been in the zeitgeist for a quite a while, this show tackles the genre on a large scale and is obviously quite successful.<br /><br />Characters are fun, provides good scares and plenty of armchair second-guessing when the characters make judgement errors (this happens quite often).<br /><br />Show is very gory, so I don't think suitable for kids or those that are squeamish. Thematically, it can get a bit redundant, but overall it's a lot of fun and once you start watching it rally sucks you in. Overall, great show!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The chapters were interesting but I did not like the ending.  It was a disappointment that the psychopathic wife got away with murder!
B001NP8PQW|4.0|you can tell by the image quality that it was shot for DVD and not blue-ray.  Sound quality is excellent.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This was my wife's favorite book growing up so we watched it when it came out in theaters. I bought the movie for her to have because she made me a fan of the story. Plus I have to say, it was very interesting to finally watch something with Emma Watson not being a wizard (IMO - Pretty good acting).
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Awesome!! Great movie, great price, awesome quality, quick shipping... what more could you want? Love it! Definitely a great place to buy blurays!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I love this movie and wanted to own it.  I have already loaned it out ,so someone else can enjoy the movie.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It is a great carrying case. I love that I can charge it in the case and it's compact to carry in my pocket.
B00005JKTF|5.0|Cate Blanchett is an excellent actor.  I enjoy her acting.  I like the story of Charlotte Gray.  This movie is one of my favorites.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I liked this book because it was always one step ahead of me and zigged when I zagged.  ...kept me coming back for more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful! I was very impressed with it because almost never find games as good as these on a kindle! So fun too! :)
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I fell asleep during this, don't watch unless you pay attention very closely. It's a confusing movie. But i'm sure if i watched again i would like it more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Another fine read, the last in the series, which kept me intrigued and on the edge of my seat. Rather sad to have finished it.
B004EI924E|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and I can't wait to see the sequel.<br /><br />I more than highly recommend this movie!
B000066C1Z|4.0|I recently started collecting records, but it was all stuff I liked, like mostly punk rock etc.<br />Decided I would buy this for my wife because she is into Madonna.  I actually really like this record too and I am not a big Madonna fan.  This is like a greatest hits for me because I like her fun bubblegum 80's stuff, not the melodramatic 90's stuff or techno 00's stuff.
B009VL28W2|5.0|focus on magnetic album however is a excellent concert! sounds great, and have extra content, for $15 aprox. its a good deal.
B000002WPH|5.0|A hip-hop classic, what more needs to be said other then get this album on vinyl?  Nothing will boost your street cred like Wu on the turntable.
0061122416|3.0|It is boring and I didn't like the storyline and there are some parts that keeps repeating and repeating . I also didn't see any depth in it
B006OAB2WK|4.0|Songs from this album would randomly come on my LastFm, eventually it grew on me.  Sounds a little bit to me like the inevitable Cocteau Twins comparison meets Enya with some weird loops and beats throws in.  I like this album better than the other two i've heard from her, as well as the Darkbloom split.
B00AKCJB44|5.0|This sound track displays a wide variety of different genres and also original pieces as well. Good movie and good sound track.
0861714911|4.0|I have been reading books on Buddhism for more than forty years--I started with Walpola Rahula's \\"What the Buddha Taught\\" and Edward Conze's \\"Buddhism: Its Essence and Development\\" for a university class on Buddhism in 1970--and I bought \\"In the Buddha's Words\\" several months ago in order to review it and decide if it warrants a place on the Spiritual Reading List that I include in the books I write. And it does.<br /><br />It is an outstanding and voluminous collection of the Buddha's words, gleaned directly from the Pali Canon, and definitely  \\"must\\" reading  for anyone deeply and seriously into original Buddhism--but it is not without flaws. First, it is tethered to political correctness. Anybody who journeys deeply into the Buddha'a teachings knows that the Buddha denigrated women, labeling them stupid and full of passion and envy.  But Bhikku Bodhi makes sure not to include the Buddha's disparaging words on women, lest he offend a goodly portion of his readers. Second, I found nothing in the text on the Heart-release, which Gautama spoke of and equated with the attainment of Nirvana. This is a serious omission, because the severing of the Heart-knot in Hindu yoga is concomitant with Self-realization; and astute metaphysicians would realize that the Heart-release that accompanies Buddhist Nirvana (the end of becoming) is no different than the Heart-cutting associated with Hindu Self-realization (permanent abidance in Being).<br /><br />For sheer quantity of the Buddha's words, this volume cannot be beat, but in terms of quality, I rate it behind F.L Woodward's \\"Some Sayings of the Buddha According to the Pali Canon,\\" easily my favorite original Buddhism text. Bhikku Bodhi is a good writer, but in my estimation, Woodward is better. His prose soars, and you almost feel as if you're sitting in the Jeta Grove, listening to the Buddha discourse on the Dharma. But if you're a serious student of Buddhism, you won't have to choose between these two texts; you'll get both of them.h of them.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|It is very insightful and easy to navigate.  It gives a different perspective on life and how to live without the restrictions society places on people.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I had played the games on the developer's website, so when they announced that they were releasing an app, I was, needless to say, very excited. Even though I got it as a free app of the day, it is well worth the $1.99 price tag.<br /><br />To sum up the gameplay quickly: You draw a stick figure for yourself, and you draw another one who serves as your [kidnapped] companion, who you must save. You complete each level by utilizing various pencils, meaning that you draw a particular shape to bring about a particular effect, such as drawing fire to burn down a tree. (Just don't burn yourself!) There are various enemies who will attack, so use your creativity, and your magic pencils, to defeat them!<br /><br />The concept is simple and unique, but challenging in its own way; therefore, this is a game that anyone with a couple of dollars to spare should consider playing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This has to rank among Grisham's best. I literally could not put it down and read it straight through from beginning to end in one day,  wondering where on Earth he was going. But of course, everything came together at the end, with all the loose ends neatly tied up.u
B0033TJATW|3.0|The story line is extremely lacking, it kind of seems like just a random assortment of music videos mixed in with a bit of Joe Pesci trying to get kids to do drugs. One of my favorite moments is when they take Michael's video of &#34; Bad&#34; and remake it with kids, headlining with one of the kids from the Sandlot. Do not buy this expecting any sort of cinematic genius (unless of course you consider Michael Jackson having a dance off as a claymation bunny genius) But you can expect to at least get a few laughs out and it's probably best if you get a group of friends together for it, I'm sure there's a fun drinking game that would work perfectly for it!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Why we need to begin to eat to live and forget the love to eat.  Health is more important that taste.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this app!!!!! it is awesome. my sistr loves it too it is a gfeat app for ANYONE. if you are looking for a cool app to get that includes horses, then this app is for you!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am enoying this game. It's keeping me from my housework so it must be good. I recommend it for anyone who likes Mahjong.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I think the problem with our current time is that nothing is new anymore. Everything has been seen before, and now when you see scary images you can recognize the effects used, or at least know one was used. That was one thing about the scary face seen throughout this movie. I did get freaked out through a few parts of this but I honestly spent more time thinking, &#34;Why?&#34;. Maybe that's part of the horror movie experience, sitting there and screaming at the TV or thinking, &#34;Why would you do that?&#34;.<br /><br />I think the best part of this movie was the music. It had some very unique and creepy music that was more memorable than the actual movie. I do like Ethan Hawke however, he always chooses weird, artsy films. His girlfriend/wife was unremarkable and he had zero chemistry with her. How she didn't know what house they were living in is beyond me. Overall it wasn't the worst horror movie I've seen and did have some unique concepts. I'd watch it just for the music.
B005LW5J9O|3.0|This book is about as exciting as a book about a papal scribe seeking ancient texts in old monasteries could be. There is a romanticism about Poggio Bracciolini's bibliophilia and his undying quest to rediscover the brilliance of the ancients, but the thesis of the book seems slightly far-fetched. I do not question the impact that ancient texts have on modern thought, and as someone who is quite interested in such ancient thought, I give immeasurable credit to the impact of the world's original thinkers on humanizing our species. However, the impact of this single text, Luctretius's On the Nature of Things, upon the trajectory of modern thought might be a smidge overblown. Despite such shortcomings, there is much to learn within Greenblatt's pages.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This movie is so moving and inspiring, I have watched it several times (and also bought his music).  Rodriguez is an amazing singer-songwriter who is more popular than Elvis and The Beatles in South Africa, where his true talent was recognized, unbeknownst to him for a very long time.  He inspired South Africans to rise up against apartheid and his music became the anthem of a generation.  But, he is also so much more than an incredibly talented and poetic musician.  He is a great voice for the every man and for social justice.  He was able to transcend the most difficult of circumstances and is a beautiful example of humility and the value of every person, no matter who they are and what they do (he wore a 3 piece suit or tux to do demolition work! - what a remarkable demonstration of showing the dignity and value in each of us and in our work, no matter what that work is and in embracing our life circumstances).  Rodriguez is a true hero in my book and this is such a great movie - it deserved to win the Oscar for Best Documentary.
B00594XOZU|1.0|They sent me a message that went kinda like this: there is a overflow of kik user names ...please forward this to ten people on your contacts...if you are not a frequent user then kik will begin to charge you 25.00 to your bill...<br /><br />What I'm worried about is that I only have one contact and that would be my brother. And most certainly don`t want to pay 25.00 a month for a dumb texting app that isn't even user friendly.<br /><br />So if you don't want to pay an extra 25.00 each month ,don't get this app at all.
B008DVJMAW|4.0|great band, we are amazed that we just found out about them. looking for other cds by blackberry smoke as we speak.
0140449337|5.0|This is an excellent work of philosophy.  Marcus' words have really changed my life and have helped me face myself during a time when I was going through a lot of emotional and psychological turmoil/confusion.  His words, ideas, and philosophies encouraged me to face myself, understand my insecurities and fears, and learn how to overcome them.<br /><br />The great thing about 'Meditations' is that it is written in aphorisms and as a result, is a very easy read for individuals who don't have very much time to sit down and read for hours on end.  I would read Marcus' words for 5-20 minutes every night before bed and would wake up the next morning feeling more secure and refreshed than the day before. I will be forever grateful to Marcus for empowering me to accept myself and find it within myself to lead an emotionally and psychologically balanced life.<br /><br />My life is forever changed for the better.  Hopefully this collection of \\"books\\" will have a similar effect on yours as well.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I am enjoying this book.  I have not completed it, but what I have read is very interesting.  Creates insight into how the brain works and how habits are formed and can be used as tools in various aspects of our lives.  Very thought provoking.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Nothing funny about movie.  Her character was as shallow when she returned to town years later as she must have been when she was in high school.  She could't stand her hometown, but yet came back thinking nothing had changed and hoping to rekindle an old flame.  Will not watch again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I very much enjoy playing Angry Birds on my phones, but having it on my Kindle is nice too.  I enjoy the larger screen and fabulous graphics.  Beware, though, this game is addictive!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am not big on war movies...but this movie...was awesome.  The \\"raw\\" singing, the absolute professionalism.  Loved the cast.  It kept you on the edge of your seat, made you smile and cry.  Take a box of kleenex with you.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Lzzy Hale lays it out and plugs it in and let's it roar. She is everything all those cookie cutter girl singers on Idol, etc, etc, wish they could be - but never will. Full of raw and real talent. And can exhibit it!<br /><br />Right now its the chicks who are rocking RocknRoll - while the boys get lazy with the same old stuff of last year and the ones prior. Rock might die soon but I think the Lzzy Hales, Scabbia, etc etc - can help revive it. Its in the hands of the ladies now.<br /><br />I'm an old guy, a huge music fan and consumer, always seeking new artists, who make me pause - and LzzyHale did it.<br /><br />I can't wait for summer, cause this is Summer driv'n music - like the old days.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I wish everyone in the world could hear track number 3, \\"The Western Sky\\" on Justin Hayward's new CD \\"Spirits of the Western Sky\\".  For me, I would have to say it is the most beautiful song I have ever heard.  Somehow Justin Hayward managed to completely bare his soul through his words and music.  The song is ethereal. The remix of \\"Out There Somewhere\\" took 20 years off my life! It will get you moving. Great remix! As Justin says on his website about this CD \\"It's about you, not just me.\\"  I highly recommend taking a listen.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I put this on my phone and none of the keys would work! I might have messed up but I followed all instructions! So it was returned!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The very Best series in years, cant wait for the next season to be released along with the next book.
B00B2064IY|5.0|I suggest that everyone who ever has liked Hendrix should buy this. Maybe it can be number one in sales. Then people would know what real rock sounds like. There is alot more passion on this album than many of his others. I like the whole album. Had it one day, only played it 5 times that day(I had to work).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an incredible book.  It made me angry and made me cry and it made me want to be 17 and in love...  it is sad and it is hopeful and it is one that I will leave in my cloud and read again some day.  Thank you Colleen Hoover for this emotional journey.
B00B3EVNEE|4.0|I like this album. Robin is such a great guitar player. I like &#34;Living Out Of Time Live In Germany&#34; better, but  Robin plays the old classics with passion and I like that. I don't know why he is not more popular.
B0093X805W|5.0|It is a cool book. The illustrations make it even better. My favorite character is Charlie. He is so fun.
B00B3EV8IU|3.0|I bought this album on a whim. It's pretty good. A little old school in his approach to the blues. I wouldn't say this is my favorite type of blues. However it is calming and well thought out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book answered all of the questions I had from the first book. I can't wait to start book three!!!!!!!!!
B000TERDNO|5.0|You'll yell for joy when you hear this album. Billy's best songs--what could be better? Totally enjoyable rock and roll.
B00A7OJ0DC|1.0|You'd think Disney would give you an HD Digital Copy and NOT a SD Copy, if you were buying it on Blu-ray.  It's another way in which they get you to buy the movie Twice if you want Blu-ray and a 1080p HD Digital Copy to take with you on your portable devices, like an iPad, iPad Mini or iPod Touch.  SHAME ON YOU DISNEY!!!!!!!
B005MMYEF8|5.0|Truly the most violent show on television. I have games on my IPAD that are similar to parts of the show. I have seen every show. The characters are deep. My only regret is that I have to wait until the season is over to buy the current season. I wish they would release tham a week after it is shown on tv.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|If you can believe in incredible coincidences, like misogynistic sex, believe the well-born are better born and evil lurks in the hearts of men, you will enjoy this penny thriller. I founf it to too long.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I rated it 5 starts because the book had a good plot and the characters were believable. I can't wait the second book.
B00B04NJLW|2.0|Sure, some of the shorts were entertaining, but many were just gross/dumb/boring.  The concept sounded good, but when you realize each one only had to have some relation to a word beginning with a given letter, then you realize there's really no plot, etc. nothing to connect these to one another other than the artifice of the alphabet.  Even as a collection of horror shorts, most of these wouldn't make the cut if it weren't for the fact that they needed something for that letter.  Next time they should check the resume of the &#34;directors&#34; before offering them the job.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This is a great story. I love the difference from the first Original movie but Jackie Chan does it all well. I love the acting in this movie and I would recommend this to everyone. Great for the entire family. Plus the mother is one of my favorite actors in my favorite tv show &#34;Persons of Interest&#34; Ms. Henson. She is a great actor and should do more. Your kids will love this movie as well.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|Can't go wrong with the boss. Bruce is so real, and live is always the best when it comes to Bruce and E-Street.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|If you have not seen this movie &#34;Hugh Jackman&#34; is great in this movie. I loved him in X-Men but I will never forget him as the dad that learns so much in this movie. This movie is funny, heartfelt, and has a great story. I can watch it again and again. Great family movie that you must see. I know a lot of people don't like Robot movies or Sci-fi but this one you must see. It has a great ending that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will be laughing and maybe even shed a tear or two. I would recommend this for all ages. Great Plot, Great Ending, all around great movie.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|It gets better the more you listen to it. It's as if she has purposefully obscured the melodies. I can't stop listening to it.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|If you like a more dark twist I recommend this movie. It is more strange than the first one, and a little peculiar but good. My daughter loved \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and she loved this one more, but she is a teen to. I would not recommend this for small children because it can scare them, I think teens that are into a more dark twist in a movie would love this one. I liked it because it was a different in the spin of things. Just to get you started Dorthy loses her ruby slippers when she returns home. Someone that should not have them finds them and Dorthy must return to Oz to save it. .... . That is all I am saying for now. You can't find this movie hardly anywhere because of the dark side of it. But I enjoyed it... As a book author I am always looking for a different point of view on things and I enjoyed this one. [...]
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very intense.  Did not think it would be a book of a freaky individual.  Not my cup of tea.  Hope to find a better book to read that will find happiness ...
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I saw the movie first, when it was in theaters, so I knew the story and end result going in.  However, the book is well written and kept me intrested to the final words.  Of course, there were still surprises inside....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought I would like a show with zombies, but since everyone was watching and talking about it I gave it a look. To my complete surprise, I love this show.  The character interaction is what makes this work and come together. It is sometime raw and harsh with the zombie elimination and survival, but that adds to the intensity. I guess it is an escape to another place and time that we will never encounter.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I bought this cd for my wife.  She liked a couple songs on it.  I started listening to it myself.  I ended up liking it a lot.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would highly recommend this series,it is thought provoking and intense! Watch them all its a great experience. Best ever
B008D1LVRY|4.0|Good Band.  Definitely good head banging music.  The price was very nice too.  $5 for a whole album.  You can't beat that.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I enjoy explanation because I can access my computer.  I can play games loaded on my desktop or on Facebook that the tablet doesn't have on the application.
B00004YM0D|5.0|Who doesnt love this movie Who couldnt love this movie? Its an inspirational movie about racisism at its highest about 2 high school coaches who have to work together with white and black kids! Great cast and i have the movie and i love the music so i got the soundtrack Consignment did a great job of the product and delivery service! Would order from them again they were awesome and get an AA++ from me. Thank you for your service!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am very pleased with this app.  It is very easy to use and very fast.  I use it quite often!
0812984412|3.0|CLOUD ATLAS is an ambitious and well-written novel and David Mitchell should be congratulated for both. It’s a shame then that it isn’t as successful as it might have been. Famously constructed in a sort of palindromic way some of the sections work better than others (for me the most interesting is the central one set in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii). But here’s where the problem lies: there is a lack of any real synergy between the parts, and they thus fail to combine to produce a greater whole. It also seems to me that Mitchell has a somewhat casual attitude to the possible connections between the characters, which leads the reader to wonder why he or she should care. Maybe this was his intention, but it left me feeling a little let down. Overall, however, the book is often funny and always entertaining, and is certainly a worthwhile read.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like this app.  It's very easy to use and very fast.  I don't have anything negative to say about it.
B0026SCMNM|2.0|I truly enjoyed this book in the beginning, I love books about immigrants and New York City. However, it went in an odd direction. It didn't explain much of what was going on and the ending left me without closure. The framework is there for a great book but the material is just not there.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|An uplifting dystopian novel - who knew?<br /><br />Fun story, nicely paced, and with a steady stream of late '70s / early '80s pop culture and geek references. You'll feel like an adolescent again.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This movie is all about living in the present, in light of the past, all the while being immersed in India.  Very enjoyable.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|The author has come up with a wonderful premise and this book kept me entertained til the very end.  The plot was well developed and I liked the characters.  And if you are one of those people who spends time thinking about what computers and social media are doing to the fabric of our culture, this book will be somewhat thought provoking.<br /><br />The ending was a little &#34;meh&#34; - but that's okay.  I still enjoyed this book and would recommend it as a quick, delightful read.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|This set of Legos was a Christmas gift for my grandson who is a big Star Wars fan. He loved it.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Read it like a detective story for the pleasure of great writing and vivid characters. A wonderful vignette of life near the top of society, and a devastating portrait of the Church in the 15th Century. But the author makes wild claims about the effects of one text on theology and science. Did Lucretius' poem really introduce the idea that there might not be a God or afterlife to people at the time? From the story itself it is clear that there were plenty of unbelievers at the time. Nor is it credible that all the alchemists and other scientist of the time were frozen into one Aristotelian way of thinking.<br />A wonderful story and elegant slam on religion, yet it over-reaches.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|The tools are there for this to be a great series.  Huff's imagination was wonderful and really set things up for the following books which is where the meat of the series will probably take place.  I would think that the book may have needed more length to get more character interaction, but the as I said, the tools are there to develop a fantastic series.
0694003611|3.0|The book is a classic according to many others. But my son, and my family, we just didn't all in love with this like many others. My son likes the cow, but other than that he flips through it so fast and ends up wanting to do something else.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy, quick read.  He may have similar storylines but always just a bit different to keep it interesting.  To have a Kindle purchase is a plus.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|He loves Star Wars, and he loves BluRay movies. Perfectly satisfied with the visual and sound effects placed beautiful on the screen with the clear blu ray view. He loves watching them, so nothing to complain about here.
B004FPZ2KY|3.0|Having seen several different makes of movies of this book, I was very familiar with the wonderful story -- however-- the archaic language and writing form made for very difficult reading.  If I hadn't known the story in advance I probably would not have finished it due to having to re-read sections frequently to determine who was speaking, etc.  The run-on sentences drove me crazy.  I am so happy PBS found it worthy of being made into a very fine movie.  This book was chosen by my book club, and so I was determined to give it a go in spite of the difficulties and I'm glad I did, but will probably not go on to read other books by Jane Austen.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I was the same age as the cast was in the years the story takes place, and I remember feeling the way some of them felt and having friends who were like other characters.  Great capture of the era, the teen angst, and the real life consequences of actions can have on people for decades.
1594487154|3.0|This book was a very quick read and I got a few useful tips out of it but this book isn't nearly as good as Drive, Pink's previous work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great for kids of all ages.  It is very family friendly.  It can keep little ones busy and help kill time for the young at heart.
B001EBWING|5.0|I have been watching this movie over and over for over forty years. It is a classic. You can't rate classics. They are in a class all their own.
B00BEU6JVY|5.0|What a Great... Beautiful album.<br />In your Blue Eyes...<br />I feel this album deep in my soul.<br />Just like the Moodies used to do in the begining.<br />I prayed for this album and Justin delivered it.<br />I thought it would be a Moodies album but he decided for this.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Hayward<br />Thank You<br /><br />Tommy Boy
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I have enjoyed many G5 games. This one is no different in format,  but a different story that is engaging. Sometimes the program does not respond, hence the four stars.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Great cd I actually like it better than the last one. I recommend this to Bruno lovers every where thanks
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book kept my interests the entire time. I was on the edge of my  seat a lot of angst and excitement.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Superficially, it's childish humor - But the subtle references are amazing. One great example is where Kim Jon Il asks what the penalty would be if he were to not let the United Nations inspector look for weapons of mass destruction. Hans Blix replies, &#34;..... we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are.&#34; . . . a perfect, true example of how impotent the U.N. really is.<br /><br />The opening scene of Team America blowing up virtually all of Paris to kill a handful of terrorists, then cockily telling the stunned Parisians not to thank them, they were only doing their jobs is priceless!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I haven't made it through every song but I picked up on a lot of really great kick you in the face tracks. Maria's voice just gets better with every cd. Cd in good shape. Everything was good.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|The graphic are wonderful, it makes the game so challenging.  Finding the objects are so hard to find, love it.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Natalie portman is amazing. And everybody thinks she's hot. Meant to be on blu-ray and enjoyed on a big screen with big sound.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|the opening sequence does not disappoint. the opening sequence is almost the prime reason that i love James Bond movies. the action is good from start to finish, but as a &#34;Daniel Craig is the best of all Bonds&#34; fan, i like his brooding humanity and his forced emotional repression. The 'intimacy' between he and M is excellent and it has its climax of course in the final scene. Judy Densch is just the best, and she did a fantastic job at Skyfall. (see it to know what I mean).<br />I like too that the action becomes between Bond and the bad guy (forget his name, but he is type cast in the bad guy role, but he does play a despicable guy), and that the Good/Evil relationship is played out mano a mano, vs, one guy against the world-destroying-evil guy.<br />Take a peak, you'll have a good go.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|My daughter and I connected both our phones easily and it does the job.  The speaker is loud and does not have an echo, actually better than my cell speaker phone.
1451695195|4.0|Gives one pause when a scientist steps into the unknown and is willing to face his peers on his experience.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Although I had seen the entire series before, I am thrilled to own it all on DVD in one convenient set!
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|We turned it off after 15 minutes. It was just too odd for our tastes. Very theatrical and difficult to follow
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We really enjoyed the program, waiting for Series 4. I hope you will show it as soon as available. Thanks
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was a complete surprise. It was nothing like what I had expected. I mean this of course in a good way.  Well worth reading...
0800141601|4.0|I was quite pleasantly surprised by this rendtiion of King Arthur. First Knight really did hit the spot for me. While it is no Excalibur, I can honestly say that this movie is a movie for everyone. It does not have the gratuitous violence that Excalibur had nor does it have too much CGI effects that 2004's King Arthur had. What it does have is a binding relationship between all of the main characters. It has scenery and it has battle scenes worth seeing over and over again. I just finished seeing Robin & Marian a few days before I viewed this film. This movie was better by far. In both movies the protagonist dies in the end, but in this movie he died honorably defending his people while in Robin & Marian he is poisoned by the bride he never had. Which movie leaves a better taste in your mouth?<br /><br />A villain named Malagant (Played By The Great Ben Cross) that seeks to control and dominate every one. \\"Self-sacrifice is very easy. It's having to sacrifice someone you love that puts your convictions to the test,\\" Malagant says after having abducted Arthur's wife. Cross plays Malagant with a witty flair that almost supercedes the protagonist leads. His villain is more debonair than the villain in King Arthur while showing more screen presence than Boorman's Excalibur. Don't get me wrong, the other movies I mentioned were also top knotch and I will review them at some point in the future.<br /><br />The chemistry shown between Ormond and Gere allows this movie to flourish and shine. Too, the great Sean connery only uplifts this move all the more. Although I must wonder how realistic it was to have a 65-year-old Connery playing opposite to a then 30-year-old Ormond. I don't believe the age difference was that great in the Middle-ages. Even allowing for artistic license regarding their playing younger characters, the age difference is hard for the viewer to overcome. Although it was not glossed over. The many allusions to Arthur having known Guinevere's father at least put the age difference in the light while not over stressing it.<br /><br />The fact that there was no Merlin did not affect me in the slightest. The story was so strong that I forgot about the wizard until the end of the movie. By then I was too engrossed to complain. Kudos to the screenwriter for not force feeding us the mage so as to be reverent to the original story.<br /><br />The locations and settings and special effects by CFX Associates make this a memorable movie. Arthur's Camelot may have been the best of any I've ever seen (Including Excalibur). Gere's Lancelot was given more depth than Clay's Lancelot in Excalibur. The love triangle we see in First Knight is more realistic and in depth than the one presented in Excalibur. Too, Lancelot himself is more than just a great swordsman, but an honorable man searching for himself. Yet despite being honorable man he is flawed too, and like all men he has a weakness for a beautiful woman.<br /><br />My one real quibble with this movie is the lack of armour. There is none! Unlike A Knight's Tale and Excalibur (The Best Movie That Ever Presented Armour), the knights wear a breastplate and greaves. Sometimes they have no helmets! This was an oversight and may have reflected in the budget. Despite this, I liked the movie and give it Four-Stars in rating.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B009K0P10K|4.0|As with the first season it was intriguing to see whom she would destroy and who she would take pity on.  Also, always up in the air as to whom her current love interest will be.  Keeps you guessing.
1449320104|5.0|Extremely well organized, this book will be your best and fastest reference for finding just about anything C# and .NET. It has very clearly stated what it does and does not cover. The information I find in this book is correct, and my mechanical search in this book usually yields reliable results faster than anything I'd get from Google!
1401225756|4.0|First off, I had always heard about The Sandman being a saga that I should check out. It had high praises everywhere, and everyone seemed to like it. Sometimes that amount of praise turns me off to a series. I bit the bullet and opted to try reading the first volume. I was pretty surprised when the story began to take off. I came to enjoy the character, even if he did look like a member of Kiss. The mixture of DC Comic characters with The Sandman character himself was pretty interesting, too. It reminded me of how Stephen King pulled from the universe he had written many stories in for The Dark Tower. I finished this volume, and the only reason I rated it four stars was because the book itself was really gloomy and dark. I expected as much, but most of the beginning book was this way. I hope it doesn't continue to depress. The end of the book seemed like it was heading towards an empowerment moment for The Sandman. Here is hoping the others are five star worthy.
B0058YPILY|5.0|These are real people dealing with horrific problems who keep their sanity for the most part and deal with the victims with respect.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|the Downton Abbey series is worth the money.  I'll be watching this over the long months until Series 4 comes out. Particularly like the extras about making the series.
B002C949KE|5.0|An engagingly written introduction to the field of behavioral economics. I don't know how it is for experts, but it's very enjoyable for laypeople!
B000R9RGF6|5.0|I have listened to this CD over and over again.  My favorites are tracks 2, 4, and 6. I first heard the music on the commercial for Johnson and Johnson right before the olympics last summer and googled it.  Boy am I glad I did.  I love this music.
B0014GVCI8|5.0|Ellen Page does a remarkable, albeit sometimes too advances for the 16-year-old she portrays, job as Juno; a fast-talking, off the cuff, says it like it is, pregnant teenager who goes to great lengths to carry her unborn child to term for a deserving couple from an add in the local Penny Saver.
1569765677|5.0|This autobiography of Carter was written while still in prison, gives great insight to the early years of this man and the prejudice and injustice he experienced, early in life, sending him to jail three times before his career as a prize fighter began. When the movie Hurricane came on cable, I watched with my son, as a boy picked up this same book while trying to learn to catch up his reading skills. Enjoying the movie prompted me to buy the book for both my son and me. I have been in search of something/anything that will get him to read, at age 11. It does contain explicit language and graphic description of this 11 year old's time in boys' prison. I hope this is a gentle, home version of scared straight. It leaves one to question, how can this happen in this country.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Tons of action, lots of suspense. I will be getting every episode that comes out. Stephen makes an outstanding and believable arrow!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|way too slow! when typing it takes too long for the letters to show up and I think its not working
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|It is evident that the author made a sincere effort to write a touching and interesting story. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it.<br />Probably the main reason for my disappointment is the fact that the main characters show much higher intellectual, moral, and emotional maturity than implied by their age. For this reason they looked to me artificial, and I was not able to develop a real empathy to any of them.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Can't put it down.  The graphics of the game are very colorful and bright. Next, the sound makes the game.  When you get the bonus points, the game comes alive with the explosions.
B000HX4ZF6|4.0|A great show, a must watch without commercials. Still tough for me to figure out a couple of parts, however  I love the feeling of pride and honesty it portrays.
B007X70NVO|5.0|If you enjoy racing and really want to see a true look behind the scenes and relive some very exciting moments in GP history you'll want this item.  Pulls you in from the start.  If your not already a fan of motogp you will be after watching this documentary.

B00BHMF578|5.0|Of course the movie is great. Compelling story, excellent acting and yes... even superb directing. Amazon streamed it well. I would recommend renting as this is not necessarily a repeat watcher. CAUTION: Do not watch this movie if you are trying to quit smoking!
1455523550|5.0|It's hard to rate any of this author's books, one above the other!  I have enjoyed all of these books tremendously!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Even more simple than trying to get a netbook to print CONNECTED.  Easy to use and IT ACTUALLY WORKS! cheers
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I took this with me on a Deployment with the US Navy. On a ship you aren't really afforded a ton of room. I could tuck this thing away almost anywhere and lock it so no one messed with it. The inboard speakers were load enough to be heard in a fan room at only 50%. It has a headphone jack so I used that most of the time anyway. The shell kept everything from breaking and made it through a duffle bag ride from Rota, Spain to Madrid then to New York and back to Norfolk Va. Thats after 5 months of a 6 month deployment with the punishment I put on stuff.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|This app rocks. I used it free on my laptop for a year and loved it. Does work as seamlessly with every mobile browser, but there's always been an option available. After Steve Gibson's analysis on his show I was sold and now pay $12 a year for convenience and security. A real bargain.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|The First one was funnier. Still great stupid humor mixed in with a similar storyline from the first movie awesome Tyson cameo
B004T32SOK|5.0|I love having my s*** backed up. I'm a little (a lot) paranoid about it. box helps take the edge off. At home, other than picture and movie files I first save to a True Crypt container and then send to box encrypted. These documents are not easily available when mobile, but that's on me.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|This album is great for most if not all heavy metal fans. My favorite songs on this album are Stains of Time and Red Sun. In my opinion, it has more than enough songs to keep anyone happy.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's one of the better mahjong games I've downloaded and the visuals are wonderful. You can actually make out the characters. I love it.
B006Y0QBQC|5.0|This book is even better than the movie. It's a &#34;self-help&#34; book that really just points out the obvious. If you read it from the perspective of getting a good laugh, you will not be offended. This is a great read and I recommend it for anyone that enjoys taking a closer look at the quriky parts of human behavior. It will give you a very interesting look inside of the mind of some males, at least those who think like the author! I laughed and laughed. Wonderful book and I am glad I decied to read it after watching the movie that it inspired.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app! it is very useful for day to day needs. I highly recommend getting calculator plus!
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|A look at the life of someone struggling with addiction and their recovery. An interesting view of the insanity that accompanies alcoholism.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This season leaned more to the soap opera than an Edwardian drama. The costumes and sets were still fabulous, but the plot got a little too maudline. Not sure what the future holds for the Abbeyites next year (and I'm sure I'll tune in to find out), but I hope there is more forward motion and less gnashing of teeth.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is actually my favorite story of the trilogy. I love the characters introduced for this story and the continuing love triangle between Katniss/Peeta/Gale.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excelente recurso para fortalecer la comunicacion en el matrimonio. Usar los profiles ofrecen un indicador de lenguaje primario de cada conyuge.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|the graphics are excellent and thegamenisnfun but when you run out of events it gets redundant. some updated content would be great. I do enjoy the game.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|IT COULD BE WHEN YOU WANT TO RATE SATISFACTION FOR JANET EVANOVICH'S BOOKS, ESPECIALLY HARD EIGHT, YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER A COUPLE OF MORE STARS.  AN EXCELLENT FUN READ
B000Q79HS8|3.0|Love amazon prime streaming movies and movie rentals! Helps keep me entertained on long flights. The movie is okay but the books are much better.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Let me just say \\"oh my goodness!\\" I loved it, cannot wait to start book three. In fact since I already have it downloaded I may start it right now.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|One had to read through so much that absolutely did not make any sense, then reverse in a odd way to find out where the ending  would take you.  The author must have had an agenda of sorts,..racism, greed, enviromental concerns, reincarnation?  A very long and boring novel to wade through and still not get the 'moral' of the story.  Hopefully the movie explains better and may have fantastic visuals,..I hope.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|I am new to Sudoko. So all of the hints and other helping features make a huge difference. Great game for beginners!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|fast paced,thrilling,exciting,best tv show ever!!!!! I hope it goes on to many more seasons.you can never imagine what will happen next,

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|its really fun and by the time I got it I emediatly played it.<br />I heard so much about it I desided to try it.turned out to be really cool.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Exactly as described. If you want a normal theatrical version of the movie this is it. The only extra is dirctor commentary.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Seasons 9 and 10 are my favorite seasons ever, for as a huge Superman fan these two seasons prepare Clark to make that jump. No more Lana, and now in this season Lois and Clark are center stage. Although there might be some bumps along the way: an evil Lionel Luthor (I know, shocking right? Who would have guessed), more alternate worlds, and even more episodes of Clark losing his power, etc. Overall this season hits the mark on so many levels. The season finale will make everyone jump for joy, and then pound their fist for more! Luckily Amazon has season 11 at .99 cents an issue!<br /><br />For all true Smallville fans who have watched the 200 plus episodes, this last season will not disappoint!!
B00BHU2A7I|2.0|Sometimes clever, often times pretentious. Hitchcock is lacking the cinematic substance one would expect given the subject of Alfred Hitchcock. .
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is a fun, different take on Angry Birds - no pigs, but angy monkeys to knock off structures and out of trees.  I would have liked to have a place to go to find out what all the extras do BEFORE I use them up and what all the shooting birds are capable of as well, but it's still a fun way to play Angry Birds.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|this is a fun game it really reminds me of bejeweled quest and its free! Got to love free games!
B000RO9VJK|4.0|Books like the startup owner's manual are focused on the products, but the E-Myth book focuses more on the big picture - the owner and the whole business.  I learned a lot.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This is my first ever app purchase.  It works as it said it does.  It works perfectly for me. I would recommend to everyone.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Very nice, well built watch. I bought this watch to wear to work because I got tired of replacing batteries and plastic watch faces that scratch too easily. This watch should provide years of service, and still looks good doing so.....
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|This story tended to drag on and on.  I didn't like how the main character was built up to be so tough, yet the author did not characterize him as &#34;wholly&#34; tough.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyable read with a great plot.  Not easy to guess where this was going and you want to find out.  I recommend this book.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Absolutely loved this odd little gem. So much fun to read and an interesting story to boot! Each character had such a nerdy brilliance that only avid readers can understand but even if you aren't you learn to love all of them for their eccentricities. Even though I thought the whole idea behind the codes and the books was kind of weird it worked well and the ending played out perfect! Would highly suggest this book to anyone!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is very fun to play I love the graphics and all the different obstacles would recommend to everyone
B0002IQNAG|5.0|&#34;I order these for a little old lady in a nursing home.&#34; At the age of 80,she loves all of them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the most intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story i have ever read! I have read a  lot of books. I including 2 others from this author. I loved the all but this one is hands down the best.  YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!! The way holder and sky are connected in so many ways they didn't even have a clue too. Its unbelievable!!
B008P1EWIM|1.0|I want to return it.. it's not worth the money all it is is a display of time and temperature
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I must state that the alien movies are my favorite movies and to be able to upgrade to blue ray is what makes me happy.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is one of the best comic book to screen adaptations Totally love it and I am not a big Green Arrow fan. And the guy who plays the Green Arrow is super hot!
0062014536|5.0|New York Times bestselling author Lauren Oliver, delivers the epic sequel in her stunning dystopian Delirium triology.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I'm just over halfway thru Chris's book but am enjoying it immensely  and was moved to purchase it when I heard of his tragic murder at the hands of someone he was trying to help; a returning veteran allegedly suffering from PTSD. From what I've heard of him so far, that was the way he lived his life and, while I'm sure he would have preferred giving his life on the battlefield against an enemy of the country he loved and served, he nonetheless died a hero in my eyes. God Bless you, Chris and may He give comfort to your family.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Super fun. Though I wish the keys were a little bigger. I find myself hitting the wrong ones. It makes me feel like I should learn to play the piano for reals :P
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Sorry.<br />But as comforting as the book is, the fact is that the doctor did not convince me that his excursion into the afterlife was contemporaneous with the cessation of brain function. He offers no clarity on that.<br /><br />He is indeed impressed with his own career. But, simply being a brain surgeon does not mean that your wild wide through fantasy is real.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Story was written with a number of twists that were revealed at the appropriate time. Did not see the end coming. Very entertaining read
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found this book to be a slow starter, and periodically it read slowly  later into the book.  However, most times it was riveting, tense, and held my interest overall.  Definitely worth reading!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Literally, the moment I finished HOPELESS, I was posting on Colleen's facebook wall. Of course, I couldn't see a damn thing because of the tears pouring our of my face.<br /><br />This book was brilliant. Colleen's words and characters were exquisitely crafted into a believable story of an  unbelievable love that knows no bounds. There was shock and awe and something new to be discovered in almost every page turn.<br /><br />If there was ever a story that will stay with me for a lifetime, it is HOPELESS.<br /><br />His tattoo, their first kiss, her bracelet, the car that pulled away...<br /><br />SHEER BRILLIANCE!<br />You won't be sorry. The intensity of Sky and Holder's story will reach in and grab your soul. They will be a part of how you describe true love from here on out.<br /><br />Cancel your plans, have an energy drink and don't put it down til you're done.<br /><br />Thank you Colleen. I can't tell you how badly I want Sky and Holder to be real! :) <3
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was one of those books that was definitely a page-turner. There were so many twists and turns that I was always surprised - and not always pleasantly surprised. The writing was solid, the characters well-developed and the plot was masterful. Not only was it a suspenseful novel, but it gives the reader lots to think about in terms of relationships and expectations. This was one of the best books I've read in a long time!
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|Up to this point I've really liked the Opteka products I've used like the one handed mount and so I couldn't wait to get my hands on my next product of theirs. I chose this stabilizer system instead of more expensive ones because... well, they're UBER expensive. I just need one to get the job done. However, I can't even get started with this one that I got in the mail.<br /><br />The one I got was missing the all important screw that attaches the camera to the faceplate. I couldn't test it out at all and give a more complete review. I returned it for a refund. What a pity.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|not a bad game but I expected better from G5.  I usually love their games but this one I could take or leave. didn't flow very well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a very well done series and I can't wait for the next season. I know sereral others that share my thoughts.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The concept intrigued me. I can't imagine the research that went into this book. Very well written and had me hooked from the beginning.... A must read! I tell everyone I can about it!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I love this album.  I have listened to it over a dozen times and still love it.  I bought it for Radioactive.  However, I quickly fell in love with every song - one by one.  Song 2 is my least favorite.  Nevertheless, I can listen to the whole album without skipping song two.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone looking for some alternative music.  It is fresh.  Not your typical radio stuff. This is the newest Imagine Dragons album. I plan to buy the next oldest Imagine Dragons album soon.
B00AW0KHMY|1.0|If you have the original DVD Breaking Dawn Part 1 don't waste your money.  I promise it is a waste. No additional love scenes, nothing worth seeing.  Hard to believe there is even an extra 8 minutes. Blink and you miss it.  If you don't have a DVD of Breaking Dawn Part 1 , then buy it if you are a Twilight fan, which I am.
0060734191|5.0|I have been wanting my own copies of these books ever since reading them in school. This set is first off a great value for all three and arrived in wonderful shape. Highly recommended for fans of Fantasy literature!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good fun, keeps you interested by offering the different levels to choose from. Challenge yourself by only accepting 3 stars.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What an excellent movie....this is what great film making is all about! Ben Affleck and cast do an excellent job in telling the story of the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1980. The dialouge is stellar, the acting is superb, and the direction, also by Ben Affleck was unmatched. He has come a long way in his career, and I feel that he will continue to grow as an actor, and a director of cinema.<br />The costumes were spot on, and I loved the historic material that was in the film. Every actor, no matter how small of a part did an excellent job with the material.<br />The best movie of 2012....no doubt!!!<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B008B92U32|1.0|Sorry does not work on my tablet.  Will not use it on my phone.  I am an amateur photographer and thought this would be a quick fun gimmick for my boys to play with but it simply does not work.  Luckily I got it for free.
B007549W62|4.0|Now the other reviewers as normal have already outlined the story so I won't bother boring you with that.<br />What I can say is that from the get go this movie got my attention for the whole way through, and at two hour mark that's saying something.<br />One guy states it's not really a horror movie but I disagree lightly just because if this happened to you it would definitely be considered a horror movie of the rest of your life.<br />But basically he's right, this isn't a standard horror movie.<br />If you even close to like post-apocalypse movies then by all means treat yourself and at least check this movie out.<br />The end scene seriously reminded me of the opening to Fallout 3 and a part 2 could be interesting but maybe not wise as the story outside the basement was clearly left under-developed for a reason.<br />So go watch and then take a shower because even if you took one minutes before watching The Divide you'll probably have the urge to have another after the credits role...kinda like after having watched Hobo with a Shotgun.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Not a big fan of Sudoku but this one seems to be really well done.  Glad to see high quality faotd.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Easy to read, easy to understand! I have a friend that has been trying to get me to read this for years. So glad I finally did! I am actually reading it again for the second time-back to back! Gives the tools and information in a simple, but extreamly informative way. The Secret has changed my perspective-changed my life. Cant wait to read the other two books by Ronda Byrne!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Nice to be able to play one of my favorite games even when no one is around to play it with me.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Interesting topic to base a novel on. - waking up each day with no memory.  Writing in a journal to help build memory and to remember her past really built the story.  At times I thought realistically she would have to do a lot of journal reading if she didn't remember anything.  The author drew the reader in with the mistrust of the husband.  Good climax, good story.  Reminded me of another book I read that I really liked, Still Alice, about a woman with early onset Alzheimer's.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I have not been able to make it work yet. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it because almost eveyone wrote that it doesn't work with the Kindle Fire. Live & learn !
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This one is a good one for a late night with the lights out and some popcorn. WE loved it.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|It's poor quality, very slow, non-responsive, the color selector does not respond very well. The actual coloring aspect must not be quality hepatic or made for any real device that's out on the market right now. I know the Kindle isn't an iPad, but I know the responsiveness of the touch is better than what this thing produces. My daughter winds up getting bored or frustrated due to the poor coloring, which is what this is supposed to be.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Ok haven't read a book in ten years. I wasn't sure this would be a good read. I was not let down. It was a slow go at first. The more I read, the more I wanted to read.
B00BESCJII|5.0|The acting was great and compared to the book they did a pretty good job. There were some important bits of the book missing, but over all was ok.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|This app does everything you need it to in a class room environment.  Outstanding.  Would recommend to any student who uses PDF.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've only recently started reading fiction, again, and I've found several writers and series with whom I was unfamiliar. Wool is a fantastic story - it built momentum as I got deeper and deeper (pun intended) into it. The heroes are believable, as is the technology and science. There are many lessons to learn from the story that apply to our own futures and politics, but the story is never preachy.<br /><br />I can't wait to start another from Howey.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I would suggest this read to anyone fanciful.  If you like Tolkien, you will not want to put it down. I loved the change of points of view, like many books in one. Started easy and ended with me completely enthralled in each character's journey.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|His is a hard role to watch, but he did a wonderful job, of course. Entire supporting cast is superb.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't normally like watching tv, but I watched this on my Kindle fire, and wow, it was awsome! Noah Wiley and Will Patten are superb. It is an  excellent show.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As there are already several lengthy and worthy reviews, I'll just say that this is like watching the longest, most entertaining and moving film ever made.  You never want it to end.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Good throughout season and is developing well as Oliver's backstory on the island and the connections of the other island inhabitants to others in Oliver's life, are fleshing out.<br />Hopefully a season 2 is in the works...
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Do not expect this movie to be a documentary. Although it does use a lot of references to what has happened in the hostage crisis, it is far from reality. A captivating, well directed movie with great acting... Must see...
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What more can I say about a wonderful classic! George Bailey doesn't realize how good he is until Clarence intervenes his life for the better. George figures that traveling around the world is what a &#34;Wonderful Life&#34; truly is, but realizes what he means to his town and his family after an apparent wake up call. This movie will make someone realize that life is truly special and worth living.
B002YOJBYG|5.0|Placido Domingo and Fiorenza Cossotto are brilliant. Raina Kabaivanska sings beautifully and is a good actress. The chorus is good and the orchestra under the great von Karajan plays brilliantly. This is a classic performance of a classic opera by Verdi.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a story that may women face. It shows and describes all the different positions that a woman is placed into when there partner is abusive. Ver well done.
1250027624|5.0|I  love the book and use it when I'm unsure of a character.  The pictures are supurb.  Thought I'd learn more about what is coming up but no such luck.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!! I was unable to put it down once I started reading it!  The story was so unexpected...it is an emotional journey that you will not regret taking!!! This is definitely one of my top ten reads...I do not believe there is really any story that I could even compare it to.  The realism factor of the characters is always something that I really look for in books and this author was able to do that for me!! This is a MUST READ!!! You will not be disappointed!!
B000NY12LO|4.0|Following yet another devastating school shooting in the real world, I guess I somehow hoped that this novel would be able to explain what really drives individuals to such action.  Perhaps that is too much pressure to put on a book, even one written by an author as talented as Picoult.  Because in the end, I was left still feeling more than a little dissatisfied.  Then again, I guess that really does reflect reality . . . where no amount of investigation and fact-finding can really explain these horrific acts.<br /><br />What starts as a normal day in small-town Sterling, New Hampshire ends in tragedy as Peter Houghton, lifelong bullying victim, takes two guns into the local high school.  Nineteen minutes later, nearly a dozen students are dead and more lay injured as the local police captain rushes into a school marked by chaos to subdue and arrest Peter.<br /><br />The book does a great job of detailing the impact on a variety of people from Peter's parents, the victims, the police officer, and even Peter's lawyer.  Between chapters describing the reaction to the tragedy are chapters that flashback to the upbringing of Peter, including the incidents of bullying that contributed to his violent actions.  His mother, particularly, was a sympathetic character.<br /><br />I was very impressed by the nuanced examination of the social hierarchies that define not only the schools in this book, but accurately reflects similar hierarchies across the nation.  This book could serve as a great reminder for adults about that pecking order and a great insight to teenagers about how trapped most students feel by their assigned roles.
B002W6Z0UK|3.0|This album is considered the piece de resistance in Lady Gaga's catalogue and after one listen, it's easy to see why.  While her other albums are filled with filler, nonsensical lyrics, and preachy self-esteem anthems, this is just a fun dance record, save for one song (more on that below), with hard hitting beats, and at only 8 songs, there's no room for filler.  The standouts are the ubiquitous hit, Bad Romance, hip-hop-infused Telephone, featuring Beyonce, and the album closer, Teeth.  The only song that I didn't care for is the Elton John-inspired ballad, Speechless.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good app lets you see how your battery is fairing and if its charging at a good rate every pad should have it installed
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It took me a while it get into the groove of the book but once I did I was hooked on I really felt this story it touch my heart..
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|This has to be the best Hatebreed album to date. Every song has it's own little hook and makes me want to pump my fist in the air. Will probably be the first Hatebreed album that doesn't grow old after a couple months. Highly recommended!
B00498XRPE|5.0|I watched Prometheus and afterward decided to check out Amazon's reviews of it. It seems that a lot of those who watched Prometheus were expecting way too much prequel to Alien. As a prequel to Alien... Ridley Scott did his job in that regard. Just look at the ship folks. You know the one with the space jockey in it, that had his ribs exploded from within. Look familiar? Sure we may have to watch a few more to get the whole story... but that just makes me glad it is not over with! Coming from 1979, it was great to watch it again. What is that? 34 years?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was amazing. I was able to stay interested the entire time. I'm glad someone finally wrote a book from the heart and told the truth instead of trying to cover it up. Thank you for all of your service and we'll be seeing you in Heaven.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|Can't attest to the durability of this toy nor how fun it is over time.<br />But it was a HIT at a birthday party my son went to (5 year olds)! Most loved toy.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|If you liked The Royal Tennenbaums, The Life Aquatic, The Darjeeling Ltd. then you would like this movie. x x
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I do tours in a military air museum, and I find that most Americans today see the air war in Europe during WWII as just some hum drum flying and bombing. This book describes life as it really was, along with the appalling loses to the United States Army Air Forces, and the fact that very few men would survive the bombing raids. On one raid alone, the 9th Air Force lost 80 B17's, which equates to 800 crewmen. Well worth reading. On the top of my list.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|At first I thought I liked the unique interface. I thought I'd adjust, but after a month, I found that I still had to think too hard to read the screens.<br /><br />Also, there are two forecast / data providers and their predictions and their current data vary wildly. Sometimes one is correct and sometimes the other. I want just one - one that I can trust, not two that are sometimes, maybe correct. You end up not believing either and constantly switching between the two.<br /><br />I'll just move along and continue my quest for the perfect weather app.
B00933JF74|5.0|Love this game.  Don't have to worry about buying extra anything to get the most out of the game.  Purchased full version for just over a buck and it was well worth it.  Only complaint is why do my towns people keep getting lost and there should be a direct way to solve that.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is my favorite Angry Birds, so far. I went as far as I could, then started over so that I could get three stars on every level. Then I had to get another phone, lost everything and I refuse to do it all again. I was so close to unlocking more levels! Aaagh. Why can't they make backup and restore work right?!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|LOVE my 2 horses. Fun game. Just wish the paddock, stalls and horse stayed clean longer. Gets a little old having to do that every 10 min.  Also, it's needs to add more competition. I've finished all of the horse shows and not much to do anymore.
B004XQYBA2|3.0|The good news is that there are a LOT of puzzles. The bad news is that learning the interface is itself a challenge. I suppose it's the nature of the beast and good for the developers for allowing so many options. Just be aware - simple, it's not.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Fun and entertaining if you like Sudoku. Large number of puzzles. Would purchase and recommend to everyone that like all types of Sudoku.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I am constantly trying to beat my best score. It's one of those puzzles that eat up your spare time and then some. I keep saying to myself, &#34;Faster! Faster!&#34;
B00160FBWK|4.0|The only downer is that this is the theatrical release and not the directors cut that was included in the 20th Anniversary 4 disk set
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Sounds just like they had never stopped playing....... Great live versions of the classic songs we all know & love.

B00AKL1XPU|2.0|ive downloaded this game on both my kindle fires and both systems crash...ive uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still the same thing...I'm about ready to pull my hair out....
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|When I was told i could get angry birds free I was excited.  But with all the ads popping up in the middle of each game I got disgusted with it
B009FZFONO|5.0|I Spent more on going too the movies and have come away with far less. Gritty and emotional. The gold standard for t.v.
B007SXB498|4.0|Having seen the movie, I was a bit sorry to see a lot of the plot missing. However I know .movies have situations added to give more interest.
B004TP0M0K|5.0|This latest installment was worth waiting for.<br />I don't know what to read next.<br />Gripping, keeps you interested until the end.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Even though I'm still reading it, I do enjoy the book.  I think my granddaughter who is 15 would like it to.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the fact that I can read right out of my android phone.  I own a Samsung 3, and it's very clear.  I haven't had any problems with my kindle app.<br /><br />Thanks!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|At first I got a bit frustrated with it.  But after playing for a while I really got into it. I have to wait . My turn because my husband discovered it!
0316069434|5.0|A rael page turner! Hated to see it end. If you're a Harry Bosch fan, this is a must read.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I wouldn't<br />watch or go to the Hollywood edition. It just seemed to be the wrong thing to do.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie and loved the blue ray picture was awesome, It came with some extras which was really great and i loved it all.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|My family and I really loved this movie.  We laughed so hard. Just a great movie.  :-) Really taught my children to believe in the magic.  :-)
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!! enjoyed every bit of it. brought me back a few generations. Jimi knew how to send chills up and down your spine and make you feel the music.
B00821OX98|4.0|Some of the writing could hold truer to the end of the world. Some of there actions in certain situations could get them all killed. Just wasn't true to reality 100%.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is another game that my kids love and can spend hours playing.  We use it as a reward for good behavior and grade.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I chose this rating because I thought it provided lots of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who has to look up a word that they need because they probably didn't know what the word meant or how to pronounce the word.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've had this app for a couple years on the Iphone.  Recently they have been doing some upgrades that I like. Especially the free NIV version.  Having multiple version at my fingertips helps me get a deeper understanding of the passage.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved, loved, LOVED The Hunger Games! I couldn't stop reading. I can't wait to read the remainder of the trilogy.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The story is unlike the typical novel.  I didn't personally relate to the main character as I have never experienced any of the things she went through but I was rooting for her.  Her ability to express herself through flowers was fascinating.
B002ZG9788|5.0|Great movie and looks great on blu-ray.  If you have a high def television then this is the only choice for format.
1423101502|5.0|Loved the entire series and this book was a great ending.  I did this as a read aloud and one of my kids and I both cried at the sad parts.  Riordan did a great job!  In fact we are going to start on another set of books from him.  My only recommendation is to start at book 1 and work your way through. ;)
B007XF0X6G|5.0|Love this sequel.  I particularly love the way this disc includes the DVD (which is great for my car DVD player), 3D Blu-ray (for my 3D tv) and Blu-Ray (living room television)  basically I'm covered no matter how or where I want to watch.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought that this book gave insight into the type of person who becomes a SEAL, their patriotism, and the training they go through. It also gave a personal view of how the frequent deployment affects the members' marriages and family life. I finished this book on the day of his funeral. After reading it I felt like I really knew him and had lost a personal friend. My condolences to his family.

B009JBZH54|4.0|If you are a fan of the movies and don't own the first two on Blu-Ray you can't beat the $29.99 I paid.  If you are not into extras or care about that the centimeter or two of space you are saving on the Blu-Ray/DVD shelf, I would just find a good deal on &#34;The Dark Knight Rises.&#34;
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The cast is great, the characters are original and fun to watch.  The plots and sub plots are fresh and interesting, with a surprise twist at the end. This is the one show that I always make time to watch.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I really like this app. I use it all the time and it is very easy to use. The buttons are a nice size.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|From start to finish this is a a stand alone movie . It does not need the support of the previous Bourne  ID!!! Good acting plus great action and then an ending truly worthy of more of the same. Great stuff! I hope to see &#34;Legacy II&#34; and so on and so on...
0062014536|4.0|Requiem was one of the books that topped my MUST READ list and I couldn't wait to rejoin forces with Lena, Julian, Alex and the rest of The Resistance. *checks neck for fake cured marks* Yep, I'm still infected with Amor Deliria Nervosa.<br /><br />Requiem is well-written, action-packed, intense and heartbreaking.<br /><br />What I liked: Lauren Oliver is a fantastic world builder and her ability to convey exactly what the characters are feeling made Requiem quite painful* (*painful in the best possible way) to read and left me just as frustrated and heartsick as Lena and Hana. I enjoyed Hana's POV and found it interesting especially since she's \\"cured\\" now. The romantic tension between Lena, Alex and Julian was palpable and I couldn't decide who I wanted to see her end up with, you know, assuming they all survive and that people's feelings stay the same.<br /><br />There were a few twists that I didn't see coming, some I felt were warranted and a few I wasn't so sure about but one in particular made me angry. So much so, I wanted to figure out a way to continue on without having to see/hear/read anything more about that person. Thankfully, there were more than enough opportunities for redemption and these characters are challenged to make decisions that require great sacrifice.<br /><br />What left me wanting more: The ending. I'm thankful it wasn't a cliff-hanger like it's two predecessors because I wasn't made to feel like I was having a heart attack but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting either. It felt unfinished and left a lot of unanswered questions which leads me to believe...<br /><br />1) This will be a series and not a trilogy.<br /><br />2) The rest of the story will play out in e-books like Hana, Raven and Annabel's (Lena's Mom) stories have. Maybe we'll hear from Alex (perhaps his time spent away from Lena?) and Julian, which would be made of all the awesome.<br /><br />3) This really is the end and I'll just have to deal with my feels. If this is true, then an Epilogue would've been helpful to tie up the loose ends. (Or appease readers like me.)<br /><br />Final verdict: Some readers may be unsatisfied but this really is a great addition to the Delirium Trilogy!true, then an Epilogue would've been helpful to tie up the loose ends. (Or appease readers like me.)<br /><br />Final verdict: Some readers may be unsatisfied but this really is a great addition to the Delirium Trilogy!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. I would recommend  FRIENS OR ANYONE TO BUY IT.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The pop-up ads with every deal are somewhat annoying, but the game itself is quite good.  Will get paid version to eliminate the ads.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book held me from the first page through to the end.  I practically read it in one sitting. Great story about a possessive, criminal mind who because he is a police detective, knows how to stalk, kill and control.  Would definately recommend this book. I know I don't reveal a lot about the story and characters with this review, but I wouldn't want to ruin any of the story for the next reader.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I enjoyed this film. Plenty of action scenes. Good humour and dialogue. Introducing characters that were part of the original Bond films. Excellent scene in Scottish countryside.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Always been a Train fan so I figured I would buy the CD, Mp3 version.<br />It is a great album.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Enjoy his music so I bought the album.<br />Enjoy the album and would recommend it<br />to any of his fans.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I like all the songs except for &#34;Money Make Her Smile&#34; because I am so sick of hearing songs about stripping, tipping, and making it rain, even if it is with Bruno Mars amazing voice. I love how diverse he is on this album. The songs do give you the feeling that you have heard them before (Locked out of Heaven, Treasure, Moonshine), so it is clear who his musical influences were on this album. But it is still very good and well produced.
B005GIS1WA|2.0|A couple funny moments other than that it was a disappointing family movie, a complete waste of time. If you've seen the trailers you've seen the best parts of the movie.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was my first book by this author so I am not familar with his writing. I had to read this one due to all the hype. It was ok. I would of like more at the end when the two main characters finally get together but the story just ends. A little predictable.
0446580848|1.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorites. This one is not his best. Just not enough drama or story movemnt....I was very dissapointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Got hooked on the series and now I can't  wait to watch Season 3!!! Very well acted. I am a lover of the time period and the costumes and furnishings of the Abby is terrific-
B000IB681Q|5.0|i do not agree with the saying &#34;love means never having to say you're sorry&#34;<br />and that is not something i would teach my children or grandchildren,<br />simply because that is not true.<br /><br />when you were wrong you should say you are sorry, and mean it.<br /><br />overall i did enjoy this dvd and the actors who portrayed the characters.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|this is the nicest best christmas dvd i watch time and time again and thoroughly enjoy the movie, many thanks for offering it.
B005529EI2|3.0|This movie is way too long.<br /><br />To start off the movie in itself is okay. The visuals are amazing as always.  The only problem is that it is ridiculously long and it drags out forever!<br /><br />I know that other reviewers are going to attack me but I must say that The Two Towers is quite boring, even for a person like me who has sat through hundreds of movies.  It just never ends!  Never!  And when it does, it ends so quick; typical for a Peter Jackson film.<br /><br />In my opinion, Peter Jackson should cap his movies to two and a half hours max!<br /><br />I don't mind long movies.  Several of them are excellent.  They just need to flow like Titanic or Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.  This just doesn't.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Two Towers is an okay sequel to an amazing film The Fellowship of the Ring.  At the end, you will enjoy your adventure to Middle Earth...kind of.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie is so much better than I expected!  It was The Hobbit: An Unexpected Delight!  In my opinion, it was better than The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />To start off, the high-frame rate technology does not take the place of a movie, it adds to it.  It made The Hobbit look so much better.  The 3D was one of the best I have seen in my entire life!<br /><br />Next, the story.  The story of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is brilliant.  It does not drag out at all.  At all.  Ignore the critics.<br /><br />The visuals are also brilliant!  Everything about this movie is brilliant!  Including it's running time!<br /><br />There is nothing that I don't like about this movie.  Nothing.  I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />Please ignore what people are saying: to wait until Christmas to get the Extended Version.  Get the Theatrical Version now and the Extended Version when it comes out.  This movie is worth seeing in both formats.<br /><br />Last but not least, Gollum.  Gollum looks amazing in 3D!<br /><br />I absolutely love this movie, I like it even better than The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie.  Please buy it.  It will be worth every cent.
B003LSTK8G|3.0|Michael Lewis' story (mainly) follows the lives of bond traders who  were part of the phalanx of financial types who took part in the great housing collapse that began in 2006. The essence of the story is that many traders knew that the securitized mortgages that precipitated the problem were 'fraudulent' products, but as long as the risk could be passed on to an unsuspecting party who cared-as long as you kept your 'share' of the fees along the way. Lewis details the stories of a couple of the traders, some nefarious, others more sympathetic, participants-howevr, plagued by misgivings. This could have been done in half the pages used, okay- the reader gets the point very early on. However, what was missing throughout was a human look behind  the economic, regulatory failings and political gamesmanship that preceded the crisis. Without that the 'human drama' described in the book is just another  morality play, like thousands of others.
B00005JLKN|5.0|I love this movie! It is very interesting and something I could rematch over and over again. If you love silence of the lambs you will like this movie

It is relaxing yet challenging. i don't have to compete with anyone else except to challenge myself to a higher score.

B008LFY6NI|3.0|My granddaughter loves spin art but she and I both had trouble starting a new work of art. It isn't as user friendly as i had hoped. We both left the game frustrated. if they can improve on save and start a new spin it would be more enjoyable. Because the free version wasn't user friendly as we hoped, we didn't purchase the full version. Maybe the full version is easier to use but I wasn't going to risk that assuption.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The clicker in my G500 went out and I decided to try this after seeing a lot of good reviews. My only gripe is that the mouse wheel is a bit farther back than I'm used to and it felt weird at first with my large hands. I got used to it fairly quick and I don't even notice it now. I would personally swap the mouse wheel and the button in front of it, but that may make it too far for smaller hands. The software was easy to setup and I haven't had any issues with the mouse in the month that I have had it.<br /><br />Honestly, I prefer this mouse over my old Logitech G500. I really like how they setup the 3 buttons on the left side, and the record/playback macro option seems like it would prove extremely useful. My next mouse will definitely be another Anker.

B00AZF13KG|5.0|Beautiful Girls is one of a handful of movies that I don't get tired of re-watching. The whole cast, including a 15-year-old Natalie Portman (\\"Marty\\"), give outstanding performances. The soundtrack is great, and will have you singing along on at least one scene. The story is about a guy whose life needs to change, going back to his small town, and all of his high school friends who are still there. The relationships all feel real, the friendships, the romances, and even the affairs, are all credible. The opinions and suggestions that the friends give each other, are just like what we have heard from friends in our lives. We watch Willie (Timothy Hutton) struggle with which path to take, professionally and romantically, and his uncertainty is evident. We feel for Mira Sorvino (\\"Sharon\\") and want to throw Matt Dillon (\\"Tommy\\") under his snow plow, but we are drawn by the story and it's satisfying conclusion. Great movie.<br /><br />I've been waiting for this Blu-Ray release for a few years, now, and will have a viewing party once it finally arrives. Because this is a low-cost release ($5.99 pre-order), I doubt there will be any special features.<br /><br />Also check out the movie's [[ASIN:B000002HL4 soundtrack]], and for a similar kind of movie, with guys making bad relationship decisions, see [[ASIN:B00004W5U6 The Brothers McMullen]].

0689505698|5.0|I read this to my little guy ever since he was two. He learned about the big bad pig before he knew about a &#34;big bad wolf!&#34; Yes, the story gets violent, as the pig has to find ways to destroy the ever more sturdy houses, but the worst, most violent thing in the book (minor spoiler) is an explosion that barely singes the wolves' tails. Trust me, your kid will soon see a lot worse than this on any cartoon! Get this book. The illustrations and the writing are gorgeous, and your child will learn that a predator can come from any species (heh).

B003UBTX6S|3.0|This one dragged a bit for me and I was very annoyed with how much of it seemed so unbelievable--specifically how the characters behaved.  Amma has become a complete joke to me because her abilities and actions are so unbelievable and don't fit with her basic talents.  It's not just her but she's probably the best example. The authors did not do as good a job with this one, IMO.  Yes, it did have a few moments--mostly at the end--but not as many as the first one.  And they made the teens so slow to see what was obvious to the reader on several fronts--it bothered me greatly.
0547848412|3.0|For anyone who is wondering how the book compares to the movie or if, like me, you saw the movie and now want to read the book that it is based off, here are my observations.  I saw the movie first and I very much prefer that version of this story to the book version though both have their merits.  Seemingly small details of the book are changed in the movie that I think ultimately make a huge difference in the tone of the story.  Pi's father is more sympathetic in the movie (the book makes him seem overly stern and mercurial), scenes with the ship's crew are added, and a young \\"lost love\\" is also added to more fully flesh out Pi's early life and the beginnings of his philosophy about the many different ways we can interpret the same events.<br /><br />By the end of the movie you get the impression that though true contemplation of the root of all religions (the need to rationalize and move beyond terrible events) Pi has come to accept and overcome the awful things that happened to him and what he had to do to survive.  That he has learned how to forgive and accept that dark part of himself that was revealed during his ordeal.  In the book it seems more like he is haunted by the things that happened to him and that he has developed a neurotic tendency to pick and choose little parts of a bunch of different religions to cope (poorly) with what has happened.  In short, the movie is much more upbeat than the novel.<br /><br />The novel also gets extremely bogged down in the middle while the author gives all sorts of excruciating detail about all the different things Pi tries to eat and other minutia of his survival.  The movie is much more streamlined and much less...well...gross.  I truly don't think all these details were necessary to get across the final point of the book- that religion is a tool that can be used to soften horrific events to the point where they can be overcome.<br /><br />Unlike some readers I personally do not see that either the movie or the bookparticularly advocate for religion.  In fact I think they both convey the message that \\"yeah religion may be a bunch of hooey, and all our fretting about the differences between religions is pointless, but isn't it nice that we can use it as a tool to give ourselves psychological comfort?\\"  So it more demonstrates the cultural function of religion rather than advocating for any particular belief.  So even if you are not a particularly religious person you should still give either the movie or the book a go.  But I recommend the movie.

B001UTW7QU|2.0|This is a goofy series of programs about &#34;super natural&#34; events and conspiracy theories. While the production values are excellent the dingbat content is uninteresting - to me. My wife, however, loves the show and will probably continue to watch it.
B00979CS50|5.0|I'm a little biased. Since I first heard him back in the mid sixties when I was barely able to have my pick on the radio station living in a family of eight and I prayed they would play some Neil on the FM stations. I am lucky I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio where there was a lot of backing to that type of music compared to some other cities allowed at the time. If you were lucky you got to go to The Cleveland Agora during lunch time where break out bands like Boston were showcased in the early afterrnoon and well, that pretty much made any other  meaningful plans you had for the day were null and void after that.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I liked this book precisely because it was a sober, balanced, but incredibly in-depth study of the methods and ingredients that have taken over American culture.<br /><br />I was expecting more conclusions and recommendations at the end, the &#34;so-what&#34; and personal opinions of an author who dedicated so much time and study of the subject. But if I had to guess, I would say that he was somewhat stumped on how to fix the problem: we like good-tasting, cheap food, it's naturally addictive, the companies exist to make money, not health, Wall Street outstrips the food gluttony with their own depraved push for maximum returns, companies are not intentionally putting toxic materials in their foods, and they're not in control of how much people eat.<br /><br />However, a few ideas can be gleaned from the book, such as the Finnish example and results (although I would guess American culture is very different in its resolve to control what people eat); setting broad limits for all companies to follow so that no one company can continue to increase amounts of fat, sugar and salt; and the best idea was to shift farm subsidies from the sacred dairy and beef industries to the fresh produce, along with applying some of the same cool marketing and research efforts to whole foods.<br /><br />Saddest to me was the reporting on the methods being employed in India for Oreos etc...right back to their old tricks of preying on children with targeted marketing.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly - it is fair and respectful while still managing to be compelling in the message: we're being hurt by the processed food industry.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Have seen all of the James Bond movies and this is one of the best ones recently. Danial Craig brings a hard edge to Bond that I like. This movie flowed well, at least to me and the villian was first rate. Well worth owning if your a Bond fan.

1400096936|2.0|As a rabid Winslow fan, I must say that this thing is a drawn out, overly simplified piece of garbage that almost seems as if he got tired of writing so he ended it in two pages.<br /><br />Whilst Winslow, along with other authors like Elmore Leonard, often have shady and improbable characters in his books with a bit of an anti hero twist, the characters in this go beyond silly  into the realm of laughably improbable. Story lines dead end. Events seem completely irrelevant to the overall story.<br /><br />It's just bad. Certainly no Bobby Z.

B007PVHMCG|3.0|I bought this for my two boys as a Christmas gift. They wanted it so bad. So I did what every parent does, try to find that &#34;special&#34; toy. I felt so bad when I saw how small each box was. Not what I or the children expected from the Lego brand. Not bad, but way too expensive for a that knid of toy. Anyway, received the product on time. Satisfied with the delivery.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I put this on my 10 year old daughter's kindle because her class was reading it at school, so she could follow along and recap at home. I made the fatal mistake of ready the first few pages and didn't put it down until I finished! It's my third time reading it and it's magical every single time. This book is great for preteen to adult. Some people say it's too dramatic and graphic for younger children, but they're reading it in my daughter's fourth grade class and it's less gruesome than the graphic images they're left with from the movie. Catching Fire here we come!
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|When I first heard about this movie going into production I was very excited. Garbo's has always been my favorite, the other various versions there have been were nice but didn't have as much heart, in my opinion. But I was glad to know Joe Wright would be directing this adaptation. I loved his Pride and Prejudice, it was subtle, perfectly cast and swept me away.<br />Of course when I read who had been casted for his Karenina, I got a little nervous. There were rumors that James McAvoy and Sairoise Ronan were going to be key charaters but it didn't come to pass. Luckily Knightly is very strong and competant in the main role. She knows how to blend into her characters and isn't afraid of showing true emotion. Jude Law was a nice surprise as well. He takes the part of the cold and honorbale Karenin and plays him with respect and flare. Aaron Johnson was the actor I was worried about, but he manages to play the brash and lustful Vronsky quite well if maybe a little underwhelming. He never quite matches up with Knightly when it comes to moments of passion but there is still much chemistry between them and it works.<br />The supporting cast is what makes the film delightful. As with most adaptions and even the book itself, you develope a stronger emotional connection with Kitty and Levin than with any other characters. To me the actor who shows he is having the most fun is Matthew MacFayden. In Pride and Prejudice, he was the handsome and proud Mr. Darcy, here he goes in the opposite direction to play a jolly, filandering Stiva and does it wonderfully.<br />If the film lacks in anything, it's in the plot lines that make the novel the classic that it is. Joe Wright himself said the movie would focus on the two romances of Karenina with Vronsky and Levin with Kitty and that's what he did. So if you are a huge fan of the book and expect perhaps more focus on the political undertones of the novel, I would suggest you simply take this movie for what it is. 2012's Anna Karenina is another sweeping, beautifully crafted, artistic film by director Joe Wright. It's romantic and lush, even if the story doesn't resonate with you, the visuals certainly will.

B000050GQM|3.0|Very interesting movie, would recommend for an evening of entertainment; however, not nearly as good as the book.  Lacks the depth of character development.

B000FBFN1U|1.0|Since when did not having a plot become epic storytelling?  *mild spoiler alert*  Folks, he kills everyone.  Every major protagonist and antagonist dies.  By book 6 he still hasn't made his point.  There is no closure.  It's just rambling story lines about characters I don't care about because I know they'll die in some unceremonious manner.  At this point, I'm asking \\"What is the point?\\"  To see one of the kings rule?  To see the Lannister's rule?  To see Starks get their revenge?  No.  There's one Stark left by book 6.  To see the dragons attack?  I don't care any more.  There's nothing to hate, there's nothing to cheer, there's nothing mildly interesting.<br /><br />So finally lets get to writing.  Every editor who has had the pleasure of rejecting an author will tell you don't tell you story through flashbacks.  This is Martin's primary technique and it makes the chapters drag on and on.  You probably don't even realize it's happening.  Sam's chapters for example.  Sam is face down in the snow wanting to die, that entire chapter is Sam's memory of how he got there, a flashback.  Oh that gets old.<br /><br />First book was awesome but now it's just old with no point in sight.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read this this book in the attempts to compare 50  shades of grey. I truly enjoyed the 50 … I can't understand why. But maybe because I felt no romance in the book, just lust. I was waiting for more intimacy, not sex; like he trusted her enough to open up a little more then he did.especially after her revaluation to him.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this application, totally all te information you need and the widget is really customizable even works wish my wp8.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best science fiction novel I've read in years. Either the author is himself an astronaut or else an excellent researcher. This story is ingeniously crafted and populated with very believable characters. The Martian presents what could have been a cumbersome if not boring premise which, in the hands of a lesser writer would never have been the page turner this was. Wow! Great job. Hats off to Mr. Weir!

B0075H7RRA|4.0|I am a committed \\"Nikita\\" fan so I am more than a little biased. Some episodes are a little weak but I think the writing suffers from uncertainty. The show has not  fared as well as I think it should have? Friday night TV tends to be the grave yard shift. Team it with one of the more successful series in mid-week and I believe it will take off. It has hard hitting action where the good guys are often as violent as the bad guys. A shadow government comes to light in this series. The super spies are always better than the bad guys and while the series moves each episode to a conclusion of sorts continuity connects every series installment.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Very impressed by the flow of writing, I didn't think I would. Loved the main characters in this book, even though it was predictable, it still was a beautiful read.

B00000J6AG|5.0|With hindsight it's now possible to see `Play' (and its follow-up `18') as the zenith of Moby's creative output. Nothing he composed/recorded prior to 1999, or subsequent to 2002, has been so memorable, so enduring and timeless.<br /><br />The talented, mildly eccentric and disarmingly honest New Yorker hit the bull's eye with this collection, songs almost everyone recognises due to the clever marketing strategy of offering the tracks to TV advertisers to guarantee wide exposure. But even without the album's famously innovative marketing the songs stand up on their own as beautiful repeat-play numbers; techno with a soft-edge, techno with genuine emotion, music which moves you. Songs like `Porcelain', `Why does my Heart feel so bad' and `Natural Blues' are for most fans the star tracks, but almost every track is good and many are gems.<br /><br />Probably everyone reading this has `Play' in some format already. If you don't, you can now buy it in confidence that it's proved itself a true classic, and you'll still likely be playing these songs (probably in some yet-to-be-developed format) in 20 years' time.
B004WR125O|4.0|I've heard that this adapter does now work good but I've had very few problems with it... The only problem is sometimes it goes in the initializing mode for a little while...But for the price I like it...
B000063S6Z|5.0|Moby's 2002 follow-up to 1999's internationally successful `Play' is an essentially similar but more even album, with an eclectic mix of styles. `We are all made of Stars' kicks off 18 great, memorable songs (the album's title comes from the number of songs chosen for inclusion). Highlights would be `Harbor', `In this World' and by way of contrast the witty rap number `Jam for the Ladies'.<br /><br />Sadness and poignancy lie at the heart of some of these songs, giving '18' a haunting character. The recordings were laid down just before and shortly after 9/11/2001 which as fans will know was the native New Yorker's 36th birthday, made memorable-not-in-a-good-way.<br /><br />In addition to his own just-OK but distinctive voice, the vocal talents of Sinead O'Connor and Jennifer Price bring real feeling to some numbers. Moby is an excellent producer with a fine ear, always knows when enough is just enough and never over-does it.<br /><br />1998-2002 was Moby's most creative period, the time when he delivered memorable songs by the dozen with consistency. Though he's never put out a `bad' album, `Play' and `18' are the cream of the crop. Some of his later material (like `Hotel') is good, but he's never quite repeated the seminal result achieved with `18'.

0062082353|4.0|Chris Kyle is a U.S. Navy Seal who served 4 tours in Iraq and as a sniper he has had more kills, 150, than any other. Here Chris tells his story; he tells us about his intense training to become a Seal, what guns he uses and what clothes he wears in combat. Chris brings us along with him on his 4 tours in Iraq through the battles for Fallujah, Ramadi, and Sadr City. There is plenty of killing, but there are no blood and guts here as Chris uses a sterile approach in describing his Team's engagements.<br /><br />Chris's wife, Taya, tells her story as to what it is like being married to a Seal who puts his country before his family. She certainly struggles, but she sticks it out because Chris is an honest, loving, and loyal person. Chris describes his life with his wife and family as well as his life with his Seal Family. There is the tough training and many fights along the way before he even gets into Iraq. I should mention here that where Chris tried to sterilize the killing in his story, he did not do that with the language; it's as it was spoken amongst Seals.<br /><br />Chris is not the greatest writer and I'm sure as in battle he depended on the support of others to write his story. He'll tell you that he hates paper work; he'd rather be fighting to protect America. That is if he could tell you; he cannot, as Chris was recently killed. That is not part of this book, but it is worth mentioning that the man who killed Chris was one of many that Chris saved during and after the war in Iraq. U.S. Navy Seal, Chris Kyle was one of the greatest warriors that our country has ever had. We need warriors like Chris to protect the good in the world. Thank you Chris and all who serve our country and their families.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Nothing else to say.. I do not play but my grandson does...he loves it. He played for 2 hour the day I downloaded this game.
0061914177|5.0|Looking for something to read which will inject some positive energy into your attitude and efforts? Gary V has amazing energy and you can actually hear his voice in your head getting excited while you read this book. These are his words and they are energizing! Another success!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is another game that has given me hours of fun to play.  Believe me when sitting waiting for  appointments this is a good time filler.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|The  Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener worked well for about 3 uses but then it broke.  Actually I bought 2 and both broke too fast.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story and its characters from beginning to end. The chemistry and the connection between Holder and Sky is almost tangible.  Every detail of the story was related and explained, right down to the name Sky.  It had very sad, heartbreaking moments that seemed to be redeemed in one way or another.  In the end, happiness and love seemed to win out. Great story of love and connection and never giving up.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Absolutely magnificent! I liked every page, every character, every story.<br />A bitter story of a bitter town, but aren't all towns and all communities just like this one?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like how the story evolves and the depiction of the history of the time period driving the story. The quality of the production is outstanding and the character development really draws one into the story. No spoilers from me. I liked that no one is spared from the realities of life. Stuff happens to accommodate the actors real lives and to push the story forward. Life is messy outside and on the television screen. Oh, and Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess is absolutely fabulous.
B000FCK65W|5.0|...tells the story of what it was like for immigrants who came to America at the turn of the century.  Very poignant glimpses of  poverty and prejudice, and the strength of survival of a young girl and her family.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Good little book but sort of slow at times. Overall good love story though. Good book for a teenager to read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it is an awesome game cuz it is like u r caring 4 a real horse. I love horses!!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Thought the ending was unanticipated....not sure I liked it.  Still thinking about it so I gave it a four...a little disturbing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game it is awesome and I love the version of ROMO it is awesome and my favorite part about this version is that the police officer is dressed up in a bunny suit and I love collecting the Easter eggs but sometimes I can't get the ones on top of the trains when I am on the ground when I play I feel like I am playing an Easter egg hunt and I also hope they come up with another version of on  of Subway Surfers
0446580848|1.0|The witticisms were amusing at first and then became annoying as the plot<br /> barely progressed. The details about Yemen were interesting but disappointingly  US - centric.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Was fun and everyone's right. The last few g Ames I've bought I wasn't happy. But this one was great. I just think it didn't last long enough. I had a boring morning so t h this snow and just finished it.
B001E25MBK|5.0|Have not viewed the DVD set, but will assume it is as good or better than my laserdisc version except perhaps for the quality of the sound.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|Classic 1970s movie packed with great acting and terrifying plot(in a world before cell phones!) Loved it! Arrived on time,perfect condition and enjoyed immensely :-)
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Have not had the time to view the DVD; purchased to replace the VHS version, rather than copying the VHS tape onto DVD.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Dumped this piece of crap  when, within 5 seconds, a popup ad asked me whether I wanted a boyfriend. Complete with graphics. UGH.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for quick play or to cure boredom. The location changes every month which keeps it interesting.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a great book. Seemed like it could almost be true, and the science and engineering was realistic, and made sense to me. I really enjoyed it. For some I suppose it could get a bit long in the science, but it is explained in way that made me think I understood it. Worth reading.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Dragon vale is a great and fun app, lacking little. I can't wait to see what else is going to be installed into it next
B00913P6G0|5.0|Kendrick Lamar goes insane on this album! He takes you on a ride through his life. Has to go down as one of the best rap albums of all time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME ON MY KINDLE FIRE &  IT'S REALLY ADDICTING, HOWEVER, I'M NOT SURE OF WHAT TO DO TO INSTALL THE UPDATE FOR ROME. I DON'T RECALL HAVING THIS UNKNOWN ISSUE WITH PRIOR UPDATES. I CLICK TO DOWNLOAD WHEN IT POPS UP, BUT IT KEEPS TAKING ME TO AN AMAZON PAGE W/OUT AN ACTUAL DOWNLOAD CHOICE. PLEASE HELP ME AMAZON/KINDLE FIRE FAMILY!!!
B008RV5K4U|4.0|I quite liked this adaptation of Frank Miller's novel.  It is both faithful to the original and works as it's own thing.  The positive aspects of this movie have been well covered here, so I won't repeat them. I want to address the one glaring flaw:  we don't get the inner monologues that made the graphic novel so engaging.  The internal thoughts of Bruce/Batman not only showed the struggles of the aging batman, but they help to push forward important themes about vigilantism, justice and crime.  The voice acting is, overall, superb.  I can't understand why the creators didn't include the inner narration that was so important to the original.
B0011Z8Q90|4.0|Tried to live off an import from an old album into mp3 format - I did not get the sound quite right.  Now I have great sound and I can happily listen to this wonderful album.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I could not put the book down... In spite of the sweet sadness In the background I loved the characters and Lou's love and ability to go on no matter what, written in a very witty language....
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|When I first heard Boz Scaggs was doing a covers album, I was scared.  I thought he was joining the ranks of Rod Stewart, Michael McDonald, etc...basically phoning it in.<br /><br />Happy to say this isn't the case<br /><br />First of all, Boz covers a lot of fairly obscure classics by Al Green, The Moments, Willy DeVille, Steely Dan, even Tony Jo White, so you're not treated to the playlist from your local oldies station<br /><br />Second of all, the arrangements are spare, allowing Boz's voice to shine<br /><br />I enjoyed this...I didn't expect to.  From the sound of it,  I think he liked making it.  A definite recommendation
0062238310|5.0|Love my copy of the first season scripts! I prefer reading to watcing tv so having this wonderful book will provide me with hours of joyful reading.
0385344333|1.0|I love the Reacher books.  I was excited after I read the first book and realized I had so many more books to enjoy in the future.  But 'A Wanted Man' is not up to the bar.  The plot is implausible and ridiculous.  But you'll only know this if you finish the book, hoping that Child is going to pull it together someway.  If you want a great Reacher read, try 'Bad Luck and Trouble'.  You get a lot back-story in that book.
1250027624|5.0|I just love this book which arrived today. I haven't been able to put it down. It is THAT good! Just a wonderful read which gives all the little details about this fabulous series.
B003YT5TGE|5.0|The humor in this movie is a dry, chill style humor. No in-your-face kind of stuff. That being said, it's awesome. It's very relatable to real life, which I think just makes it so much more enjoyable.
B007M45PMU|4.0|The first time I heard The Lumineers was on Saturday Night Live. From the moment I heard them playing \\"Ho Hey\\" I was hooked. I have zero regrets purchasing this album, especially for $3.99. I highly recommend this album!
098357670X|5.0|I never look at people the same now. As a professional illustrator and designer, I always look for ways to improve my craft. This has been an excellent resource to help see people's characters. I see things that I haven't seen before. Thanks so much Tom!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game passes the time with addictive fun!  Starts out super simple but each level adds a challenge or more.  Not too hard but patience helps you reach your goals.  This is one of my favorite games.
0812979656|2.0|I heard a lot about this novel but I didn't find interesting and motivating to read. I wish writer would have made little interesting to read.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I am a big fan of Maroon 5 so of course will be a bit biased. The cd is fun full of different beats and moods but with an overall upbeat feel.
B004V71CYQ|4.0|Was a lot clearer then I thought it would be I rented it for my GF to get updated when watched the  sequel the Tron legacy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put it down. I didn't even want to stop and eat or sleep, I needed to know what happened next.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent time killer. very well done for a mobile game.I enjoyed the story. I wish it was a bitlonger though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the thinking that goes on with this game. Loads of fun! Introduced it to some of my other friend and they love it too!
0425263916|5.0|This book was amazing!!! I read Fifty Shades and needed some other great book and by far I found Bared to You and Reflected Into You to be soooooo much better!!!!! It is awesome!!! It is so well written, not so juvenile and for a more mature audience I feel!<br /><br />You will not be disappointed I couldn't put the books down! I cannot wait until the 3rd book, Entwined With You comes out!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is like a drug. Once you start you can't stop reading. It's thrilling, keeps you on the edge of your seat for sure!!
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|17 and 16? for real, Yeah Johnathon is alot better than Charlotte, but She is improving each song. They Compliment each other so much, and without Charlotte where would Johnathon Be..
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I typically enjoy Joaquin Phoenix, and I was really looking forward to this movie, but it was simply terrible- Just pointless, awful, and not worth your time or money.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|It was Okay, even the kids got board with it. o think it was a little over the top but it was watchable.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It was interesting. I do not really like reading but whatever. I would not recommend this book to a friend
1847879071|2.0|This has to be the craziest \\"textbook\\" I've ever read. The examples the author uses to illustrate his points are so out there that they actually distracted me. I understand his desire to stick out from the crowd and educate through humor, but at the same time, as others have noted, the humor was really shocking, and not at all helpful. I wouldn't recommend it. Even the prof for my class said the book is strange.
006224454X|1.0|\\"Been there, seen it\\" premise (Memento, 50 First Dates), repetitive plot (wake up, question, write, sleep, repeat) and a twist you can see from the middle of the book. Save your money; not even worth a trip to the library.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I absolutely adore this series, so it is only natural to want to own it on DVD  I was able to purchase both Season 1 & 2 for a very reasonable price and will soon purchase Season 3.
B0081336FO|5.0|Though the seasons from the BBC are rather short, the episodes are longer and fairly well thought out.  It's a modern adaptation of some of the original stories, so the details have become slightly more &#34;sciency&#34; in the same vein as CSI and similar shows.  (And this show gives a nod to them, in fact.)
B00723NWJE|4.0|This cd is ok .... I like her first one a lot better but there are a few songs on this one that I listen to. I wish she would go back to her original sound and musicians.
B0091THDOM|4.0|I prefer this often-hard-to-find smartphone case style, and felt I received good value--a good product---for the price of a cheap plastic shell
B007BVOEPI|5.0|My jerk brother told me that this was the prequel to lord of the rings. I am pretty sure that this is shakespear or something because they talk old timey, and there is a lot of talking. I didn't see any hobbits or orcs.  It was ok, but not lord of the rings.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent series with a superb cast of characters. Storylines move fast. Period costumes are exquisite. Cannot wait for Season 4!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|At first I thought this movie was about different style of suits but it was some sort of alien movie. There was the fresh prince in it and that guy that looks like Billy Bob Thorton but older. Interesting fact, Billy Bob  who was married to Angelina Jolene she was not in this movie. If she was it might have had nudity.
0316069434|5.0|Purchase this book for my husband so I don't know much about it except to say it arrived promptly and as described.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I did not think I would enjoy these books but I did.  Sometimes what happened was overwhelming. Some parts were gorey. But I had to know what happened to mocking jay.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is actually amazing. Macklemore has impressed me yet again and this is such a great deal. It's a digital version of the album and the music video for thrift shop. So happy.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think that it is a awesome game &amp; it is most of the time fun but when I play it &amp; I get the monkey behind me I can't see in front of me but other than that Love it I LOVE! It I just can't stop playing it.
0446563048|4.0|I found Mr. Hsieh “Delivering happiness” an interesting book. Many people write about success and many more write about the “right” way to succeed, some even write about the “sure” way to success. Not many write about failures, about struggles and about key differentiations which led to their success.<br /><br />Tony Hsieh and the Zappos.com story is a unique story. It is unique by the values set for the company, it is unique about its approach of deciphering success and it is unique in its openness.  The book provided me with many insights about customer service and how to set a culture, vision and practical values for a company. It is also a very motivational book, and don’t we all need it from time to time?<br /><br />Zappos.com’s story is a story about hope. It is a story of leaders who had a new idea for an “old” industry and decided to create a business based on their idea. Well, the initial idea did not work out. The founders almost ran out of money but they never lost hope. They worked to change their business model after realizing the old one did not work. Zappos.com founders and leaders continued with the new strategy hoping it would work out. They decided to make customer service as their company brand, hoping a word of mouth would bring much needed money (and success). I assume many at that time thought “ah, only hopeful thinking” and yet Tony wrote in his book “Hope is not a good plan”. What a simple and clever insight.<br /><br />If your business service clients, if you want to know why hope is not a good plan, I encourage you to read the book and find your own insights. I am sure you will find many.<br /><br />Amir Avitzur<br />Author of &#34;Why do we sell low and buy high? The guide you must read BEFORE you invest&#34;
B005LAII3U|1.0|ORDERED THIS 2 DISC SET BLU RAY AND ALSO 3 DISC SET BLU RAY AND BOTH SETS ARE DEFECTIVE. IT LOCKS THE DVD PLAYER IN BOTH PLACES. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS FROM 3RD PARTY SELLERS BECAUSE THEY SEND THE SAME THING. I DON'T KNOW IF AMAZON'S COPY WORKS OR NOT BUT HAVE HAD TO GET REFUNDS ON BOTH SETS.
1609611543|5.0|Just try it before you knock it! I certainly didn't expect the results I've had by eliminating wheat from my diet. But, it is amazing how good I feel because of this new lifestyle of being wheat-free! So many annoying health issues have simply gone away...all due to the elimination of one itty-bitty grain called \\"wheat\\". And, I'm losing more and more of my \\"wheat-belly\\" every day! Just wish I would've found this information a few decades ago!!!
B006UKFFE0|4.0|I found Running Lean to be a very useful book -- it's not so much that it offers a ton of new ideas, but that it collects the ideas into a coherent and to-the-point narrative. While reading it, I continually found myself thinking \\"Of course, that makes sense\\" because, really, most of the ideas are not-so-common sense; that is, it's common to forget about them in the excitement of creating something. Having Ash take you through the stages of planning and force you to think things through is worth the price of admission alone, and if you're new to the startup scene then this book is likely on the \\"must-read\\" list. Even if you've been through a number of startups, as I have, there's no doubt that this book belongs in your collection as a reminder of how to take the sane approach to creating a product.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Game is not what i thought it was.  You must play a lot of three of a kind matches before you can use tthe bricks you`ve accumulated.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This books was very inspiring. It really made me appreciate the complexities our soldiers face. At times it seemed a little ranty even though I share Lutrells convictions about the warped state of the US media. It's easy to overlook this since it plays such a significant role in the events that transpired. Loved it overall.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The DVD was shipped quickly and it was a brand new one like I ordered.  Very good movie so I wanted this DVD for a keeper.
B002PJ8AE2|5.0|That's all I can say about this product. It gives me joy to see the smile on my granddaughter face. I would buy again.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Don't listen to anyone but me. This girl is totally bonkers, and it's in the best way possible. Buy all her products, etc., and do so now. Thank you.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I'd much rather give the book a 4 1/2 star rating, but unfortunately Amazon doesn't provide that option.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver created a unique dystopian society, a society that cured amor deliria nervosa, or love. In Delirium, Lena believed in the system, followed the rules, and was ready to be cured...until Alex came along and made the ultimate sacrifice for her, in the name of amor deliria nervosa. The plot thickens in Pandemonium when Lena becomes a part of the resistance with the invalids, and finds a home for herself in the Wilds with fierce Raven and Tack. Tack and Raven, in an effort of the resistance allow Lena to get caught with Julian, the prized poster-child of the DFA--Deliria Free America. Somehow Julian and Lena save themselves from the scavengers, a group of DFA-backed invalids working to get rid of the resistance.<br /><br />In Requiem, Alex and Lena's mother have found their way out of the crypts of Portland; the resistance is battered and broken, Hana is guilt-ridden, Julian is learning what it's like to be in the Wilds, Alex is a shell of his former self, and Lena is caught between the two--not knowing who she loves. Lena, who has changed from the Lena of Delirium; Lena, who became a new truth in Pandemonium has only one purpose--freedom.<br /><br />Requiem was a well-written and moving tale of a fractured people. In a common element with dystopian novels, there is the notion of a controlling governing body that seeks to better society by some sort of manipulation. The element is unique, the characters evolve and become real, their pain and guilt and sorrow is authentic. This was one of my most-awaited books of the year and I loved every heart-turning moment of it (even the ending which got mixed reviews!). Was the book perfect? No. Was it still pretty fantastic? Yeah. Should you invest in the series? Most assuredly!
B00756GKBA|5.0|This album is a new reason for me to keep on living. Seriously, my life is that sad. But the album rocks, anyway.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|when everyone would say &quot;wow temple run is so amazing and entertaining,  it's an addiction &quot; The first one sucked it was was too hard and glitchy. Now the second one comes out and its way better.
B000I9YLTE|5.0|SPLAT A ZIT!! Classic Classic movie, even though this movie is 35 year's old (The Same age I am now LOL) I first saw this in full unedited about 5 years ago, and it keeps getting funnier, the Origonal Van Wilder. James Belushi is at the top of his game in this wonderful film.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A surprisingly unique and exciting story that makes you question everything about your ability to discern right from wrong. I was rooting for the sociopathic wife to take down her silly, immature husband.
B002RPLY2O|5.0|Out of all the Child Play or Chucky Movie's this one besides the first is the best. Jennifer Tilly is really awesome in this movie, probably one of her best, and Katherine Heigl is really young but is also great.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Been using this app for about 38 years and never had any problems. Its the official app for yahoo mail, works good. Links open as they should and its easy to use.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this game. Its better than the first one because its a waste of time which is a good thing and it keeps you with something to do and its just really fun. I enjoy it and ya.... I really like it. Think its better than the first one.
0763644765|4.0|This is a cute little board book for little ones.  It's not one of her favorites yet but I choose it out of the pile from time to time however she might still be a little young for this at 15 months.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great wish had more energy though to keep playing...hard to advance without it... wish everything good didn't cost real money.... fun time killer
B005OZE9SA|2.0|You have to record your tracks in mono because I am not able to record a stereo track that isn't either on the right or left side. Other than that it has about the same quality as the MXL Mic Mate Pro and that was only $80. 2 stars for me.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A little depressing but overall a worthy read. The significant meaning of flowers was new to me. Roses, yes, but never had any idea about other flowers.
1609611543|5.0|this book changed my life( for the better!)<br />well written with just enough humor to keep it from being to heavy
B005RUUUAI|5.0|It's not &#34;Lost&#34;, but it's the closest to a fix for me and my hubby.  We finally just broke down and bought cable so we can watch it every week and DVR it too.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|Classic Viking Death Metal at its best.  If you like Amon Amarth you will like this album, hits like a hammer :)
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Mark O'Brien is a paralyzed poet forced to spend much of his life in an iron lung due to polio. He's never had sex, due to his condition, and wants to do so before dying. He first tries proposing to Amanda, his caretaker, but she's put off and leaves. Then an advisor suggests contacting a 'sex surrogate' - Cheryl (Helen Hunt). Complications ensue when her husband becomes jealous and they develop feelings for each other. O'Brien then ends up in the hospital after a power outage and meets volunteer Susan. Together they find happiness. O'Brien then dies and Amanda, Cheryl, and Susan attend his funeral.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz has not lost his voice, he sounds great. You can hear it is Boz and it is Boz to the 10th degree. I just want to play it over and over. I still have him on vinyl and never tire of his songs. This is the BEST CD in my collection now. Boz is still soulful yet maintains his smooth groove in this album. You must get this one !
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to go onto Amazon to get books for my android, that I can't find on Google play.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I watched a few episodes when it originally aired but for some reason I didn't stay with it.  Maybe there was something else on at the sametime, but for whatever reason, I am glad I rediscovered this on Amazon Instant Video Prime.  I've wached the whole series in order and now I've purchased the BluRay.  Since I just finished watching I will likely go right to the extras but looking forward to watching the series again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|When I go to local fairs I am drawn to this game and spend lots of quarters but here I can play for free and still have fun.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I really enjoy this game on my iPhone, but I cannot keep it from crashing on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009O2XY12|5.0|It's very addictive but fun.<br />It's was free and I love free things so try it and you will love it too
B0025KVLSI|1.0|All the Beatles CDs I received were in Quicktime format. I returned all of them. This is not a CD you can rip to mp3 and play on any device.
B0015AARJI|4.0|the product came along with all accessories works well the estimated costs was as predicted everything was fast impeccable product quality is top and filled my expectations highly recommend this store as they are very serious about selling and delivering their goods
B000NY12LO|4.0|I started to read this novel about two years ago but the first page just didn;t catch me. Decided to give it another chance and I was totally enthralled throughout the book. Picoult has never failed me yet with her style of writing and the realization she brings to her story lines. I found it ironic that Josie was in a similar situation as Peter, the emotional and physical abuse although she was part of the in-crowd. Everyone reaches a breaking point, but with bullying, there is more often losses followed by sadness. This tragedy has become an all to familiar pattern.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app because it's accurate and I can check anywhere I want. It's great for when you are travelling and want to know what to pack.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was very happy with this.  It was so great having access to it though Prime!  I have no complaints!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I only use this app to see what my kids are doing and what websites they are on. Granted they can kick me off the app at anytime, I can still check to see what they are doing.
0399226907|5.0|my kids love this book.  I bought this one for my sister's baby shower.  this one is the 5 x 7ish size board book.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was a really good book and funny to. It made you think a little about what was goin to happen next. Best book of the series yet.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I lost my Kindle charger and found this inexpensive replacement on Amazon. Well worth the wait and so glad I saved money.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie in the theater and out.  A new grittier twist on the classic bond, Daniel Craig brings a new edge.  Not exactly like the Ian Fleming vision but still great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is an great game to play when you want to see a horse and you do not have one of your own this most certainly helps when you don't have the real thing.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This is a great movie with a wonderful story and message.  We watched it with our 8 and 6 year old kids and the entire family loved it.  Our 8 year old watched it over and over for two days straight.<br />What an incredible human Jay was! Definitely left his mark for the short time he was on this earth.  And the realtionship between Jay and Frosty was heartwarming.<br />Just a great story about character, determination, friendship and love.  Definitely a keeper!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I usually get together at a friend's house to watch every week's episode of Walking Dead, but we've been doing different things lately, so I purchased an episode from Amazon. Episode 10 had a little bit of just about everything that fans enjoy about the show, drama, action, battles of wills, bad decisions, good decisions and everything in between. If you haven't seen the show, Episode 10 will let you know if you're a fan or not... and chances are that you're a fan.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The only thing I don't like about this app is that it, inexplicably, became linked to another app and now uses the other app to search for songs when I use the song setting--it's not really a big thing, but I hardly use the other app and I hats that this one drags it up to the front of the line with it.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|my son loves these movies! Im so excited to find all 3 for such a wonderful price.  The casing is convient too all movies in one case.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Brave is a story about a mother and daughter coming to terms with one another in a teen angst coming of age movie.  The film takes common teen cliches and parent of teen cliches and explores them in a magical way.  There's nothing new here.  The cliches have been around a while.  I would have rather liked to see the movie more about the killer bear and his back story.  For me, this is almost the weakest Pixar movie.  I still think the Cars franchise is weaker, but this one is a close second.
1451695195|4.0|I have always enjoyed reading about these experiences. The author offers a well efforted description of his but it is not without a great deal of personal info not necessarily related to the story. Overall, I liked the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game it keeps me really busy. I always love to play it. It has some glitches but it dosent matter
B00AODKSAA|1.0|This was just plain awful. I am so glad I didn't pay to watch the whole movie as it would have made me mad to waist money on this piece of garbage. This coming from a die-hard vampire movie fan too.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|This Movie Is breath taking. Incredibly artistic. All of the actors did an amazing job. The costumes and scenes are beautiful. I am buying this movie on blue ray
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very realistic and animated.  the chores are true to life and educational.  we thoroughly enjoy this horse game for the kindle.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Exactly what i wanted and it came in the mail very fast. Movie was in plastic wrap and everything brand new! thanks
B000OJFV4C|3.0|It's a nice attempt at exploring the early years of Henry VIII's reign, but the actors are wrong for the roles.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Enjoyed the presentation at the end of the movie.  Affleck, definitly should have been nominated for an Oscar nomination !
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|There was a small arms race in my house between my roommate and I for Nerf Guns. I have to say, this one is a lot of fun. It has a lot of removable parts, and a great look. I'm thinking about making it Steampunk eventually.
0345803493|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I liked it enough that I read the 2nd and 3rd book. I have never read a book of this nature so it was a different experience for me. And for those that consider it mommy porn I don't see the big deal. If you don't like it don't  read it.
0061373877|5.0|I bought the Audio Book, which also has the benefit of having been read by Gaiman himself. He does a fabulous job, and has a really soothing voice. I love listening to him read his own work, and really can't recommend this enough.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the book. Very different from anything else I ever read which is why I liked it so much. I will look for similar books to read. Looking forward to reading more of this authors work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game rocks. I love playing it and it is so fun. I wish it was easier to get gems and it takes awhile for the game to load. any one who luves horses should get it. and the graphics are really good too.
B000ECX0QU|3.0|Topaz refers to a Russian spy ring during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. The film is based on a book by Leon Uris. According to the mostly superficial commentary by film critic Leonard Maltin, much of the original film was cut based on audience responses to the film during an early screening.<br />I give the film three stars for taking on a serious topic. It is not one of his best films nor one of the worst. The action occurs primarily in New York and Paris. We have a blue eyed Fidel Castro and John Forsythe as a CIA agent who hires a French operative to travel to Cuba to investigate rumors of Russian missiles.<br />Hitchcock shot three endings for the film. After major cuts, Topaz runs two hours and 23 minutes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Because it is good for the community and to the school of the publicity for a few years old and to the community
B0014GVCI8|5.0|I LOVE this movie! The dialogue is laced with smart funny lines that I quote often.  What a nice departure from the mindless drivel in most recent movies.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|cant even open the app to play the game. seems awesome. wish I could play. android players always seem to get the short end of the stick.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|We enjoyed this movie alot, &  watched it three times. The kids laughed out loud and so did we. It did contain some adult humor but nothing vulgar. We will see it again.I especially liked how it looked like it was filmed in B&W like the old movies were.
B0098VXE50|5.0|excellent product ... I get everything in perfect condition. aunqeue a little late but all very good. thank you very much. recommended
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is a love film--I adore the humor and the sheer level of honesty in the characters and their development. Another great job, Wes!
B0084HJE0S|3.0|It has good information but it is not a reference for a web developer. It is short with good information.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I am a huge Adele fan and this is one of my favorite purchases. Great quality and I have lost track of how many times I have watched it. Great buy.
0062238868|5.0|If you do not buy another book all year buy this one. It gives you a look first hand at what our troops have to do to get the job done across the pond. It shows his insight and how he had to prepare himself for becoming a SEAL. It also is a very personal story with real feelings and emotions from a man who in my opinon was a true hero. It is a shame he is no longer with us because some thug caught him off guard. I would hate to be that guy if he makes it to heaven and meets Chris. It is a great read!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|What? who doesn't like the Lorax? This is the cutest movie i have seen in a long time. i bought it for ME and I am 63, but I share it with my grandkids. But they can't take it home. LOL
B0000AGQ6P|5.0|What an AMAZING picture.  This is my sister's favorite movie, and her vhs finally bit the dust.  I decided to replace it and saw this one in the selections.  When she put it in to watch, I was in awe.  I have seen this movie so many times, but NEVER like this.  There are so many details in this movie that you don't see with the regular type dvd or vhs.  I am sold on this.  If I find other movies with the superbit...I am definitely going to chose them!
B004I744AS|1.0|I hate this! It keeps on saying that I'm offline! When I'm not! I don't know if its just because this is the free one, or not! DO NOT BUY! I bought this only because of all of the good reports about it, now i know that some of those are probably not true! And seriously, if it says that it is offline, i cant do anything! Once again DO NOT BUY! Didn't be convinced from the other reports! BTW i would give it 5 stars if this didn't happen! I thought it was great! :(
B00B49L7JY|5.0|You've heard the buzz.  It's true.  This is an INCREDIBLE story of a man who never got credit, getting what he deserves.  The subject couldn't be more humble and worthy of praise.  When the film was nominated for, and won the Oscar this year, he didn't go to the awards for fear of taking attention away from the filmmakers.  This film introduces you to an artist you've probably never heard, and you'll leave inspired and ready to add a few amazing albums to your listening repertoire.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|I enjoy playing the game. Frustrating tho when you want a hint although maybe I just haven't found that yet?
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This book was written from the perspective of a person progessing with the disease. It gave insight on how they feel as the world around them changes. It does break your heart to read this story if you know anyone with Alzheimer's disease.
B008518MOW|4.0|I wasn't expecting much because I didn't like the last Movie.  This one was refreshing.  Will Smith was funny and the story line was good.  I ready enjoyed it.  I am glad I purchase it.  The 3D was super as well.
0307987698|3.0|The original was so good it is hard to compare it.  Good book though.  Kids will like it because it is Elmo.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I Listen to it every evening before I go to bed. Very soothing reading, and it gives you opportunity to listen in chronological order.
0307010856|5.0|I love this book.  My mother in law got it for my oldest nephew and every child in the family after read this book.  I got it for my own son and it was his favorite!
B005K17RU0|5.0|We use it on a daily basis. My husband drives a truck, so we check this app before he leaves for his destination to see what kind of weather he is driving towards.
B0089OBLDO|3.0|I got this adapter for the sole reason of using Xbox 360 controllers and arcade sticks on my PS3.  So far, it has done that job well.  I have not tested its other functionality, but from reviews, it seems that PS3 to Xbox 360 compatibility is not as good or non-existent.  The game that I play the most is Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and I have not experienced any kind of input lag due to the adapter.<br /><br />This adapter loses two stars however because the USB connector does not securely attach the USB cord of your controller/stick.  Thus, this slightest movement can disconnect your controller and force you to forfeit a match if you're playing in a tournament.  It is probably possible to glue/solder/otherwise attach the USB to the adapter more securely, but the fact that it isn't this way out of the box is a gross oversight.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Sound and picture quality is excellent.  It was definitely worth the money and I would recommend to others.  The special features gave insight to the characters by the actors who played the character as well as costume design and how it has changed throughout the three series.
B000002JNJ|4.0|To me, this is the first Pantera release, almost like their debut. (I know they did some Glam/heavy metalish stuff in their early years but that isn't really my thing) But Cowboys From Hell is Pantera's shinning moment, more so than any of their other albums. This album puts together some of the best qualities of music. Great melody, and strength with the brutality Phil Anselmo has in his voice and Darrel Roberts has on the guitar. Vinny Paul, isn't the best drummer but he is the best drummer for Pantera? (Catch what I'm saying?) The title track is killer and its one of their bests. \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\" has a crunchy guitar riff and a powerful chorus. Another highlight of this album is \\"Domination\\" It is powerful, rebellious, and catchy. One of my favorite songs to deadlift to. Now so far I have scratched the surface of this groove metal masterpiece. If you like hard rock, groove metal, metal, ect ect. Give Cowboys From Hell a listen.
B008YKRRIQ|1.0|If, by &#34;romantic&#34; you mean &#34;sluggish&#34;, you've made an apt description. Simply put, Klemperer, like Edward Elgar, doesn't export well.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I bought the CD and it is not censored.  So.....just saying......<br /><br />oh BTW-  i dare you to not dance while listening to this!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wow.  What a book!  I am honored to have read Dr. Alexander's book and am indebted to him for having the courage to step out on a limb to share his story.  This is a subject matter I have been fascinated with for some time.  I think we all want to know for sure what really happens when you die.  It seems most medical professionals are so quick to chalk up near-death experiences to a chemical reaction in the brain.  I choose to believe there is more to it and I thank Dr. Alexander for having the courage to speak what he believes following his experience.  Everyone should read the book, if only to help you make up your mind regarding what you believe.
B004KKX814|5.0|While looking on your web site with my nephew he saw this one and told me I could get it for his birthday.
B004X60QE2|5.0|Very funny. Offbeat humor and great characters make this a great show. Very silly, can be watched without going back to the beginning but it's better to start there because you miss inside jokes.
0393338827|5.0|What anyone with an investment needs to know - how we got into this mess, who was responsible.  Easy read from a great author who was there and also can write an easy going 'historical piece' on the economy that is not dry, dusty and boring.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show, however, the seasons are very short. They should consider making them longer in the future.
B007SGM084|4.0|that hasn't already been said about this trilogy: fluffy, yet titillating. i was ashamed of myself for reading it but that's another book.....isn't it??
B004DARF6A|4.0|Worth a watch, not as good city lights, but still classic Chaplin humor.  We watched with with our grand kids and my 8 year old grand daugther is now a Chaplin fan.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I'm not sure that this style of watch can be beat at any price.  Keeps great time, seems indestructible, and waterproof to boot.  Has a nice weight to it and I can feel the quality.  This is my first automatic but so far so good.  Love the fact that I don't have to worry about changing batteries.  Look forward to having this watch for many, many years to come.
B007C52NY2|5.0|i had read these books previously and purchased and shipped these as a gift.  i wish Stieg Larsson had not passed away so there could be more books in the series, but i am grateful  to have gotten to read these.
1451695195|5.0|Well worth reading.  Validated many issues for me.  I would recommend this manuscript, especially for those who Don't believe in the Afterlife.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|Very easy-better than hulu+. Prices/episode a little high, the pricing on hd ridiculous. Great quality, easy to use & best selection as a current netflix user & having just deleted hulu +,due to lack of selection.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|If  you  want  to  see  a  good  version  of  the  movie  Anna  Karenina,  then  watch  the  one  with  Sophie  Marceau.  I  saw  it  a  long  time  ago.  It  is  very  good. I  have  seen  the  trailers  for  this  movie,  which  stars  Keira Knightley,  &  have  been  on  the  fence  whether  to  view  it  or  not.  After  all  of  the  bad  reviews,  though,  I  probably  will  not.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I grew up with all the Ian Flemming films so all the films will be rated 5 stars no matter how anyone else rates them. It is all a matter of personal taste in video entertainment .
B004XWLN20|5.0|Smallville was an awesome series that is an entertaining introduction to how superman came to be.<br /><br />When watching this, you must keep in mind that this is a television show made independently of the movies. That being said, it may not go hand in hand with what some Superman fanatics may believe.<br /><br />All in all it is goog for the whole family!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the ease of the calculator big numbers and simplicity.  So I'd say that &quot;the 5 stars say it all!&quot;
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Everyone in our family has enjoyed this series.  The first season has enlightened us on so many points.  Thank you!
B00006RAKP|1.0|This DVD was extremely difficult to hear.  The background music was in the foreground making the singer very difficult to hear.  Sounded like he was in back of a tunnel with the instruments up front.  This problem was present on all tracks. Do not recommend a purchase of this album from this vendor.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Her books are absorbing, full of interesting details, and memorable. The amount of research she must do is mind-boggling. The local newspaper does book ads & as soon as I see she has a new one out, I order it for my Kindle.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldnt stop reading!  I tried to put my iPad down, but I couldn't.  I cannot wait for the movie!
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Know I will always be entertained with distasteful issues coming up.  Good to learn bits of another culture and the characters are my friends.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|A gorgeous film that will delight anyone who's ever played an arcade game. Imaginative, fun and overflowing with heart. How this lost the Oscar to Brave is a mystery to me - this film is far superior. 3D is gorgeous and vibrant. Accompanying Oscar winning short, Paperman, is pure delight. A true return to form for Disney, and better than any Pixar film since Toy Story 3.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Love it, I have seen this documentary many time, it worth the buy. Highly recommended thank you so much much
B009UZLRJE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sisters 22nd birthday. This is her favorite television show. It was a great deal and includes all 5 seasons in the box set. The packaging was great. It's the Big Bang Theory, you can't really go wrong.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is amazing and I love that I can download it and watch it on my Xbox. Will be using this service in the future
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased this for my cousin who is 11 years old. The corner of the case actually cracked the very second she put it on the phone. We returned it and got another case, which did the very same thing. Needless to say she returned the product and purchased something different.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app hours off fun never any problems always runs excellent on my Kindle very addictive a great way to pass the time
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Listening to album at this minute!!  Love &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34; main  reason I bought this album. I do like  very much the rest of album!!  Oh! this seller delivered product in 2 days!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like temple run two better than temple run because you really feel like your escaping a temple. I like how  there are hills and different land forms instead of just flat. Would you rather play with this ___/\___ or ___________? Temple run two is way more fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lot better than the other horse games!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I like the graphics I like how we r able to feed the horse and how to the horses look like horses.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is really good. I haven't finished it but so far I'm 90% finished and so far it's excellent!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I love it , my kids love it . It's really good and funny. Great family movie and we watched it about 15 times already.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is super fun! Sure occasionally it is difficult, but don't let that stop you! This is an awesome game for any device!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Great live DVDs with all the classics.  Must have for an Zeppelin fan!  The box and art are cool as well.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is really fun. I get really mad when I lose something so yeah, this game makes me mad but it is super awesome! I am stuck on the last one but other than that last one and a few other ones this game is worth $1.99!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Finding Nemo is such a great movie and in 3D it is absolutely stunning.  I felt as though I was in the ocean and even more connected to the story than before.  It is very much worth the price and if you don't have it in 3D buy it now!!!  You will not be disappointed.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Get it the actual price is 9.99 and its free n works fine on my kindle fire hd and my friend bought it but get it free that's all I need to say
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I watched it and then went back and watched the Alien Anthology (another great collection if you don't have it) and it's really good and I cannot wait for the ones to follow.  I haven't even had a chance to watch it in 3D yet but I'm sure this will only add to the experience.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Lots of fun!<br />  Got this for my daughter, but I play it more than she does! The gems are hard to come by, however.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil games and movies and I really enjoyed this one.  In 3D it's amazing!  I have watched it a few times and it one of my favorites out of the RE movie series.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|I waited a long time to review this film, and with 200-plus it is likely no one will read it.<br /><br />Why now? I listened to an interview with Dr. Phil Zimbardo today, famous for his early 1970s experiments on prisoners and guards at Stanford. I watched the films in college, and never forgot them. Then, I saw recently a film adaptation, located in Cologne, where I studied and lived with a German family. It is called \\"Das Experiment.\\" For drama, there are deaths and rape of one of the experimeters.<br /><br />Zimbardo picked the healthiest college students for a summer study of \\"prison life\\" assigning them randomly as prisoners and guards to a makeshift prison on the Stanford campus.<br /><br />Within days, the experiment was halted. The guards had become brutal, and at least two \\"prisoners\\" had become nervous ponds of blather.<br /><br />what has this to do with \\"Lord of War?\\" Everything.  Except for the 1 in 100 who are born sociopaths (they decapitate cats for enjoyment as children)...how do some of the 99 of 100 become evil, and others good? Zimbardo's strong answer--environment. I tend to agree, after earning my Ph.D. and M.A. in Clinical Psychology at Vanderbilt, becoming an academic scholar, and then a consultant in private practice in Clinical and Neuro-Psychology.<br /><br />I have seen the film in English, German, and Russian. the images are true--Europe, America, Africa...in this drama, you see how environment creates villains, arms dealers, arming both sides, and--of interest to Zimbardo, how one brother can DIE trying to save a camp of Africans about to be slaughtered, and the other brother, an arms dealer for any side---something he learned in Brighton Beach, or Little Odessa, after fleeing Ukraine with his family masquerading as Jews in the 1970s. His father got the point--he goes to Shul frequently, but also introduces Yuri (Nicolas Cage) to some of his first gangsters.<br /><br />If any film heralds the environment as a creator of killers and heroes, this is it, and you can understand that in any language. Throw in love (based on beauty, a trophy of Long Island who becomes a model and then the object of Yuri's all-American desires, a little betrayal (Yuri's uncle is assassinated by a rival arms dealer), and a psychopath (the African arms purchaser) and you have it all, including the pilots who have to land their plane to avoid being shot down, carrying Yuri's latest cargo. Pursuing all the time is Interpol, represented by Ethan Hawke.<br /><br />Then, finally in custody, Yuri's \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" card arrives--a mysterious U.S. officer, who trumps Interpol. Because, War is Business, in any language.<br />So why no protests of G.W. Bush's \\"Business Wars\\" after 2008. This I do not yet comprehend. Where did all the anti-war activists go? Are they now so busily employed mowing down Detroit to be concerned. It troubles me, and after viewing this film it should trouble you. Unless, of course, you are one of the 1 in 100 that Dr. Zimbardo cites.<br /><br />WHY does Yuri's brother, brought into the business as a \\"Brother in Arms?\\" The good boy with the drug habit?  This is the missing part of the story, and it is the one that Dr. Zimbardo is now most interested in. How do we create pro-social individuals? We once relied on churches, synagogues, the schools. They have less influence now.  If you find Dr. Z's website (not difficult) please contribute to this cause, this research, because it will not be government funded. However, this research is needed now more than ever. We know the Soviets advanced only with rifles and machine guns aimed at their backs--the Heroes of the Great Patriotic War. Where are the defenders of freedom? We need to know now--before compulsory service of 18 to 24 year olds begins. Time is short. Hitler said that he didn't care what the \\"adults\\" thought because he had the children. They were difficult or impossible to break out of the Nazi mold--I've seen the research, and been to some of the places where this was attempted. We are in desperate times. No, I'm not a crackpot or a conspiracy theorist, I say this based on well-done research, and research that needs to be done. None of Zimbardo's \\"prisoners\\" became partisans. Why not?<br /><br />A great film for all time.he places where this was attempted. We are in desperate times.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|This was the first Keys album I ever got and it's a great one.  Has a few songs that are not on par with the rest but for the most part you can put it on and let it play all the way through.  Great stuff!
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This is one of my favorite Angry Birds, but the full commercials that now show up during it are ridiculous.  You can't close them so you have to close the game and reopen it every time they appear.  I don't mind ads that you can close during a free game, but the 30 second commercials have got to go.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|Honestly the problem I have with this collection is you cannot run the games of the disc.  You must install them to the PS3 for them to work which was annoying to me.  It should have just been a digital download if it was going to be that way.  I played Flow and Flower and both were cool for about 5 minutes.  I have not even played Journey yet (which is supposed the be the best in the collection).  I would say just get Journey via the PSN and don't even mess with the disc as it doesn't serve much purpose.
B005HSL626|5.0|the kids and i both find this enjoyable. but it's addictive. i think it helps them work their mind and hand an eye coordination. they love it.
B00006F83Y|3.0|I really liked Them Crooked Vultures (big fan of Homme and Grohl) so I wanted to give some QOTSA a try as I had heard a couple songs on this album I liked (Go With the Flow and No One Knows).  Other than those two songs there weren't many more that I really cared about that much and the radio talk and such is cool at first but gets old very quickly.
034580404X|5.0|Loved it the order came fast I just wish that there were more books by this particular author the book was a good read.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Great Tarantino action.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone who has not seen it.  The Blu-ray is stunning.  Watch out for the bear jew!
B0079R8KXG|3.0|Produce does not work as a stand and is not as pictured will work as a cover but not a stand.
B009MO5G90|3.0|I am a big Resident Evil fan (the games and the movies) so I really enjoyed this movie but I could see how it would be horrible to other people.  It doesn't have much of a story but the action scenes are great and the 3D is awesome.  It's nice they introduce Leon and Ada.  I was a little bummed out because I thought this was the last movie but it definitely lets you know there will be another.
B002BVYBBK|5.0|came as described. brand new no damage arrived promptly. very satisfied with the sellers description and actions. 3 more words
B008518MOW|5.0|I enjoyed this MIB more than the second one and I would say it up there with the first.  It is great in 3D and well worth it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this second book of the trilogy and am looking forward to the third.  Thank you Ken Follett<br />for hours of entertaining history.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I originally saw this in theaters and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Blu-ray is true to form and it looks great.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|ok this app was so rere it did not let me clickonany thing and i could not scroll down, not good at all.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I do not enjoy this album as much as some of the other Rage albums but this one still has some good songs.  Has more slower paced songs that are almost ballads to me but still has the great sounds of Morello and De La Rocha.  A good album but not great.  I would definitely pick up their self titled album before this one if you do not have it.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|wow this CD kicks ass...every song is memorable and picked it up at a bargain price. i highly recommend this CD!
B009YU62H2|5.0|I'm a huge Soundgarden fan.  I honestly did not even know this disc was out and when I pulled it up on Amazon it was $4.  It is a great album that has that classic Soundgarden feel.  Some of my favorite songs are Bones of Birds and Eyelid's Mouth.  It is a disc I can put on and listen to all the way through and just lose track of time.  Really good sleeper album.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Inspiring story. Music that indures. Met all my expectations and so much more. The best movie I have seen in years!
B0000028RR|5.0|Right off the bat with Bombtrack this album is great.  Killing in the Name is also one of my favorite RATM songs.  It's high tempo and has power in the singing and lyrics that make you want to start a revolution.  This might be the best Rage disc there is and is a must own for any Rage fans or hard rockers.  Tom Morello always blows my mind with some of the sounds he can get out of his guitar.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|3D is amazing, great quality, extras are tons of fun, I would totally recommend it, buy it if you love 3D movies
B005LAII80|5.0|I did not expect anything out of this movie and have never planned on watching it.  After reading reviews I pre-ordered it to watch it in 3D.  It is an experience!  The way this movie is shot and the atmosphere are amazing.  I would highly recommend it as I enjoyed every minute of it.  It did drag along in a couple parts but stay with it because it's enjoyable.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I was waiting and waiting for these 3 movies to come out in one package.  You won't regret buying it
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This double album from RHCP is amazing. Frusciante and Flea tear it up and both discs are great.  Good songs all over the place with these two discs and it is very much worth it if you are an RHCP or rock fan in general.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This is the one game I have loaded on my Android phone.<br />I like the interface compared to other Sudoku apps I have used.<br />It is Sudoku and no complaints
B007U8UBGI|4.0|I grabbed this album on an impulse because I'm a big Jack White fan.  The album is really good and is a good change of pace from most music put out today.  I really like the first half of the album but the second not so much.  Freedom at 21 is probably my favorite song but I cannot figure out why.  If you have not seen It Might Get Loud and you are a guitarist you must go watch it now as it will make you more of a fan of Jack and his uniqueness.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This is the coolest concept for a calculator.  Unfortunately you can't do any advance functions like trigonometry or financial functions, but to handle basic math problem it is great and fun.  I sometimes just sit and play with it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Just updated the app and now you can do trig functions and other advance math functions.  This app just got better.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a pretty good game.  I am still working on getting the hang of everything, but so far so good.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the book a lot. I had read it before but enjoyed reading it again and would recommend it to anyone.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Logitech seems to have completely failed with this product.<br /><br />I bought the Logitech G930 to replace a nice wired Bose headset. I wanted something more upscale and gaming-centric, plus wireless was a must since the wired connections have been the point of failure for virtually every headset I've owned since I always snag them on things.<br /><br />I read a few &#34;industry&#34; reviews which often placed the G930 at the top of their comparisons. For the price they seemed to be the most feature-rich and highly-rated option. I read a few &#34;customer&#34; reviews, however, and found a pretty mixed response. Since I usually assume &#34;you're doing it wrong&#34; when I read bad review I bought the G930 anyway. My mistake.<br /><br />I got the headset today and was very excited to try it out. I un-boxed it, followed the installation instructions to the letter (because I'm a rule-following dork) and TA-DA!---- very crappy, crackley sound that drops in and out. WTF?<br /><br />I tried to re-launch the G930 software that comes with the installation disk (to adjust the settings) and repeatedly get the error &#34;unplug and re-plug your headset&#34;. I have un-plugged, re-plugged the headset about two dozen times. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the software several times as well. Nothing. The sound is bad and the software won't launch. The Logitech Support forum is completely full of customers complaining about the same thing. A search of Youtube also reveals more of the same. Apparently Logitech has been completely silent on the topic, offering no solutions.<br /><br />This may be a great headset, but because of terrible software I'll never really know. I'm boxing it up and returning ASAP.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|I would give this 5-stars but it only scratches the surface. Truly an eye-opening movie. If you read \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and/or \\"Fatland\\" you'll love this movie.
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia is what I believe to be a true companion book to the entire life of The Legend of Zelda series. This book is a gift of high calibur for any Zelda fan and or gamer.
B000006OAM|4.0|I recently purchased this CD to replace my original, which I had played countless times. I adore this album! So while I like the Auto Rip feature, I DO NOT LIKE that Amazon shipped me a blatant pirated bootleg CD. The CD is green, the graphics are grainy, the whole thing is janky. Not cool.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is the first SK book I've finished. I'm not a very good reader because I get distracted! But this book was very good, kept my interest and I connected with the characters. Many surprises!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Purchased this for my daughter-in-law.  We have been waiting for the blu-ray version to be released.  I have the DVD and she has the other two discs.  We both love the 'eternal child&#34; Peter Pan.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|great app just what I needed to find friends from all over the world made lots of good friends from badoo can get enough of it. thank you for this great app
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is a great read and the archetypal page-turner!  There are implausibilities in the telling of the tale, the characters aren't that likable but you still want to know what happens next and how things pan out in the end.  The denouement is probably disappointing but maybe not illogical.  Plenty of fodder here for a book club!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter is 4 1/2 years old and LOVES monster high!  This is a must see for all Monster High fans!
1616550414|5.0|my 16 year old son loved the level of detail in this quality book.  it should keep him very busy!
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|Very nice CD. It really shows that Justine Bieber has developed maturity and improved his talent. I'm glad I purchased this CD.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I try getting it for a grandma. That's what I say anyone tell me not to no. that's what I say.
B008P86FTE|3.0|I like the CD but it has too many interludes. Some of the songs are a little strange and you must listen to the lyrics. I like most of the CD. Pyramids, Forrest Gump, Lost, #2, Bad Religion. I'm pleased with the purchase.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Different from other angry bird game it is really refreshing the way u have to use physics to complete challenges and to realize there is more one way an unorthodox ways to achieve the goals. A delightful mind challenge that is fun and relatively simple.
B009LXECF6|5.0|It is rare that an artist can top his previous CD but he did. The entire CD is excellent. He has a style all his own. Looking forward to more from this artist.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It's a story beautifully told, and you cannot put it down.  Very moving, and the characters are very engaging. It's also great for a bookclub, since it can generate a lot of debate, and things to analyze and talk about. It's one of the readings I enjoyed the best lately.  A good book is a real pleasure.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars has an array of talent. This CD is fabulous. It has a little bit of everything. Slow, fast, reggae. Very nice.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Thanks to all who made game. I have it on my kindle fire. Works with no problems.Have all my favorite bots &amp; my own.It's just like the movie.I love it !
B005DNBDXM|5.0|I like apocalyptic movies and this one is cool. Anything with Morgan Freeman is gonna be good in my opinion.
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|Anyone who likes Al Pacino must see this movie in Blue-ray. The picture & sound is much better. As we all know the language is very graffic. Not for little ears! Put that aside & it's a very good classic, time era movie. Might be a little too violent for some viewers also.
B001AQT0UY|5.0|DVD was in great condition and the kids love the movie, how can you not it's a timeless classic for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I feel really really happy playing subway surfers. I laugh at the funny things I get to do! It's exciting and really fast! Totally cool! ( This is in my 6 year old sons words) :)
B0036S4CTS|4.0|This was a great book about how the best love begins with friendship.  I loved the realistic view of these characters.
B00821OX98|5.0|I never even heard of this show till I saw it featured on my Kindle. It was done very well and the acting was superb. I liked it so much that they I tried to find it on my TV. I found out that it will be back out this summer. I am a FAN for sure!
B00A77II0U|5.0|what a blast!  my first  app game and i am hooked!  i hope there are many sequels to this.  applause!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great read! This book was worth a great deal more then 99 cents. Read it in three days and spent one night reading until early morning. If this is Andy Weir's first book I will follow and welcome his future efforts to the SF genre.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Anyone who says this movie is bad is a freaking lunatic. Now it is a little different from the book, but the movie is it's own little world. Peter Jackson has a vision like no other and everyone criticizes this movie because their imagination isn't as big as Peter Jackson. I wish Peter Jackson would take the Percy Jackson series and make a master piece from what Rick Riordan has put on paper.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I don't get what so many said about this game being so fun...it's a &quot;click and wait&quot; game.  I was excited seeing the 3-D intro and thinking it was a knock-off of Jurassic Park Operation Genesis from PC and XBox glory, but no...click on dino and wait...or dig into wallet.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I just unpackaged this thing about an hour ago and have been playing around with garage band and also just seeing what this little workhorse can really do....  It is perfect for small studio recordings and I may even have some live application ideas.  BEST THING ABOUT IT............  Phantom Power!!!!!!  I have been trying to figure out a way to use my condenser mic with my computer, This thing solved that problem for me.  Great Product!!!!!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Since I was told about Breaking Bad 3 years ago I havn't been able to stop watching it. The action mixed with the everyday family life. It's the doubl elife come to life on screen.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|I would give it a higher rating but the price of the series is a high for 10 episodes. That's over $3.50 an episode more then rentals for a TV show.  Other wise it is a good show.
B002VHI8FE|1.0|I like books in which I can actually like the characters. In this series they all have too many flaws. This book killed a small part of my inner child.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This works great on my nexus devices,  but on my kid's generic 7 inch tablet the d pad is so small it is unplayable.  Hoping for a customization option very soon.
B001AP11L6|4.0|There's not much more to say about this album that hasn't already been said numerous times before... Jack White is mind-blowing with his fusion of garage rock and blues-y guitar playing, with every song masterfully implementing impressive hooks that you won't soon forget.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game i mean my whole svhool plays this game my lil and big sis play this even my momms play it you will love it to lms!!!
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I loved this app on my phone, but it's just not the same here on Amazon. Yes, it was free on GP, but you had to pay for the plugins. Here, you pay for the initial app, and the plugins are free (much cheaper overall). My problem is that the sound skips on some tracks. For the first few hours it was perfect and lulled me to sleep... but then I awoke to the skipping of the beach plugin track. I hope this glitch gets fixed soon, as I was a huge supporter of Lightning Bug. I tried the \\"beta workaround\\"... no dice. 4 stars for app WHEN it works.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse everyone in girl scouts has it. I just wish you could get coins and gems easier.
B00B3HJMLM|2.0|I thought this might be the gateway to summer album but the lyrical content is lacking.  These might be fun songs live and in a bar setting, but on a disc they are almost hard to listen to.  Yes, Luke still has a great voice but the stories and musicianship of the songs doesn't exist.  I give Luke a break as it has a disclaimer in the title as a \\"Spring Break\\" party album, but given the effort and production of the great tailgates & tanlines I expected more.  Sorry Luke, this is lacking.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is awesome I play it all the time but it's Kathy which really sucks because it kills you when you are not supposed to.
B0094K1K42|2.0|This movie was quite disappointing. It did not keep me interested, waste of a couple of hours.  I do not recommend this movie
B0018QQQK8|4.0|VERY GOOD BOOK. One of the best books I ever read!!<br />it has a lot of detail...and it also has a cute love story to it.
B009ANP48G|3.0|I just ordered this movie from my amazon list & the sound keeps skipping on the DVD but their is no scratches on it & I won't be able to hear it as much as I need to ! ! ! So I was wondering how do I fix this problem ? & One last thing you can't sell DVDs if their is something wrong with the disc itself ! ! !
B008YWY0HK|5.0|One of Disney's finest new movies. Good for both boys and girls, but especially nice for showing girls how they can stand on their own two feet!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I LOVE Downton Abbey but this season proved to be very depressing! As always, excellent acting and beautiful scenery but very sad storylines! Seasons 1 and 2 were better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game plays smoothly, the hints are there if you need them, the Vegas scoring works properly, and the ads are unobtrusive--one screen at the start of each deal.  This app does exactly what it's supposed to, and it's free.  That's good enough for me!
B005AUWY2W|5.0|My toddler is obsessed with both Cars and Cars 2. Mater is hilarious. And it's fun to watch with him. There is more of a storyline in the first movie. But we love this as well.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Among all of my 3D movies, this is one of the most watched. You may say any movie shot in good quality 3D can be watched over and over but I tell you the quality of the film itself matters a lot. This movie has both. The quality of the 3D is astounding. I'm surprised it is not frequently counted among the best 3D depth and quality. The screen effects are jaw dropping! The story is intriguing too. All those people that blab about the poor quality of this movie possibly fueled by a personal vendetta with Michael Bay have a right to their opinion of course, but I dare them to present a movie they've directed and produced themselves before splashing their malicious and non professional reviews about this product of hard work and talent! If you don't appreciate something, you can pass the message without being spiteful and disrespectful.
B007IK44CK|3.0|The usual Tom Cruise action movie.  The ending was technically WAAAAY off, spoiling the whole thing.  The scenese depicted (eg., the Burje Califa) were breathtaking.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|One of the best albums I've heard in a long time. This young man is going to be around for some time, his music is full of art, soul and compassion. This is definitely a treasure of a find!
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed getting to know the characters, and I believe the suspense and drama were well portrayed.  This is the first David Baldacci book I've read, but it won't be the last.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This was a Christmas gift, such a good movie. I have watched it several times now. I would recommend it to others as well.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|This was suppose to be a 2 disc DVD a WRONG!!!!!!!!  I got one disc when I payed for the 2 Disc DVD what a jip vendor was.  Do not recommend
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LIke most of them, this book was extremely better than the movie. I would recommend the book over the movie any day.
B001O2QW9G|3.0|Truth is it is very tiny.  I wanted to put it by my pond, but after I received it and saw how small it is, it ended up in my 30 gallon aquarium.  In the description, it never gave the deminsions.  I wish Amazon would be more aware of that and be more detailed.
B0009UC810|5.0|I will give this movie a 5, I personally haven't seen it yet but it was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This book is a great tale of romance in hard times.  I was immediately drawn in to the book like I was part of the story. I just couldn't put it down!!!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|We all know how bad things were, but this movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and in the end you'll feel a sense of justice.  A really great movie.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It compares very favorably with the previous Pendergast stories.  Very imagnative and with a twisting plot line.  Always makes youi wonder how he is going to get out of this situation.  Highly remendend it to all Prendergast readers.  A note of advise.  If you want to read this book, I would recommend that you start with the first novel in the series and make your way forward.  As with all the Pendergast novel, each one refers to what takes place in the previous stories.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I plug in the KINDLE each night, and can check the charge each morning. The app also reminds me when I am down to 15  percent, so I can recharge.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book and I think that I'm going to read the last book too.Hope  the  author of this book will write author<br /> (\_/)<br />  (*.*)  &lt;--------------  he shall be called squishy the bunny<br />  (\\")_(\\")
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book! I read it along with my 12-year-old son as part of a cumminty read at his school. I couldn't put it down. The charatcers, the moral, the way it was written are just fabulous. I gave it to my 75-year-old mother and told her &#34;you have to read this.&#34; She read it in one day....so moved by it.<br /><br />A MUST-READ BOOK!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It feels like the story of my life and probably yours too. It's nice to know that in not alone in my thoughts.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|It's okay...a bit rambling in spots, but interesting book about her life. The way she describes her dad is funny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game non stop. It's a great never ending game.you can relate it to temple run, it has jumps and turns and trains!!!!!!!! You can get some really cool new people(you must have enough money(which u can collect while running.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|The movie is awesome. I love superhero movies and this one is funny and tasteful. It's a great movie for children and young adults.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great way to entertain you and your children. My friends little brother loves it. There is also great themes that you have to earn like,normal,Rio,and Rome.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie.  Very well made.  And even though we knew the outcome...we were stuck in our chairs...frozen until they got away.
1400069807|5.0|Society is slowing understanding that there is a downside to the convenience of ready-made, processed food that supermarkets typically sell, just as we now understand the pitfalls with fast food. What is less known is the various &#34;tricks&#34; used to make many of us de facto addicts.<br /><br />This book, written by a New York Times investigative reporter, details the rapid growth of the (American) processed foods industry and takes a look at the various methods being used to make us want to consumer more and more. It is no accident, it is design. Design of a big business worth over a trillion US dollars a year in just America alone.<br /><br />Some of the statistics cited are alarming. The average American (note that word - average) will eat over 33 pounds (15 kg) of a fat-laden cheese each year, equivalent to the weight of a small child. Not alarmed yet? How about 70 pounds (31.7kg) of sugar? Or double the amount of salt that we should ingest… and all of this is only from processed food! Of course, a bit of everything can be good for you, but when this means that one in three adults is clinically obese and the problem is still growing you really need to sit up and pay attention.<br /><br />The author takes a thoughtful look at the problem which is a worldwide issue and examines the role, or possibly collusion, that the processed food industry has been involved in. This is no conspiracy theory-style drama but a matter-of-fact, an articulated consideration of the problem. The role of product development and various food scientists, marketeers and ad men and even industry lobbying efforts are brought together to get us eating more, more, more.<br /><br />The reader is free to draw their own conclusions and inferences.<br /><br />Processed food is said to be affordable to the general population, at least by its advocates. Often the reality is a lot different when you check it out. Of course, it might be faster, more convenient and be attractive, but it is not necessarily cheaper, more wholesome and as good for you. Time after time we are seeing various scandals affecting &#34;big food&#34; such as, at the time of writing, the growing mislabelling crisis affecting meat in Europe where horse meat apparently has been &#34;mislabelled&#34; and sold as beef, passed on through a chain of suppliers, subcontractors and processors. If you are not worried by various animal welfare issues, mislabelling, pesticides and other chemicals or the various addictive or health damaging properties of your foods, what will get you to look at what you eat. Is anything really what it seems to be?<br /><br />Reading about the gradual resistance to the domination of &#34;big food&#34; and the changing shape, if you pardon the pun, of our dietary habits was also interesting. What stood out from the book was the reaction of many people who work within the industry. They are not necessarily the most enamoured with their (employer's) own products. Whilst polished marketing departments will no doubt mumble phrases about everything being fine in moderation when forming part of a balanced diet and so on, the following text is really thought-provoking and possibly telling. &#34;I found that many of the executives I talked to go out of their way to avoid their own products. It got so that I couldn’t resist asking everyone I spoke with about their eating habits: John Ruff from Kraft, who gave up sweet drinks and fatty snacks; Luis Cantarell from Nestl&eacute;, who eats fish for dinner; Bob Lin from Frito-Lay, who avoids potato chips, along with most everything that is heavily processed; Howard Moskowitz, the soft drink engineering whiz who declines to drink soda. Geoffrey Bible not only stopped smoking his company’s cigarettes; when he oversaw Kraft, he worked just as hard at avoiding anything that would send his cholesterol surging.&#34;<br /><br />The book ends, leaving the reader feeling like a bomb has detonated around them, such is the impact of theauthor's work, with an extensive series of notes that can lead to further reading and research should you doubt what you've read or want to know more. Whilst this reviewer is a reasonably level-headed, cynical soul, even if you could discount half of the book as being false and misleading (and there is NO evidence to suggest it is) then the remaining half is still deeply troubling and concerning.r's work, with an extensive series of notes that can lead to further reading and research should you doubt what you've read or want to know more.

B003WJ6AD2|5.0|Its my favorite just to watch, the movie if you want to know for yourself because, I don't believe in giving away the story...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was a great read.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book and the other two in the series
B00B19G01C|5.0|I love the story line and graphics of the movie. I give a way up there. So see it for yourself
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I did not expect to like this CD as much as I do, but had to get it because Thrift Shop had grown on me so much. Great, well-rounded CD -- deep lyrics, great beats.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful show, great acting, well written! Beautiful to watch!<br /> Gets a little silly at times watching how the Upstairs people relate to the Downstairs people, but it makes for a great show!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am NOT a gamer...never have been (no Atari or Nintendo as a kid) and never will be.  However, I am addicted to this game!  It is easy to learn but requires a little bit of skill.  Angry Birds Rio is fun too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|With sweeping camera work and angles, this series is a beauty to view.  I'm not even going to mention the plot lines, which everyone knows are great.
0553386794|4.0|...I'm drained after reading it.  Look, if you're considering reading the Game of Thrones saga then you probably already have seen at least the first season of the hit HBO series.  Now, it's a pretty consistent statement saying that the book is always better than the movie/show.  This is true of this first book.  The details the author provides in simply describing a suit of armor a character is wearing is pretty in depth and cool.  The history you get of different characters reveals a lot of depth that you don't get from the show.  BUT...this book is draining.  Honestly, Appendixes at the end of books weren't meant for leisure fiction reading.  But in this book it's necessary because there are literally like 50+ characters that get thrown at you in this 800 page beast.  It's like studying for an exam as you read the history of who is related to who and what relevance they have to the other characters.  It sort of takes a little fun out of the reading process.  I probably shouldn't have, but I went ahead and read reviews of the latter books in the series and from what I gather the series progressively goes downhill from here.  I'm not so sure I want to invest this much time and brain energy into another four novels of 800 pages each when I can watch the show which, although maybe not quite as good as the book, is still pretty darn good.  In fact, I've gone back and re-watched season 1 of Game of Thrones since reading this book and I have a whole new respect for what a great job the producers did of reinacting this novel without missing a beat.  Maybe I don't need to read full length paragraphs on the description of a knights armor when I can just see it on my HD tv.  Maybe I don't need to memorize a bunch of characters names who may or may not be important to the big sceme of things and just pay attention to the characters introduced to me on the show.<br />My advice...read book one...you'll appreciate the show more...and then just stick to the show. The actors are incredible.  The visuals are incredible.  And the writers did not miss or change anything important that the book delivers.<br />Hope this helps...<br />BRincredible.

B007BFSYMS|4.0|This has taken the place of my white noise machine that I have in my bedroom.  It is great because it has more than four choices and some of them, which seem so bizarre (I.e.-washing machine, crowd noise, just to name a few...) actually are soothing to some.  I love the snooze feature and it will turn itself off after the time set.  I'm still getting the hang of it, but, so far, so good!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love it very much! best horse game for me! try and download it too; best past time oh.yeah oh yea!
B004U52VPS|1.0|Bought this for my son. Very cheapily made. My son loves &#34;Angry Birds&#34; but does not like this game at all.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Great plot, although geared more for women, and excellent actors, however, the sound quality was poor but there's a lesson to learn here concerning our current political situation.
0385337388|4.0|Gives an interesting insight into hospital life (and sorry, but the sexual escapades are outright not true -- a real hospital is not like &#34;ER&#34; -- I'm a hospital staff nurse, I know) but I think it should be a requirement that if you start reading this book, you must FINISH reading the entire book. I won't give away the ending, lets just say the truth comes to light at the end, turning a lot of things around into what they really are. This book was recommended to me by a senior nurse, and I'm glad a I read it. But like I said, you MUST finish the book.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I like the series so far but this book was very slow moving for me...it wasn't til almost 2/3's through the book that it took off and really got interesting for me!!! The whole book could have been written in the last part of the book.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great wireless headset that is full of features but i noticed that the transmitter doesn't get enough power from usb 2.0 (~500 mA) port to allow the max range of 40ft, so i moved the transmitter to one of my free usb 3.0 (~900 mA) ports and it worked like a charm(instant range increase, better audio, and no signal drops). For those of you that have usb 3.0 i would suggest moving the  transmitter to a free port to really get the max performance on these headphones.  That is all :)<br /><br />mA = milli amp (1000mA = 1Amp)
B000URWYTS|5.0|A charming book that captivates the reader from the beginning. I found the story resonating within me as I search for my place as a mother, wife and ardent believer in fulfilling one's purpose.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was enraptured by this story from beginning to end it made cry so much, and made think of how blessed I am that I never went through what Sky did. Holder was an amazing character too. It was easy for me to just love him. As well as Six and Breckin.<br /><br />Overall, this book was wonderful. It made think, laugh out loud, cringe, and cry. I love it when a book makes me react like that.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who wants a quick good read.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The app was good at first until it started saying there was a &quot;connection error&quot; and that it could not &quot;download content&quot; at this time. Is the app messed up?
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I use these mics in my karaoke show and several of my singers have noted the difference in sound. I was using the two that I purchased for my singers and keeping the Audio Technica mic in the booth with me, but after trying the Behringer I swapped it and now use one for myself as well. I love the fact that it doesn't have an on/off switch on the mic. That way, you know the mic is hot when you turn up the channel. The pickup pattern is very tight, reducing the tendency toward feedback. They have a very warm and natural tone and are sensitive enough to pickup subtle changes in the voice which helps me make my singers sound as good as they possibly can. Mine have both been dropped a couple of times by drunk people and have hit the floor but are still functioning just fine. They will wear out eventually and I will replace them with more of the same. You cannot pick up the same quality microphone anywhere for this price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love mini games, so this app is really fun for me. I am hooked, just can't put it down! Great for when you have to sit and wait for anything.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|good storyline and easy to read on the kindle. We are glad we bought it.  And will buy more books for the kindle
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Very good thank you play back was very smooth action was ok not as quick as the other bond movies
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's an epic app for several reasons 1 because you can get an app so you can cheat. 2 in the update 0.6.1 or 0.7.0 theirs going to be natural caves so you don't have to make them. And that hopefully we'll be able to change are skins to. And hopefully be able to have mods!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|THi sis one of my favoirite movies.  It will make you think about faith and life beyond our small little planet.
0812550706|2.0|Well, I read Ender's Game for the first time when I was 12 years old. I loved it. I thought that it was great. Partially because my dad recommended it, partially because I thought that it wa interesting, and partially because the best books that I had read at the time were Eragon by Christopher Paolini and Life Expectancy by Dean Koontz.<br />  Ah, the good old days when I wasn't such a book snob. I'm now 15, and I just reread Ender's Game. I was more disappointed than I thought that I would be. I read a bunch of Card's books, and I realized that he is far from the perfect writer. I read Speaker for the Dead, half of Xenocide (which was just too boring to finish. I tried.), Ender in Exile, Ender's Shadow, Shadow if the Hegemon, and half of Shadow Puppets, which was also too boring to finish.<br />  Anyways, I noticed a bunch of things in my reading, even the first time. Like, that Ender and his buddies are completely unrealistic. We're supposed to believe that these kids adults, with the emotional and mental development of adults, just in the bodies of and with the memories of children. Speaking of which, did they really have to be naked all that much?<br />  One of my biggest problems is that their life is not that hard! Ask any genius kid if he'd like to go to a school filled with kids just as smart as him, in space, fight in zero-gravity chambers with laser guns, training to save the world, without ever having to be worried about being truly bored. Do you think he'd say no? I, personally, think he'd say hell yeah! I would. Why do they complain?<br />  As all of the one star reviews say, the side plot was weak, silly, unnecessary, and uninteresting. I think that I'd rather watch paint dry than listen to Peter and valentine. No one I going to take over the world thought the nets. Honestly, why a silly idea. I'm not just being close-minded here, I swear. Any time that something gets written online it either gets overlooked, or called stupid In a million different ways by a million different people. All of the characters are so far past not real people that the whole thing is silly. Peter isn't evil, anyways, and Valentine is nothing close to a saint.<br />  Card tells you things, instead of showing you in Ender's Game. He tells you about Enders friendships, but you can't see it. He tells you that Peter is evil, but you can't see it. He tells you that Ender has a back story, but we're not allowed to see that either. The parents religion, too. Same thing.<br />  I have a lot to say about Cards other books, but I won't go into it on here. All that I can say is; Read Ender's Shadow if you didn't love Ender's Game but you'll still open your mind a little bit again. In it, he tries to fix his mistakes. The Bean in the shadow series is a different Bean than the one create in Ender's Game. Completely. But he's really cool and he's genetically altered to be something more than human, yet he's still more human than any of the Wiggins. He has a back story and everything.<br />  Just a little, barely matters tidbit. For those of you who have never experienced sleep-deprivation, you don't dream. Ever. The most rebellious time of your life is when you are asked to get up. You become stupid, depressive, giddy sometimes, and your body adjusts to whatever sleep you get, only the less you get the less intelligent you are. Card obviously doesn't really know this. Ender never would've had nightmares. He wouldn't have been able to, and he wouldn't have trouble going to sleep. He would just lie down and the sleep would instantly take him. Just putting that out there.<br />  I find some of what Card wrote creepy, pedophileish, violent, amateurish, and not even very well written to top it off. The whole thing was both rushed and drawn out at the same time somehow. I give it two stars, though, instead of one, because it was cool when I was twelve, and it was slightly interesting. Also, it didn't take very long to read and I got some enjoyment out of it. I hope you don't overlook all of the negative comments. They have truth.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|thank you toughest men i ever read about i felt like i got to no you four thanks for sharing this story and god bless america
B000SJJCX4|5.0|Buy it !  you will not disappoint at all.  Once you try it you will quit Boss.<br />This is my truth. the price is super low.  People use to say &#34;you get what you pay&#34; but in this case it is not true.<br />You will get more than you pay when you buy this stuff from Behringer.<br />Grand Rapids, Michigan 2013
B001LO0TRI|2.0|The story itself  was vey good. The end of this novel and the series was rather very anticlimatic and dull.  I still suggest reading the series but don't have your heart set on an amazing ending.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Great and hilarious movie! Jamie Foxx was absolutely unexpectedly funny! Overall, some terriffic raunchy disrespectful writing that the kids shouldnt be caught dead watching!
B004JQN4WM|5.0|We have several Papo and Safari dinos and I have to say the Papo ones are definitely more realistic. I'm buying them for a 3 year old though so he doesn't care as long as they key features are correct. The paint job on the Papos is definitely more precise and detailed though.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Cant wait till the next one comes out starring Gary Oldman! Commissioner Gordon vs. Apes? Thats gonna be awesome... oops, this was supposed to be areview about this! Sorry! Great movie!
1426308469|5.0|Each page has a colorful pic of a dino and a few fun facts about it. My 3 year old loves it!
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|When I saw that \\"Villanova Junction Blues\\" was going to be on this CD, I thought, great, someone's finally getting the good stuff out and hopefully sonically improved.  Seeing that there's only a 1:45 excerpt from an epic 27+ min. blues jam, with Jimi incredibly fertile with ideas, is something that can only be described as idiotic, dunderheaded, clueless.  For the really great Hendrix material not yet officially released, I highly recommend \\"Hendrix By Night; Blues Album Outtakes\\" (which features all of \\"Villanova\\" + 6 other dynamite tracks for 74 min.; \\"Message From Nine To The Universe\\" (the great Larry Young jams); \\"Axis Outtakes\\"; \\"The Wildest Thing Here\\" (Cleveland 3/26/68); \\"Truth And Emotion\\" (studio tracks and the great San Diego '69 show); \\"Stockholm Concert\\" (both shows from '69) -- and there's lots more, put together by enthusiasts who love the music and know the proper way to present it.  By the way, every Hendrix fan should also be familiar with Mike Bloomfield (esp. the first and \\"East/West\\" albums by the Butterfield Blues Band) and \\"Hoodoo Man Blues\\" by Junior Wells which features Buddy Guy in his prime.  Happy listening, everyone.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|This dino is super cool! I bought it for my 3 year old so I was a little worried about the pokey wings but it's actually kind of rubbery.
B002RSQGQK|3.0|I guess I've just been too programed with contemporary movies to appreciate this as much as when it was released.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I loved this story.  It was very inspiring.  I thought it dealt with many issues.  I would highly recommend it to my friends.  We had a Bible study on this movie at our church.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Weird movie!  Can't get into sci-fi mixed with erroneous politics!  It had a cinematic value however, that was all for me.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very heart-wrenching, yet heart-warming.  Wonderful story telling and development of characters.  Reminds me of a Maeve Binchy novel, on a more serious note.  (Not to say that there wasn't plenty of humor as well!)
B005KELQEU|5.0|enjoyed the series very much. do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do ok
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and interactive game for kids.  My daughter loves playing this game and enjoys keeping her horses fed and trained.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|wife was happy with the gift. She enjoyed it. to to to to too to to to to to to
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|I didnt really care for this game. It wasn't completely clear on how to play at first. But when i got the hang of it it just wasnt fun.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put it down! This was one of the best series I have ever read. I am glad that I bought these books!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good family film. My children and I enjoyed the move. It was a neat original feature. Also, very, very funny
1616550414|5.0|It's filled with so many concept designs of so many characters. It's in depth on roles certain character play, worth every penny. I wont regret adding this to my Zelda collection. :)
B005VPRF0M|4.0|We bought this for our Lego-obsessed son (he's 6).  The set was challenging enough that he had to ask for help a few times, but no so challenging that he was frustrated.  Plus, it's Batman...so of course it's awesome.  Lots of cool detail.  The only reason why I didn't give it a &#34;5&#34; is because the Bat-plane has a tendency to break, which can be pretty annoying when you're a kid and you're trying to play with it.  Otherwise, we have no complaints!  A good buy at a pretty decent price!
0060531053|4.0|I ordered this for my son, but somehow got it on the list he wanted when it was already actually a book he has. So I kept it for myself. I don't actually anticipate doing any home brewing, but read it so I would be able to hold a better conversation with him about his hobby. I found the reading easy and informative. Both my son and a friend of mine's son who also home brews highly recommend this book from the brewing standpoint. I enjoy the brews both of them make so assume the book is also useful for actual brewers as well as this interested bystander.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I didn't know about Fringe before it premiered and by the time I learned about it, too many episodes had aired. I LOVED the 1st season, and all the rest. I couldn't wait to begin season 2.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|Whenever I'm using the auto calibrate function, a lot of the time my x axis is inverted. If that could be taken care of, I'd have no reservations about giving this a five star rating.<br /><br />myTouch 4G
B009738XXM|4.0|It is surprisingly good. I was not expecting it this good. A A A A A A A A A
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Love Gavin DeGraw! This CD is great and love that it came with a stripped CD. Follow Through is one of the songs on our wedding DVD so hearing it brings back many fond memories!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This is a very good CD, she wrote and sang the songs and all of them are equally pleasing to listen.
1451695195|5.0|The near-death first hand experience by a neurosurgeon is clinically described as well as his journey through the &#34;unknown&#34;.<br />This is a very inspiring reading that leaves you in a state of spiritual peace.
B000YDE43C|5.0|Most comfortable boots I've owned.  Seem to be well made...time will tell. Had to get one size smaller than I normally wear.  I think they look great.
B004OZZ624|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, we enjoyed it!  Good acting and pretty fast paced towards the end.  Worth the time to watch.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just can't get enough of this show!! I started watching it on netflix, and now i'm hooked. I suggest you buy this show. You won't regret it!!!
B000I9U9A4|4.0|We liked this movie very much!  Never saw it when it originally came out, so we're a little behind :)  Excellent acting.
1439156816|5.0|You really can't say enough about Stephen King. The man knows how to write, and with his memoir/guide, simply called &#34;On Writing,&#34; he shares his knowledge and love of the craft. Its worth reading regardless if you're interested in becoming an arthur, or if your just a fan of his fiction.
B003XU02QG|3.0|A Roman legion runs into a tough competitor in the Pict clan in the quest for world domination.  Lots of fighting, some reminiscent of the movie 300 but in my opinion there was a more realistic feel. Decent acting as well by Fassbender and West.  Worth a watch.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|The book was heartbreaking and funny.  The character portrayals seemed right on target.  I couldn't put it down.  The best of all of his books.
B007712XAU|5.0|The DVD order arrived on time and was packaged well.  This is a very well produced series. Job well done on placing this order.
B0094K1K42|4.0|Not great, but notable for its biting humor and a sobering performance by Charlize Theron.  Plus good work by Patton Osvalt.
B00A7OJ0DC|2.0|Just a quick heads up, this isn't a review about the movie, this is a review about the DVD/BLU-RAY itself. The movie is fantastic<br /><br />Very disappointed with the bonus features with this Disc.it only has a barely making of wreck-it ralph and a special pause feature.<br /><br />But no commentary! There's commentary on the deleted scenes but not on the movie itself. Very disappointed with you Disney.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for a free game!  Very fun and even teaches responsibility. Graphics are also very nice! Sister and I both love it.
B000I14UTS|5.0|This is one of the 10 best movies ever made: in the same class as 'Citizen Kane'. Something more than an allegory about the end of an era and the beginning of another and why it happens. If it's true that history repeats itself; that there is nothing new under the sun, than this is truly a movie for our time. Bob Fosse is too much of an artist not to see the dynamics of this reality. See it and learn.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Anyone who enjoys Sparks`s romantic story books will enjoy this fast read.  The introduction of Jo adds a bit of mystery especially towards the end.<br /><br />Wonder why the author included Jo?
1419705849|4.0|This book is great, but an extremely short read. I am in 7th grade, and I finished the book while I was at Barnes and Nobel. It is not as good as the first books, but still a fun read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|For me, the die hard S.Ws fan, this...is....too..cool..I have it on my Kindle Fire so its cool to see/watch/play. Totally kid friendly
B008G12EUY|5.0|This is just as awesome as the regular CD.  The music and special effects of the DVD are awesome.  Great Buy.  Love these guys.  They are the best.
B008PNBU30|5.0|With this album, you get a little bit of every emotion, and you feel it in every song and can hear it in Adam's vocal performance. I highly recommend this to anyone especially those who have never heard 3dg.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Awsome!!! Game play is great! The graphics are in fact, excellent for mobile gaming.  No stuttering on this game. Best game ever! This game hs many levels of game play. Additionlly, it has many different ways to play.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm typically not a fan of fantasy or medieval fiction, but this book certainly kept my attention! Modern must read.
B007WPM7SO|3.0|An interesting story, but overall I was not a big fan of the movie.  Too many flashbacks.  This was supposed to be a great love story, but after leaving her husband, for her lover, she goes right back to him when her lover goes to war.  He ends up with her sister? And a seven year old daughter who he doesn't seem to want.  Just an okay movie.  Nothing great and a lot of the dialogue was delivered in whispers that, I guess, passes for acting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so fun and i recommend this app  i love it so much :)  get this app you wont regret it i promise
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! It was a wonderful love story. I could not put it down. Suggest it for all love story fans.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|The CD's skip, jump and malfunction!!  It all started with the 4th season.  After I addressed my matter with the seller, now the ALL do it!!  So, I can't watch any of the CD's on any of the seasons without it skipping all the way to the end.  I horrific purchase made worse by the fact that they wouldn't even exchange it because (as it turned out) I watched them at my leasure and it took me past the warranty period.....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching it when it first came out but when the first season was over I kind of forgot about it. I saw the advertisement on tv and watched one show, now I'm hooked!!
1400049628|5.0|A great practical guide for when the dead rise. Easy steps for preparation and implementation of your own personal zombie survival plan.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Fun for the whole family! My kids love playing it! I love the glow, the option to change the pucks and just about everything about it. Thank you for a great product!
B002GAR3AM|4.0|With all that has happened I was hoping for a better ending.  What happens to Max, Bette and Tina, Kit and Helena, and Alice and Tasha?  Just a lot of unknowns and now we will never know. :-(
B00B99KJR0|5.0|simple addictive game. just like the computer match 3 games .  this game is well worth the money. I really enjoy this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great when I'm home sick and I don't have any thing to do I help me bourse thanks dog
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|Be aware that there are hidden charges. The game is free, but the teensiest scoops are $1.99, along with other items within the game.
B002HML756|5.0|I really wasn't expecting this movie to be very good; it was made way back in the 1990s and features James Garner, so I guess I anticipated something about as intense as an episode of Maverick.<br />To my surprise it featured some pretty darn good acting and some very disturbing alien abduction scenes. I made the mistake of watching it right before bedtime, and I tossed and turned all night while having nightmares about being chased by aliens. Don't let your kids watch it unless you want them jumping into bed with you.
1616550414|5.0|Quite possibly one of the greatest books written about one of the greatest video game series of all time. Wish it would cover more of the 8bit-16bit era games, but other than that this book is amazing!!
0307477479|4.0|A visit from the goon squad By Jennifer Egan is entertaining and at times an intellectually and emotionally challenging book. It chronicles several characters and there intertwining lives through different time periods. Some characters are more compelling than others and some you may want to know more about, but ultimately are passed up. Either way Egan's book is worth reading if you want a quick read with good character development woven together in a non-literal way. With short space, Egan describes enough of her characters to make one feel for them and the predicaments they find themselves in. Sometimes the connections may seem too much of a coincidence for one looking for straight realism, but this is also a testament of Egan's ability to weave detail and character over many situations and time periods. If you are looking for some grand plot or really any over arching story line one may not be totally found, but the atmosphere of loneliness, desire for human connection, and redemption is created and felt. Finally, there has been a lot of banter about chapter 12, the power point chapter. This isn't nearly as difficult to read as many say and an interesting format attempt. It may not be something I would want to read a whole book in, but none the less its fine for a chapter. Furthermore, I believe it is suppose to be written from the point of view of a slightly autistic child. This power point presentation makes sense if the child would find it easier way to present a story this way than traditional narrative.
0439023521|5.0|It was an easy read, it carried you from beginning to finish. left you with the urge to get the net book
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|one of the best pictures I have seen in a very long time and I have seen a lot in the [ast 40 years. The story is wonderful and should have won &#34;Best Picture&#34; this year at the academy awards. the ending is one of the best scenes.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|Same as previous review. This was a present for my nephews. It arrived on time and was well packaged .
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I downloaded this app on my Samsung tablet and my kids love it so when it became available for Kindle Fire we were happy.  Unfortunately it after we installed it we haven't been ablento get it to open.  It gets to the end of the load bar and either sits there or closes.  I now have a very disappointed 5year old.
B000NJXG6S|3.0|I got this for a really good price so I'm not too upset about it but there are some discs in season 2 that started to skip because they were a little scratched. Packaging wasn't in great condition either since it was used but still all in one piece so it's fine.
B004HD61KE|4.0|While this type of drama/action story is not my usual it is a good book with a lot of fact and actual history woven in.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book!!!! Clary and Jace rule!!!!! I cannot eat to see the movie and read the second one!!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Action, explosions, superheroes, bad one liners. Pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />I need more words. Word word word word word.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book has got to be one of the best books I have ever read. The story it's self is heart wrenching and beautiful all at once. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|when I first got the app I thought it would be a rip off but I really love the grafics and the ziplines are amazing! get the app! will not regret!
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Cool book Hugh hi by hi vBulletin kindle oh oh he vBulletin vs  typically by rd by by by tv
B001L2APH4|5.0|I love Tom Petty's style of music, but the fact that I got 15 songs on the &#34;Echo&#34; CD was wonderful! That is just music to my ears! Haha
B005KELW26|4.0|This case came today, and I really like it. It was supposed to come yesterday, but it didn't. You should get this case, the price is worth the price.
B005T87QCI|1.0|You have to pay extra to create your own robot, or to unlock any of the good robots? I already paid for the game, should not have to pay again!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am in love with this book. Be warned: you will cry. A lot. John Green is such a talented author.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a load of fun only down side is pop up apps come up all the time but other than that I love it.
B00006FI51|1.0|Does not play in any DVD player. It just opens right back up to eject it. My son was very disappointed since he was looking forward to watching.
B003DTLUFO|5.0|Got this little nendroid for my anime crazy 12 yr old,lol.  Was nervous about all the talk of bootleg products out there.  No need to worry, I purchased this adorable little figurine from the Casual Collector, and she is perfect from her awesome accessories, to her authentic packaging which we kept.  If your a nendroid collector, please check out Casual Collector, I also got the Hatsune Miku and was doubly pleased.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I  have had a death experience. myself .<br /> and was wondering what other people were like.<br />I am glad a Dr has had the experience. it was for me a great feeling knowing  that there is a  Beautiful peaceful place.<br />after death. and that the one we lose. are in a better place. hopefully Doctors try to open there mind a little bit. and listen to there Patience a little more I have also had a out of body experience. told the doctor every thing that was going on what i heard and he looked at me and said okay. started to walk a way. he turned around  looked at me and said no,no hum and walked away
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have only been playing My Horse for a few days.  The game is entertaining, the only problems that I have with it is the choices of horse breeds they chose for the game, for the most part Quarter Horses are not the choice of horse for show jumping. your horses body types look more like the warm bloods that would be in this arena than the Quarter Horse.  And the touch response on some of the screens is slow.  Otherwise it is enjoyable. :)
0451232852|4.0|Wonderful tour through history pre-WWI as well as an exciting story of several lives on both sides of the war.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Classic story. It sounded like it'd be a good solid &#34;base&#34; for a movie. But no.  BORING. And I mean booooooring.  I'm a fan of Kristen Stewart. I think she's very pretty and was looking forward to seeing her in a costume drama. NOPE. Dull colored rags . BORING.  Charlize Theron was BEAUTIFUL in this movie but that wasn't enough to keep it interesting for ME.  I wanted to like this movie. I enjoy fantasy themes, they relax my brain.  :)  But Snow White and The Huntsman I can't recommend at all. Sorry.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I felt this book was great because of the detail about life in a small town and the secrets therein. Flynn does a great job of drawing the reader in and making them part of the drama. As with her other novels, I had no idea what revelation awaited me in the final pages.
B0019IIPZO|5.0|It's just a good Vin Diesel movie.  Riddick is so cool. Vin Diesel is so gorgeous.  ;O  I love the way Riddick looks out for Jack. To watch the interaction between them is worth the price of the movie to me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had my doubts about this show, having seen Upstairs/Downstairs in the 1970's.  But, having recently watched a few Upstairs/Downstairs episodes, I have to say, even allowing for 40 plus years of improved technology, Downton Abbey is better.  The story lines are more interesting.  The Lord of the Manor having an American wife adds a twist.  Every cast member (current and departed) is perfectly suited and give outstanding performances.  Wonderful insight into the English gentry in the early 1900's.  Can't wait for Season Four.
1476729719|5.0|This is a should read for everyone!<br />There is a lesson to be learned from this book!<br />There should be a way for bullying to be stopped!

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|really had a blast playing this game. cant wait for more. this game has a good story and graphics are decent too. please give this one a chance you will be amazed. great mini games and object hunting too.
1451695195|2.0|Proof of Heaven; a Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife, was mostly an egotistic journey into extraneous details of a man's life and his thoughts.  It would have been more honest to title the book, Proof of Nothing; an Egotist's Soliloquy of Special Greatness.  If the book had presented itself as a fiction novel, I might have appreciated it because it was a good story, inasmuch as it was a well written account of a great man with a great life that was being mortally threatened.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander describes his experience and an NDE, a Near Death Experience.  Based on his own accounting, I claim that it was not actually an NDE.  He was still alive, albeit in a very compromised state of existence.  His heart did not stop; his functions did not cease. He still had brain activity, which was responsible for his being alive, not dead.  Dead is when all system functions stop, including all brain activity.  NDEs do not last for days; they last for minutes; Although, sometimes, a body can last for hours under certain conditions, e.g., immersion in very cold water.<br /><br />There was far too much accounting of himself and his life, in a book that was supposed to be about the afterlife.  A little accounting of his life would have nicely salted the story, but his accounting was like pouring the contents of the entire salt shaker on it.<br /><br />This is an area (NDEs) that I have studied for the past few years.  I am certainly not an expert on all things like the good Doctor, but I am a reasonably intelligent and discerning individual.  It seems that he did not experience an NDE; rather, he might have experienced a metaphysical, or spiritual, encounter with beings or entities in another realm.  Perhaps, because it was not an NDE, he was not able to leave his body and mind behind, in order to purely experience the phenomenon.  In other words, his functioning body and mind inhibited his experience.  This might explain the vagueness of his accounting of the \\"afterlife,\\" as he claims.<br /><br />As a novel, perhaps fiction, it is very good.  As an accounting of the afterlife, it is a disappointment, a bait and switch that got me to buy a book on a false premise.e,\\" as he claims.<br /><br />As a novel, perhaps fiction, it is very good.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was a really creepy read. I had a hard time putting it down. I did however have a hard time connecting to the main character. He just wasn't that easy for me to feel sympathetic with, but the action in the story was intriguing. The other reason I don't feel this deserves a full five stars is the ending. It tied up the loose ends, but it still didn't seem all that logical even if you believe all the science fiction in it. It was still a fun and worth the hours I put into reading it.
B001OSIV62|3.0|It was an interesting story, and it was good to see what really happened, as I do remember the event.  The movie was okay, probably a 3+.
143911000X|5.0|I love the show and in particular Neil Patrick Harris as Barney so when the opputunity came to buy a copy of the Bro Code i jumped at the chance. If taken literally it is infantile and male dominant but that is the way the character is in the show. After reading i felt it funny and well written almost like a constitution for men from the Barney perspective. If your looking for something that will make you smile while reading and possibly quoting later this is a safe bet to buy.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Great. Really loved video. TV Movie quality. Not bad at all. Looking forward to full length Halo film in the future.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is one of the best heatsinks I have used. I used it in a few gaming PCs I have built and it is great. It keeps the CPU running cool and its not that hard to install, though you need to remove the motherboard to install it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is only the 2nd full legnth movie that I've bought to download to my Kindle Fire. We had already seen it and my daughter kept asking to watch it again, so now she can watch it anytime, anywhere that she wants. It's just like all of the movies now, where there's funny things that the adults get and alot of things that kids like, so everyone is happy watching it. Lots of good actors as the characters and with Adam Sandler being Dracula, how can you not like it?
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of &#34;I Feel Better&#34;, but I absolutely love every other song on this album.  Gotye has a very unique sound--and I highly recommend listening to him with headphones/earbuds to fully appreciate the complexity of his music.  &#34;State of the Art&#34; is brilliant in this regard.  &#34;Easy Way Out&#34; is probably my favorite track (even though it's only two minutes long!), in part because it transitions directly into &#34;Somebody That I Used To Know&#34;, a very different song.<br /><br />Next on my &#34;To Do&#34; list...purchase his other album!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|My 4 year old wanted this because it's Hello Kitty. It's exactly the same as another game that we have (Cinderella Cafe), except for the characters. It was free, so that's great, but I don't like the fact that you have to use real money in order to buy more staff. Without the extra added staff, the game is just too hard. Even for me and I'm really good at Time Management games, lol. The only other thing that I wish that was different is that you have to wait for each thing to be done before you can start another since there's no queing of actions like in the &#34;Dash&#34; games.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This story will grab you and keep you entertained, making you wish there was such a circus coming to your town.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Interesting story, great special effects, colorful characters. No complaints. The Blu-ray has the movie and some bonus content included deleted scenes (the only extra content I care about). Good buy.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved 50 shades just wait until you get into this book. I could not put it down! Awesome!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|As the Twilight books were/are text only, that is what you will get, and all you will need, in this digital format. I wanted to own/read the novel, and that is what I got from this purchase. A good buy, I would do it again.
B004I744AS|5.0|This gives you so much more than just an old dusty book of words.  I love the horoscope and weather additions and check it daily.  An awesome way to start your day!
B0060D0SSK|5.0|A digital only copy of the movie that you can stream and watch at any time. Nothing wrong with that if you only want/need a digital copy without any extra/bonus content such as deleted scenes, audio commentary, etc. The movie itself isn't bad and has an interesting story that shows how civil cases can play out.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has everything you need as long as you (and your spouse) are willing to do the work! It opened my eyes to many things I was missing and the things that I had stopped doing and needed to be doing. Great read and full of insight to help you in your marriage or any relationship!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great collection of all of the episodes and some neat bonus content. Plus its in Blu-Ray format so the picture/sound quality is very good. Worth buying if you want to own the series.
1607066017|5.0|If you are looking for a new graphic novel or comic series to get into, I cannot recommend Saga highly enough. The story is compelling and original. The character designs and artwork are stunning. I can't get the next issue fast enough.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Interesting story, great special effects, colorful characters. No complaints. The Blu-ray has the movie and some bonus content including deleted scenes (the only extra content I care about). Good buy.
B009MO57H6|5.0|Again the series has been capped by another brilliant part. The storyline threded through all of the films has captivated the audiences who have watched them. I just hope there are still more films to come., They are brilliant.
B00433TO52|5.0|This is a really good collection as it has everything Shakespeare has written in a text only format that is stored digitally instead of in a big fat book on your shelf. Worth buying if you want to read one, some, or all of Shakespear's material.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A msterpiece. I have now seen all 3 of the Series & my Wife & I thoroghly enjoyed them all. The insight into what it was like to live oin the times before the 1st World War & the afterwards into the 1920's & beyond is so correct. The differences between the social standing of &#34;Above Stairs & Downstairs&#34; is brilliant & especially the standing of the staff below stairs. Only the British can make such a masterpiece. I would recommend anyone studying English History to watch the series, as it is a clear insight as to how life was lived in those turbulent times. The rise of the &#34;Irish Question&#34; (Freedom from British Rule) was well handled & showed the real start of the move to independance. Overall a wonderful series & should be enjoyed by many.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|This is a good purchase if you are looking for the original, complete and unedited, version of Caligula. Good story and good sets, but definitely not for kids. There are material/scenes that would be considered XXX rated in every country. If you don't want to see that sort of thing, instead look for an R rated version that will have edited them out.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|and I like the things in this album. Ordering on line and finding good stuff made my search and purchase quite simple.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|If you like Daria you'll be glad you bought this collection. It has all of the episodes from the series and the &#34;tv movies&#34; that they made after. Plus it has some bonus content that shows the actors who voiced the characters. Some viewers are worried about how they removed the orignal songs that aired when the show was first shown, but this is not at all an issue. This collection simply puts generic background music and songs in during scenes such as at a party or on the radio.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Very well done movie and of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins spruces up everything he stars in. He is a wonderful actor.  Highly recommend Seller for excellent product and prompt shipping. A good  movie to watch on a cold winter night.  I think you will enjoy this thriller.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|DVD as advertised, color was better than what was displayed on cable. Arrived quicker than expected, packaging was well done.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|This is a good movie, but one I only wish to see one time. Sorta a dark side to it, but this is my impression. Also has a saddness quality. Seller shipped very prompt and item in great condiiton. REcomment the seller to all.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this app but it wont let me get on it after I play it the first time. but everything else is perfect
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I woke up this morning and the App kept coming up saying &quot;Under Construction, we will be back soon.&quot; what does that mean? its unplayable right now? I just spent 5 bucks on your in store options, I want it back if i cant play!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|To much desert , not enought action. I was very disappointed. I really enjoyed the other books, Plum Island and Wild Fire
B005KELWJY|4.0|This a very sharp cover that protects my Kindle when it's not in use, and it also enables me to hold the Kindle like a regular book when I'm reading.  The only negative is that my Kindle sometimes locks up on me, and I have to remove it from the folio to allow the back of the Kindle to breathe and for the Kindle to cooperate with me again.
158270208X|5.0|This is my 3rd Secret Gratitude Book. It is great to write in every night and set my intentions. I feel good when I use it. The book is far superior to just writing in a notebook because it has little positive, unique sayings for each day/page to contemplate.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a cu t e game. My kids play it all the time. I'm not going to lie, I play it all the time. I rate this game a 4, only bc it takes a while to get up levels.
B005LAIISA|4.0|The movie is a little frightening at times.  NOT my favorite ice age movie but good.  will there be another?
B007ZXK08C|5.0|WOW!!  Excellent writing, fantastic storytelling. Part of me was appalled the other part had me laughing out loud [no mean feat!<br /> Writing that operates on many levels, the hollowing out of American society post financial crash, who is each individual in a marriage, who is acting for whose benefit and an absolute dissection of deviousness..... Brilliant!. Gillian  Flynn... keep writing.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Stays on repeat at home. Listen to this album while cooking and cleaning. A great buy. She just has an amazing voice
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game ever I play it all the time it is my favourite  game I it doesn't skip and there's no adds I am over 13
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I'm a huge L.Fank Baum fan and love this twisted version of Return to OZ. The OZ characters are haunting and strange. This was also one of my childhood fav movies in the 80's
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Some may say it's a knock off of temple run... and I used to think that too. But really, it's better than temple run. Maybe it's just me, but using your finger to move side to side is more comfortable than tilting the device.the graphics are more interesting...as where in temple run its just like the Sims graphics.and subway surfers is a world tour, which gives you the option of changing it up once in a while by updating the app. The latest update which is Rome, has the app exploding with favors and downloads, as did the previous update when it came out...which was Rio. I'm addicted.
0399250573|4.0|I loved the book. It was a great end to the Alex Rider series. I'm sad to see it go though, really enjoyed the books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so so awesome and cool and its . In Rome so it's very, very cool and very, very awesome
0062014536|3.0|This book had the absolute worst ending I could have ever imagined- in my personal opinion, of course. However, it was written well up until that point.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I purchased AVG AntiVirus for my phone and  Tablet works good , I like the way it scans anything i download and lets me know if its safe.
B008VBYN80|2.0|seems like a really fun game, i just don't have the patience or time to play it how it should be played? - also didn't like the constant barrage of ads and, like other gameloft games, the constant pressure to &#34;purchase&#34; in game items with diamonds - that cost real moneys!  that's crazy!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key---<br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was very well written.<br />The story line was very touching and heart-warming.<br />I definitely would recommend this book.
0062082353|5.0|The author &#34;speaks&#34; his mine and uses language that those who have served understand and have used. As a leader he didn't forget the basics: &#34;Lead By Example&#34;. He saved &#34;lives&#34; of soldiers and marines for it was what he had trained to do.<br /><br />An awesome book. Excellent reading.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Amazing story.  This is a book I never would have picked up on my own but it was highly recommended by a friend.  I was riveted from the beginning and couldn't put it down.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The author really makes the reader understand the importance of leadership and the role of the leaders above his team. Yet, the team carried their mission to the best of their ability understanding the reality that each one of them could lose his life. At the same time, the reader learn the not all Afgan's are bad people. This I see as a plus for Afganistan. The author also added a sense of humor which made the reading more enjoyable. The sadest part was the &#34;fairwell&#34; to his fellow BROTHERS.<br /><br />A must read book even for high school students.<br /><br />Mr. V
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book!!<br />I would recommend this book to any women.<br />I Couldn't put it down, read it in one day.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wrote a 5 star review of the first story in the saga.  Even so, I was a little nervous to read further.<br /><br />The poignant ending of that introduction to Mr. Howey's work left me thinking about the many issues with which his crafted world dealt.  So many authors would have followed that story with a tidy conclusion and heavy-handed morality that would have left me disappointed.<br /><br />Mr. Howey did not disappoint.  His opinions are clear, but the questions are left open.  He allowed his characters to grow and learn throughout the book, taking his readers along for the journey.<br /><br />Buy this book!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Put this in a new Micro-ATX system and it cranks!  Much better than I though it might be.  Win7 experience 7+ with SSD.  You won't regret buying this one!  But try to put it on a good Mini-ITX Motherboard, they were made for each other.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|They did it again, sometimes a series will start to go all wrong but this is the best long run series I have seen
0553213105|5.0|Un capolavoro, capace di farti comprendere bene la societ&agrave; del tempo e le sue intricatissime fisime psicologiche.<br />Bisogna sempre calarsi nel \\"tempo\\" della scrittrice, altrimenti gi&agrave; dall'incipit sull'eleggibilit&agrave; dello scapolo si potrebbe fare l'errore di giudicare la societ&agrave; come superficiale.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game! I absolutely love it!  it makes me think of school days, playing in the lab in the 3rd grade!!!
B00138F4OK|5.0|Love every track. Just the sound of a certain song makes me want to challenge myself in the gym or in life.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|I gave this to my husband as a gift and he went crazy over the extra pages and even the centerfold that even told who all of the people are. Great but!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It was a fun read. I did not know it was a kids/young adult book when I bought. I am neither but did enjoy the story.
0765325950|5.0|I waited so long for this book, yet when it finally came I have to admit I was really sad. These characters that we've spent so long with were finally going away. The ending was brilliantly written, Brandon Sanderson did a fantastic job. You won't be disappointed with how it all comes together.
B004ODLUGM|3.0|Bought the sequel, Garuffalo's Child, first.  The story is just a bit better.  My grandsons want to watch the second movie more than once, no so with the first movie.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|this product was g r e a t i l o v e i t a l o t !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought it was a book for teenagers. After I read on I just had a hard time putting it down, and I'm certainly no teenager!  You will have a hard time too I'm sure.  It's a book I'll be sure to read again.
B000683VI4|5.0|this product was g r e a t i l o v e i t a l o t !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very very cool, unlike other pet games. This game is really addicting, I would really reccommend this game .
B0009W5JS2|5.0|this product was g r e a t i l o v e i t a l o t !
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|What an anjoyable picture!  Interesting characters in situations they create for us.  Lots of fun watching them, particularly Hitchcock himself, work their ways out of them.  And there's a happy ending to boot.  No need for guns and bombs and people being blown to pieces.  Just an interesting story well-told and superbly acted.
B00009L1TA|5.0|this product was g r e a t i l o v e i t a l o t !
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I have always loved Milan an I was glad I could see it once more for a low price I wish it was free then I'd really love it
B00003CY0V|5.0|this product was g r e a t i l o v e i t a l o t !
B00BHMETKC|5.0|love ben affleck and he acted really good in this movie.  loved the fact that it was a true story.
B00005JNTX|5.0|this product was g r e a t i l o v e i t a l o t !
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|One of DC's best animated films to date! If you were a fan of the book, then this is a must see!
0060763280|5.0|Great book to read if you want a millionaire mind set and a whole new way of thinking. You don't have to agree with everything, but it will open you up to new possibilities.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|A very honest account of the author's military and personal life. At times very exciting and at other times somewhat disturbing. It is very troubling that he came through such imminent danger only to be killed by a fellow American. Chris Kyle was a very skilfull sniper and his accounts are as graphic as only first-hand experience can dictate, but his actual writing leaves a lot to be desired. God Bless His Spirit!
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|i wish the vocal in this vocal album were louder, but other than that its great.worth the money. Great listen.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I enjoyed reading it but it was not my favorite book. I think the movie will be better because you will be able to see more of the feelings that words are hard to describe.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  It was informative, yet kept my interest throughout the entire book.  I did not know that Toy Story and Pixar were creations of this complex man.  He was truly a genius, surly, eclectic, and did not appear to possess a filter of any kind.  It is crazy to discover the man, and the company behind all the many things that I now take for granted.  I remember all of the different variations of the Mac, IPod, ITunes, and IPad.  these are products that have changed my life.  These inventions/creations have also had a profound affect and effect on society at large.  I am talking about the book to anyone who is willing and able to listen.  I was so glad that I took the advice of all the reviewers when it came to this book.  I would've liked more photos, but I saw plenty of photos over the years in Time, Newsweek, Wired, etc.  thank you for writing this book and for having the patience and the honesty to stay with Jobs throughout the entire process.  He doesn't sound like an easy man to work with.  Again, great read and I highly recommend.  What an interesting man and what a great book.  Thanks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a good game 2 play if Ur bored or if u just want 2. U can earn points And get games with the FREE points u earn. Definitely get this! All u have 2 do is play a game (anyone u want), then once u lose, u earn the points, u can either reach the minimum amount of points 2 complete or not, but either way, u get points, and if u have enough points 2 unlock a different game, u can. GREAT GAME, GET IT!
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|The construction is very solid and once it is calibrated it works very well. That being said, calibration is very frustrating.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very enjoyable and hard, keeps you going.  Graphics very good and soundtrack is also good. All in all, one to own.
1609611543|5.0|Welcomed this book so much and have found it so helpful it is a nice addition to our cookbooks and home library.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game, it makes you think. I hope a lot of people get this game. This is one of the best games I have.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Now this was a gotta have for me. Couldn't wait for this to hit the theaters. And yes I'm biased as far as the Alien / Preditor franchise goes. But this , this beats them all as far as I'm concerned. Now I know the scientist were all kinda loony and unprofessional , but hey, they took their helments off too soon. If you never saw any of the other in this series I would recommend<br />seeing this one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon is just...wow!  Love him.  If I am honest, I still like the Fifty books better, but that is because I don't find them as similar as some readers.  Yes you have a rich alpha male with a dark past...but too me that is where most of the similarities end.  Will you enjoy it if you like the Fifty series...yes.  Other way around...not sure as Christian Grey is more in the dom lifestyle than Gideon.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I first saw this in SD and liked it. I have now seen it in Blu-Ray. It is a stunning visual experience. Also there is enought action to keep you satified and a good story to boot. I would definately recommend this.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Easy to use and practical, fits any bike and fits any mobile phone. Good quality vs price. I recommend thid product.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Intriguing mix of fact and fiction.  Thoroughly enjoyed the journey.  Mr. Rollins, where are you leading next?  This was fun!!!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. I love the fact I can battle other players from my facebook. I also love that I do not need wick for it.
B00A861QMM|3.0|My daugher  put it on my Kindle when she gave it to me. cound never get to much on. Sorry
B002APU580|1.0|The film has a nice score but the script is terrible and making one of the most loved characters in literature with a snarky kiera knightly is a crime
B0063GORYU|1.0|Was not the game I looking for. I do not like games I have to think so much. So Sorry
B001FB563E|5.0|The Road is an adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy book of the same name. Readers of McCarthy will know already that this is not a man interested in making the reader feel good. The movie is surprisingly faithful to that, which is probably why it is unwatchable for the majority of the American audience. It's just too grim for a culture looking for tear jerking reunions and happy go lucky adventures. However, if you are willing to watch a movie that will not make you feel good, this is that movie. It's stunning in every way, from visual to soundtrack, to the acting by Viggo Mortensen, who is as usual, completely committed to his role.<br /><br />Watch it, feel depressed, go buy yourself an ice cream, and repeat.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|Very well written. Typical British humour from start to finish. I bought the movie Paul at the same time and loved that too. There is great comedic chemistry between Frost and Pegg.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It has no glitches and you can get a lot of power ups for free really I enjoy the game. I like it better than temple run and fun run.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book by a great guy.  Awesome!!!  We need more men like Mr Kyle in this world!  It's a must read!
B00BCA29WY|4.0|Hypnotic and catchy. I enjoyed more than I thought I would. I hope this group does more work in the future. They have a lot of potential.
B000SFJWLU|4.0|Mostly what I expected. Over all, an incredible band. I will be purchasing their other CDs!  You should try it.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Good movie for the story line of the franchaise. A little over the top in places, but all late action flicks are.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a great game.. I get lost in this game and end up playing it for hours.. So addicting, even have my kids playing.
B00000DFKF|5.0|I love this CD the music is awesome!! More black metal that I so enjoy!! Given that I have bought quite a few black metal cds lately from amazon because of my love of extreme metal!!! Absolutely awesome!!! And my expectations? Wow and beyond!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!
020530902X|4.0|Rule thirteen is the kernel of gold in this slim book:  \\"Omit needless words.\\"  All other rules that Strunk and White include simply expand on this idea and emphasize clarity.<br /><br />A writer shouldn't feel shackled by the ideas contained in this book; it should set them free -- much as a jazz soloist is set free knowing the rules of good music.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the trilogy...it left me wanting more. I hope there is another book soon. I can't wait to start reading another book.
B004S3MB2U|3.0|This is the calculator I use all the time; it's on my device, and I don't have to carry anything else around.  It's functional, I like the way it's laid out, and it has most of the features I need.  The RPN implementation works well, and is a joy to use.  I jumped at the chance to get it as a FAOTD after using the 'free / lite' version for quite some time.  If I need a more powerful calculator, I reach for one of my HP's -- but that's becoming a rare occurrence.<br /><br />So, Why do I rate it only three stars?<br /><br />First, It usually works when I'm not web-connected.  But there are times when I'm not, and it seems the DRM-check is activated, and the user is tasked with waiting for the check to complete before using.  That's a usability problem.<br /><br />Second, it uses a 'recording macro' feature to help automate calculations -- but it's limited to only one macro.  If you need to regularly do two or more types of calculations, then this app isn't the one for you.  And the macro feature doesn't really make this into a programmable calculator; keystroke playback is only one aspect of having a functional 'programmable' calculator.  I understand the app isn't marketed as 'programmable', but I am frustrated by the hint of programming without full implementation.<br /><br />Last -- and this is more of a 'wish' than a problem -- I'd like to have the ability to create a custom layout for frequently-used functions:  I often have to switch between the scientific/engineering layout, the statistical layout, and even the financial calculations.  Yes, a simple swipe is all that's needed to get there -- but a custom layout could be oh-so-much-more efficient and productive.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|A great game and a great port.  The new content not only enhanced the storyline but allowed for a deeper understanding of the characters.  Not to mention some great comments!  Marie-san is awesome!  The vita features were used interestingly and the wifi was helpful in tougher dungeons, especially in the beginning.  All in all a great addition to a great game.  Can't wait for Persona 5 now!
0895292211|2.0|I was hoping for readability. Instead, all I got was page after page of incredibly boring statistics and charts with the apparent aim of impressing his readers. Well, this is one he didn't.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I didn't think I would like it,  but too much fun not to like. A great way to pass time and love the fact that its free.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The show is well written and the actors are every good.It is never boring.like the gag alsowould like to see longer gag reel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg.best game ever.<br /><br />I am glad that Amazon Dosent have lite version,because if you find diamonds,you can't even MINE them.you know, it's also great for passing time.me and my brother always join each others game and have so much fun together.at fist I find of thought that it was ridiculous for it to be $7.00,but is worth it.on other thing I hate is that a lot of people make spins off of minecraft.for one instance,survival craft.it is HORRIBLE and should of never Ben made.and,I mean,people look.things like survival craft,don't by the full version of that.by the full version of minecraft instead.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is even better reading the second time. Can't wait for the movie. Now on to the end of the trilogy!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My boyfriend and I are making plans to get married and it definitely helped us understand each other better! This book is great for married couples and couples that are still just dating. It gives you a lot of insight on things you need to know and didn't already know about your relationship and your significant other.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|After spending way too much time installing other calendar apps on my Kindle Fire HD in the hope of syncing with my Google calendar I broke down and bought this. Well worth the money. Great features, easy to use and a really solid app
B00A4AHZZO|5.0|This eight-disc box set is arguably a little slice of heaven for the Klemperer completist, but even those not so devoted to that conductor who are more than just casual listeners may want to pick this up. When it comes to big band Mozart, I must admit that my own preference is for the vintage recordings of Karl Bohm with the Berlin (not Vienna) Philharmonic. Klemperer, however, proves himself at times to be Bohm's equal, particularly in the older renditions in this box. The set contains duplications: There are recordings of Symphonies Nos. 29, 38-41 and Eine kleine Nachtmusik from both the 50s and the 60s. In just about all cases, the earlier performances are noticeably superior. (Though they are mono recordings, those older versions come off well in comparison with the 60s ones with respect to sound -- the later recordings sound a bit muddy to me, frankly.) There are also a handful of overtures, as well as the Serenata notturna and Gran Partita and Masonic Funeral Music, all played in classic old school manner. And, countering a common trend in bargain box packaging, there is a booklet which includes details on recording sessions. As I implied at the start, the more casual listener may not care to get this set: If you want big band Mozart, pick up the Bohm Berlin recordings -- they are more or less complete and the sound is much better. And if you want period performances, you already know to stay away from this one. For me, those 1950s recordings are more than worth the price of this excellently produced set.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This book truly embraces the concept of being YOU and how to be better at what it is we all seem to be in the business of doing - moving others. Great examples, tips, and concepts will help you to listen, think, and serve those around you. I highly recommend this book (and Qualtrics - see chapter 1).
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|This is competent music from the 1980s. The good songs are good the bad songs are bad. Overall it's a good album but not outstanding like something from Aerosmith or the Who.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love love love this show and can't wait to see Season 4.  I definitely recommend it you won't be disappointed,
B009I2UH2W|5.0|It works as advertised. Materials appear durable. What more could you want? Except perhaps eight more words. Three, two, one.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Good book.  Very funny. A classic story from sesame street.  We love to read this story before bed!!!!  Worth it.
B000002KZ6|5.0|and still love to listen to this release.  this is my 3rd copy!  I gave a copy to my nephew to introduce him to this great band
0525478817|5.0|As a high school teacher, it has been an absolute pleasure to pass this book onto my students. The clever, passionate characters grab their attention from the start, and never let it go for more than 200 pages. Nothing helps young people with reading like a great book. Thank you, John Green.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|First time I used the serrated tool to sharpen a serrated knife the pointed tool broke....not cool. Great idea but cheaply made.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its an amazingly amazing!!!!!?!! I was automatically  addicted.  (this part is just because I need more words.) blab blab blab
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its very good because it has fast reflexes and I only crash when it is my fault. It is also fun to play with when I'm bored
B00917IQFY|5.0|Back when i was in college, the covers band I played in was always looking for new songs by Graham Parker and the Rumour and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes to play. It's always been fun, energetic music that you can't help but want to dance and sing along to. These guys aren't showy--if you want 4000 notes per measure in Mixolydian mode, buy an Yngwie Malmsteen CD. These guys are about the music--the songs are catchy, robust and fun. And on this disc, Parker even gets a little political, specifically with the song \\"Coathangers\\", about the consequences of criminalizing abortion. Some people dislike political messages in music but hey, we're all political animals, so why not write about it? I happen to agree with Parker on this issue, so I'm biased, but I say good for him for keeping the music real while standing for something at the same time. If any readers of this review are new to Parker's music, first of all, welcome and I hope you enjoy this discovery! Secondly, go back and check out two other releases which I think you'll also like: Squeezing Out Sparks and Stick to Me. This is just great rock and roll by a group of guys who feel to me like true believers: the Rumour isn't cranking out formulaic junk to make a buck. I think these guys are the real deal.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|DA chronicles a period of time that is recent enough to be compelling history.  There are lessons as well about the changing cultural values, and the characters are authentic.  The Elizabeth Gaskell series that predates this time period is something other viewers might like to see, as they make history come alive and they provide a sense of continuity that a person might not otherwise consider.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its fun as long as it doesn't crash when your tring to play and making you remove and redownload and lose all your game play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome I love running on top of trains and doing the challenge I also like collecting money I had alot of Money tnd I bought different things
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|Don't download, this is the worst game.  I highly unreccomend this game and I think both of them (leps world one and two) should be taken off the appstore. DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!
B001O3SSWY|5.0|If you have never seen the movie, you are missing out on a very important story of our history. The music is very emotionally moving, with piano and violin and orchestral music, all of which I enjoy.<br /><br />[...]
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I absolutely love this series. The quality of the DVD was good. It was wonderful to be able to get the DVD even though the shows were still airing on TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game except had over 100000 coins next time logged in had to start over. Very addicting game. When you start playing herd to quit.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My 6 year old loves this game but when I tried to purchase gems, nothing happened.  I tried to contact Amazon through email. Nothing.  So it was charged to my account and the money is gone and no gems.  Not so good.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|If you have an hp printer (or not?) that you have networked, this is essential for printing from android devices.  I never had to figure out how I was going to make my phone talk to the printer because this app did everything.  One drawback is that it doesn't search the documents directory on the Kindle Fire 1st generation, or at least I haven't been able to see that dir.  And that is where logically you might have documents to print.
B006W99PS6|1.0|It's made to play in the UK only and I didn't realize that when I bought it. Too bad for me!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Little too complicated and far fetched but enjoyable. Would recommend it for some beach reading. Nice to think about being so rich.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|If you want like see a movie. What the human act for money Nature does not care, this movie made me realize how nice it would be to live with nature and how we can live in it without destroying
B00340ESIS|5.0|This was my first foray into a screenwriting book. It was thoroughly enjoyable and well written. Recommended to my by a friend, I would have no hesitation in referring it to anyone interested in writing a screenplay. The only shortcoming I felt was the lack of screenwriting advice for tv, but there are tons of books (and sites) for that, so it didn't affect the star rating. Would have been nice though to see the beat pages assigned to 60 minutes as an example. Great read!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is a wonderful confirmation of what so many of us believe. I had cold chills while reading this book. It brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower has always been one of my favorite books, and seeing it made into a movie was even better. Logan Lerman is an amazing Charlie, and the whole cast really just knocked it out of the park. Emma Watson was great, but I think the actor that stands out the most in this is Ezra Miller. He was incredible. This is a must see.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Wow, another movie with no disappointments...Just keep up with the story line and see if you can figure how Tom survive Ghost Protocol...Awesome and all the additional actors/actress were good.  Nothing like beautiful women who are tough but will hurt you bad if you mess with them.  No Angelina Jolie or Gena Davis, but those girls were some tuff cookies...
B003IY48PS|5.0|This is my favorite horror film. Saw it when I was 8 and have loved it ever since. if you've seen the trailer for the remake, then you should really watch this original version. I am really excited to see the remake!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Enjoy the variety and how you can increase the amount of puzzle pieces to make it more a challenge...My tablet was a birthday gift and already I truely enjoy Magic Puzzles, its a great source of entertainment for all those who loves Puzzles...
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is a lot better than i expected. There are a few things that arent in the pc version, but those are computers.<br /><br />So the ups:<br />They added armour recently<br />More nether stuff<br />More blocks<br />Excellent graphics<br />High quality sound, but sometimes glitches<br /><br />And the downs:<br />No caves<br />Cant mine redstone<br />No hunger, but thats not a major downside<br />Armour takes fall damage but protects you<br />THE FREAKING PRICE<br /><br />There are lots more, but i just put down some. If you are a major pc gamer, then you may find this game horrible, but if you haven't played minecraft or you play it every once in a while, this is a great game. HOWEVER, sometimes this game gets boring, but its a LOT more fun in multiplayer, which i have played. I overall suggest this game for people over 9/10. Great game and worth the price.(WARNING in multiplayer if you join a server and you leave with your stuff it gets deleted)
B002V9PEU4|5.0|I was happy with the movie it takes me back to when I was a kid love the movie its funny as hell
B009NYF2ES|5.0|This replaces my VHS copy, so it's obviously better.  Better sound, better clarity, better in all possible ways.  I like it.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This is a great game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves dungeon crawlers.please give this game a try.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play this al the time and enjoy trying to beat it. It is a good workout for the mind.
