0062068423|5.0|This is one great mystery novel. The plot has a number of twists and turns that are intriguing without being superflous. I found myself not able to put the book down because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. The characters are complex and well formed. Harry Hole himself is a fantastic lead character. He is a flawed individual, but aims to be morally good. I loved that Nesbo allowed his characters to go beyond archtypes and that they seemed like real people. The mix of 1940's to 1990's really helped to pace the novel and added wrinkles that would have been lost with a straight line narrative.<br /><br />This is the novel that really made Nesbo and you can see why. This is not the first book in the Harry Hole series, but this is where Nesbo found his voice and where I would recommend readers to begin the series. For those unfamiliar with Nesbo, imagine Henning Mankell with a punk edge.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Addicted!!  Couldn't put them down. A lot of characters to keep track of, but very detailed. Can't wait for more!!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I have a friend who is blind.  She is not sightless, but does have significant vision loss.  Working at the computer with her adaptive software doing its thing, she tends to straight at the rather large flat screen monitor.  Seeing her struggle like this is unnecessary, as this unit mounted easily to her desk, and to the back of her LCD monitor.  It now literally floats above her desk, and with the very easily adjustments available, she can position this monitor at just the perfect height.  As she is rather elderly, the exact point does change a bit, but after a few weeks of use, this has brought her considerable joy - well, not the unit itself, but the ability to comfortably sit at her computer and join the world.<br /><br />She can change the tile to the screen, and keep the monitor just floating a centimetre above the desk, or higher - as my friends arthritis allows.  It has been a God send, and she has been very happy so far with this unit.<br /><br />The assembly went together easily, and I can see alternate ways to mount the unit and display the LCD monitor.  While it is not immediately obvious as to how the unit should be put together, the instructions are written okay, but the diagrams are very clear.  The entire assembly took me about 10 minutes and one coffee !!<br /><br />I have checked in on my friend, and the unit is still rather snug, and has not loosened unnecessarily.  I will check again in another month, but so far I get two thumbs up!!<br /><br />I do recommend this unit, but it is not cheap, but it is a rather higher quality unit.  It is made well, and spells sturdy.  I like it better than the type that will screw into a wall or desk - obviously I don't want to destroy something to make an attachment of this sort.  Sometimes people can change their mind on desktop computer locations, and this semi-permanent mounting is perfect !!!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am not a Treky, nor was I planning on being one. But this movie is amazing, and Im ready for Into Darkness
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I was listening to her on z100 and found her very talented. I went on to listen to more of her music. Excellent singer!
B000FC13UE|5.0|A fine example of Gaiman's magic. And yes, there is something magical about his writing. If you are a fan, this needs to be on your shelf. If you are not, then read this and you'll soon be.
0670026557|4.0|An individual's hard work alone is not enough.<br /><br />To me, this was a part networking book, and part success book.  You're either a taker, a giver, or matcher... but this book shows you how to combine elements of these 3 types of people for more success.<br /><br />Your personal and professional networks will benefit as a result of implementing what this book describes.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|After 10 books about Jack Reacher I'm still excited. The character hasn't lost any stamina and the stories continue to be original.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Can't say enough positive.  Anxiously awaiting the sequel.  I agree that some of the actors were miscast however it's visually stunning and a great take on the world of Oz.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Has its good momentes, exciting twists and turns, but ends up mainly carrying the story to #3. Almost wish 2 & 3 were combined.
B0032CVAQQ|2.0|The basic concept of this book is interesting and useful in understanding different needs in a relationship. But this books is a waste of time. The entire book could easily be condensed to a 100 word list.<br /><br />Chapman vastly over simplifies the complexities of human needs and interactions and is so smug it drives me crazy. It's as if this book was written in the 1950's for house wives and businessmen. I don't think a single couple had a self-empowered, modern woman. I'm trying not to be stereotypical, but I couldn't stand his smug, southern twang telling me how simple it is to make your partner happy. This is a terrible audio book.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|This cd is awesome.  I love finding new music that speaks to me in a moody sort of way. Keep it coming!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I watched it with my husband and I laughed from seeing him laugh. This movie is so terrible that it is funny.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed -an engrossing and engaging read. I  couldn't put it down. Very creative approach -loved the character development  - lots of ups and downs.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|I purchased this for some family pics on my computer, so I could free up a little space. I absolutely love it. I love the sleek design, and this is perfect for me. And the shipping and price were unbeatable!!
B000JD29EI|5.0|The book arrived just as described. I have read it & learned. Passed it<br />on to my niece ...so the memory of what  atomic bomb damage can do.So we<br /> will fight for it to never happen again.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie. It's interesting to see how a wild cat and a gentle youth can come together as it were by marking out each of their territory on the lifeboat and survival floats.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|For all the functionality I've been getting out of this mouse, the price feels like charity on Anker's behalf.<br /><br />The \\"Precision\\" part of the name is well-earned, this thing flies across the screen and stops on a dime. I've been making do with one throwaway $20 optical mouse after another for my entire life and I never questioned how clumsy and arbitrary my cursor was; the difference with the Anker mouse was immediate and mindblowing. Movement is translated so rapidly and accurately that it feels like an extension of your hand. I use it on a relatively low sensitivity and I can still navigate any application very accurately with my fingertips without moving my hand, let alone swiping to the edges of the mousepad three times like I'd grown up doing. Also, I never realized how good I actually am at PC games, this thing acquires targets like an angry wasp.<br /><br />The software is very easy to set up and use, and allows you to code certain always-on commands to two switchable profiles. The intent of design seems to be focused on gaming but I've been using the mappable buttons to fly through Ableton Live by mapping inconvenient-but-vital keyboard hotkeys to the mouse. The accuracy and shortcuts have upped my productivity immensely by letting me take big leaps without taking my hand off the mouse; I can see the mouse doing equally well in other specialty software like Photoshop, etc. I don't even switch profiles because I want all 9 buttons to be mapped for Ableton, and just make do with the hard macros in other applications/games because it's ergonomic enough that I have no problem ignoring anything I don't want to use. Speaking of ergonomics, it's comfortable and gratifying to use. It makes the most of small movements and somehow glides like an air-hockey puck on my cheap mousepad.<br /><br />This is my new standard for control, and will happily add one to any computer I end up using regularly.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />On a side note, I would love to see Anker release a productivity-oriented mouse that provides more assignable buttons with equal (or better, because why not) responsiveness and comfort. Gaming on this mouse is obviously awesome, but what I value most about it is how efficiently it lets me work. When using Ableton with my old mouse, I used to be stuck choosing between darting the mouse all over opposite sides of the screen or taking my hands off the mouse to enter uncomfortably wide multi-key shortcuts on my keyboard, but the Anker mouse lets me kill three clumsy steps with one swipe and move on to the next task with full momentum. The existing buttons are more than adequate for most purposes, but they're so useful that I often find myself wishing I had way, way more. There's a lot of functions to put into play at any given time with music production software, and I could map 20+ buttons without blinking. This thing is killer for specialty software as-is but with more buttons it has the potential to be the hand of god.
B005D643PO|5.0|I think Dexter is great!  I'm really sorry to see it go,  Like all good things, the ending is an eventuality to be prepared for. The writer(s) and the Director of Dexter are to be complimented for the fine work they've done with the scripted episodes by keeping and maintaining a focus of a story line that could have so easily gotten lost in the abstract obscurity such programs so often do. Are you certain Dexter can't be continued for another Three (3) to Four (4)  seasons. I for one find myself paying the $2.99 for each HD Episode of Seasons 1 through 6, while anxiously awaiting the release (finally) of Season 7. Anyway I'm ambling. I don't know what your viewer base is but I'm one of them, and I've never killed anything bigger than a fly and mosquito in my life. It does require a specific mindset however to watch Dexter jab a huge knife into the chest of a bad guy, but then you say to oneself; oh well, he's a bad person deserving of the watery grave, and it's only fantasy. Keep Dexter coming as long as you can MoviesVille. It really is a winner!!!
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Mark Walberg does a great job.  Storyline keeps you fully engaged.  Nothing as enjoyable as a surprise twist to the ending.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Really dig the love theme. Suits me perfectly. The beats are also really great... super easy to dance and jam to.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We went on vacation and forgot to bring some videos for my son. I purchased this movie and was able to play it immediately for my son at bed time. So convenient and easy, great picture quality! He loves it and has watched it everyday since!
6305558167|5.0|This is the best movie about King Arthur I have ever seen.  I love to watch movies from this era and I've read many books and watched many movies about this topic and I repeat, this is the best movie bar none.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|One of the best written books I've ever read. If you've ever been to Bombay (Mumbai) you'll feel like you've returned. If you've never been you'll feel like a native.<br /><br />This is not a book for the squeamish as Robert's tells it like it is, no holds barred.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would suggest it to anyone who is interested in good literature. It's simply the best book I've ever read read . Period.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|definiety a easy read. Something to get your mind off of your daily routine. I dont want the story to end.
1612680011|5.0|Love it when I have people ask me about my entrepreneurial journey & express interest in learning more.  Rich Dad Poor Dad is my go to gift to get them started.  Thanks Robert for your passion & true understanding of what is happening to the American Dream.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|It is an interesting show to watch. I am happy i did not have to pay for it and that it was FREE with amazon prime as I would have asked for my MONEY back.. but.. FREE is worth it.
B002ZG98UK|2.0|I have a great 3D setup. The beginning was ok, after that not much more. Might return. Not recommended. Buy something with more bling too it!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Wonderwful story about big love beyond reason and a heeling after a painful break up. This time it is not about perfect people but people who are so deeply hurt and despair that are not able to keep a clear mind.
B000FC12C8|3.0|Despite it's age, The Intelligent Investor is still a wonderful book on investment philosophy. For the careful reader, it contains much wisdom. Unfortunately, this edition is marred by the lengthy commentary added by Zweig. There is nothing wrong with Zweig's commentary per se but it interweaves Zweig's very basic investment advice into Graham's profound investment philosophy. Occasionally, Zweig does a good job of applying Graham's philosophy to modern events but more often the comments are largely tangential to Graham's approach.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book had many twist and an exciting ending but I really wish it hadn't ended so soon I can't wait to see what adventures await anabeth and Percy in tartarius and what the sphere that Leo has can do can't wait for the next book
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG Gideon and Eva relationship is something that is you want to keep reading up on. You want to know what is going to happen next. It is a page turner all the way through. You just want their relationship to work out without any complication attached to
B004P1JEWU|3.0|But I still would possibly recommend other works above it. Wizard of Earthsea, E R Eddison, Henry Treece's Sigurdson Trilogy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is all I can say Gideon and Eva relationship is put to the test in this book. Everything that can put a wrench in their relationship comes out. People from that past and secrets are here to split Gideon and Eva apart and if they let it. I recommend this book for everyone to read because it you want Gideon and Eva to remind together and you have secrets and people that can tear them apart.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The book told me about a remarkable man who gave the world more than it deserved.  I am a staunch conservative, but it gave evidence of how greedy, financiers actually harm mankind, and are responsible for current world conditions.
0525952926|5.0|I was so caught up in the characters and the history. I know it was a big book, but hard to put down.<br />I will be waiting for book three.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I was unaware of these prison camps till this story. it's a shame someone doesn't intervene and rescue the prisoners. This story of the prisoner who escaped is tough to read because of what he went through.it was a really good book though
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|pretty useful for me as i use it on my kindle fire at home and in the lab. Makes for quick calculations with large view area.
0425263916|5.0|This is a wonderful book and a wonderful sequel to Bared to You. Where Christian Grey is more likeable, Gideon is darkly and dangerously attractive, but he must be hell to be in a relationship with. Nonetheless, it's difficult not to have a massive crush on the man, because he's flawed and damaged and it all fits in with Eva's character. In some ways, he is the last person she should be with.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am working on reading the Outlander series. Once your start it you just have to b uy the next book to find out what happens. I must admit I will skim thru some pages and sometime there is more detail than I need.... I have have enjoyed all the books so far. I am on book 5
B008I3RARW|2.0|An ok app. I just expected more. If you enjoy the old school arcade games you will LOVE this.<br />Have fun.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Anyone interested in a confirmation of how one can derive best practices from the best available knowledge should read this book. A very interesting story of how science can trump prejudice.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is sure to keep the kids occupied for a while. Kids played it all the way traveling on vacation.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Anyone who deals with other human beings, especially from a professional/institutional standpoint, must read this book. It is also a instruction manual to our own deep-rooted psychic dynamics. A must-read, definitely
B00AHSKRJ4|5.0|This movie kept me laughing because it was so true. Most people of this age will laugh until they cry, for many reasons. Must see
1451668945|1.0|I was expecting more from one of my favorite authors.  Seems like her recent books just don't have the same page turning suspense as her older ones.  This one has too many characters with so much detail and background that it was often confusing and didn't seem necessary, and the multiple story lines didn't help.  I really struggled to get through this book and several times found myself questioning whether or not to even finish reading it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is just like the normal angry birds but better! This game is really fun,you can also use other things such as unlimited power ups just for getting a Facebook account. Rovio has outdone themselves!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Good book, seemed to focus too much on the past, and not as much on the raid itself. THere was a lot of back information, which is entertaining, but seems like i heard it all before.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|what can i say i love this knife its not a 500 dollar knife but it does great just like all the reviews iv watched and it hold an edge great plus it dont take anything to get it razor sharp again. and its also got a nive lil sheath u would be surprised how much you could it in the lil pouch on the front.i would have to say that i am completly happy with my purches

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another page turner book by Follett! He never disappoints.<br />Looking forward to reading the next book by Follett when it comes out in 2014.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|Though it doesn't have nearly the production value of Game of Thrones you're left with the feeling that something like these stories may have once actually happened.
B00001OH80|5.0|I have this on vinyl, now can enjoy it on cd. It's a great album with a variety of music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ya so, I am a minecraft lover and I decided one day to delete it and redownload it with the new update.  We I tried to redownload it though, the thing said it was still downloaded So know I have to maybe get a new Kindle Fire and download it again, even though I had a world ready to put online.  So word to the wise, and people with kindle fires, DO NOT DELETE THIS GAME!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. this is a true story and a really great seed for minecraft is called: generate seed
1250007208|5.0|I was totally hooked on this book on page 1, and I finally got a good chunk of free time and read 3/4 of it without putting it down. I really loved it. The characters were fun, the storytelling was engaging, and it was an easy read without being boring. Definitely a good retelling of the Cinderella story with some excellent sci-fi thrown in there that was very well-balanced (think Firefly meets a fairy tale). I already ordered the second book in this series, and definitely commend Ms. Meyer for reigniting my love of reading as an adult.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I am a lifelong Bonnie fan, but would not automatically give all of her work the best ratings.  This set, however, really hits the mark.  Great sound, playing, song selection, recording.  See if you can listen to the final song while reading the lyrics and not be totally moved.  Highly recommended.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|The movie as well as sound track is superb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you like old Bob Dylan type of music, you will love this music.  I really love all the songs but my favorites are:  &#34;I Wonder&#34;, & &#34;Cause&#34;  but I love them all!!!!!!!!!!!
0143120530|5.0|Not only a great read but very motivational for improving your own memeory. The book gives you concepts not the tools but after reading it I bought right away a book with specific memory exercises. And yes! Anybody can do it! I already recommended the book to my students from gifted and talented academy where I teach foreign languages. They cannot put it down either!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This is a good 2nd game for Angry bird players.<br />more tools and characters, and new skills to learn...<br /><br />Have fun
B0084HJE0S|2.0|The word \\"Now\\" in the title I think made it seem like it should be a programmer's guide, but it is not...it is a technology survey at a 10,000ft level.  This book does not contain any coding instructions nor examples to get you going, nor to even give you the flavor of HTML5 and JavaScript.  It is definitely more of a glossy \\"technology review\\" of JS and HTML5 which describes where these languages and tools fit into the very broad technological landscape that is forming as part of today's web.  Just thought I'd write this review to inform somebody in case they are expecting this book to present coding rules, examples, best practices, design patterns, and other topics associated with actual programming.  It does not...it is just a kind of white paper or executive summary on JS and HTML5.
B0063M22QO|4.0|this game has enough oomph to it to given the new Mahjong player a real taste of the game, before deciding to go on to higher levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omb I love this game!!!!!! I find challenging but I love it. Very simmilar to temple run but better! Better graphics than temple run and even Mrs characters.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this is a great game for children and  adults.<br />And it is so much better than continually having to clear ads out before you can continue to play between sections.
B0086HGW42|5.0|This album was not what I expected at all. Mesmerized by his title track I thought I'd purchase the album and I'm certainly glad I did. Ed Sheeran has a poppy unique style and sound that varies from jazzy to island life sounds with guitars and ukuleles similar to Jason Mraz. The impressive collection of original work is a staple now when I'm traveling on the road. Again, not what I expected, much better.
B000LB4DWO|5.0|I have seen Superman since the 50's and this was one of the best ever with all the special affects which clearly show how &#34;Super&#34; HE really is. You could not have done this in the early 50's with what we know today, so it makes it even more believable.<br />I wish the story went another direction, but I guess that's to keep you coming back for more.<br />The relationship with Lois Lane, and a little &#34;surprise&#34; happened while Superman was away searching for survivors of his lost planet Krypton.<br />Maybe next time the character will get more in depth on his relationships and his ability to travel across the World to save people in distress.After ALL, HE does hear everything going on. That is a lot, even for a sharp Dog with his senses.<br />Anyway, you have to get this movie if you want to live the Superman saga in real time and enjoy the special affects.<br />You WILL be astonished !!!! Money well spent. Great for the Family and kids. Truth, Justice and The American way are not dead. It lives on in US and Superman!.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark and twisted and edge-of-your-seat AMAZING read! The story makes you won't more and more.  Very well written! Highly recommended!
B008602KQI|2.0|If the film of this story is anything like the book, I'm glad that I have never bothered. The wimpy/emo romance between Peeta and Katniss is revolting, and I am so thankful that I watched this for free on Amazon Prime. If I had paid a cent to see this movie, I would have given it a 1-star review; it was 2 hours poorly spent.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book. Enjoyed the style in which the story was told and the shockers were just right. Really well written. Enjoyed it a lot!
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Campy, silly, fun, glorious and the music of Queen, what's not to love!  Get your popcorn ready and settle in for a trip down memory lane.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Filled with surprise and emotion. The character are extremely relatable, from the various family dynamics to the different &#34;love&#34; relationships. You are left questioning how you feel about love and life.
B003UYUP58|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies is one of those books that keeps you reading.  You do not have to be a medical person to enjoy this book.  I especially liked the historical context of this dreaded disease.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The &#34;Life of PI&#34; is a wonderful story but in 3D it makes me feel like I'm in that boat with Pi & Richard Parker!
141659521X|2.0|Macho attitude of writer creeps through the entire novel to the point of stupidity! I read several of his earlier novels and they were reasonable though his macho attitude was noticeable. In Last Man he simply carries it too far to boring point. Last one of his novels I will read. Sad, he could have been a Silva.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|perfect, works very well in any part of the house my 10 year old granddaughter uses it 90 percent of the time and fines it great.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|The game is not complicated and easy to learn. There are a lot of options for airplanes to unlock. Many of these are sort of &#34;tongue in cheek&#34; and cute. My kids love it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout.  It has 3 levels to choose from so you get the workout that is best for you.  I use it 4 to 5 times a week and it is doing wonders for me getting off my winter weight.  I will be bikini ready when the weather warms up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a beast cuz it go hard that is why I love the game subway surfers.  Malique Byrd
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Season one explains so much as to who the doctor is. This is a must see for anyone just getting into doctor who.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a neat take on the &quot;endless runner&quot;. The repair and build times on the armor are designed to eat your money, otherwise this is a quality game.
0374275637|5.0|This book has more valuable information  than almost any other book I have ever read. Every chapter is filled with interesting insights into how humans actually think and function as compared to the assumptions that most economists make. I highly recommend this book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This Is the perfect ending of an epic series.  And every time you reread the series, you pick up more content (yes, you need to reread the series).  Very complex and satisfying.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really liked the first season of Doctor Who.  Even though the special effects can look cheesy at times, the stories, the acting and the production value are really good.  Christopher Eccleston brought seriousness to the Doctor and it is such a shame he was only in one season.  Billie Piper also was really good.  The two had chemistry and a relationship that is not felt in future seasons.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|I could listen to these songs over and over again forever. It's almost a perfect collection of REM's very best.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Shows how we can easily avoid relationships just for fear of problems that may come. But really, love will find it's way.
B004LDLHWW|4.0|I am commenting on the German language version. In my opinion, the English translations are completely inadequate. Yes, they convey the roots of the terror that was the Third Reich, but no translation can convey the absolutely hypnotic style that made Hitler stand above all his compatriots. Reading his words, especially if you can extrapolate those words into the accent and tone you remember from news reels, you can viscerally understand how he wielded such influence, how he was able to move a population towards evil. I found this book riveting - horrible yes, but riveting. It helps to elucidate some of our not-too-distant history. Highly recommended, but not for pleasure.
B008602KQI|4.0|I didnt expect to like it. i had picked-up the book my daughter had sitting around from a college course, and didnt get very far. it was too dry and depressing.  I really liked the movie though and I think I attribute this to jenifer lawrene's performance.  she was just very compelling to watch. i'm glad i decided to watch it and not just skip-it based on my experience with the book.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|very talented group singing some classic songs.  I especially liked the version of Hit me with your Best Shot by Catherine Zeta Jones.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Ive seen the trailer and this game look likes a REALLY GOOD game!! The only thing is that I wish this game was free though :/ .(But again,looks like a GREAT game just please make it free)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great read; very descriptive. He tells his story clearly and with great detail.  I've read other first person SEAL books, but this is the best.
B00BF123WG|4.0|This movie was pretty riveting until the end. During the actual taking of Bin laden at his compound there are too many black screens where the viewer sees nothing. There are flashes of scenes depicting night vision, but too many black screens. This kind of ruined the movie for me.
1452123071|5.0|It is so cute to see Little Luke & Daddy Darth as friends. This a great postcard book - very creative and comical. The drawings are a wonderful reflection of the Star Wars movies.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've gotten these many times.  They are lightweight and perfect for warm weather, when headphones that cover the ears would  be too warm.  Audibility is excellent and one can hear ambient noises as well.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Loved the first two. .... best kept secret kept the pages turning. .. can't wait for the sequel. ... when will we get it?
B001XV1X6A|4.0|We enjoyed it as a family, would recommend it for children of all ages. Perfect for Saturday evening at home.
1853260983|5.0|The nontrivial number of one-star reviews of \\"Mayor of Casterbridge\\" is evidence that no matter how well written a book is, it is always possible to find reasons to trash it.  Yes, the events in the story could not possibly happen in real life; but that doesn't matter, because *it's a great story*.  (And who decreed that a work of fiction must be indistinguishable from reality, anyway?)  Yes, Farfrae is a cardboard character; but that doesn't matter either, because the character in whom I was most interested was the Mayor himself.  Some reviewers found him \\"despicable\\" or \\"annoying.\\"  I didn't.  (For annoying, read \\"Emma.\\")  Yes, there were many times when the Mayor would commit a bad act or have a bad thought.  But each time that I was on the verge of concluding that the Mayor was at heart a bad *person*, the Mayor himself would realize his own sins, become ashamed, and attempt to correct himself.  It was like watching a man on a seesaw frequently going down, down, down, and just before he is about to hit bottom and get stuck there, he realizes where he is and summons the effort to push himself back up, both in his own eyes and in the eyes of the reader.  And that final note on the bed: Despicable men do not write such notes.  Utterly heartbreaking.<br /><br />And Hardy's writing is utterly clear, easily parseable, and understandable without the repeated sentence re-reads required by many other works of the period.  If you enjoy classic novels, give yourself a treat and read one of the best novels ever written.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I have loved all the cut the rope games so far and this one is no exception!  Great job Zepto!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game starts out easy and gets harder as you go on and the guy that is chasing you fund pretty fast so try not to bump into anything
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The Irish slang might put some off in this touching tale set in the Irish countryside but if you keep with it, you will be rewarded with a tale about two unlikely siblings finding each other against all odds...excellent read.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like the game, but am not crazy about the timer. I'd rather play at my own speed. Try it! It's fast paced.
B008C20TDG|5.0|What excellent read. Educational, inspiring and there are even some funny bits thrown in. If you are looking for a book that will provide guidance transforming your lifestyle and diet, this is the book for you!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|It was a wonderful movie.  I had to add it to my collections.  i can watch it over and over again.
1609611543|5.0|Bravo Dr. Davis !  This book will open your eyes about the food and health industries. The wheat we eat today is nothing like the wheat our grandparents ate.  It has been created in labs to get the most product out of a single plant.  It has no nutritional value and seems to be the root cause of a lot of health issues.  You need to read this book and make up your own mind.  There are 2000 cases studies behind this study and the results speak for themselves . I have changed the way I eat and have started to see results.  Being 66, overweight with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-diabetic, and having a wheat belly, I needed to make a change.  Going wheat less is hard at first but after a while when you start feeling better and do not have &#34; food Coma&#34;, after every meal, you will understand why you need to change your eating habits.  Again, Bravo!  The recipes in this book and the Wheat Belly cook book are easy, tasty, and healthy.  Bona petite!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Does what it's supposed to. Using my tablet provides a larger context for reading. When I'm finished reading, I have the functionality of the tablet.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|For an old fart like myself, I just wanted something that was simple to understand and put a some notes together with.  Seemed very complex and I'm sure if you have time to learn or they provide better instructions with some of these programs that it could be very useful.  However, I was just looking for something simple.  Inada de eso!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The games are quick. Just what you want when you've got a few minutes to kill. I like the option of 1 card or 3 at a time when drawing a hand. Enjoy!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Not your Harry Potter!! Very good and interesting read. Keeps you turning pages to the very end.  I really enjoyed this book.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|David Foster and his friends are contributing more to the  music industry currently than anyone I can think of!<br />Legendary already!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The whole series you wait for Ana to stand up to him, he \\"loves\\" her and I understand he has issues but you wait for this final climax of understanding and for him to care more about her feelings than his weird need to be in control of her whole life. I thought I could try it, but it really becomes a huge frustration that ruined my Outlook on anything kinky!!!
B001I5M9SC|5.0|Best Concert I ever watched and listen to with all my hi-tech equipment<br />Superior visual and sound quality<br /><br />Really great!!!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing, I've never fallen into a book or factional characters the way I have with these books.  Couldn't put the books down, read the whole series in about a week, bumbed its just over. Would love a book done on Christians perspective.. Ahhhh...
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Celine is so great!<br />She puts on a performance better than anyone out there!<br />Another legend to be<br /><br />Thank you David Foster
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Love the franchise and loved this movie, however, the end had you wanting more. I'm betting this is a good thing and purposeful. Never-the-less, I wanted more!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|And epic look at the early 19th century with some of the most engaging characters on TV. Well worth seeing from the beginning!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie, not as seat clenching as I thought was still quite the watch. I've realized that this could be many people's stories [or something similar] in our workplace society now and this is what makes this movie actually realistic. I know and have heard of individuals who are some of the top performing people in their fields and later you find out their predicament were similar to a situation like this movie laid out. Drug use and all, yet the best.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|When I got hooked on this series, I was unable to watch the second season ANYWHERE! I had to skip ahead and watch season three. Then, when I started browsing through my selection on Amazon Instant Video, there it was, season 2. I love Downton Abbey and that era is amazing. And I love Amazon for offering what most do not. Not to mention the great products and service Amazon has to offer too.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Item was great and it was as described. I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend to a friend.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Well, I'm definitely feeling well, sane and functional after this read. Flynn draws dark, unlikeable characters in this story, but it's compelling none the less. A fragile woman returns to her hometown to write an investigative article about the murder and disappearance of two little girls. Camille is thrust back into her dysfunctional family and dealing with the memory of her younger sister Marian and the brutal cruelty of her much younger sister, Amma, whom she barely knows. Camille is a cutter - after her sisters death she feels driven to cut words into her skin, and she drinks excessively. But the book makes it plain that her brokenness is completely homegrown. So much of the book is discomfitting - it left me feeling soiled and oily. Story had good pacing and kept me turning the pages to find out who did it and what was really going in in Camille's house. Great read!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Item was great and it was as described. I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend to a friend.
B0084670FU|5.0|I was wondering where the story was going and it ended with a different story line that I did not expect.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Item was great and it was as described. I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend to a friend.
B008Y79IUE|4.0|It was an interesting movie. Very sad but different. Surprise after surprise. Good photography. Too much time smoking as many directors think is necessary for some unknown reason.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Item was great and it was as described. I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend to a friend.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It is well made and should do the job. I have had it for a short time and it does work.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|The actors were stellar and even though it was subtitled i could follow along with the funny parts.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|I just like a few of the characters a lot. You have to really escape reality with this show. If you can forgive and accept some of the basic premises of the show, you will have a good time with the show. I enjoyed it immensely! I wish it were still on the air. Although I loved the show, I would rate it 4 or 5 BUT 4 = like.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Some parts of this the movie are really funny which compliment the truthful more serious parts about trying to getting pregnant.
0300169787|5.0|No one remembers anymore how McQuinn was dragged through the mud by certain fashion media for that certain first collection for that certain fashion house...<br />This book gives full credit to his genius - a rare one amongst many mediocre celebrity-designers who are still around to bore us with their same-old-boring collections season in and season out.<br />Great photography reflects what I feel is the McQuinn world of fashion.<br />If you are even remotely interested in fashion, add this book to your collection!
B000GCFG7E|3.0|I'm a reader at heart.  That's how I spend my spare time.  Since I got the kindle it's cheaper and less cumbersome than paper books so I downloaded the Jack Reacher series.  The were ok.  Nothing special; nothing wild and crazy.  Almost plodding and predictable.  He gets from A to B with minimal effort.  Jason Bourne and Mitch Rapp series are much more entertaining and action packed.
B005FQE2E4|2.0|This is not my style of humor so I didn't like it.<br />Others may not agree with me but I believe that this kind of 'loser' humor negatively affects our senses.<br />I like to laugh a happy laugh. This book did not make me laugh or smile.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I bought my first pair of basic Toms canvas slip ons and love them.  When I first heard of them from a co-worker, I thought, what a wonderful idea.  They use very basic and simple materials, cost not more than the average pair of shoes and when you purchase a pair they give a pair to a child in need.  Once my shoes arrived I slipped my feet right into them and they fit perfectly.  I could wear them bear foot or with socks.  I decided bear foot since they are canvas and after 10 hours in them no blisters.  I have never had a pair of shoes that I could wear bare foot immediately and not get blisters.  They are just perfectly comfy.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Very scary, took awhile to get into, but once you did it was very hard to put it down.  Recommend it
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|Quite simply the worst film I've seen in 20 years. It is empty, repetitive, angry and cynical beyond description, without any feeling for its characters, for place (imagine portraying Paris, let alone soul-numbing oily suburban Oklahoma, as barren)for story, for acting, for love itself, or for viewers, a tired, self-indulgent cliche from start to finish. It's a shame that Malick's reputation and career will probably be ruined by this film. He once did good work. Virulent anti-Americanism, of the most cliched and unobservant kind, abounds. Only Javier Bardem seems even vaguely human. Ben Affleck has never been more of a cipher (resembling Keir Dullea in 2001), and the pouty, one-dimensional sex object he hangs his loins on (Rachel McAdams) is an embarrassment to femininity. The first five minutes will tell you everything you need to know about the style and content of the film. It never changes or progresses. If you stay longer you need a life.
B00A6CT012|4.0|Good info. I have two very small boys and two adolescent step-daughters, all of whom create an incredible amount of waste! Between activities, school projects and just general everyday living I became more & more concerned with the amount of trash we were producing. When I saw Bea's blog and book I became impressed and a little obsessed with the Zero waste movement. We are a long way from 1 liter of trash per year, but small changes like no more disposable products such as paper plates and towels, buying in bulk and composting food scraps has reduced our waste (and grocery bills) significantly! Zero Waste Home is a good resource for info without being too \\"crunchy.\\" If you are looking for more info on the environmental impact of our trash epidemic, you should check out Getting To Zero Waste. If you want good, practical advice on how to get there with style, get Zero Waste Home and check out Bea's blog.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Not for the faint of heart as it might have you rethinking dining out. Otherwise, another fun read from Anthony!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I can't wait to see the next one.  I waited a long time for this one and Peter Jackson never fails to impress.  Its a very good buy and worth it.  I have already watched it 5 times since I got my pre-ordered copy and am about to watch it again.  \m/@.@\m/
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It really is like Mario world x) But these  people have put their own Lep twist on it, making it their own creation. The controls are really easy to get used to- was  like I was born knowing how to use them. Favourite game on the kindle right now x) thank youu to the creators! Oh and... there really is nothing for you to buy- it's completely free :D
B00AIBZJS4|4.0|This Bluray Disc is Region Free, but the DVD copy is Region A/1.  I don't know why Amazon.US will not put this information on their web site. I am in New Zealand where our region is B/2,and the Bluray Disc plays perfectly alright, and as I have said the DVD copy is region A/1 so you would need a multi DVD player for the DVD. I found out this product information through HD Movie Source where it says US Manufactured Disc, Region A B C.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|A very nice way to spend a Saturday.  It was good to relax and watch this movie.  You should consider watching it too if you have not seen it.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|This book was way to long.  I got tired to reading it and starting skipping pages. I think the story could have been much better if shorter.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game<br />I would continue I they make more<br />It has taken a lot of patience<br />Mind boggling
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Loved this app. Bought it for my nephew but I play it all the time. Would recommend it highly for a free app.
B003G4W49C|4.0|For the military intellectually minded reader this novel forces one to think analytically regarding the training and development of military leadership from the tactical to the strategic level of command. This novel provides a reader a well rounded understanding of the sacrifices a military leader must make in order to be a successful commanding officer. The basic principles leadership are displayed well throughout Ender's military training through his display of leadership from the beginning of his training at the battle school and as a commander at the end of his training there. He further displays his intellect and initiative at the command school by taking the lessons he learned at the battle school and applying them there. The ability of a commander to effectively adapt to an enemies tactics is further high lighted while Ended is a commander.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I agree with the other recent 1 star review. This was my absolute favorite game, I would log in to check  my dragon's hourly, I even spent real money on this game. A few weeks ago it started taking an insane amount of time to load on my android phone, then it stopped loading all together. Like the other reviewer, I figured it was my device. Now I haven't been able  to get on, on my kindle for 3 days. Both devices are up to date, both games are  up to date. The game loads  and loads and loads, then nothing. It says  an error occurred, and shuts down. I've tried everything but removing the games and starting over, but I would hate to loose my progress..<br /><br />If this can  be fixed it is easily a 10 star game. Until then, buyer beware, you will get hooked, and then never be able to log on again.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Once i started reading it i couldn't put it down. Gayle Forman made sure to hook you in since the beginning. It was better than the first book and an amazing love story!
B000O14VAU|4.0|I had seen this one before, so you know I liked it in order to rewatch it. Even though it is a vampire movie, it has a little different bend to it and it pleased my palate.
B0084I9QLY|5.0|This Picture Vinyl looks great. The Picture is good quality and it was better than expected.<br /><br />Because I bought it as a collector's item and have not opened it, or played the vinyl, I cannot speak on the sound quality.<br /><br />However, I will say that if it's anything like the Thriller 25th Anniversary Picture Vinyl, then it probably sounds incredible. Vinyl tends to sound better than cd or mp3.
B007Z9RS22|3.0|Good movie to rest your mind and smile...My friend absolutely loved it. Maybe you will, too. Certainly not Keanu's best, but not his worst, either.
1482076608|3.0|This story is good but it's not what I really expected. There isn't anything scary about it, that's the thing.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Their story, thier music, & their videos are absolutely amazing!!  Everyone in the house loves listening -- even our 4 year old.  Can't get enough!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Lots of history, drama, family life rough and loving. I heard it on Audible, my favorite way of getting my exercise by walking and listening with just one ear, the other ear is listening for traffic and keeping me safe on the street. You will enjoy with your eyes or ears. I just started the seond book in the trilogy. Anne Jarman
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It kept my attention the whole time.  I'm glad I read it before I saw the movie.
B0065NAKRO|4.0|This game works well my only issue with it is the small size of the Domino's. I understand the game requires space to play, but I have a hard time selecting individual dominos from my pieces. This is my only issue otherwise the game works perfectly, it's smooth and fast.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I listened to this CD about a dozen times in my car before I switched back to my mp3 player. I still keep it in there since I'm always in the mood for this.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love historical fiction. I find it interesting reading about the struggles of people that had little or no choice because of their station in life. It's appalling how badly they were treated. It makes me feel so thankful that I was born in a later time and live freely to do what I choose.<br />This story held my interest right from the beginning. I couldn't wait to get back to it every time I had to stop. I loved the characters who brought the story to life and made me wonder what happened next in their lives.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is much different from her Harry Potter books, although some of the themes are the same--i.e., troubled but essentially innocent children in a world of ill-intentioned or misguided adults, with the exception of Barry, who seems to be a Harry Potter of sorts, but unfortunately, died at the outset, which set events in motion.  I think anyone who likes serious literature, can deal with gray instead of black and white, and is prepared for something different from Harry Potter will enjoy this book.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The actual flight events were very realistic, and the aftermath, including serious investigations, scheming lawyers (are there any other kind?) and soul-searching of the main characters were very important to an audience seeking redemption in the heroes of the plot.
B008Y73940|4.0|Was a good movie that was not the normal predictable everyday movie.  Matthew was a nice looking lawyer that did not sit back and let everyone else do all the work.
B0021L9MJG|5.0|I've always loved EC comics and to me this was as good as it ever got to bringing one to life.  The effects for their day were good, and translates fairly well to blu-ray.  The acting was good for it had a good share of strong character actors in Nielson, Barbeau, Holbrook, and a good turn by Stephen King.  I still surprise the kids with this one and they love it.
B00932A4XE|4.0|This was a good movie.  Was a little too descriptive for younger children.  Was funny and had a variety of characters - you had to keep up with all the storylines - was not boring.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Ending is anticlimactic and ended much too quickly.  The story as a whole is a very good story. I recommend!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|good Michael's songs, the same for the Cartero CD just a cardboard cage at least this was not expensive, I was expecting one best CD presentation
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Hunger games was okay I loved catching fire hated mockingjay they killed prim katniss grew hatred for gale. I officially do not like Suzanne Collins
B00005JMJG|5.0|always watch this one when im having a rough break up i love it so much very artistic and thought provoking<br /><br />That's may sound weird but I find it very comforting.
B007RCJNDE|3.0|Well, this was certainly an end to the series, I found it a little slow in parts.<br />I read all 13 books in a row, and felt as if I was part of the plot, and knew the various characters personnally.<br />It was sad to see some of the main characters killed, especially the ones that were needed to rebuild the White Tower.<br />This certainly left the end sort of open ended.<br />I guess there is some room for another book perhaps.
0140544518|5.0|Bought the books for the grand kids and they loved it. It is definetly a different twist on the story I grew up with but I enjoyed it still
0684824906|5.0|This is one of the most interesting, informative books I've read in a long time.  It took me quite a while to digest the context and my book is filled with notes!  Guess I'm more of a history buff than I thought.  Great work Miss Goodwin.
1451695195|5.0|Recommend to anyone to read. Very well written and thought provoking at all levels.Of all the books on this subject this is filled with facts that cannot dispute the end result
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Finally, a truly terrifying and believable tale from the zombie lit genre. I knew they were out there somewhere. Thanks max brooks.
0785156593|5.0|Outstanding story and great way of bringing the marvel universe together.<br /><br />Cannot wait to see Thanos' presence in the rest of Phase 2 and into Phase 3 of the Marvel movies.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|minii usb , you can't get them to work , it like the old days when you hade to move the tv antenna all over to get a good signal. You have to cajole the thing around to make it work!  It Stinks.
0756655307|4.0|I say great and not outstanding.  There are some key characters in the Marvel Universe I would have liked to have a little more of a write up on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app.  though not really loving the new update.  Just wish I could search just my boards instead of all boards, when I can't remember where I pinned something.  Have even got my husband looking at recipes when he needs new ideas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best sand box game ever. BEWARE there are RIP OFFS of this game like worldcraft and the other wannabes. BUY THIS GAME no really buy this game it is worth 7 bucks
1416914285|5.0|This book was very nice it showed romance and action. The story was nice left on a nice cliff hanger that kept you reading .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is . my favourite app the racing the jumping the coins it's better then temple run in my opinion . I highly recommend this app for anyone even 90 year olds
0393338398|4.0|Perhaps now it's not so revealing, but when this came out, it revealed the advanced use of Sabrmetrics as applied to the big leagues.  The book is refreshing in that it pulls no punches and shows both the benefits and the downside to using Sabrmetrics.  It's quite a read for anyone interested in baseball.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|We purchased this because I wanted to keep one set in our travel case, and I like that this is clearly marked &#34;Amazon&#34;. We  never travel without the Kindle but we once left the Cable at home. Bad move.
0307949508|4.0|It's hard to give this book only four stars, but I do so only because the first and third volumes of the trilogy were just a little bit better.  This book is very, very good, but it's got so much going on in it that it's almost too busy.  Even so, you need to read this and the first volume to be prepared for what happens in the final volume.  This is just an excellent series, and I don't typically read much contemporary fiction.  I couldn't put this book down either.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|We are always looking for something that will appeal to the adults and kids (ages 12 & 8) in our family. This was perfect. We all enjoyed it.
0307454568|5.0|I was skeptical when I began this trilogy but immediately was swept up in it.  I couldn't put any of these books down and this one was no exception.  I was only sad to see it end.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great strategy game. Setting a goal to get a perfect score on each configuration makes it more challenging challenging and longer play. Hope more levels are coming.  Quell Reflect is good also but different.
0345495004|3.0|I have a fascination with Frank Lloyd Wright and this book provided some details about what happened in this sad chapter of his life.  I'm not a big fan of historical fiction, however, and this was no exception.  I think I would have preferred a straight up story about the tragic events and not a fictionalized account.
B009K86D86|5.0|I loved watching this documentary. I highly recommend it. if you want to become aware of the food products you consume.
B0095H4FAA|5.0|I'd heard all the hub-bub about the book and then saw the movie, which I liked a great deal.  So I decided that I'd read the trilogy before the next movie came out.  I was blown away.  Like Lonesome Dove, it's the rare case where the movie and the book are about equally good.  There were some slight differences between the two, but the book is just phenomenal, quite a quick read.  I couldn't put it down.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|A B movie classic and one of Carpenter's all-time best. \\"Escape From New York\\" is a perfect example of a huge idea made with a minimal budget. Kurt Russell is bad @ss perfect as Snake Plissken and the soundtrack is awesome. Love this movie!!!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|It was a great read for many reasons. An excellent storyline stretching across generations. Twists and turns kept the reader captivated until the very end. Beautifully written too.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I truly empathized with Jamie. It was hard to believe that a child who'd endured all that he did could turn out so well. The orphanage scenes were very disturbing. Very sad. I almost felt like I was reading two different books.<br /><br />I loved the Irish accents and the wonderful way in which Ms McKenna brought them to life for the reader. The descriptions were incredibly visual. I felt like I was right there with the characters.
1401937519|5.0|I gobbled this book up in no time. A very enjoyable read. I like reading about peoples life changing experiences. It deffinately carries a uplifting message.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun to play. I like the game very much and would like it to be longer than this. More levels please.
B000NY12CI|5.0|This book calls out for us to think for ourselves, to commit ourselves to freedom of expression and a commitment to our values, especially equality.
B007VT6QSI|4.0|In June 2012 Canadian Pop Star Justin Bieber released his third studio album Believe. Though it drew the normal snarky commentary from haters it surprised many with it's older, more mature sound and r&b/hip hop influences. On a personal note I was once a Bieber hater ( Boo! Hiss! I know, I know lol) at 21 going on 22 years old my tweeny-bopper days are behind me and my tolorance for uber sugary sweet bubblegum teen/tween pop has deminished ( I still love pop music, just in more mature form). However it wasn't all that long ago growing up during the late 90's-early 2000's pop boom that I loved it. *Nsync, The Backstreet Boys, Britney, Christina, Jessica, Brandy, 98 Degrees, Destiny's Child etc will all always have a special place in my heart. As a result on a whim I decided to give The first single from the album a listen and I enjoyed it. It's resembalence to *Nsync's single \\"Girlfriend\\" tugged on my heartstrings, and I found myself eager to hear the album and was pleasantly surprised. This album is Justin's \\"I'm over 18 now, I'm not a little kid anymore and I'm growing up.\\" album. Does it do it's job as the first step into adulthood for him? Yes, I think it does. Let's get into the music...<br />1.)All Around The World Ft. Ludacris: The album opens ironically with the fifth single, though not a bad one. Luda's rap is as generic as most of his guest verses nowadays seem to be but good effort nontheless. The beat is also generic and the song somewhat sounds like a faster version of \\"As Long As You Love Me.\\" However Justin's voice really shines here as with the rest of the album. His voiced \\"dropped\\" right after he recorded his Christmas album and it really makes all the difference. Though he still sounds young he doesn't sound like a pre-pubesent girl anymore. This Makes his music more enjoyable and frankly IMO credible, it was hard to take him seriously before, now the listener can relate to him and the subject matter much better. 8/10<br />2.)Boyfriend: The albumscontinues with the first single and many claim Justin's frist real serious chart hit reaching #2 on The Billboard Hot 100. The song's rapped opening is admitedly cheesy and ill written but somehow cute anyway. Justin goes from falsetto-ish vocals on the verses to lower ones on the catchy chorus \\"If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go, keep you on my arm girl you'd never be alone...\\" Can you hear the fangirls squeeing? lol. Overall cheesy and a bit repetative but also very enjoyable and fun. 10/10<br />3.)As Long As You Love Me ft. Big Sean: The second single from the album is a gem IMO. Justin does the vocal effects himself without the use of auto-tune. The lyrics remisent of the Backstreet Boys hit of the same name have JB telling his girl as long as she loves him and is with him nothing else matters. \\"As long as you love me we could starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke. As long as you love me I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold. As long as you la la la la la la la love me...\\" He sings with gentle conviction. Big Sean's guest verse is also nicely done. 9/10<br />4.)Catching Feelings:The album slows down for a minute with another one of my personal favorites. The subject of the protaginst realizing he is falling in love with his childhood best friend has been done many, many times before ( Backstreet Boys \\"How Could I fall In Love With You\\" for example) Justin put his spin on it very well IMO. His soft yet confident vocals with the sweet yet vulnerable lyrics are a great match. \\"We've been friends since we were this high, so why do i get nervous everytime you walk by?\\" he ponders over a nice acoustic guitar and easy beat. The bridge further relays the point as he is worried she might not feel the same way. \\"Should I tell her how I feel? Should I move in close or just stay still? cause if I take a chance and touch her hand will everything change? How do I know if she feels the same?\\". 10/10<br />5.)Take You: This IMO is the first real filler track on Believe. The song seems to be a re-done version of Boyfriend, As Long As You Love Me, and All Around The World. The same exact message, similar beat. Justin's vocals are great but not even that can save this song from being lackluster. 5/10<br />6.)Right Here Ft. Drake: Thankfully the album picks right back up IMO with the fourth single. This is another favorite of mine, with the R&B and Hip-Hop feel to it despite the repetative subject matter (JB is right here for you girls hes got you don't worry!) \\"Cause I just wanna love you, I will never ever put nobody else above you. I just wanna kiss you baby I just wanna hug you till the end. I'm right here aint nobody got hold ya cause I'm right here aint nobody gon' control ya\\" Justin croons though he sounds very good his voice sounds much younger in comparison to the older Drake. Drake IMO did a great job and his vocals fit in very well with the tone and feel of the song. His approach reminds the listener of his vocals in his duet with Rihanna \\"Take Care\\"( Another favorite of mine). (It doesn't hurt he is the only member of Young Money I can really tolorate right now.)10/10<br />7.)Fall: The album continues with the second filler track IMO. This should be called Catching Feelings part 2. It's basically the exact same song the protaginst in love with his childhood best friend, she's scared and he's telling her to \\"fall\\" as he will catch her and be there for her. Thankfully it is a brief song so it doesn't wear out it's welcome but not a great track anyway.5/10<br />8.)Die In Your Arms: This Usher/Justin Timberlake esque track is another favorite for me. Justin's sweet vocals paired with the nice r&b style beat are a nice combo. The pleading \\"Please don't go girl\\" tone is also remincent of both MJ and NKOTB 9/10<br />9.)Thought Of You: Though this track is a bit scattered IMO it is still very enjoyable. With a slower beat during verses that turns into a modern dance beat during the chorus. Justin's falsetto vocals are very nice, though the song could have been trimmed down by about 2 minutes or so it's still very good. 8/10<br />10.)Beauty and A Beat Ft. Nicki Minaj:The third single from the album ( which reached number 5 on the charts and which Justin performed on The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show) is the most dance-pop song on the album IMO. Though that isn't totally a bad thing. Justin's energy and vocals manage to neutralize the normally over the top Nicki( who to her credit tones it down and stays on topic) and their voices blend well together. The song is first and foremost a dance song and dance is what it makes you want to do. 8/10<br />11.)One Love: This song is IMO meh and along with the next song most reminds me of his first two albums. Though they aren't bad and Justin's vocals are very good. They aren't remarkable and he has done both topics to death.6/10<br />12.)Be Alright: Yet again Justin is here to reasure his fans everything is going to be alright and while the song might earn an eye roll from us older folks it must be said that Justin's youth is on his side in songs like this. IMO because he doesn't yet have the jaded cynical snark that the veterans of the pop game do he is believable when singing songs with such sweetness and optimsism.7/10<br />13.)Believe: The title track is a thank you to his fans/supporters/parents for... well beliving in him. And as cheesy as it might sound in theory like I said above I genuinely believe Justin is thankful to everyone who helped him get to where he is. Too many big stars seem to get cocky after a few years and forget not only fans but all the people behind the scenes we rarely see.Those who pushed and propelled them to stardom, like parents A&R people, Managers, Radio etc who took a chance on them when they were just un-knowns trying to make thier way. As Justin himself sings on the track \\"Where would I be if you didn't believe\\"?!9/10<br />14.)Out Of Town Girl: Though this song has a nice IMO Hip-Hop style and attitude to it it is a bit average,ok but not great. It isn't bad in fact I rate it much higher than say Take You, Fall, and One Love. It just comes off sounding like something from Chris Brown's last two albums ( though in a much friendlier, non-arrogant way thank goodness) Still enjoyable enough though and it's good to hear Justin moving away from crooning for a second and he sounds like he's having fun. 9/10<br />15.)She Don't Like The Lights: This track is another favorite of mine, from the opening camera flash sound effects to Justin's falsetto and the dance break. Weather or not the lyrics reference Justin's on again/off again ( though they seem to be officially off now) girlfriend fellow pop star Selena Gomez is anyone's guess. The protaginst is struggling with his love's hatred of the paparazzi and the spotlight \\"Don't wanna love in front of the cameras\\" \\"It's getting to the point where it's too much for her\\" as she eventually gives him an ultimatum give up the public life or shes gone. He sings doing a great job sounding conflicted not wanting to break up but un-able to leave his stardom behind ethier. \\"damn it's my life girl\\" he can be heard saying in the backround. Very Well done IMO 10/10<br />16.) Maria: The album ends on one of the most adult grown up notes it possibly could. Justin Bieber's own version of \\"Billie Jean\\". In 2011 Justin was accused by a crazed female fan named Mariah Yeater of fathering her child. Justin and his people have denied the allegations completly. Justin's manager has said the song is \\"inspired by\\" the allegations though not totally based on them. \\"Maria why you wanna do me like that? She ain't my baby no she ain't my girl\\" he sings sounding both genuine and annoyed ( though who could blame him). Justin's vocals are great and though the beat is a little generic it fits and lets the lyrics take center stage. A very good song as a whole and a good if a bit odd note to close out Justin's first \\"adultish\\" album.<br/>Overall I must say now that I am a Justin Bieber fan ( I refuse to call myself a \\"beliber\\" I'm too old for that , a fan I am. A crazy 14 year old hormonal fangirl I am not.) I really enjoyed this album. I took off one star for some cheesy lyrics and filler tracks but I am not ashamed to say this is an album I listen to often. Justin even as far as he has gone already still has far to go, and this was the first step into his grown up career. Justin's vocals were IMO great on point even in songs I didn't like, not just that his voice has deepend and matured but he has more control over it and has learned to use it much better. I look forward to what he has in store next as he continues to get better and stronger as an artist. I would recommend this album to any pop music fan. Overall 9/10.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughter and was thinking that it couldn't be anything that I would like. I was mistaken. I thought the movie was done very well amd had a great theme. The acting was excellent and I would give it 6 stars if that was am option.
B00A81NFAS|2.0|I didn't care for the movie. I don't want to go into too much detail, since when I did (I had a long review written prior, which I've deleted to rewrite), all I accomplished was spoiling several of the plot points (as obvious as they are), and going off on how terrible it was. You don't need me to tell you what all is terrible, if you watch it you will see for yourself. My hope is that you don't waste time, and I'll try to give you the best reasons I can as succinctly as possible.<br /><br />The acting was good. Don't get me wrong. Jennifer Lawrence proved herself to be more than I ever expected she could be from her role in the Hunger Games. She still slumped into her monotone at some points, perhaps the worst points she could, but overall she did well. Good on her. The rest of the cast was good also.<br /><br />The real problem is the story. The story of this movie is quite simply absurd. You cannot relate to the characters because of how poorly they are written. There is no redemption, and for a movie about mental illness there's really no REAL emotional discomfort. The only discomfort generated was generated by having half of the dialogue yelled between angry people. That should not be your go-to tactic for creating conflict.<br /><br />Even more unfortunate is that there is really no conflict resolution. The character development is forced, and the way the characters act at certain points is completely opposite to how someone would act (by the way they feel). All of this misdirection is to force a twist at the end, a big \\"surprise\\", but it really ruined the little the story had going for it. It would have been much more effective to throw out the silly twist at the end, perhaps the book didn't have the ridiculous ending?<br /><br />The other beef I had was that the author, or at least the people who adapted the book for the movie, could not write men. Honestly. Men do not simply go crazy over an easy lay. I'm not saying men won't exploit women if they're easilyavailable, but let's give ourselves an ounce of credit here. I saw that it was a husband-wife duo that worked on the book, perhaps the husband envisioned the female character and the wife envisioned the man? Either way, what they give us are two characters we can't relate to, who suffer mental illnesses that really don't seem to have much effect on them. I mean sure they're bizarre people, but if this is what we medicate over we have some serious issues as a society... I mean Bradley Cooper could just concentrate his problems away (apparently). If you can concentrate a problem away, it is not a mental illness that requires medication.<br /><br />Anyways, I see a lot of people like the movie, I can't really understand why. I simply didn't like it, no offense intended, I know a lot of people DO like it, so you can feel free to disagree. I found it insulting to people suffering from real mental illnesses.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Visually pretty but has no real instructions/explanations for bonus balls and it has glitches. The expectation is you clear a level with balls left over and you get 5 additional balls for the next round. I've cleared levels - somehow gaining many extra balls/points - and will have as many as 135 balls left only to be told I lost because I ran out. Happens often and turns a game from fun to frustrating.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Though some of the instructions for formatting a kindle book yourself were helpful, most of the book was above my level of knowledge. I read it from beginning to end and still don't feel capable.  It may have been written with people in mind who already have expertise in WORD. Mine is limited
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you've seen the musical, then you'll love this CD. It helps relive all the scenes in the musical. My daughter already knows all the lyrics and sings the songs constantly.
0307476073|4.0|This is another travel book I randomly ripped off the library shelves, and this is truly one of the best that I have read.  I respect the author for not only having the courage to do this adventure after losing her mother to cancer and her life hardships described in this book, but also her not only willingness, but excitement and descriptive detail of the gritty nuances of her life.  I haven't read many female authors who are forthright not only in their adventures, but sexual themes in an autobiographical adventure book.  This book truly is \\"wild\\" in some ways.<br /><br />Before reading this book about the Pacific Crest Trail along the west coast, I really didn't know that much about it.  The descriptive narration made me feel like I was really there, and having done long distance bicycle tours, I know what the hardships and struggles can be when you are all alone and the temptation to quit is near sighted in your mind's eye.<br /><br />She encounters generosity from strangers, a few creep-os, bears, coyotes, gets kicked off her camping spot, hikes for 80 miles in taped-up sandals, amongst other things.  I felt the book did a great job of also incorporating life experiences from the author that led her to inspire to follow through with this incredible trip.<br /><br />Read this!  Also, if anybody out there likes this type of adventure travel book, please also read my book \\"Travel By Two Wheels\\" by Jeff Commissaris, also available on Amazon.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is one of those movies that will make you think about what your life is all about.  I would watch it again and may go out and buy it so I have my own copy.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a very nice, high-quality USB to MicroUSB cable.  I appreciate that the cable is relatively small gauge and flexible but does its job of charging the unit and transferring data without issue.  I've bought a number of microUSB cables over the past few years, and this is definitely one of the best ones I've purchased.  I'd buy this again any time.<br /><br />Price wise, I think it's priced just about right.  It's definitely more expensive than some of the more value-priced items found here on Amazon and elsewhere, but is also higher quality than some of the least expensive options.  It's far less expensive than some of the options you'll find at your local retailer, while being equal or higher quality at the same time.  Trust me... your data will not transfer any better, nor will your device charge faster, if your cable says &#34;Monster&#34; on it vs this cable.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|I've been a HIM fan for about 10 years, love every album, and TOT doesn't disappoint. It's been on repeat in my CD player for 2 days straight and I still want more. I do like this better than Screamworks because it seems more \\"raw\\", but every HIM album is so unique that it's hard to even compare any of them. The day this CD dropped was also the day I became 1 year clean and sober, so it means that much more to me! :D I honestly can't name a favourite track because I feel I would be doing all the other tracks an injustice! Great job HIM! The only cons I would have to say is that the lyrics weren't included in the booklet, and Ville's vox could have been a bit louder on a couple songs. Still 5 stars though because damn this is a masterpiece. Thank you HIM for making music!
1932100660|5.0|This is an incredibly revealing study of the impact of nutrition on health.  it has literally changed my life.  As a result of the lessons learned from the book, my health has improved beyond the wildest dreams.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series.  Wish it was on more often!  The acting is wonderful with a good amount of humor.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|this book i bought for my kindle fire and is was okay. i tried to get into the book but it was boring to me. it didn't keep my interested from the beginning.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is the best series I've ever seen. I love Old English pieces. I liked earlier ones best. I like history pieces of English history and ways of life.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|...is the music. I have always enjoyed soundtracks because you get a sampling of many different artists. This CD was no exception. Great tunes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 is just as great as the first. It continues to build the different characters' stories and their life. My only complaint is sometimes it seems to fast forward in some parts, I would like to see some of the seens play out further, rather than, just lead up to them.<br /><br />I love that he Christmas special was included with this season.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I loved the book, so I watched the movie. I truly did not expect the voice quality out of some of the actors in the movie. They were excellent and even just listening to the soundtrack, the story brings me to tears. Wonderful CD to add to my collection.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Probably like so many before me I chose to watch the movie before reading the book. I wished I had read the book first. There was so much more to their story. The love connection between the characters is breath taking. Some of the words he says I know I wish some guy would come along and tell me those words. I have watched the movie several times and I still get that awesome feeling in my stomach when I watch it. I get the same feeling when I read this book. This book is definitely a must read for anyone who loves Nicholas Sparks or romance novels.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great book, loved all the info. Easy to read and keep all the characters straight. Found out a lot of things I had no clue about before
B008IJT0CE|5.0|night nurse insomniac tool... very versatile and easy too use.  great selection to choose from. binaurals really work! you wont regret buying this.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Amazing story! Amazing actors! Definately not for kids. I could go on to say how much this show has raised the bar, talk about what is going on and such, and explain just how great it is but instead I'll just say that this is my favorite show and I can't wait for season 3!
B002361MLA|5.0|A must read for anybody. Inspiring and liberating. Gives you hope and makes you realise you can concure anything. Thank you
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|From the moment I started playing The Room, I was hooked. I'm a bit slower at these games than the other reviewers, it took me more than two hours to finish the game, in fact, I started at 11:00 one night and played until I couldn't see straight. Every time I went back to the game I was totally engrossed- and why? There is a safe, a table, and a spotlight in an otherwise very dark and empty room.<br />You are given a number of puzzles of varying difficulty that will eventually lead you to the combination needed to open the safe. Stage one is complete and the puzzles continue.<br />My only complaint is one voiced by others, The Room is four chapters long, and about four chapters too short. I WILL be looking for a sequel and/or another great game from Fireproof Games. With such a great first effort, I can't wait to see what comes next.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart. The content is disturbing and it makes you think about society as a whole. The film is extremely well acted and the twist was not expected. It really is an awesome movie.
B00000K413|5.0|I listen to this just about every day in my car! I absolutely love it and love Tears for Fears :)
B008602KQI|4.0|For such a violent story, I was amazed at the way they were able to tell it without bombarding us with all the gore.

B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Really really enjoyed playing this game with all the challenges and clues given made this game a keeper for sure.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|The majority of the album is catchy with a few filler songs.  Overall, worth the money to get a leading star's album.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Not a very challenging game. I expected it to be more of a find and seek game when in reality it shows you everything so easily.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|AWESOME GAME and came on time. I recommend for anyone who is a fan of games with good story, turn based combat and a highschool feeling. Not many games put you in control of a highschooler who has to deal with grades, girls, managing time between friends,clubs, work, studying and also hopping into a TV world to DESTROY SHADOWS.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the site. Get so many great ideas on things i am interested in, like recipes,yard improvement,home improvement.<br />Always pick up a new idea when i visit. Keep up the good work
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Purchasing these blu-rays is the path to the dark side. Purchasing leads to revenue, revenue leads to profit, profit... leads to contentedness!<br /><br />The sale is tempting but so long as people continue to buy these, Disney may never release the unaltered versions. But a big enough outcry and we will be heard... and I believe Disney will answer us in the way Lucas never did. Please do not buy these blu-rays, or any version of star wars that is not the unmodified originals. The fate of the universe is in your hands.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is great for adults who love animation, science fiction and human interest mixed all together.  My husband and I truly enjoyed it, but it would not be appropriate because of sex and violence for children or perhaps even younger teens.
B002DJZJT8|5.0|Mark Wahlberg is so hot in this movie and Reese Witherspoon is great at any part she plays. Enough said.

141690977X|4.0|I read this book after seeing the movie, and it shed some light on excuses I had made to make myself hold onto relationships that were better let go of. I just wish I had read this sooner. At least now I know never to hold on when it's best to let go.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the whole game is good, and I think that travelling around the world to different places makes it more interesting. The places the characters visit gives us a insight into the countries culture.

Such a fun, good read and an interesting concept.<br /><br />I think this was the second book and it was pretty good, i liked how the author changed things up a bit. She wrote as' then and now' it was really cool how they matched up in the middle and made a perfect ending!<br />Fun summer read!
0446547646|5.0|This author is consistently good. This was a bit predictable, but it was still a great feel good novel, well worth the read.

B000U1ZV8K|4.0|These 4 movies was new and they arrived a lot sooner that I was told they would arrive. I had bought the 4 VHS copies when they first came out .Now I have them in DVD and they are great to watch.it was a great buy.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Its the story of an assistant district attorney whose son is charged with murdering a high school classmate. It is interesting, timely, enjoyable and diverting. A well written story, great plot, with some unusual and unexpected twists. Very hard to put down. High marks.

B004S5FWEC|4.0|A good sequel to the series. As usual it is difficult to put down until the very end of the book.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Basic and perfect for quick calculations. I'd recommend it to anyone who just needs a simple calculator very quickly.  Nice to have one for my kindle that was perfectly free.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this down! It was a page turner from the very beginning. I'm not usually a fan of thrillers or mysteries, so it was a pleasant surprise to find myself so engrossed in this book. I will definitely read her other works.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Boring, especially for someone who hasn't watched children [of all ages] actually play the game.  I've only had people talk about how hilarious it is.  Not for me.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it many times. I never knew so much about Julia Child, until I watched this movie. Meryl Streep was perfect for the part.  There is nothing that I disliked about it. I liked how they switched back and forth from Julia to Julie. An excellent movie, and I would recommend it to all my friends and family.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Oops, you say it wasn't made by Disney? I sure couldn't tell that while watching it. The whole spirit of the book was missing.

0385344333|1.0|So we have a long commute once a week, and she reads to me while I drive.  Recently, we've been reading this particular title, and I actually had to lock the windows today so she couldn't toss the book out onto the highway.  We were both completely outdone by the utter RIDICULOUSNESS of this book.<br /><br />I won't even talk about the horrid pacing, the idiotic FBI agent, the terrible way the cops are always portrayed as ineffectual buffoons.  I won't go into the way the author both bores and insults the reader by spending the first twenty chapters going around in really long drawn out circles about who we should be looking for in these roadblocks.  I won't even get into the laughably silly code shared between the victim and Mr. Reacher, a code that also draws things out like a piece of taffy being stretched on the event horizon, a code that Reacher magically cracks without a problem even though he's never met this strange person before in his life and they have no common frame of reference.  Nope.<br /><br />We got to the introduction of a character named Lester L. Lester.  My partner closed the book in disgust.  I joked and said the middle initial stood for Lester.  We parted ways, went through a whole 10 hour day, I picked her up, she went back to the book. Another character asked Lester L. Lester's middle initial stood for Lester.  THE ANSWER WAS YES.  And then I had to spend the rest of a three hour drive cooped up with a crazed reader who was literally screaming about the utter stupidity of what we are being asked to swallow in a book that isn't supposed to be a satire.<br /><br />I am totally convinced that Lee Child is trolling us all. That has to be it - nobody can write this unbelievably ridiculous tripe and actually be serious about it, can they?

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book really expresses how it feels to not be normal and really says that it doe not matter what is on the outside because what really matters is what is on the inside. Also great page turner. - A., 10-years-old.

B008D19WBQ|5.0|Personally, I think this BlueRay set is well worth it, even inf you already own the DVD set.  Being able to see edges of the screen allows for seeing new things that help make the show a little better.  Also, the quality of the videos is certainly better than the DVD discs were.  The only thing about this set of BlueRay disks that I don't like is that my Sony GoogleTV Disc player is not able to read the titles on the episodes and so it makes it really difficult to tell which episode I am on while viewing a disc.  I suspect a different blueray player may not have this issue but I would make sure before I bought this set.

B00A757EFW|3.0|It is ok, kind of like the original and like the original I am no good at it (LOL).  If you are good at pac-man and love the game it is well worth getting.
0449911357|5.0|I have watched the movie for years, but I never read the book until now. I just fell in love with it. I got so close to the characters that I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends when the book was finished. My dad once delivered furniture to one of Ms. Flagg's houses in Alabama. I would love to go back in time and go with him to talk to her. It's the perfect book to read on a beautiful Southern summer day while you sit in your porch swing and sip your tea.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|I dont really like mysteries but when i read this i found it surprisingly very good. I would suggest it.

B0094AH3MU|4.0|Verdi's 11th opera should have been a rousing success. It was commissioned for a London opening, Queen Victoria was in attendance, a good cast had been obtained with super-star Jenny Lind as Amalia and Verdi himself was to conduct a quite competent orchestra at Her Majesty's Theatre 22 July 1847. The music he wrote was an advance over his former works such as the absence of the obligate opening chorus and the concertato finale. Here the main character Carlo and the chorus set the scene and start the drama in high gear. Queen Victoria was displeased, the audience loved Miss Lind but not the opera. Back in Italy the work received scant attention. It was considered shocking, terrifying; depicting men who as the Robber chorus says like \\"stealing, killing, whoring and fighting\\". Just the sort of vivid action plot Verdi would favor for most of his career and successfully. But what went wrong with I Masnadieri? The problem seems to lie in the play that was the opera's source.<br />Frederich Schiller is considered one of Germany's most significant man of letters, up there with his close friend and colleague Johann von Goethe. As a reaction to the literary age of enlightenment, the German era of Romanticism was being ushered in by these two and others. The younger Schiller's first work was \\"Die Rauber\\" cast as a \\"Sturm und Drang\\" (Storm and Stress) play depicting a terrifying picture of society. It is a rage against oppresive society that deprives the individual his right to make his life as he wishes and to think as he wishes. (The Count dismisses his elder son Carlo who then takes up with other suppressed rejects of nobility-run society) The problem is Schiller went too far. His individualism ended in fanatic idealism as he was wont to do in other of his works used by Verdi; Don Carlo, Kabale und Liebe (Luisa Miller), Giovanna D'arco and even Maria Stuarde of Donizetti and William Tell of Rossini. But in the later works Schiller handled it better. In this Schiller's first work some of the dramaturgy is not well handled. The taking of his own life by the younger brother Francesco in the last act is convenient but not motivated sufficiently. Just as the killing of Amalia by Carlo is simply nihilist and awkward. (Budden in his work on Verdi says she was not supposed to be killed).<br />The music as a whole is good solid Verdi. At places it is quite beautiful and foreshadows things to come. Some arias are quite spectacular in character devlopment. The stage production is a mess; total Eurotrash. Ignore it. The singers are excellent. The young Venezuelan soprano Lucrecia Garcia sings beautifully and is skilled in this demanding role. Aquiles Machado is also an excellent singer and did well in his long role. Both need to mature and stop looking at the director all the time and especially when they are making love to each other. She needs to lose weight and needs some vocal refining. All the other roles were well done. Nicola Luisotti had the orchestra, chorus and singers under tight control and all played very well. It all sounded so good but...... there's that cluttered mess on stage. Oh well, put the disc on to play and go dust the furniture.work some of the dramaturgy is not well handled.

1439153663|5.0|This was one of our book clubs favorite books this year.  Interesting story with interesting characters, this is an author to watch.
0316223239|1.0|One of the worst books I've ever \\"read\\".  Unfortunately, I got the audiobook, which I think made it even worse.  There is only one thing original about this book, which is that it's told from the POV of a child.  Everything else is ripped straight from the headlines of 2 recent similar cases.  Unfortunately, the one original thing does not work.  At all!  The \\"voice\\" of the child is tedious, annoying, obnoxious & defies logic.  As others have said, one moment he (btw, the he sounds like a she on the audiobook) is using multisyllabic words & then in the same paragraph sounds like a babbling 2 year old that can't make sense of the most basic words.<br /><br />Also, while I understood why he makes proper nouns out of everything in the room, it makes for a very tedious read.  We are supposed to believe that Jack understands the concept of \\"cunning\\" lies & deceit, but at the same times uses 'words' like \\"fasterer\\" & the 'tall of the tree'.<br /><br />Perhaps if the author had interspersed the child's POV with an adults, it would have added a star.  As is, it's an unreadable mess.  It was torture to finish & I only managed to b/c I was recovering from a medical procedure & I could just lay there & listen. I would have given this 1/2 a star if I could have.  It was awful & I can't believe all the positive kudos for this book. If you must read it, get it from the library!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Exceeded my expectations. I had never heard Izabella before. Wow, it's unbelievable. I would highly recommend this to any Hendrix fan.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander, which is now 26 weeks on the NYT best seller list, is an autobiographical account of the near death experience (NDE) of a 60 year old neurosurgeon who taught at Harvard for 15 years and achieved high success in many professional publications, over 200 conference talks, and in surgical practice. A dedicated scientist who heard several NDEs from his patients during his long practice, he assumed that these experiences were mere symptoms of the dead or near dead brain. He contracted an extremely rare (1 in 10 million) bacterial meningitis which put him in a (Biblically suggestive) 7 day coma with a completely \\"dead\\" neocortex, which is the large part of the brain responsible for all conscious experience and much more. All previous cases lasting half as long as his affliction resulted either in death or a permanent vegetative state.<br /><br />Leaving aside for the moment the momentous question of whether his astonishing NDE was a mere biological symptom, the book is gripping as (1) a medical documentary and (2) an odyssey. Just as it's fun to read The Odyssey, The Aeneid, Dante's Inferno, and Milton's Paradise Lost (Eben's experience has striking parallels with Paradise Lost especially), Eben's book is worth reading as one of the greatest visionary stories of all time.<br /><br />His NDE was similar to most others, but amplified by the putative total flat-line of his neocortex. Unlike other NDE's, he had no memory of who he was during his visions, presumably because of his completely disabled neocortex. His consciousness was literally selfless and pure and went further and more vividly into a transcendent state of knowledge than all other documented NDEs. His experience of the divine is surely one of the most compelling ever narrated.<br /><br />He points out that prior to his NDE he was not really a skeptic of NDEs, for true skeptics at least read about what they are skeptical of, and prior to writing down his visions, he never read anything on the topic, for his scientific mindset was firmly entrenched and cursorily explained NDEs. Dedicated skeptics of this book have one major and one minor criticism in their favor. The major criticism is that he does not address a rebuttal by one neurosurgeon reviewer: that his visions could have occurred when his brain was reviving from the coma. The minor point, which I arrived at, is that, though he apparently achieved a miraculous, indeed the only, case of complete mental recovery, perhaps he does not admit that the 2 months recovery time he claimed was needed to regain all of his medical knowledge was in fact never complete, and he realized he must earn money in another way. After getting to know this person through the book and interviews, one would have to be an awfully enthusiastic conspiracy theorist to believe the minor criticism. Eben's appendix about the medical science that could explain his visions mitigates the major criticism but does not invalidate it.<br /><br />Faith always requires a leap from evidence. All evidence of the divine is circumstantial at best. (I'm haunted by the consistency with which the best of such evidence remains so precisely circumstantial). My broad reading in quantum physics, in the empirically established prescience in predator-prey and other animal interactions, and in the few well-documented paranormal events, leaves my scientific mind disposed to believe that Eben's NDE was indeed an encounter with a dimension of our universe that abuts the one us mortals experience, and that after death we will go to that dimension.<br /><br />In a clash of titans, Einstein debated Neils Bohr for several years over the implications of established facts that had already proven the validity of quantum mechanics. As one physicist framed this debate, \\"Upon its outcome rested the entire enterprise of science, and its triumph over superstition, religion, and magic.\\" Over years, in papers and at preeminent conferences, the debate swungone way and the other, with apparent victories undermined by a subsequent argument. In the end, Einstein, pale and shaking, conceded victory to Bohr.<br /><br />Since that monumental defeat of \\"the last great classical physicist,\\" science has reclaimed some of the battlefield it lost that day. But it did so at the expense of accepting proven postulates, like Bell's Theorem and the role of the observer, that, when actually read and understood as much as laymen can, are just as incredible as the claims that NDEs are visits to another dimension of the universe. Accepting those proven postulates--and not to accept them is to dismiss science--opens doors to accepting NDEs as proof of other dimensions of consciousness that await the expiration of our short little lives here.<br /><br />After reading this book, one has the option of assigning a probability that NDEs are visits to another dimension of the universe. Until now, this is what I've done with NDEs and several post-quantum cosmogonies. But the impact of this book on me was to force a decision 100% one way or the other. I chose to believe that Eben's NDE was a visit to the afterlife. I always remain open to new information that could change my mind, but for now I'm all in. Once all in, the implications are vast and deep in how one responds to life--life including death--and for me that journey has just begun.<br /><br />~Rob Laporte<br />Greenfield, MA
B007THA4FI|4.0|I think J.K. Rowling really deserves a huge amount of respect for being brave enough to break with her past in such a dramatic way.  Few books have an original idea and this one does.  Well written and concise.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|I was extremely pleased with the whole movie. I am not sure if the movie was historically correct, but they captured the spirit of Ghandi.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  Can't wait to see her in person.  I'll be on the lookout to see when she might be appearing near me.
B00BI745AA|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie musical in so many ways... excellent performances for the most part, wonderful score and cinematography, rousing anthems, sweet feature solos and duets, presented in a spacious audio mix.  Jackman, Bonham-Carter, Seyfried and Hathaway put on a great show.  Russell Crowe is a really admirable actor, but lacks the vocal range and malevolent gravitas that this particular role requires.  The depiction of enormous wealth disparity and class warfare rings true to our own times.  Overall, this is a &#34;keeper&#34; blu-ray.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|As I stated before, I'm just waiting until she comes to a place near me so that I can go and see her in person.  Excellent piano player and singer!

B00B0C6T34|3.0|This is a great CD that was mixed poorly. The songs are great and performed well. Something went wrong in the recording studio and did Swing Out Sister and disservice.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Very simple system that anyone with a tiny amount of willpower should be able to handle.<br />Encourages a better diet throughout the week.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I wanted to catchup on the seasons that I had missed.  Love the characters, bad and good.......... Sorry that this year will be the last season
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|The first song I heard off this album was \\"Off to the Races\\" and it struck me as so rare and different with its vintage hiphop sound, the drawl in her voice...I was hooked. When I got the album I learned that the rest of the songs are actually pretty different from that one, not a bad thing at all. I've grown to love each and every song on this album, especially \\"This is What Makes Us Girls\\", \\"Without You\\" and \\"Dark Paradise\\" \\"Born to Die\\"<br /><br />Lana has a unique sound unlike any other, her voice is lovely and carries the songs, giving them a deep feeling. It's a great album, give it a chance and don't expect cookie cutter sounds.<br /><br />Note, if you like her sound you should probably check out Marina and the Diamonds who's amazing, but with more of a pop sound and social commentary.
1401937519|5.0|I discovered from this book the infinite goodness of God.  Some sections were hard to read without crying, since the author was so sick.<br /><br />Another truth which she shared was how fear and anxiety can produce disease in the body and how they need to be dealt with.<br /><br />Her steadfastness in her knowledge of being healed even when the medical community denied it was truly remarkable and  shows how each person must take<br />responsiblity of themselves and their well being.<br /><br />This an uplifting account about the power, mercy and love of God.
B003HARV98|5.0|After hearing \\"How to Be a Heartbreaker\\" and constantly seeing Marina when scrolling through my social media, I decided to check out her debut album. Right off the bat, I completely loved it. Her voice is amazing, with its ride range, going from high to deep and carrying melodic and catchy tunes, saying lines in an interesting fashion, i literally could not put this album down.<br /><br />Every song is just.. yes. This album gets all the awards from me.<br /><br />What I love about Marina is her songs stand for something, they clearly express her opinion on social themes, she has a pop sound but has also done many of songs acoustically online.
1451695195|5.0|I loved this revelation of someone who has had to change their mind about the spiritual world after experiencing it for themselves.  Most of the medical profession are so focused on the physical that they discount the spiritual to the detriment of their patients.<br /><br />This was well written and the authors' experience plainly explained.  A must read for everyone.

B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I played the board game for the first time about 6 months ago and thought my grandkids would love this game.  I had given no thought to looking for an app version so I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up as the Free App of the Day.  So I put it on my phone and played it.  It plays exactly like the board game with some entertaining graphics included.  I immediately installed it on my wife's phone and her Kindle Fire.  Next I showed it to my grandkids, one boy, one girl, one is 10 and the other is 5.  Poppop was right.  They both loved it.  So now it is also installed on my granddaughter's Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I realize I got it free but it is well worth the price of $2.99.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It has different goal, very addictive. Kids love it, would be nice if they change it up a bit like Everton.th something new scene wise
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's amazing and love it! The realistic graphics are out of this world. The experience is supercallafragalisticexpealledoshis. Fun amazing fantastic good for all ages. And is worth the time to get.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game even my 4 year old loves it<br />I enjoy playing against facebok friends aswell . We compete to c who has the highest score and we all try to beat sch others score. A must have for all tablets.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it and can't wait for the next season to start.  The acting and costumes are superb!!!  Great series.
B00BZAJMWG|1.0|The entire story line of this film is absurd. But, for Hollywood, that's OK, so long as they can sign on several stars who are attracted to the roles (Cooper, Lawrence, DeNiro) and a marquee director - David O. Russell.<br /><br />The whole thing is simply a marketing contrivance: Bradley Cooper brings the female audience; Jennifer Lawrence brings the young male audience; Robert DeNiro brings the geriatric audience.  It's a boffo date movie for young couples and old married folks.  Who cares that it's a rather unlikable mess, as long as the Weinsteins fill the seats?<br /><br />As for Jennifer Lawrence, her performance was uneven at best, but the camera surely does love her face and her body, so I'm assuming that she won the Oscaar more for her future than for her actual performance.  She got lucky: she was up against actresses in three films nobody wanted to see (The Impossible, Amour and Beasts of the Southern Wild) and against Jessica Chastain, who is one of the most over-exposed and unlikable actresses currently working.  If you really want to see Lawrence at her best, watch \\"Winter's Bone\\".
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Even though there were no &#34;pop-outs&#34; in the movie, the depth and clarity way surpasses the 2d version. I have shown off my 3D TV using this movie to a few people who have already seen it in 2D and they were amazed at the picture! In fact while I was only gonna show them a few minutes of the movie we ended up watching the whole thing...beautiful picture.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Can't wait till the next season is available to buy. Love this seriers with all it's plot twist and mysteery
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Amazing new series.  Telling all my friends to watch.  The plot that carries from one week to the next is intriging.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Any fan of Thrones owes it to himself to get this amazing boxset. The picture and audio quality is gorgeous and it comes jam-packed with special features which enrich the viewing experience. The only negative is the gatefold packaging containing the blu ray discs, which looks prone to wear and tear. Highly recommended.
B000002JAX|5.0|I am not sure why audio snobs post what they do but this CD is good in a few tracks and great in a couple. If you want good music; this is what you will get. I loved the CD for what it is and it is hard to improve on that.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I first watched the piece on PBS and was inspired by that to buy the book. I really think the guy is on to something!
B003XRELGQ|2.0|This was not what I expected from such a renowned author and highly regarded book.  It was more distasteful than inspiring, although some quotes were amusing.  I will try another Vonnegut, but not for awhile.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The plot has some wonderful twists and turns that make you wonder what is real and what is not. Photography was spectacular.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|great graphics. passes time nicely. kills kindle battery.lots of reading so may be hard for younger kids to play. for free its great
0394721772|5.0|Love everything about Julia. This book is a classic.easy to follow and the results are fabulous. I always refer to this book if I'm in the mood of cooking French recipes.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|With apologies to Al Stewart, this pulp-fiction-meets-science-fiction-meets-historical-fiction tome written by the &#34;Master of Horror&#34; is a terrific diversion from the world of &#34;what is&#34; to the world of &#34;what was&#34; and ahead to the world of &#34;what might have been&#34;. It was most definitely worth my time.
0394721780|5.0|Love everything about Julia. This cook book is by far my favorite. Easy to follow and the result is fantastic.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This is for 2011 widescreen release on Blu-ray, it is rendered 1080p but, in my opinion not the best transfer avail, so for $30+ for the three disks..i am happy watching them again.
1451626657|4.0|I had to read this book for my college 20th Century American Literature class. We had to read it in two weeks, which seemed daunting with my other course load, but it was such a fun read, I had no issues getting through it.<br /><br />The book is hilarious! I loved the satire and hypocritical comedy throughout the book. It is my favorite book of the class (we read seven other books as well). It is a fantastic book for anyone high school age on up to read. I found it a bit too wordy in some parts and I think the novel could have been a little shorter.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters in this book so it is a little hard to keep them all straight. Each character has some specific, differentiating quality about them though(usually a funny one!) that makes it a little easier. This book is also great in that you could easily put it down for a few weeks and come back and get right into it no problem.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|Extremely boring couldnt make it past the first 20 minutes. Even used fastforward about 20 minutes and it felt like the same scene.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a awesome game!! But the thing is , it does not have eggs,<br />So you can't plant crawlers or zombies , it also is awesome , my friends<br />And ME talk about it , we even spent 20minutes talking about it and we missed class!!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Awesome movie, I just wish the main character, Andy Whitfield, was still with us and had starred in part 2. He was such a talented man and played this roll so well. I haven't even purchased part 2 just because I don't think it will be 'the Spartacus' I've come to know and love with Andy playing the part.<br /><br />Lots of blood and gore in slow-mo for the guys, and lots of love and romance even for the gals.
B00BQI4AU6|3.0|There's a level of taste and quality in the songs that is above average compared to most releases today. Tom sings with a more normal voice, so the high pitched raucous voice is mostly absent, but still very impressive and melodic.    The album does start to drag by track 9 and becomes more generic with no surprises, for five tracks, so that takes away something for me. The rock songs made the mistake of being hard and loud somtimes in place of having a real edge - something which all the rockers seem to fall prey to as time goes by. Album could have been shorter. And for some reason, many songs fade out very fast. Loudness brickwalling is here too, though not as harsh as most.    Looks like 'Cinderella', Ratt and Dokken are releasing good music well into this second decade - beating most of their old contemporaries.
0671646788|5.0|And after reading it, they will thank you for changing their lives! I'm a very optimistic person, my hubby not so much. So I ended up ready most of the book out loud to him because after reading the back cover, I just couldn't keep all of this great info to my self.<br /><br />A must read addition to your library!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A rollicking good time is had by all, mostly the readers of this zany novel about a bookstore, it's owner and his workers.  There is a secret organization at work, however, among the devotees of this particular bookstore.  A coast to coast plan to figure out the purpose and goal of the organization combines the elder owner, his young adult staff, Google wizkids and the true love of books, culture, reading and life as it rushes ahead with new gizmos and technical know-how.  It is fast moving, fun, intriguing and well written.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Such an easy read and it keeps you guessing what is going to happen next.  I would highly recommend all of the Clifton Chronicles and can't wait for the next edition.
0060191325|5.0|Read a critical Amazon review after receiving this book as a gift from my mate. After reading the review, critical of the author and context, I layed the book aside for six years. Big mistake. After she left in frustration I read the book. I recently bought two copies, one for bride, one for the groom. I think I've bought a total of seven copies of this book - to hand out to men who need it. I now have most of Dr. Grey's books. It's true what they say: &#34;Men just don't get it.&#34; This book helps.
B00439MV42|5.0|I choose this movie cuz my hubby told me I had to watch it and that it was a great movie and it turned out to be a great movie. I love the actors in the film and I love the comedy in it as. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed this book on my kindle, I almost always pre order any book by Mary Higgens Clark.  The short chapters, easy mystery and writing style are all familiar and I'm never disappointed.  Mary never seems to be in a rush at the end of the story as some authors are it's like they suddenly realize they have to wrap the story up.  I believe she always know where the story is going from the beginning and I like going along for the ride.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|I choose this rating cuz for one thing I love harry potter movies and to they are just really good movies. I love everything about this movie and I would recommend this movie for everyone.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal minds always gets the stars because it always keeps me intrigued.  I download it and watch it while I work out at the gym. 40 minutes of pleasure while I get healthier.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I choose this rating cuz the magic puzzle app was fun and it mad some boring time fly by but after about a day the app started to mess up it would not load properly and I had to delete it I would not recommend this app to anyone.
B004N622EY|5.0|the plot and characters were great i love the twist and the killing off of heros when you least expected
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I choose this rating cuz  I love this movie it is a adventure and is funny I would recommend this movie to everyone
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love it honestly but my friends got a update and for some reason it wont update on mine! Help please!!!
B00271DNP4|5.0|I choose this rating cuz I just love the harry potter movies. they are a mystery and a adventure to watch. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The best book since the first, it does not bounce around endlessly and the characters are finally coming together instead of each having a separate story. It has finally become about The Dragon reborn once more....
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Secrecy and immaturity meets young love with all types of drama as a result of two products of dysfunctional  families. The surprises were well placed but not nearly as juicy as they could have been. The relationship between Abby and Travis gets so confusing it turns predictable making it hard and almost useless to hope their relationship lasts. I expected more intense drama. And less emotional turmoil from the seemingly confident buy really insecure protagonist, Abby.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH FUN. LET'S PLAY IN THE MOUNTAINS AND ALASKA PLEASE.I PLAY ALL THE TIME. MY KIDS LOVE IT ALSO.
B001XRLWPQ|3.0|The program is as I expected.  The quality of the DVD is not good.  The sound of the DVD has issues and it disappears from time to time.  On top of it, the volume of the sound during the episode is up and down and it is so frustrated to continue to adjust the volume or listened to silence episode.
052118939X|5.0|This book is divided into small units. Each unit starts from easy examples up to more complicated ones. Its a very good book that I recommend for Med level foreign English speakers.
B000QE1U9K|2.0|too much conversation, pack of full bla bla bla bla no action nothing, producers and director forget to keep the line of alien and aliens, well for the group this is a terrible alien, nothing to do with the one and two, don't get sleep and try to see it in parts or days.....bad
B00471TLZS|5.0|Nice transfer.  One of my all time favorites. &#34;There is no death.&#34;  &#34;Honey, Tweety can't smell a thing.&#34;  &#34;Throw it into the light!!!&#34;
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Terrific Movie.  Matthew McConaughey was excellent!!!!!!!!  So glad I bought the movie.  I love it!!!!  I love it!!<br />Love it!
B0085LMFAE|5.0|If you have the chance to see the PBS special on the making of the album don't miss it.  It was the reason I went back and bought the album and added it to my collection.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|In the acknowledgements of the book Cline thanks the people at Warner Brothers for realizing that his book would make a good movie. That is true so.far as movie producers seem to like cheap gimmicks.<br />I do not think the book is a cheap gimmick. The book is solid with all the required parts. The problem is that it cones off somewhat as nerd pandering.  So much so that the nerds walked over the line to fork and back quite a few times. I font Wang this to all sound negative, the book managed to hold my attention and the chase was fun!<br />Besides the pandering, the main problem was that the story seemed confused in its message. The charictors loved there VR world, but the author kept hinting that the VR world was corrupting all the people in it. That is a confused message. Did the OASIS keep the people from having a better world of was this a great place that gave the chance for equality to the people.<br />If the message was clearer I believe this would have been a much better book. As it is the book is a solid 3 (worth your time to read you will not remember it in a month).
B00797MB0O|2.0|I did not like this movie and I didn't think it was funny.  I found it hard to watch.  War of the Roses is a dark comedy this was NOT! It should have been listed as a drama.  I have seen drama's and horror movies have funnier moments than this movie.<br /><br />I thought Charlize did a great job and so did her disabled partner in crime.  I thought the ending was different from what was expected which thanks to that ending I gave it an extra star for daring to be different.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Some ok scenes, but overall it's just sad. Definitely mislabeled as comedy. Can be used as a guide on what to avoid to keep a relationship healthy.
B002413TY2|4.0|For mindless, leave the brain in neutral, action movie, this is probably as good as it gets. Some of the chase scenes are a little too unbelievable for my liking, however.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was so much more in depth. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Suzanne is a great story teller cant wait to read the other two books.
B0086700CM|1.0|well designed and fun. I am just not a gamer, however I can see where people would become addicted, if they had that gamer-gene
B007TNS6JI|5.0|very awesome game. plays good and graphics are nice. storyline is decent. and items any gear interaction on key. if you like button mashing rpgs you will like this.
B003K16P3M|1.0|awful, the whole plot left a lot to be desired and the main character was lame. I cannot believe it got such great reviews
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I loved this movie so much, I seen it when I was younger as I was growing up and I cant get enough
B003B02O7I|5.0|It was a gripping story ... lots of twists and turns.  There were so many characters to love and to hate.  It was great.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|i received my movie. i watched it the night that i got it and i just want to thank you!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I originally saw this on Broadway in New York and fell in love immediately.<br />Have since seen twice in traveling groups but never the same magic.<br />This helps to recreate that magic of Broadway.
B0060CV7YK|5.0|I HAVE LOVED THIS SINCE CHILDHOOD!  THE THEME, THE MAGIC, THE LOVE THAT DEVELOPS BETWEEN THE CHILDREN & THE ADULTS, AND OF COURSE THE STAR,  ANGELA LANDSBURY, MAKE THIS A FABULOUS FAMILY MOVIE!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Had never seen this play before or read the book.  Absolutely fell in love with the story line, the music, the characters and the interplay of the movie.  The music still plays in my head.  Had to have the CD to remind me of the magic.  The actors in this version are absolutely superb!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is a fantastic reminder that there truly are happy endings - even if they come in the weirdest ways.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|One of my many games of this type. It does as it promises and works glitch free. I enjoy this game. Great for Kindle. Have fun gamers every where!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great and wonderful movie actors were sharp! The movie had heart. It makes you think &#34;what would you do if found in a situation as this?
B005LZW8FO|5.0|It makes us reflect upon the consequences of our actions and on the possibility of redemption. It encourages us to take risks in the direction of right, honest relationships with others. Moving.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincoln was a wonderful movie. It took me back to a historical era where congress was just as it is today. Steven Spielberg did it again. The whole cast was wonderful!!! movie was well put together so real to life. Great move need to see if you have not seen it!!!
B001FB55H6|1.0|This came in a dvd case with an obviously home printed cover art.  The disk was scratched to s*** and was covered in fingerprints.
B008MM9630|5.0|love this game  a++++++++++++++++t over and over try it you will love it too<br />A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Got to try this games now i think you will love it
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Well written and interesting.  The action moves quickly and the plot has twists and turns.  An enjoyable read that you will find fundamental to the Harrington story.
B0007939NO|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether they've seen it before or not.  It has all the elements to make a movie memorable:  drama, comedy, sadness, love and a great ending.  I first saw it many years ago (around 35 yrs) and it was good enough to stay in my memory and make me extremely glad to find it on Amazon.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|Omg I loved this CD no matter what her music is always awesome, I enjoyed singing to umbrella my fav. song on the CD. My friends loved it and we danced along to please don't stop the music:)
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it enough that, when it came to town as a stage play starring Richard Harris, I was more than eager to see it again.  The music is unforgettable and perfect for each scene they put it in, the acting is unforgettable and real.  This brings the myth of King Arthur and his beautiful wife, along with her tragic lover, to life in a beautifully haunting way that grabs your heart and doesn't let go.  The writing and photography is perfect in every way.  This is a movie everyone should see!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This by far is the best Mahjong came, multiple games and different screen shots so you are not playing the same game over and over
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this new Yahoo mail...It is so much easier to use and see my mail now that it makes everything bigger.....
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun game most people would like the ease of seeing the tiles.  Quick and fast for all ages from 2-100
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I only recently became acquainted with this series. And we most certainly enjoy it. The historical setting and the contrast between the aristocracy and the working class provides a most striking insight into life in the England of the teens and twenties of the 20th century--a time when great change was transforming society. We find the characters compelling and a story line with enough plot twists and humor to keep the series truly entertaining.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|While not 100% of the boardgame, its a truely great single-player adaptation.  The little cinematics can get old but mostly can be turned off in the options and are really great the to watch once in a while.  They have managed to capture the feel of the game and most of the rules/options. Really worth the money if you like the boardgame, or just like playing boardgames in general.  There are 2 peices of add-on content for purchase.  Both are excellent though i would argue that they are a little expensive.
B00CBKXGPI|1.0|Let me start by saying that I have owned and played the PC version of Art Mogul for over a year, and I love the game.  The main problem with the app is that a phone screen is just not big enough to play the game.  The game can't be enlarged very much, and when one is trying to find small items in intricate paintings it is nearly impossible to click on the right place.  I would absolutely recommend the PC version of this game.  I do not recommend the phone app.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I just hope that they follow through and release the entire series and not stop half-way through. Beautiful, great sound, and worth of a trip back to my favorite teen-age sci-fi universe.
B000286RKW|5.0|This movie is a must have for any movie collector, its really one of the best gangster movies you can watch
B000PMLFRA|5.0|All 3 films in a case the size of a single blu-ray case. You get all 3 movies without taking up a bunch if extra space.
B000XA5K48|5.0|SHOOT EM UP is awesome, If you like Clive Owen you will like this movie, tons of action, very underrated movie in my opinion and priced nice all over amazon
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I have been making para cord projects for over a year now. I have known about this book for sometime, but I just finally bought it. I had used several of J.D.'s designs, so it was only fair I spent some money with him.<br /><br />I bought this as a Kindle book, which is a two edged sword. One one hand, the pictures are gorgeous; on the other, there is only one picture per page at the size I like, so I have to keep turning pages. Just something to think about.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|This processor is a very nice one. Being a i3, 3.3Ghz, it will work fine.<br />The fan is noticeably loud. I think it's just a cheap fan.
B001KTATIS|5.0|Great movie. Combines horror, history and x-rated perversity that doesn't seem to know where to draw lines. Don't show it to children or sensitive people. Delivery was good. Condition as advertised.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|Teaches about the best way to approach swimming for every type of swimmer. Rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all strategy on the reader, the authors help to develop technique that works for each individual body type and style of swimming as well as the swimmer's goals. The theory and rationale behind what they teach is laid out simply and in plain language. There are also many many photos to help those who learn from visual cues.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game brings me back to my youth in the horse barn. I can't believe that it's so realistic! Simply gorgeous graphics.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Like the game. kept me on my toes remembering where I had to go back to and make next steps.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Kinda boring not US shows It's a great idea but you need more channels and with popular shows here in the US as well as overseas
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I first watched Before Sunset without having seen Before Sunrise and it took my breath away. The entire film consists of conversations in real time as Jesse and Celine stroll through Paris. I am eager to see what's in store for these two beloved characters in Before Midnight
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Nicholas Sparks chose to set this romantic novel in one of my favorite places -- Oriental. Although I love his work the premise is mostly repetitive: boy meets girl, parent/s hate boy and they separate only to reunite at a later time. The twist as the end was somewhat surprising but predictable regarding donor.<br /><br />I do enjoy reading his novels because they're simply written with good dialogue and short.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This should absolutely be nominated next year.  For first time writer/director Dave Grohl, this is a amazing feat.  Well done, entertaining, educational, captivating, star studded and all around feel good film.  A great piece of filmmaking!  I can't recommend it enough.
B005P89F1C|3.0|Other than Mariah's catchy tune redone as a duet, this is a very forgettable Christmas album.  But then, I'm in my 60's and certainly NOT the Bieber devotee I might have been if I were a tween!
B00457X8BC|3.0|This is one of my favorite series, both the books and the British series with Kenneth Branagh (I've also watched several of the Swedish episodes). This is my least favorite book and least favorite episode, but it WAS interesting. Instead of being set in Sweden, it's centered in and around Riga, Latvia. Spoiler: the most interesting character is killed off early on and what's left is a mishmash of Latvian characters that personally, I didn't really care about. The storyline seems a bit contrived in my opinion. I love reading about different places, so that was okay, but this was a bit heavy on the politics, I thought.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I'm a nut for the Bourne series, and Renner brings top notch excitement to this installment.  Hint: Renner rides motorcycles in real life.
0345803485|2.0|I'm a male, yes, but I was wondering what the hype was about. It's not particularly scandalous. Quite predictable. Certainly not a \\"Hope they serve beer in hell\\" or \\"Confessions of a Homewrecker- 100 Tales of Sex\\"- level of scandal or entertainment.<br /><br />I gave it a try and read every word of this (Part 1). I will not be reading part 2 or 3, however.<br /><br />Congrats to E.L James for marketing savvy because she fooled me and 70 million others.
B008Y7Y0AM|4.0|I'm a huge fan of their early stuff, and a lot of their more recent offerings just don't enthrall me the way I anticipated.  This album goes a long way toward redeeming them IMHO, and the upcoming EP sounds like it will take no prisoners.
B007HO392S|4.0|I love the song Black Cadillac. I really enjoy Carrie Underwood. I have followed her since Idol. The CD is easy to listen too and could be one of her best. It is, however, the same as all of her others. If you enjoy classic Carrie, you will love this. If your looking for something different from her, this is not the one.
B00985E3UG|5.0|It was very informative and has raised my level of observing what I eat, all three, salt sugar and fats.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|This is a good movie. It wont keep you on the edge of your seat, but it wont put you to sleep either. Anything with Mathew in it is ok by me.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|The songs were well chosen. Is the whole recording available that was on bps several years ago? Can you e-mail me the answer?
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I didn't enjoy this movie, and wish I had rented it instead of purchasing it. However, in all fairness, this type of movie is not really my cup of tea. I like the main character, and felt she did a great job. Just didn't enjoy the story line.
B005E3ZMZ6|5.0|Really cool !!!! Great story behind the music !!!!! Like all of King Diamonds work a true masterpiece!!! This album has it all amazing guitarwork!!!Great singing!!! Awesome drums!!! Bass that owns!!!! Heavy with great lyrical and musical content.
1400069807|5.0|This is a common sense idea. We all know that sale, sugar, and fat are hard for our bodies. this book just drives the concept home with hard facts. Sometimes it is hard to acknowledge the obvious until it smacks you in the face. And that is just what these facts will do. I will never look at salt, sugar, or fat the same way again. I have spend 15 years working in the food distributor industry, and I will never view that process the same either. Shocking.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|You won't like this book if your favorite part about the movie was Brad Pitt. I've been following baseball for only a year or two and found this book to apply to much more than just the sport. I now rely on objective observations in my work and don't let subjective issues taint a valuable resource or individual.<br /><br />I'm sure I could write a review that makes me seem like a sports reporter, praising Billy Beane or criticizing Art Howe. But I didn't get that from the book. I saw this as an example of what math can teach us. All of those scouts Billy fired must have wanted to jump ship by the time they left. I use the knowledge I got from this book in my business dealings, thwarting anybody that wants to challenge with my data and give them the numbers to allow them to come up with any better solution.<br /><br />Great book, it gets a little technical if you aren't baseball savy, but you can keep up if you're comfortable with numbers and can keep all the names straight when they're scouting and trading.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I got this for my niece's baby shower and she absolutely loved it! It was the one of a kind!!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|And yet another winner by J.T.  I do not think this man knows how to make a bad song!  Sensual, groovy, and sure to put you (and your partner) in a good (or even THE) mood.
1451695195|4.0|Ironically enough, neurosurgeon Eben Alexander, went through a major life change that makes anyone want to question life itself, of which he wrote about in his book Proof of Heaven. Dr. Alexander left Harvard in 2001, because he was tired of \\"medical politics.\\" In 2006 he moved to Lynchburg, Va. there he did research on less invasive forms of brain surgery through X-rays, and digital scanners. Quickly after, meningitis got to him. In 2008 Dr. Alexander got bacterial meningitis, it soaked his brain and he ended up in a deep coma.<br />He was going to write a scientific paper that would explain what he experienced. He went through a deep coma where he had an out of body experience. During that week, his life almost slipped away. He now says, he was living intensely in his mind. He was reborn into a mucky Jell-o-like substance and then guided by \\"a beautiful girl with high cheekbones and deep blue eyes\\" on the wings of a butterfly to an \\"immense void\\" that is both \\"pitch black\\" and \\"brimming with light\\" coming from an \\"orb\\" that interprets for an all-loving God.<br />I recommend this book to people who are looking for questions being answered towards religion, or life in general. This just might help you, you might want to keep an open mind when reading this book of course.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for Season 4 to start already!  The setting, the writing, the acting, is all very good quality.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Unless you can fork over buckoo bucks for the Hi-Rise stand that Twelve South offers, this is the next-best choice. I have two of these... one at the office, and one at home. It makes &#34;docking&#34; my MacBook Pro next to my Thunderbolt monitors a simple process, and delivers just the right amount of elevation to still use my laptop screen as a secondary display. Highly-recommended.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Disk in fairly good condition, a little bit of scratching on it, but does not affect the playing quality at all. Arrived quickly.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|It is great when it is working. I often have to uninstall and reinstall because the screen goes black and it shuts it's self down.
B008602KQI|3.0|I guess it would have been too difficult to make the movie really follow the story as it was written...
B003Q6CUAI|3.0|no a bad read, only brought it to see what all the fuss was about, not a good diet for long term health,<br />but a few good ways to loose that pesky 2-3 kgs.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|nice to see him back again - definitely an adult drama but great acting all around<br />James is a superb actor also
0385360169|2.0|Hi my name is Anastasia (Ana) Steele and I am about to graduate college and I need to mention I am a VIRGIN.  Somehow I have managed to make it through college without owning a computer.  I made friends with a rich girl and live in an apartment with her - which is great because she can lend me some really hot clothes - oh did I mention that I am a VIRGIN.  My really rich friend writes for the school paper - she has somehow managed to get an interview with one of the world's richest, most successful businessmen.  Unfortunately on interview day she has the flu - and she asked me to cover for her.  I do no prep work, no research - what do you expect I do not own a computer after all!!!  Anyway I do have her list of questions so off I go to interview Mr. Christian Grey.  This guy is hot, in fact the first time I see him upon entering his office, I trip and fall on my face.  He reaches for me ..  our hands touch ....  Bam electricity ... my INNER GODDESS perks up ...  hot, hot, hot.  I start of my list of questions, flush every time this beautiful/gorgeous man looks at me and my INNER GODDESS is screaming ...... for hot sex (but I am a virgin, with no experience at all - in fact I have hardly ever been kissed, let alone touched \\"down there\\") .......<br /><br />Hi I am Christian Grey, filthy rich and successful entrepreneur, but most importantly I am HOT, HOT, HOT.  In fact in addition to being one of the most successful/rich men in the world, I am probably one of the hottest, most gorgeous.  Well, I don't really view myself that way, I have a lot of baggage and really deep inside I am just an abused 4 year old boy and get my sexual kicks by beating women into submission.  Yep, I am a DOM (dominant) and my women need to be SUBS (submissive).  Don't believe me?  Well my women have to sign a contract so they will know exactly what I expect from them and also to sign a NDA (non-disclosure agreement) because after all I am one of the most successful, well known businessmen in the world (take that Bill Gates!!!) and I can't have any of my SUBS telling any of my little secrets plus more importantly they need to know how to please ME.<br /><br />Ana & Christian:  Is this a match made in heaven or what.  Shy, uncertain, inexperienced Ana (shall be say she comes off as SUBmissive at first glance) meets beautiful, worldly, self-assured DOMinant male.  Here goes her INNER GODDESS again ....  Of course, our poor heroine doesn't know what she is getting herself into.  So off we go ..... on the incredibly boring journey of this pair of \\"lovers\\".<br /><br />I knew going in this story was fanfic based on the Twilight series but supposedly with an adult/erotic storyline.  It finally made it to my listen list (audiobook) so I decided to see what the big deal was all about.  Honestly, it is much ado about nothing!  Plot, well, there really isn't one.  In the first book it is only about the great sex Ana has with Christian.  Now remember she is a sexually inexperienced 20 something but somehow she is constantly listening to her INNER GODDESS (wish I would have had this on my kindle as it would be interesting to see how many times that phrase is used - it is used ad nauseum) and the first time she has sex with Mr. Gray she gives him the BJ of his life (and this is one sexually experienced guy here) and he gives her multiple-orgasms (he does know what he is doing after all).  Mr. Grey is surprised by how much he enjoyed the vanilla sex (he is used to B&D in his playroom) ..  book consists of much soul-searching, *hot sex, flushing, hot sex, Ana constantly asking stupid questions that she knows will piss this guy off (but this is, I guess, considered \\"character development\\" by this author) hot sex, wanting to please \\"her man\\" but having a problem with the SUB/DOM thing (but hey, some of this kinky stuff is kinda fun)  ........I could run on and on but all of this has been said before.<br /><br />I hadn't read reviews of this book before starting - but looking at them now it is refreshing to see out of 19,000+  there are 5,000+ 1 star-rankings which really hits the nail on the head.  I am giving 2-stars solely for the fact that Becca Battoe (narrator of the audiobook)  was able to actually make it through without cracking up - she is a true professional ha! and I certainly hope she was well paid, she deserved it.  maybe in addition to monetary payment she got an Audi?<br /><br />The next book is now up on my audiobook selection but I don't think I can make it through.  I will read the 1-star reviews first and I imaging they will give me all the \\"plot\\" progression I need to know.  My INNER GODDESS is telling me to take a pass!<br /><br />*my assemption of the authors def of \\"hot sex\\"<br /><br />I read a review that said if you didn't know better you would think this book was written by a teenage girl .. I would take it a step further .. a group of teenage girls at a sleepover using google and books/magazines from their dads (ha ha) porn collection .....<br /><br />Happy Reading (but not this one)king at them now it is refreshing to see out of 19,000+  there are 5,000+ 1 star-rankings which really hits the nail on the head.

0738711500|5.0|Explains everything very easily and beautifully. This was such a random gift and it turned out to be a perfect one.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The app is not completely useless. However, I wish it was at least as good as the mobile site. I also wish the messaging setup was a little more... notifying.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Fun if you dont look closely at plot points that make sense.  If you need a plot that makes sense is required you may not enjoy this movie.  This is a typical Micheal Bay movie - great looking and fast moving with crazy characters that make illogical decisions but then the fun action hits so quickly afterward you dont have time to think &#34;um, did he really think that was the best choice?&#34;.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is a wonderful game. The graphics are beautiful, and the story keeps you completely involved. This is definitely one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Enjoyed this film! Lots of action !! Didn't slow down at all! Highly recommended if you love action violent martial arts movies!
B000RF7XYO|5.0|I loved this movie as much as the first time I'd seen so beautifully done, on VHS. In the DVD, the costumes, the english landscape, so real, so green, and the chamber music  played perfectly for which all became alive to me. Cate Blanchett was born to play this role, young Elizabeth.  The story was so well written, not a lot of movies do that to people, transport one back though this one did. I have watched it many times and I must tell you, all the actors were on target. The DVD is even brighter in color and if one wants a history lesson, this would be the one to purchase.  If you love English History, well, I can't think of a better way to start your collection.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|He is an absolutely remarkable singer-love everyone of his songs and I've played this CD everyday since I've received it.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I tried three different cases for the kindle fire and none of them fit my needs.  Either it didn't stand up on its own right or it the material didn't feel comfortable or the material was so soft I was in fear for the safety of my kindle.  This is the best case ever.  Material feels nice when you hold it, snaps in place so it wont fall out of the case and it looks great! Highly recommend!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I have listened to this everyday since I bought it-he is remarkable and it sends chills through me every time I hear him sing.  Such talent.  Bravo!
B007704PRU|3.0|It's hard to relate to the terribly wrenching and intense feelings of the main character. I think I used to feel so strongly about every little thing when I was 15. In any event the book starts slow, but I enjoy the bit of action in the middle. The romance is predictable. So is the ending.<br /><br />Kills a couple of hours.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|Superb,gripping account of the little man whose book &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; probably claimed a 5th victim beside the four innocents of the Cutter family, slaughtered in Holcomb, KS 1959 - Capote himself.  Like the book which is a physiological drama rather than a murder mystery it took years for Capote to finish it.  Capote was a master manipulator.  Only negative is the audio is very low on this film.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you like Quentin Taratino this is one of his best.<br /><br />Certainly not to be considered a serious documentary on the times,  the Director loves to overstate in all of his movies. This he does with the causes, the reactions and of course, the violence.  The only weak part of the film is Quinton's acting in the small part he assigned to himself.<br /><br />Wonderful artistic camera angles and scene setups.<br /><br />JFS
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've now watched season 1 & 2 about 4 times and it only gets better.  Looking back to the beginning of the drama one can see the birth of each twist in the tale.  Huzzah for Julien Fellows..
B009S33I68|5.0|I spent a tour in RVN flying helicopter gunships. I was truly impressed with how Harold More verbalized many of the thoughts and feelings I experienced. The preface should be read over and over by those that make the decisions to send young men and women to war.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If you love iron man and war machine this is for you it has lass ers  . Explosions, machine guns etc.  So this is totally awesome gems are easy to earn and gets  progressively harder. But not to hard it does require an extra download but is worth it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love it! Bar None!! It's way better than The Weather Channel App. or The Weather Bug App. and I had them both. I installed then both on my tablet and my phone.  The only down fall about this App. is if you install it on an iphone it doesn't have all the features like it has on an google phone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books of all time. If you get get the first book and read it, it's hard not to get the others!
B0057RCFQS|5.0|My kids loves all Jurassic park movies, with 3d version coming out, they got excited n wanted to watch all of them. Great family entertainment
B008476HBM|5.0|Don't want to be repetitious with other reviews. It is an  awesome book - Witty and at times comical. Jane Austen at her best. I have an &#34;off the rack tablet&#34; and purchased the kindle version. I haven't experienced any issues as others have with this version. Came through crystal clear with a full page of print - no problems at all.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The controller I received was a knock off didn't have Sony on it and even the package said not endorsed by the Sony company. When I order it said Sony dual shock 3 wireless controller but its not. If you value your money don't buy unless you want to be rip off.

B00633W614|5.0|A great follow up  to Cain and Abel.  I enjoyed it immensely and are now into the third book (which follows<br />Sins of the Father) The Prodigal Daughter.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|i really like his music didsn,t know i would but i do hes different but very kool i saw him on tv really liked so then  i had someone go buy it for me
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was great! I have not seen the movie and will do so soon. I like to read the book first
B007L6VR12|5.0|Ok, I will try.  Quirky funny characters, loveable characters, hateable characters, flawed but trying characters...beautifully written and played parts in this movie.<br /><br />The story line is hilarious and beautiful.  I would say it's the best of all the films by this director.<br /><br />And I cannot say enough about the stars in this.  They did not play their parts like movie stars...as you watch, you forget it is them, they are raw and vulnerable and endearing for who they are in these 2 hours.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for easy entertainment. It's easy to play while watching tv. Sure beats the old days Andy h Richards that were all ddogearred
B005HED11Y|5.0|We love the original Star Trek show for its portrayal of heroic men and women putting themselves &#34;out there&#34; and going beyond the mediocre and predictable to achieve the seemingly impossible.  It's great to compare the pilot episodes with the rest of the first season to see the growing vision of cast and ship.  Terrific!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|While it can be very frustrating it rapidly becomes very addictive. I have not been this addicted since the old days of crochet and space invaders
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Detailed without getting bogged down in details, the only issue is that book 2 isn't out yet.  Sanderson has shown skill at keeping series moving and exciting so I am hopeful (and hooked)
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Wonderful insights into our responses and reactions to stimuli. It's a comforting look at ourselves that I have never seen before. It has been an enormous help in boosting my way of dealing with myself.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Thank you to the CIA agents, thank you to our military for their service.  Great movie.  We all know the end result, but, the dedication of all involved is amazing.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love the new Oxford dictionary of the book.  I FEEL THIS BOOK SPEAKS TO ME AND I HOPE IT SPEAKS T OK YOU
B00BUCXVPI|3.0|Firstly the trailer makes this movie out to be a nonstop action movie. This is not the case. It does have bits of action in it, You saw most of it in the trailer. The movie to me was more like a crime drama. The main characters came together to solve a crime. It was okay I would have much rather rented it  instead of buying it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had this book read in a very short time. it was a great book  you couldn't  put it down. Highly recommend if u r a female to read this one.
B006T9PI5I|5.0|Love this movie. I use to watch this movie when i was younger. I was so happy to know that i was able to rent it on Amazon so that I can watch this movie with my boyfriend's daughter. Thanks Amazon!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game when they got it for the kindle fire I was super excited.  I am as o like the way the way the fan err started instigating &quot; your friend passed u are u going to take that&quot; lol funniest thing ever :)
B0074PNCRM|5.0|What a well written book about love and illness. After a long time a book has made me cry and that is partly due to the sarcasm and with and the un-pityful manner in which the author makes you feel not only so sad for the characters but also so grateful for my health.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to my friends and family. John Green is a star
B00BGICGJ8|3.0|Overall, not a great movie but definitely had some funny moments. I thought this movie was more of a comedy but it turned out to be really more sad in parts than anything.  The movie gets somewhat depressing but the husband/wife make for an interesting couple.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|It's slow, plodding, moody, depressing and boring, ( I loved &#34;Tree of LIfe&#34;). If you're feeling at all suicidal, don't watch this movie
B00CATSONE|3.0|I was waiting for a copy on a NIKOLAS TESLA Historical Novel to review when I stumbled upon this quick fun free read. I highly recommend it; it is upbeat and it makes one ponder on achieving greatness.<br />As a lover of research and History, I do feel sources should be quoted and credited.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana Del Rey's sultry sounds are just as vivid on this LP as they were on her &#34;Born to Die&#34; album.  Each song tells its own story, and there isn't a single disappointing track on this album.  The only thing you want from her is more music after hearing this.  Fantastic vocal work and story telling make this a great treat for your ears.
0143117130|4.0|I loved the film, so I read the book. It was quite different from the film but I enjoyed it just as much. Bridget is a wonderful, funny, flawed character that any woman can relate to on some level.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is simply epic.  It is filled with bonus material and information even a veteran reader of the series will enjoy and find enlightening.  If you have not seen this then you should definitely buy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome it might not be as good as the computer version but it's still one of the BEST game's I've ever played but no doubt it does need some improvement. The best improvement would in my opinion would be wolves
B000S1M9LY|5.0|He's a wonderful writer. In league with some of my favorites like Walker Percy. So wry and deep and humorous. A merrily jaundiced  report on our species.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It's pretty bad it works for a while then stops after that it's a waste of time I would just go to the web and go to you tube there it's the same quality.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love it. It's easy to use and fun. I feel like a child hahaha. The only thing is it's difficult to find my  Facebook friends
B0086700CM|5.0|Whatever it says on the description is true it is addictive and very very fun. The people who made temple run 1 and 2 ROCK!!
0470913029|3.0|It was an ok quick entry level book for getting to know what Paleo live style is about .  I was looking for a book more specific to just losing weight on paleo diet .  You will lose weight any way just by eating the paleo way . Which is good to i guess..
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Because I reaky enjoy jewels star,and love the recipies , also I am really enjoying  the book bettys  child these are great choices
B009R659L8|4.0|While I really love this author and the book was good, I am not happy with the kindle version of the book- it skips lines, paragraphs,even and makes it hard to follow the story.
B001NB5BA4|5.0|Those that were there probably still remember the explosion. In 1987, a somewhat obscure Irish band with a devout following suddenly became ubiquitous in a manner that still resonates today. Though U2's 1984 album \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" did very well in its day, nothing compares to what followed. At the time, many people knew U2 for the song \\"New Year's Day,\\" which MTV used to play on the first of the year back in the halcyon days of the 1980s - not to mention when MTV seemed more like visual radio than just another cable channel. They weren't \\"big\\" then and many fans liked it that way, though many also knew that a massive breakout was inevitable. It came with \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and its success seemed almost preordained. Instantly radio stations were playing the album nearly in its entirety. Songs from the album blared from passing cars, homes, loudspeakers and just about any music friendly orifice imaginable. Overnight everyone knew U2. Comparisons to the success of such landmark albums  as \\"Sgt.Pepper,\\" \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" and \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" filled the music press. Headlines blared \\"this is the big one.\\" It was. U2 fans, once an almost elite and exclusive crowd, had to add a few more tables to their fan club gatherings. And passersby would no longer ask \\"who's that?\\" when they saw someone wearing a U2 shirt. Things changed forever.<br /><br />One thing fans of early U2 thrived on was the band's unmistakable passion. The Edge's searing and unique guitar riffs and Bono's howling vocals were religious experiences for some. The passion didn't let up from the first notes of \\"I Will Follow\\" on their 1980 debut album. Though \\"The Joshua Tree\\" gradually builds up in intensity from the beginning, the passion that possessed their music never subsides until the music stops. For once all of the media hype had some substance. \\"The Joshua Tree\\" arguably remains the band's strongest album, though they have changed considerably in the intervening years, so comparisons can become rather sketchy. Nearly every song still stands up today. Only \\"Exit\\" seems a little substandard and out of place with its unfinished \\"filler\\" feel. Every other song contains amazing lyrics, sounds and rhythms. Brian Eno's influence definitely stands out. The band's sound overall, complimented by the Edge's delay-saturated attack, combined with their newly found popularity, gave them the double benefit of sounding edgy and popular all at once. That doesn't happen often in the mass-market music industry, and almost never today. But every now and then one manages to sneak in.<br /><br />Anyone who has listened to the radio in the last 20 years has heard most of what originally comprised the album's \\"Side One\\" (the LP has made a slight comeback, so speaking about \\"sides\\" feels less obscure and quaint these days). From the blistering \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" the fairly overtly religiously themed \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\\" the radio saturated, simple and accessible \\"With Or Without You,\\" to U2's portrait of America \\"Bullet The Blue Sky,\\" the album remains undeniably solid and familiar. Things calm down somewhat with the slow ballad \\"Running to Stand Still\\" and its mood of despair and futility. \\"Side Two\\" will sound less familiar to radio fans, with one slight exception, it plays as solidly as \\"Side One.\\" \\"In God's Country,\\" one of U2's best songs (though many would likely disagree), didn't fare as well as the album's other singles, but presents an interesting portrait of America, which seemed a sub-theme of the album as a whole, particularly the American desert. A sonic surprise explodes at the beginning of \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" when harmonica bursts into the set. And \\"Mothers of The Disappeared\\" ends the album on an appropriately political and somber note. The song's stark and brooding mood recalls the closing track of 1983's \\"War,\\" \\"40,\\" though the lyrics explore more macabre themes.<br /><br />U2 were not the same band after \\"The Joshua Tree.\\" Though success on that level tends to usually destroy bands, so perhaps change was the better outcome. Their albums of the 1990s delved deeper into electronica and experimental pop music forms. Not everyone liked the new direction, but enough did for the band to continue unabated. Looking back, those who knew U2 in 1983 could probably never imagine the U2 of the new century. They seem almost unrecognizable in contrast. But perhaps what remains true for existence remains true in the recording and fame industry: embrace change. It has definitely worked, with varying degrees of success, for U2.The Joshua Tree.\\" Though success on that level tends to usually destroy bands, so perhaps change was the better outcome.

B000O590I4|4.0|\\"Vagabonds Of The Western World\\", (1973), is the first classic album by these Irish blues-rockers.  Phil Lynott bass and vocals, Eric Bell guitar and Brian Downey on drums.  On this deluxe version, we get great songs in,  \\"Slow Blues\\", the mighty \\"The Rocker\\", the title track,  the excellent \\"Little Girl In Bloom\\", \\"Gonna Creep Up On You\\",  the neat string arrangement of \\"A Song For While I'm Away\\", the late Kid Jensen's voiceover on the Irish themed \\"The Hero And The Madman\\".  On the bonus tracks you get,  \\"Little Darling\\", \\"Here I Go Again\\", \\"Randolph's Tango\\" and \\"Cruising In The Lizzymobile\\" and the 1977 overdubbed and remixed \\"Slow Blues\\", with Gary Moore on guitar.  On the 2nd side, you get a great BBC Radio 1 concert with Bob Harris and 2 songs from the John Peel Sessions.  Last album with Eric Bell, who would be replaced by a young 18 year-old Brian Robertson. This album got Thin Lizzy going for over the next decade.
B006RJTKYU|1.0|I was really pleased to see this available on Prime.  I was to young to see it back in the 60s, but I remember how everybody raved about it.<br />I made it through the first 20 minutes.  It was like watching a Three Stooges movie, but the audio was really bad and the actors were on some serious downers.<br />it was just bad.
B0045HCJ94|4.0|Wonderful performance all the way... they were very believable.  We all loved it.  I highly recommend it for laughs and shock.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|WOW another awesome cd. What a beautiful voice this man has. I have been listening to this over and over.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|First, i wanna start off by saying these headphones are GREAT! Extremely comfortable, VERY crisp sound and the fact that it has an 8ft cord makes it great in the studio. That being said, lemme tell you why i bought these headphones and what the cons are.<br /><br />I'm a music producer, and i bought these so i could produce without driving my neighbors crazy with the constant thumping from my monitors. I was looking for quality headphones that would give me a similar expirience to my monitors, without breaking the bank and after a lot of research i decided these were the best choice for me. but the problem i've noticed with these is that theyre actually TO good. they have the amazing ability to reach extremely high frequency's, and extremely low frequency's, without any distortion in the sound, but the problem with that is, realistically, no normal speaker can handle the frequency's these can. so i would make a track and it would sound GREAT on my headphones, but then i would try the track out on my car or different headphones, and it would sound like garbage and i realized its because, im hearing sounds on my headphones that normal speakers, I.E. car, computer, or other headphones, just wouldnt pick up. so i was constantly having to reference my songs on other sound systems to find out what sounds were/were not being heard on regular systems. so i guess its not a bad thing these headphones pick up just about every frequency you throw at it but it is a bit counter productive having to constantly export my audio just to see how it sounds, when that was the whole point of buying great headphones in the first place right? But all in all, i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get some high quality studio headphones but dont wanna break the bank. great headphones for an even better price. just remember when your making music, it may sound like gold on these things, but put that track on any other system, and you might get an unpleasant surprise
0761536434|5.0|I chose this rating because the book tells of the history of video games up from humble beginings to the modern age which will later advance to the XBox 360 we have now.  I can say it just what it looks like and can recommend it to video game fans and people looking into the history of video games.  Let me tell you it was a very different time then the one we're living in now.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Perfect for the clip on reading light used on my kindle. Fresh, and longest brand we have purchased so far.
B000002KHH|4.0|This disk came in a very minimalist cardboard slip-cover, but the price was right. Surely you've already heard the music. Classic.
B001IF252M|5.0|I bought two adapters. They arrived in perfect condition within the date range promised @ a competitive price. I use one to connect my mac to an external monitor and the other in a conference room to allow us to view our computer screen up on the 60 inch LED. Works great for both. I will buy from this vendor in the future.
B00004BZ0V|3.0|I remember liking several of the songs from years ago, and I still do like them.<br />The Clash aren't a particularly skillful band, but I guess they make the most of the talent that they have.
B00BLYFDO2|3.0|First I just have to say; &#34;Welcome back James Williamson!&#34;  10 seconds into &#34;Burn&#34; (the first track on &#34;Ready To Die&#34;) he tears it up and we know he means business!  &#34;Ready To Die&#34; is a step up from &#34;The Weirdness&#34; which was pretty underwhelming. The material on this CD is better, the energy is pumping and the guitars sound huge!  On top of blistering tracks like &#34;Burn&#34;, &#34;Job&#34;, &#34;Gun&#34; and &#34;Ready To Die&#34; the CD offers up two lovely ballads; &#34;Unfriendly World&#34; and &#34;The Departed&#34; (RIP Ron Asheton).  Sure Iggy's lyrics are basic but it has always been his raw honesty rather than his poetic finesse that endeared him to me.  On &#34;Ready To Die&#34; he makes sneering observations about America circa 2013 that ring true and sound current.  &#34;I got a job but it don't pay *&^%$&#34; &#34;Friend me cause me I'm empty&#34; &#34;If I had a @#$*& gun I could shoot at everyone.&#34; &#34;Freaking out in the USA&#34; indeed. When the &#34;Unfriendly World&#34; is dragging me down Iggy never fails to make me smile .   While &#34;Ready To Die&#34; may not stand up to the brilliance of &#34;Fun House&#34; or &#34;Raw Power&#34; it sounds great and proves once again that Iggy Pop is the quintessential survivor!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Although I don't think the book was written so well, it was enjoyable to read. Wrapped up a bit too nicely at the end.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|I love U571 and crimson tide, however this movie is the best even with subtitles!  Do yourself a favor and watch it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|saved me on oaks floors. wow too much material on a project can be a bad thing. especially with the price of it. thank you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So addictive can't put down, wish it let you have more than 40 coins at a time so I can keep playing
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Started with a bang- build alot of momentum and kept me interested. The ending was climactic- but the ultimate disposition of the heroine was very bland for such a strong story. It was not in keeping with the character.
0062238868|5.0|This should be required reading in ALL educational facilities. Very easy to read and understand, even to the average citizen.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|I enjoy books that give you the concept and examples.  This did both and very clearly at that.  Great content!  The only this was that the e-version had a couple of graphical alterations.
1439190275|5.0|I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  Atkins lets me eat almost everything I like best (forget the potatoes).  If you've never tried Atkins you should.  the plam really works if you aren't addicted to sugar.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Since receiving my Kindle, I've never done this. After having read the Kindle version I am going to purchase the hard cover and set it in my collection of books that cause my heart and mind to fire on all cylinders. This is the best book I've read in several years.
B0071F3T0K|3.0|I had high expectations going in due to it being a classic. It took me a while to get used to the writing style.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would highly recommend this series, wonderful acting, story, and addicting! I cannot wait for Season 4. Outstanding all the way around!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|My son recommended the addition to my iMac and it works fine for my use of the computer. Just what every computer should have.
1400032717|5.0|This story is so very different.It's narrator is a teenager with Autism. Extremely well done work of fiction. Interesting story and enjoyable quick read.Not for young children.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I believe this entire series could consist of the first 3 and the last 3 books.  I've been one of the unlucky ones who have been dragged under the Jordan bus for decades awaiting each new book.  When the man died, I selfishly felt robbed.  How dare he string me along for so many years and then pass away.<br /><br />The first two books of the last 3 are written very well.  It took some time to get used to the prose of the new author.  His sentences are shorter with more punch to them.  He sometimes succeeds in the Jordan-like description of characters that you haven't heard from in awhile.  Jordan had the habit of almost completely reintroducing them, as if we wouldn't remember them.<br /><br />I feel the last three books are ultimately a let down and fail on a significant point.  The point being in the sheer number of characters that Jordan introduced to us over the years, the expectations built up around them eventually showing up and being a big part of the story.  In these last books we still have new or very new characters showing up and having a big portion of the story.  When I finish these books I will put them down forever and never read them again.  I've been through them a few times now just to jog my memory of what has happened.
B008D36INE|1.0|This movie starting out right with wonderful casting then  i got lost as the story began. I am sad to say i didn't watch the full movie but what i did see made absolutely no sense whatsoever.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought this was an enjoyable, easy read. Well thought out with what I thought was a good ending. There was one aspect of the book that I thought was unrealistic, but I won't discuss it so I don't ruin the book for others. I would definitely recommend this book!
B00B7G3BUW|3.0|The experience of renting  online is convenience, but it is missing the inside features, it would be nice to be able to watch the trailers for the upcoming animated DC movies, creative team commentating or the small short film that most of the time accompany this films as well.
B002N1AEMS|4.0|The record itself is very good easy going music.  I loved the mp3 download feature for the same music on the go.  Thanks.

B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Second book I have read by Lewis. Explains in great detail some of the things these financial  &#34;wizards&#34;  did to the world economy. And the characters he follows that bet against them , and won, are absolutley terrific!  Learn something and read this book. Maybe you'll recognize the next crash coming next time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Use it on all devices. One if the first things I install on a new phone its awesome install now!!!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I'm really conflicted about this book.  On one hand, it was a very interesting read in and of itself.  While I was very surprised that it was basically one long battle for about 2/3 of the book, the story itself was very interesting and well written.  I'm giving it 4 stars as a standalone work.<br /><br />However, as a conclusion for the Wheel of Time series, I was somewhat disappointed.  First, I'll start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of the series as a whole (weaker books in the middle aside), and have reread the series a couple times.  As a fan who has invested a lot of time in reading these books, I was very frustrated that side plotlines that took up hundreds of pages in previous books are wrapped up in paragraphs, are left hanging, or are revealed to be meaningless.  Major and semi-major characters in the book that have been with us for the 20 years or so it has taken to produce the entire series are killed off in a sentence or two without any real effect on the reader.<br /><br />I do think that my problems with the book are caused by structure of the series, rather than Sanderson's writing (which I think is actually very good).  I guess it's almost impossible to build up towards a finale in 13 books, then write an ending in one book that gives everything the wrapup it deserves.  Sanderson inherited so many open plotlines that it would have been impossible to wrap them up in any way that is satisfactory in the three books he wrote.  I think he made a conscious choice to write the first two at a pace which closed as many plotlines as he could at a brisk (but reasonable) pace, then wrote the last book in such a way as to wrap everything else up and give the story closure.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I thought it was wordy.  Things were repeated over and over again from chapter to chapter.  Found myself skipping lots of pages due to this.  Not really what I expected.
B004IF8TLU|5.0|I love this movie, and you obviously can't go to redbox and get it because it's an old movie and rental stores don't exist, so here I am watching movies online!
B0054NQZ9S|4.0|This movie is good and reminds me of everything my friends and I have been going through over the years with mergers and lay-offs and chronic unemployment. Whew! It really hit home. Good actors.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I like it. It is truly the &#34;last battle&#34; and it was always going to be a tough call to bring it all together.<br />Now could the producers of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; please make the series? (With today's CGI the channelling will be awesome!)
B000BYRCGU|5.0|Enjoyed it! I have watched it over and over again.  The water scenes are awesome and it's great to see them out there!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I don't think there is any shortage of Steve jobs bio's so I got this book a little skeptical that I would learn anything new. Having read all about Steve jobs for years on the web this is the best all in one package about Steve jobs that you can get, (even though there is very little in this book you could not find on the internet). The picture section alone is worth the price of admission.  I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a look into the life of Steve jobs.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is the rare instance where visual interpretation exceeds expectations, This is a wonderful period piece that is pretty darn accurate for a historical film. I love the subtle moments in the movie and the score is lovely. I would recommend this to everyone!!!
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Seriously...Where does one begin to critique this amazing masterpiece of a film. Tom Hanks is outstanding in his role and I challenge anyone to walk away from this movie before the final credits. It is lengthy but it sucks you in. The soundtrack isn't half bad either;) You can't go wrong in choosing to watch this movie.
014241493X|4.0|I'm a huge John Green fan! (Who isn't, come on??) But when it comes to Paper Towns, I'm conflicted. On one hand, I absolutely adored this one. There is so much wonderful, fabulous and insightful adventure taking going on. On the other hand? I want to find Margo Roth Spiegelman and kick her in the face. (Which, I suppose - Mr. Green, you've accomplished the goal of making me emotional about this book.)<br /><br />So we open with Q, who is hopelessly in love with his friend from early childhood. He puts Margo Roth Spiegelman on a pedestal. (Which, I must admit? I found endearing because I'm horribly guilty of that in a few instances in my life.) Then, after Margo and Q reconcile their friendship in one bizarre, yet incredibly kick ass night? She's gone. And Q seems to be the only person to care - thus starts the adventure of him piecing together clues to find her.<br />It's been 2 days since I finished this book, and I'm still not sure how to write my review. I'm struggling to follow my typical structure (Quick Summary, talk about the writing, then the characters, then my general feelings/would I recommend the book.) Paper Towns had me emotionally invested, and at times cheering for the characters (Nerds who finally, in the last days of high school, find their \\"place\\" which - was incredibly unrealistic to me.) And then, well then this epic thing happens, and culminates in a way that... well... I can't spoil it. (See - I'm vague, because I can't spoil. But I can't put my thoughts out coherently either.)<br />The characters, for the most part are great. (Although I struggle with what Radar's girlfriend has to do with the price of tea in China...) Q is easy to relate to, and you can't help but feel sorry for him most of the time. Lacey is an absolute bitch, but her part is perfect! And the Black Santas? Well, it's just one of those awesome things that everyone loves about John Green! But Margo... Margo Roth Spiegelman (Who arguably is the main character, despite being mostly non-existent in the pages) she's where I struggle. I started out loving her. Adoring her. And then? Then, I hated her. With a passion.<br />So really, Paper Towns is a novel that I am passionate about, which I suppose is the point. It's got some wonderful themes. Moments where I fall in love with John Green and his writing all over again. And then? It has moments. Moments where you question Mr. Green's sanity. Because it goes to places you just weren't expecting. Or maybe hoping it would be different. If you're a fan of John Green, I would recommend this one (although you've probably already read it!) But go into it with an open mind, and try not to come up with too many theories on your own. If you're new to John Green? I recommend starting elsewhere, Looking for Alaska or The Fault in Our Stars!stly non-existent in the pages) she's where I struggle. I started out loving her. Adoring her. And then?

B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Watch to be entertained. Please do not believe how the film depicts the wolf.<br />It is a disgrace to the animal kingdom to have Hollywood allow a film to be created in times when the wolf is now being taken off the endangered species list.<br /><br />Doug MN
B009QW7MQS|4.0|This one is #3 ranked on my favorite Bond films list!<br />It seems that when The World Is Not Enough (the one after this one) came out, the character and the situations became darker, colder, angrier, and more revenge driven.<br />*sigh* The sign of the times, I guess.<br />Enjoy!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is a wonderful, thoughtful story about life, family, choices, and unforeseen events. The characters were endearing. It was wonderful to read an about \\"alpha male\\" with some class. Will was delightfully mature and responsible for a man his age, but not too much. He had his moments of weakness, which made him more believable and lovable. Layken was awesome in the same ways, and her friends had struggles of their own, which they overcame. I liked how Hoover portrayed the characters overcoming their struggles by reaching within themselves and with the support of others rather than having them wallow in substance abuse or poor behavior. Refreshing. Not only did the book incorporate poetry, it was poetry. I couldn't put the book down. Stayed up late to finish it. I laughed and cried and was in awe over this beautifully woven story. Highly recommend.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It was a great story and was constructed very well, but it was a very bitter and depressing pill to swallow. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it should have followed the formula of &#34;License To Kill&#34;; Vendetta, yes; But, have a happier ending!
1451695195|5.0|I've read extensively on the subject death & dying 30 years and worked in Hospice Care for 10. This book stands out for it's readability as a work of empiricism, debunking the myth that science & belief in life beyond life are incompatible. As we who've witnessed the transition of the corporal body separating from the life force which travels on have known for years, the two are inseparable.
B00999DFP0|1.0|This was not a legitimate DVD set. These poor quality DVD's could not even play on my Macbook. Even when I did manage to get them to play on my PC the quality of the video was not even that good. The picture was a little grainy and it also had a couple moments where it would have audio glitches. The covers of the Dvd set (btw there is not even one holder its 5 individual sleeves) were the only thing that actually looked like the original thing. The cases that housed the actual dvd's was extremely flimsy and cheap. The plastic was not even cut to properly to fit the exterior of the case, there was excess hanging off of the sides; and the covers inside the plastic looked like someone had printed them out on a home printer with extremely cheap printer paper. Overall, i am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />P.s It took almost 2 months (1 and 2/3 months) to get this pile of disappointment
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I read the book and enjoyed it so much, I couldn't wait for the movie to be released.  Book was better......this version on DVD was just okay.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Did Robert Jordan proud by the way it led you to the end by tying off the different scenarios and the way the final conflict was written
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a wonderful movie!  I think Steven Spielberg always does a great job and always picks the right stories to produce.  If you haven't seen this one, do it!
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This book is amazing. For so long I've struggled with the belief that I was alone in the world. That my strong desire to help others grow and achieve in life was an \\"affliction\\" or decease that I would have to hide or somehow be \\"cured\\".... I've \\"come out\\" as a giver at work and it has been a huge relief, no longer a matcher who felt \\"dirty\\" after each encounter. I give freely without restraint, and I have been reborn by its power. This who I am, it is who I've always been. Read this book, and your world will be a better place. Even if that world is just between your ears.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Glad I read the book before I saw the movie. The book, of course, includes much more detail and insight into what Pi is thinking, feeling, and experiencing. Must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an awesome game!!! You can do a lot with it!:-) it is the best game I have on my kindle I use it everyday that's how fun it is
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I loved this book. Even the battle scenes which really surprised me. Usually I skim those pretty quickly. Parts of it felt rushed like the compulsions on certain people and I wanted more resolution in their recovery. But I guess it had to end sometime. :(
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was not what I expected, nor was it what I was looking for.  Fortunately, sometimes the best experiences start from a simple mistake.  Read this book!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|even if you can't see it in 3D, it's still worth watching. i thought it would suck, but it really needs a sequel!
B009R659L8|5.0|Great Read! Enjoy all of Mary Higgins Clarks Books! This one was hard to put down, she knows how to tell a story!
B005D4YHN4|5.0|These shoes were an excellent fit so true to sizing chart. These shoes are $249 dollars in NZ and i managed to purchase for $148.00. My husband was pleased with my choice. Thankyou
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It sure does not take long to get into the series, though reading the books first helped. can't wait to see the rest
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 9 year old daughter loves this game: her favorite one for her Kindle. My 14 year old son also likes it, but he would like to do more with it than the pocket version permits.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is full of surprises and i suggest that whoever likes the movie series should read the books- Mariah Jessica Bohlander
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The story is so good - funny, interesting characters and really good acting. I just hate all the gore. I know that's Tarantino's thing and I love his stories, so I just avoid the really disgusting scenes. I get that's part of his humor - it's just not for me.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I think the game subway surfers is ok. There are some aspects of the game I don't like. When you try to switch lanes were you run it will sometimes make you jump. O th her than that it is good.
B00A93ENX8|5.0|The 90s were a slower pace for Rush, but this album came out of the gate full speed.  This SACD version is a great improvement from the first issue.  Great sound from start to finish.
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark does not disappoint in this tale.  Her usual formula works again for a good recreational read.  Enjoyed it.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|Maybe I've never read a memoir... I understand it was written from a child's point of view (as he remembered it) but, there was really no cohesiveness or even a resolution.<br />How it won such acclaim is really challenging my sensibilities.  Maybe I'll write a memoir of my childhood, in the same manner and win awards as well.<br />Yes, it's a good read, but I wanted more.  Needing more depth.  Then, to look at what else he has written, led me to not only his other works, but, his brothers works as well.  Jump on the band wagon or what?<br />If all you have to do is write down things like a journal (ages later) doesn't cut it.  How about some insight, reflections, what was learned, what was felt, what should be taken away.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Wonderful story about a woman's life and her burdens, and how she is resilient enough to live in a war zone.
B0001I561E|2.0|Wife is a kid a heart loves this movie so happy when she got it for her birthday. Sender said almost like new and it skips in 4 different spots, not almost like new to me. Upset my pregnant wife so bad review.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Pure and simple... Say what you want about Arnold being past his prime or anything else about this film, but this movie is a great action flick. Includes new classic lines by Arnold like, \\"you give us immigrants a bad name,\\" I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this film. Top notch, and I am surprised it did not do well in the theaters. If you like action movies, and/or build up movies that end with a stand off by an \\"underdog\\" force like a small county sheriffs department and an ruthless/evil organization like the Mexican drug cartels, then this movie is for you... Bottom line, this movie rocks...
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Tons of action to go along with a handful of great actors.  Definitely worth the time and money to rent!
B0081336FO|5.0|The acting is great, the suspense is thrilling, the plot incredible. MAKE MORE! HURRY!<br />CJ Reischman<br />Littlteon, Colorado<br />United States of America
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Ok, so I am a student. I have been using styli for quite some time now (mainly for notes) and I have to say I love this stylus so much! It's smooth as silk, but its a little bit to big for me. Maybe they will create a thinner version of this. Then it would be the perfect stylus.l
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As a fan of the tv show first, I'm impressed with how close the character in the book mirrors that on tv.  Great story line.
B000OLGCI4|1.0|I bought this movie for my son. We just sat down to watch it and didn't even get 10 minutes into the movie before it stated skipping so bad that the rest of the movie wouldn't even play. Definitely not worth the money. Very disappointed!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Well developed story. Devoured it in a few days. You must read the all the Silo Saga Shift books to get it all. Well done!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the game and can't stop playing it the surf board and charaters are awesome i really like when its on tour because the setting keep changing and right now its in Tokyo
B0044XV3QY|5.0|See every detail like the first time you say it at the movies! You don't want to miss this again..
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Best game ever it's free so download it people it's really awsome and never gets boring and if you don't like it just delete it but I can guarantee its the best
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Fantastic cinematography exploring fascinating places all over the world! We had it in DVD format and this is SO clear!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|There is a pop up every time i log in to i decided to rate and give my opinion on this game  but if the creators see this i want in game compensation for my time righting this instead of playing the game.  ( i want elements for compensation) this game  has so man features compared to  there first game like you can get elements in the dungeons to create th  best of weapons and armor which i think ia awesome improvement to the game.  There is also a online multiplayer mode which is really fun also because you can play with 4 different players that either you have to carry because they suck or you are dead even and rock the place so yeah lol.  I would advise  also making a lot of friends to play with to. Finish all of your missions first to get started then do multiplayer or else it will very difficult for you to understand what is happening have fun and add me if you can find me my.<br /> name is logan
0545265355|3.0|The truth is, what I received was not a matched set. It was the three books in the set, but different sizes and print with some writing on one of them. I will keep them, but I was disappointed witht he presentation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love subwAy surfers every chance I get I play this game, greAt graphics, cool music, cool themes, I've subwAy surfed in NYC,Australia, and tokyo so far lol, I even subwAy surfed for Christmas, no freezing issues or installation issues at all, I had this game on my android cool pad 4g metro pcs phone and it was greAt, when I got my kindle fire HD and I saw the game is available for kindle fire HD,I immediately downloaded and installed this game with no issues and haven't put it down since, you can play this game without internet access, you just won't be able to see your Facebook friends, but who cares, as long as you can play the game, challenge yourself and kill time. Playing the game with internet access or Wi-Fi is cool as well, just 2 ads, one when you start the game and get to the menu another ad when you go to the menu to quit the game, no pop ups or ad's interruption while playing the game at all. If I could give subwAy surfers an extra 5 stars I would, as a matter of fact,***** lol great game overall!!!! Also a nice game for kids as well, well maybe ages 5 and up
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved this one even more than the first season and I really enjoyed that one. I would recommend to anyone who likes this type of shows
B00263HWM8|3.0|You don't go into these expecting much more than explosions, motorcyle chases, and a few kisses.  This delivered, we had fun.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|He is 4 months old and he really enjoys playing with this toy. It is his favorite toy right now.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|This movie sucked!!!! Don't waste your time and money. Very boring story line that lasted 2 hours. I could barely stay awake.
0425252868|5.0|Once you start reading this true story, you won't be able to stop ,until you finish.This is one of the very best,,as war stories go.!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a great game. You have to download this app or u will die!u can build cool  cars planes and watch how they go! Pass cool levels to earn stuff for the sand box and much more! Have fun!!!  !
B00AIJP9BS|4.0|The kids like this game.  They have been playing the game since I got it.  They love it.  Thank you.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Next to the movie Hashi, if you are a dog lover this is an absolutely must read. This should be a movie. It is amazing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|good read...I didn't want to put the book down! Excited to begin the next one! Someone previously compared this to twilight but not at all!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I love Kathy Reich books.  When I read her books I find enjoyment and I also learn something without realizing it.  This one taught me something about the Montreal and Yellowknife areas and people.  I liked it!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|The movie is great.  I think I have watched it at least six times. It is my current favorite. Better than the Hurt Locker.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Wow. Truly incredible! An uncanny (and artistically disgraceful) almost-beat-for-beat transposition of De Palma's THE UNTOUCHABLES to post WWII Los Angeles. As a member of the Writers Guild, it pisses me off when an inferior derivation such as this one gets made and released, garnering a modicum of attention. I wish I could get specific without divulging spoilers--but I can't, so I won't. Suffice to say that by the time we learn what ultimately happens in the radio shack, I wanted to grab someone by the lapels and scream, \\"Like we all didn't see that one coming!?\\" (with apologies to Charles Martin Smith of the earlier film).<br />That most of the events in the third act of the film never really happened is also a bit annoying; sticking to the template of The Untouchables was, apparently, more alluring than that of reality. But, so what, right? It's just another Hollywood bio-pic, right?!
B008DYZKQE|4.0|I LOVED this book as a child. Now my son & daughter love it. Good story. Good underlying message. Strong, independent female character.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|On my first day, it took me a while to figure all setups out. However, in my 2nd training things got a bit clearer. Very good to be able to configure the different screens to show exactly what you want. Garmin Connect, web based training, is also great. Not only I can review my trainings in details, but also I can input exercises and download to the watch. Worth every $$$.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love it, an infinite world of imagination and creativity. This game is by far one of my favorite games.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Love this game lots of new challenges. I found temple run 2 very hard and I was unable to  play play. But with temple run Oz I'm having a hard time putting the game down
B00936A0RU|5.0|Amazing acting, Jessica Chastain talented as ever! Based on a true story and an action-packed movie! Pretty violent though, appropriately handled a gritty scene, it was implied, but not shown
B009MYAQK4|5.0|What a mistake. This was a philosophical exercise not a novel. Not something that held my interest.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very enjoyable read.  It kept me going and seemed somehow a realistic yet scary possibility.  Each character brought me in and made this silo world a greater possibility with each page.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I couldn't stop watching and felt sad when the season was over.  I can't wait for more Downton Abbey to be available!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Read by our book club.  We will read the three books of this trilogy.  The author is most knowledgeable and produces a fast moving historical novel that most can relate to.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great run for passing time - would like to see the app updated like the iphone app - there is another layer of fun in the world<br /> of oz.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great story. Excellent animation, her hair looked real, that's impressive! I liked how they tied in Irish lore into the movie in a way that kids could easily understand. All in all very entertaining.
B00008AY3L|5.0|I first got introduced to Ben Harper from a jingle I heard on a television ad. After looking it up on you tube I found out it was &#34;Amen Omen&#34;. I checked out a couple of other titles and then decided to buy a couple of cd's. I've had several misfortunes lately and the song &#34;I will not be broken&#34; resonates a lot with me. I am in my mid fifties and he reminds me of a young Bob Dylan with a spiritual slant. Someone you need to check out, you will not be disappointed.
1444737104|5.0|Bob what an amazing cat. Animals & nature have much to illustrate Gods love for lost souls. great film material?
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|love this movie.  a touch of humor with spock and the swear words.  &#34;  ONE DAMN MINUTE ADMIRAL &#34;  classic line.<br /><br />  love it when kirk gets busted down to captain and given command of the enterprise again.  best part of movie.<br /><br />  and chekov when the guy says  &#34;  of course he's a rusky you idiot &#34;  great movie.<br /><br />  spok did too much lds.  great ,  buy it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A great story that can be translated into any religion. I think it shows that you must trust God to survive. The middle of the story kinda dragged but then it had a real surprise ending. Loved it!!!!!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|what can you say about this movie.  awesome.  heath ledger played his roll best joker ever i think.<br /><br />  sad he's not around now.  movie moves fast and great movie.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Love anything about Lincoln and this had such rave reviews. But I fell asleep while watching. It must have dragged somewhere in the middle. I only saw the start and the ending. Very dissapointing.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Good read. I liked that the ending had some plot shifts.  A definite page turner to keep you enthralled to the end.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I personally think that this game is very well developed and runs beautifully. I think thigh, that when this is compared to other versions, it has very little resemblance to the original game. I would recommend getting the computer version as it is further developed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Lovely graphics and nice puzzles. Worth the money. Performed well on Kindle Fire HD. Looking forward to the next chapter.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Tools graphics fun time killer but takes a while to downloaded<br />Other than that every thing is great but I wish horses were cheaper
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My wife and I played this one together and had a good time with it. Helpful tip. Sometimes you have to be precise when placing objects and don't forget about the tilt feature.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Should come standard on everything from phones to desktops.Installed it on iPhone,iPad,Kindle Fire,PC,<br />and MacBook.No problems with any device.Actually does what it says it will do.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Loved this series,disappointed it was canceled , great story lines and imagination, purchasing the season was great, I love that there aren't any commercial
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series! Lots of action and love not only love for a lover, but also for friends, country and what's right.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie was really good. I really liked watching it. I would recommend it to others good movie, very funny
B0033AX1YG|5.0|This is a great collection of Gary Moore rocking the house at Montreux in various performances over the years of his stellar career.  It is a must-have for any Gary Moore fan and I urge you to get it today!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Les Miserables is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. It wasn't what I had originally expected. I would recommend watching
B003NX75B8|5.0|This book was truly beautiful! The end was surprising, and it tied the whole story together. I highly recommend this story to anyone who is considering reading this.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|A great way to end an awesome series.  Most of the major and minor plot lines are weaved together to a satisfying conclusion and the last battle is truly epic.
1401938906|4.0|I enjoy Pam Grout's witty and informative style and her ability to create easy and fun ways to show how we can indeed create reality.<br /><br />However this book is remarkably similar to her previous work \\"God doesn't have Bad Hair Days' & a number of the experiments are almost identical,although I really liked The Jenny Craig Principle which is new.<br />I would say that while the book is not exactly identical to the earlier work and does build on the principles expressed there in a slightly different way, if you already have God Doesn't Have Bad Hair Days, this isn't so unique that it adds all that much to the first work.<br /><br />While I was somewhat disappointed to discover the very close similarities to the earlier work, I still found it useful and entertaining. I don't regret buying it but I wouldn't exactly say it was essential reading as a primer for applying quantum energies to shaping reality if you do have the other work, but the title of this one might be more attractive for anyone who turns off attention at the word 'God'.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Nice to have a leading character that we oldies can relate to, with all his marbles and thumbing his nose at the world.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|In my opinion' it is a good story with complex plot' keeps you engaged and at the edge of you seat waiting for the events to unfold and pleasantly surprised at the same time. Very well played; acting is believable and enjoyable. I would love to watch it again even I already watched it twice
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Was good but very intense and a bit of a downer.  I assume it was a true representation of the racism of the time.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Very engaging show about late 19th century life in rural England.  Characters are well played and the story gets your attention right off the bat.  Look forward to watching more!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I think that Dr Alexander lays it out extremely well.  His conclusion there is a God. I agree with his hypothesis.  Great read!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is an extraordinarily powerful performance by Andrea and all associated with this cd. Beautiful selection of material ideal for Andrea's voice. Sound quality is excellent. This is the kind of cd you are proud to own. You can't go wrong here if you love good music, excellent arrangements and a vocal performance almost not of this world. WOW, I'm in awe of the capabilities of the musicians and of Andrea's vocal performance. I would suggest you not pass this one up. Andrea is something else.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The Broadway show had better vocals --- the Movie had more depth to the vocals.  These are actors, plying their trade by singing.  HIghly moving and a great story of love and redemption.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|Not as good a story as the original, but better graphics & production - but darn good in it's own right.

B000V6AE22|5.0|I enjoy all of Supertramp's music, but this is one of the best albums they ever put out in my opinion. This has several great hits and well worth buying. It takes me back to years ago when listening to it on my turn table.

0374531269|5.0|I found A Long Way Gone to be an interesting and mind changing experience due to the powerful story of Ishmael, the boy soldier. The story begins with Ishmael, a young African child living in the small town of Mogbwemo during a brutal war between the military and rebels. One day, Ishmael travels to another town with his brother and friends, but soon after they leave, their town gets raided by rebels. Once realizing that there was no chance of turning back, Ishmael and the others were forced to keep moving ahead of the advancing rebels. Later on, a town that they are staying in gets raided and in the chaos, Ishmael gets separated from his friends and brother. This begins the long journey that Ishmael goes through to survive.<br /> Throughout this amazing journey, Ishmael overcomes many obstacles such as losing his loved ones, fighting in the war against the rebels, and surviving the war itself. There were many graphic scenes full of people dying or having severe wounds, so this book is definitely not for the light hearted. The graphic scenes add on to the atmosphere of death that is present throughout the novel. There was also a presence of fear throughout the novel that made it amazingly suspenseful.<br /> Reading this book helped me learn to better appreciate what I have and what my life is like compared to that of Ishmael's. It also made me realize that even when things appear bad, they could always be worse. This book also reminded me how important family is and reminded me to cherish my loved ones for as long as I have them. Hopefully, new readers of A Long Way Gone will be able to experience the emotions expressed from the author and appreciate their lives a little more as I did.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it's really fun and great for most ages! I really recommend this game for anyone that has seen the movie Oz, The Great And Powerful. If you haven't  seen it, then you won't understand most of the game. You should totally get the game!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham, as he seems able to do in book-after-book, spins a pretty good yarn here.  However, this time the plot &#34;twists&#34; were more like plot &#34;curves&#34; (S-curves at times) as I had the plot pretty well figured out well before the end of the book (but kept reading to see if I was right).<br /><br />I shall await his next offering . . .

I was able to apply so many of those principles to  my life as well as show my clients how to do the same. I am also in the coaching industry and when starting out you are not quite sure where to turn and what steps to take. Jack has taken all those steps for you and is literally hand delivering them to you in this book. What a great read. I now watch him on you tube almost daily just taking in his knowledge. Thank you

0981951252|5.0|Six discs teaching you exactly how to make small changes for a lasting effect in life. We as human beings always look for immediate gratification's, which is why most of the population are stressed or depressed. We start something and we want glowing benefits right away. The compound effect shows you exactly how to change that way of thinking in order to create your ripple effect in life. I was able to lose six pounds in three weeks and take my business to a whole new level making slow but steady changes. Giving out free information slowly overtime brought my business maximum profits. Exercising four days a week and cutting out unnecessary foods is helping me to continue to lose weight. What a great program.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A quietly moving tale of one man's almost accidental trek across England to save his old colleague from cancer.<br /><br />It is amazing how Rachel Joyce not only convinces the reader of the feasibility of such an improbable quest, she also manages to inspire him/her to actually root for Harold Fry, the newly-retired teetotaler (from a brewery, no less). He walks out one day to post a reply to Queenie Hennessy, who has written to tell him she was dying of cancer in a hospice all the way up in Berwick-upon-Tweed (as North as it is South in Kingsbridge, where he is from). But instead of posting the letter, he keeps on walking, and inspired by a garage girl, who tells him about her own aunt with cancer, and that \\"if you have faith, you can do anything\\", he resolves that as long as he is walking, Queenie will live (nevermind that he left his phone at home and is wearing yachting shoes).<br /><br />Interwoven into this journey is Harold's reflections on his estranged marriage to Maureen, and the tenuous relationship with his son David, whom Maureen confides in, when her discovery that her husband has embarked on this ridiculous pilgrimage turns from bewilderment, to anger and despair. An unintended consequence of all that time in the wide open country as he treks treacherously by the side of motorways is the opportunity for Harold to confront and wrestle with the ghosts of his past.<br /><br />Joyce paints a rather poignant picture of Harold, and shows his struggles when the normally reticent man has to explain his quest to complete strangers: \\"He took a deep breath. If he heard the sound of words coming from his mouth enough times, maybe he would feel like the sort of person who could get up and do something about them.\\" The failure of communication in his marriage is also rather efficiently summed up in these lines : \\"Sometimes her words sliced down on his before they had even reached his mouth.\\"<br /><br />Harold the child had also had to deal with disapproval from the string of aunts his father takes up with when Harold's mother abandoned them: \\"'He's awfully tall,' his Aunty May had said of him once, as if this was something you could rectify, like a leaking tap.\\"<br /><br />Not only is her desription of characters sharp and insightful, Joyce is a skilful writer who comes up with such beautiful lines of prose, you just want to read them over and over again, like this afternoon scene just after heavy rain: \\"To the east, the cloud tore open and a low belt of polished silver light broke through. Harold stood and watched as the mass of grey split again and again, revealing new colours: blue, burnt amber, peach, green and crimson. Then the cloud became suffused with a dulled pink, as if those vibrant colours had bled through, merging as they met. He couldn't move. He wanted to witness every change. The light on the land was gold; even his skin was warm with it. At his feet the earth creaked and whispered. The air smelt green and full of beginnings. A soft mist rose, like wisps of smoke.\\" The reader's senses are totally engaged in the picture Joyce paints.<br /><br />Such beautiful, and at times heartwrenching prose would be pointless without a compelling story. Joyce has achieved that rare feat of meeting both criteria. At the end of the day, it is the pronouncement: \\"But maybe it's what the world needs. A little less sense, and a little more faith\\", that makes this tale such a powerful one.
B009X01D9U|5.0|It's so difficult to buy things online and know it's what you are looking for. I always rely on reviews along with the picture/description. This case seemed to provide protection and it's versatile.<br /><br />At first it seemed like the standing part of the case wasn't as sturdy as it could be. After seeing the Kindle cases of friends, I think this one is better.<br /><br />No ports are blocked, which is nice. The screen rotates smoothly.<br /><br />I've never had a problem with my Kindle not going to sleep when the cover is closed. I know people with other cases who say it's hit and miss with the Kindle sleeping.<br /><br />I ordered the Orange color. It was slightly less expensive and I figured I didn't care. It's actually a very beautiful color, I was surprised! The leather seems thick enough and despite the fact I take my Kindle most places with me, there are no scratches or signs of wear.
B003HV0TN2|3.0|This book took me a whole month to finish, though all things considered, it was a not a complicated or difficult book to read. The story of an aspiring young magician, Kvothe, who seeks entry to the prestigious University to become an arcanist, does seem rather Harry Potterish, though this is by no means a disparaging comparison.<br /><br />What distinguishes this fantasy novel from others of its ilk is the rather believable magic the author conjures. For instance, this first of a trilogy introduces us to \\"sympathy\\", a magical force which boasts elements of scientific concepts like thermodynamics, in the way objects can be moved by creating a sympathetic link between them to transfer energy.<br /><br />To Rothfuss's credit, he manages to create a fictional world that runs rather consistently according to a system he imagines. Kvothe's musical background is established by his childhood as part of the Edema Ruh, a troupe of people very much like the travelling minstrels, and music features as much as magic in the story. The inciting incident that throws young Kvothe into action is perhaps the murder of his parents and entire troupe by the Chandrian, a mythical evil force that is the stuff of faerie tales even in Kvothe's world, which complicates his quest to avenge his parents. Do the Chanrians exist or don't they? In the process, he becomes a street urchin for a period of three years, during which he learns a little about the Chandrian, and confirms his resolve to learn as much as he can about them by setting out for the University.<br /><br />However, the reader becomes very aware of the narrative lapsing into that of pre-pubescent boy, who is suitably enamoured with the first mysterious beauty, Denna, whom he meets enroute to the University, and who continues to appear in his life years later. Our young hero is caught gawking at women's bodies like a hormonal teen in parts of his narrative, while at the same time becoming obsessed with Denna despite her cruelty andcontrary signals to him. One can't help but be irritated by Kvothe's willingness to explain her irresponsible behaviour away to his two best friends at the Uni in a very unconvincing conversation near the close of the book.<br /><br />The action in the novel is tempered by these distractions, especially in an episode with a draccus (a mythical dragonlike lizard) where he and Denna flirt, while also plotting to slay the creature. Arguably, the narrative structure also serves to distract, rather than add to the telling of the tale. I couldn't help but feel that the narrative frame of the adult Kvothe narrating the story to a Chronicler at an inn, is an unnecessary complication. Perhaps I would be proven wrong after reading the other two books in the trilogy (the third book still pending release at the time of this review). In the meantime, most of the other characters feel flat and undeveloped, largely owing, I feel, to the singular perspective Rothfuss gives to Kvothe throughout his recount of his past.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the story is entertaining, even if the writing is uneven in some parts, with overused phrases like \\"safe as houses\\". I look forward to Kvothe learning the name of the wind in the next book.

B009MYARIK|4.0|I love all of her books. It's a very fun read, I feel this one would make a great romantic comedy movie. Lots of very funny hysterical situations.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had to read this book as part of an assignment. I loved it so much that I ended up getting the rest of the series.  I haven't read them yet but I look forward to doing so. I enjoyed it enough that this is the first time I have taken the time to post a review on any of my purchases from Amazon. I highly recommend this book to just about anyone.

B008M87GJK|5.0|Yes, I like the BBC News.  Excellent and comprehensive articles, covering all area of interest.  I'm very pleased to have it on my Kindle.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|really sets the tone for following novels, expansion of the honorverse and introduces more and more of the key characters.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I truly loved this book, I couldn't put it down. It really makes you think. It was very easy for me to relate to the main character, because I am also a very thoughtful person. I would suggest this book to anyone who may have been through any of the same situations. It gives you a deeper meaning. I really did like this book, has to be one of my favorites. :)
B00APAENUI|5.0|My favorite of the series, never fails to bring a lump to my throat, many many plot lines and a great insight into Grayson.

B00CDSVZHY|5.0|All-star cast, and all of them were brilliant.  Leo DiCaprio- one of his best performances ever!  Jamie Foxx was stellar! Wanted to see it in theaters, and never got the chance. A must see!
B009X01C64|5.0|I am pleasantly surprised at how well the revolve portrait and landscape work.  It was hard to tell based upon the pictures.  So, I took and chance and ordered it anyway.<br /><br />I also like the hand strap and use it regularly.  I like the easy access to HDMI charging ports with the case on as well as the auto shut-off and wake up feature.  The elastic strap is also helpful to keep the case closed when you take it out and about.  The leather is nice, it is padded well for good protection.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this case for the Kindle Fire HD.
B004UPANGM|3.0|Not as good as the first one but watching the1st & 2nd movie it gave me an idea of what to expect out of the newest version of Evil Dead

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Its really fun. I just started playing it and its so much fun. They mix the aspect of zoo and dinosaurs so well.
0385344228|5.0|I didn't like, but thoroughly appreciated, this psychological study built on an unthinkable, horrific family drama. True, the pace was infinitely slow, the characters largely inscrutable (and unlovable, every one), and the courtroom and legal stuff protracted and sometimes excruciating. But it all fits, and I wouldn't change a thing in this book.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and hate to put it down when I start. It is very addictive, but so much fun
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I think it's up there with Lord of the Rings. If you watch the show you will find it follows the book so it may feel like you're watching reruns. But really a great read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a wonder! Every part of the book was awesome. Sometimes it made you sad others it made you happy! I love this book!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|It's perfect for me.  It's had all the station's that I listen to.  It buffers  every now and then but it's to be expected.
B003JHKORK|3.0|The movie was good, but way too different from the book. That is why I didn't enjoy it very much.
159413586X|2.0|Katniss: As soon as she said the words \\"I volunteer as tribute\\" we've loved her strength, passion and fire. But in Mockingjay she speends most of her time hiding in closets and getting drugged.<br /><br />Peeta: Our sweet, kind, loving and downright better person this turns into a mutt. A MUTT!!! Why Collins? I cried and cried when he choked Katniss. Thankfully he somewhat turns to normal. But the boy with the bread is not the same.<br /><br />Prim: Honestly she's the one who started it all. Killed in one horrible sentence. We didn't even have time to mourn. And who killed her? Who was the cause for this injustice? We don't know it might have been Gale but it could have been the capitol.<br /><br /> Gale: He leaves without even saying goodbye.<br /><br />There were so many unnecessary deaths so so many. Poor Finick :(<br /><br />Epilogue: Their love slowly grows back together? What in the world?
B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't actually done the routines yet because I am limbering up a bit with a Yoga dvd I bought.  I did look through them, and they look fast and fun.

B00BSBU4EC|4.0|My kiddos really liked this movie. I thought it was funny as well. It will end up as a purchase.
B0094ZJK4O|4.0|This is a really good album. It just is. Progressive, emotional, well written and executed. I would say equal to his first if not better, yet different (that was a blues record - this is a rock album). I like the edgier feel of this one IMO. Sorry Jon had to pull the rug out from underneath this album before it had any chance to mature, because it is so much better than that watered down \\"Disney\\" record - with no guitar solos, or even bass riffs...<br />Just saying. I do hope things work out for them. But this album is a gem ;-) Keep rocking!
B00821OX98|5.0|The cast, writing, cinematography, everything is top notch. Incredibly fun concept of a post-apocalyptic alien invasion. Great blending of genre. Truly a joy to watch Noah Wyle, Moon Bloodgood, Will Patton, Drew Roy, Connor Jessup, and especially Colin Cunningham perform their craft with such expertise and passion. The character driven narrative in the backdrop of an extraordinary situation makes it all the more fun. This show is a gem in a TV landscape littered with singing competitions and pithy sitcoms. Just watch it. You won't be sorry.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I had just lost my German Shepherd of 10 years when I saw this movie. I had adopted a new dog to replace him and was debating names. When I saw this movie and the meaning of Hachi (Japanese symbol for eight...meaning earth to heaven and back again), I knew I had found the name. As for the movie, it is delightful and so is Richard Gere. I thought that it dragged a bit as Hachi aged but how do you cover 9 years of waiting without it being a little boring, especially since the dialogue during this time is limited. The ending sent me into tears, as you can guess. If you love dogs, you will love this movie.  Be sure to watch the extras regarding the making of the movie, training the dog and training Richard Gere to train the dog. I have renewed respect for him as an actor.

1451627297|5.0|Schoolteacher Jake Epping is about to learn to most stunning secret ever. After being summoned to Al' Diner he is told of a portal aka the rabbit hole that will take him back to 1958. Al's lifetime obsession is to prevent that assassination of John F. Kennedy and he has compiled a book full of Lee Harvey Oswald's movements up but he is missing the key...did he act alone or not. Now cancer has taken the opportunity for Al to find out and he must confide in one man who is young enough, smart enough and doesn't have many ties to go back thru the portal and hang around until 1963 to find out and possibly stop Oswald from committing the assassination. Al's time is short and he needs Jake to believe him so he sends him thru to test the waters. Jake does have one thing he would like to change about what happened to one of his adult students, coincidentally, in 1958, and decides to test the rabbit hole. Even after somewhat successfully achieving his goal and coming back, Jake is hesitant but Al does something to force his hand and Jake has no choice but to head back under his fake identity that Al created for him, George.<br /><br />Having to wait around until 1963, Jake/George starts to become bored and wants to teach again and begins to form attachments to some very interesting characters all of which he was warned not to do. Each new character ends up playing an intricate part in what he came to do. 11/22/63 wouldn't be the novel it is without all the trials that Jake/George endures during his time in the past. The reader becomes deeply invested and wish for a happy outcome even though fate has another idea on what is to become of those that meddle with the future. History does not like change and even though Al warned Jake/George about this, it still takes all of us by surprise.<br /><br />I loved every page of this 842 page novel. King had me quickly flipping pages to find out what happens next and then he left me raw and broken at the end. The time travel aspect is real basic. The portal takes the person to the same day every time and each time you enter it will reset all that was changed that last time someone went through. Though you may be gone for months or years, in your future time you are only gone 2 minutes. The blending of fact and fiction is one of King's strengths and it is showcased brilliantly in this remarkable read. If you enjoyed Under to Dome you will love what King has in store for you in 11/22/63.al basic.

B008EKON56|4.0|Product works wells, does exactly what I need it to, which is work around broken headphone jack on ipod). Product feels very cheep and flimsy, connector feels more like foil than metal, similar material broke very quickly on another product. So far, works great, and at a cheap price I am happy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was touching,amazing,and just courageously good no, it was courageously GREAT!!!!!!!!!!! I just loved it.Everyone should read the book wonder.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The feelings of emotional expression of the charaters are so life like, I had no trouble picturing what they all looked like.  And the twist at the end was unexpected and a wonderful conclusion of the two main characters.

B00000AFGM|5.0|This is lyrically the greatest album ever written, and it translates musically as well. Manson is the greatest that has ever lived. The (un)holy trilogy of Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals, and Holywood can never be duplicated by another artist. This album is beyond classic. It may not be that metal, or industrial for that matter, but it's a phenomenal experiment.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This book continues the saga of the ruling families and kingdoms ,created by Martin, developing complex characters and plots. It is a story rich in imagination and fantasy and seems to reflect both the good and  the bad in human nature.<br />Even better than book  2.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I had bought this for my 10 yr old son. He seen it on tv one day (only caught a little more than 1/2 the movie) but enjoyed it and now cant stop watching the dvd.

B00AQA94M4|5.0|The guests on this record are amazing, like always with Avantasia.  Kiske is the greatest singer alive probably.  The previous metal operas may have been a little better, but hey, they can't just write and play the same style over and over again.......they're not Yngwie!
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|This is the best racing movie ever made.  Great footage on the race course that took on-the-spot innovations to create.  The extras on the DVD are outstanding.
B004RJZA1E|5.0|I really like this album, love the catchy tunes and their approach to vocals. Guitar riffs are a bit weak and lack real cool, complex stuff. Seems the guitar just sticks to mostly chunking on the E string, (believe it's actually down tuned to C) with some filler stuff here and there. Guitar solos aren't bad, drums are great and the bass and keys have some great moments too.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story was a little hard to follow at first, then it got interesting, then the ending fell flat.  I was disappointed.
B005QMOZOO|4.0|Nothing like the original by Ms Austen, but as a murder mystery  - exciting, with lots of 'red herrings' and will leave you guessing to the end. Well written, with plenty of authentic, descriptions of life in earlier times. Elizabeth and Darcy still having trouble with Lidia<br />&#34;Oh what a handful&#34;
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|hearing maiden performing most of the songs off 7th son of a 7th son, my favorite maiden album, and a superb rendition of wasted years<br />off my second favorite (somewhere in time) was enough reason for me to pounce on this double live. but really, every song is performed in classic maiden fury ('die with your boots on' will stay in your head for good, after hearing it here; better than the studio). newcomers will be amazed by the sound of this 88 release and those who worn out their old tapes will be greatful for harris & co for having this gem available on spotlessly remastered cd; all instruments sound amazing and the aura of the songs especially from 7th son, still retain almost all of their studio evilness. highlights: all of it. it's the only live maiden featuring 'moonchild', 'infinite dreams' and 7th son title track, performed by what is in my opinion, maiden's ultimate lineup. enjoy without moderation.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great follow up to a bland second season that sees lots of mayhem and plot twists. I like it a lot.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I know a shows good when I get excited for characters!<br />I spent almost an entire weekend marathoning this series.<br />I love it!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. A movie that you can watch over and over, enjoying every viewing.
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|Paulo at his best! Beautiful quotes and words for everyday life in general. A worthwhile read and keep on hand book
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|It was an ok story. Nowhere as good as the Kite Runner. It was good enough to pass the time though
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was enthralled by Gone Girl. Thought it was one of the best books i have read in a while until the end. Felt like the ending came up short, left reader hanging. Would have preferred elaboration of ending or better yet, different ending. Thought he would kill his wife in the end.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook for Kindle needs work.  It leaves a lot to be desired.  I'm looking forward to an update . . . soon!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The story line keeps your interest throughout the movie. And Jennifer Lawrence gives a powerful, heroic performance. Looking forward to the next one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|That sums up this great little app. No bells and whistles, but none necessary for a basic function (and free) calculator.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Carcassonne is a great game, and this app makes it easy to play. One can play against the computer or other opponents, but the device on which you are playing has to be handed around to the other players. There is no online play, which is why it doesn't get 5 stars.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I loved this story. It won't take you long to read but it is very engaging.<br /><br />I really like the premise behind the book and the magic system that was developed. Brandon Sanderson is great at making up and fleshing out magic systems and even in this shot novella he does it again.<br /><br />I love the way he can paint pictures in your head as you read and The Emperor's Soul is the perfect novella for this. Not only that but Sanderson paints ideas that can grow and with this he leaves plenty of room for the reader to think up different stories that could happen in this magical old world.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is ok, but very glitchy.  When &quot;harvesting&quot; often times it doesn't give credit for the items or experience.
0231161166|5.0|I like this book because it doesn't read like a text book but still packs your mind with information. I really like the writing and the subject is fascinating!<br /><br />If you don't already know epigenetics describes information that changes DNA expression. These changes don't rewrite DNA but influence how parts of it are expressed. This includes why our brain cells, skin cells and lung cells all have the same DNA but are so different (and why someone could take a skin cell and turn it back to a stem cell-this is discussed in the book). This book also talks about environmental changes and their effects on our DNA expression.<br /><br />I like the way Nessa Carey really tries to set the stage for whatever story she tells that highlight different aspects of epigenetics and it's history in science. She introduces the scientist in a way that makes them human working in a human environment even though what they are working on is often times extraordinary.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Love it!! Can access my desktop from my bed. Got it for FAOTD but worth 10 bucks. Awesome!  filler. filler.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a lot of free fun and I'm having fun playing with the amazing world of the Tokyo and the world tour
B00004Y87O|5.0|I remember when this movie came out, at the time I was young and thought it was weird. As I grew older this movie grew onto me, this is a John Carpenter film, it's good but it is not his best. If your a Kurt Russell fan you will love it. It is a different film from Carpenter, but it is still filled with suspense. I will give viewers a tip this movie came out in 82, so it is dated but it's still a great one to watch.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought this was a great story.  Lots of sex and BDSM so if thats not your thing then I would pass on this one.  If you are not sure if its your thing, then I suggest giving it a try.  The underlying story is cute and the sexy parts might inspire you to spice up your own love life.
0679809015|5.0|I give to my 14 month old whenever I change him and it keeps him occupied.  Very cute board and sturdy for a flap board book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this was a great story.  Lots of sex and BDSM so if thats not your thing then I would pass on this one.  If you are not sure if its your thing, then I suggest giving it a try.  The underlying story is cute and the sexy parts might inspire you to spice up your own love life.
B000GOWNPU|2.0|I've seen this'd movie before & it was lame then too. Hell's Kitchen is just Hell's Kitchen. Deniro played a cool priest though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this was a great story.  Lots of sex and BDSM so if thats not your thing then I would pass on this one.  If you are not sure if its your thing, then I suggest giving it a try.  The underlying story is cute and the sexy parts might inspire you to spice up your own love life.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love this show! I want Alicia to be with will so badly! Never saw the ending coming though and can't wait for next season!!!
B001O53BK6|5.0|Hillarious. Good acting too. ...reminded me of the old days, with a nice tie to the present. Also has some pretty good wisdom that isn't obvious or goofy.
B0011Z31V8|4.0|There's a slew of Prince songs that I remembered as I listened to this collection.  I thought, &#34;Hey, it's been forever but I remember that one!&#34;.  Nice change of pace, less expensive than purchasing the singles separately.  If you like Prince (even just the more mainstream singles) and don't already have all of the albums, this will get you caught up!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|This is a very funny movie with great color and graphics. My children and I watched this together. The loading was prefect, no freezing.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|If you're squeamish about taboos, don't even go NEAR this film.<br />Brothers and gay and in love with each other. That's enough to send a lot of people's heads spinning, but I do like my movies to be controversial.<br />The two leads have an EXTREME chemistry, more so than almost ANY other couple I have ever seen in a movie. Plus, they're cute - especially the older brother, whose face is the most stunningly beautiful thing to grace my tv-screen in a looooong time.<br />I found it very sweet and touching and sexy :)
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|It shows problems playing MP4 videos on the Kindle.<br /><br />The number of frames per second is not correct. The movies play as if they were recorded in slow motion.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I chose this rating because I have always liked Star Trek and I enjoyed seeing it again.  Looking forward to viewing the next season also
B0081JFGQU|5.0|One of the best bands out there right now! They are amazing live and this album captures it all. I can't wait for another album!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Last shark is awesome :-) Good luck on all the missions! The map is really helpful and save your jewels for the treasure missions.
0061733199|5.0|Love this handbook. Very easy to read and comprehend. Accurate illustrations. Flat out an amazing guide to own. Should be in every home in my opinion.<br /><br />Perfect size text and book itself in my opnion. Fits right in a bugout bag without the bulk. Its paperback so its flexible too.<br /><br />If youre just a begninger at the outdoor survival then this is the book for you to get. If your a  seasoned outdoorsman and you know a lot of things about survival, than this is the book for you if youre looking to sharpen those skills again. Very useful information on just about everything you can imagine from choosing a perfect knife to health information to navigation by stars plus so much more.<br /><br />This book has it all! Cant say enough about it.<br /><br />I highly highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a survival handbook. I bought this for my brother and skimmed through it, needles to say, Im bought one for me that same day I looked through it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is amazing and beautiful I can not live without them no one can top them I love you Suzanne Collins!
B007PFD90G|2.0|I bought this book after hearing Rushdie interviewed.  From what I recall, he spoke eloquently about protecting free speech.  I'd heard others praise the book as well. Consequently, I took a chance.<br /><br />Oy veh!<br /><br />His description of the writing process did nothing for me. His descriptions of dinner parties and assorted get togethers seemed to be name dropping at best. His love life... I know much less about the love life of many, many, many people and am much happier for it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the most exiting app I've ever downloaded. It's fun and addictive!!! You won't be able to put it down. 5 stars!!!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Dr. Who &#34;Hello.. I'm the Doctor..Basically....Run.&#34;  This sets the tone for a very pithy direct way to go abut dialog and get to the point of a plot.  It really makes the most of the show's long and strong past to tell stories that otherwise could bog down.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone interested in getting closer to what they eat.  Everyone should know how we get our food and how we should get it.  Well written and easy to read as well as extremely entertaining!  Worth every minute!
B00BHMF578|5.0|A picture of a difficult time when one could stay the course and win the prize without carping critics.  I am amazed by the reality of the location scenes.  Just wish they really could make &#34;Lord of Light&#34; into a film.  Zelazny has been overlooked for too long.
B009R659L8|3.0|I love MHC old writing style - these books don't have much substance anymore.  Wish she would take a year and write a substantial book instead of churning out 1-2 books a year.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Excellent wrap up of the long series of the wheel of time. I am still reading the book, it is keeping me wondering, how could it get any worse before the good guys win.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the third in the series and equally as exciting to read.  It keeps your attention all through out the story.
B009O2XY12|3.0|you shouldn't have to wait soooo long to retry to complete the levels after you run out of bubbles.<br />Entertaining for the most part.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|I have read many stories about this notable gangster, and Penn played the part very well. Cohen was a ruthless man and sent many to the grave. If you think Capone was bad, Cohen made him look like a saint.  It was his greed that did him in, and in 51 it was all over for the last great gangster. I will watch this movie again. I love stories about the old gangster days, I used to live about 6 houses down from Capone's place in Lake Geneva Wis. back in the 50's Do yourself a favor and purchase this movie, you will want to see it agin. Enjoy
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This is a complex novel that take the reader through the complexity of a muliticultural adoption by providing insight from not only the child, point of view, but the natural and adoptive parents as well. The author develops very beleivable characters as well as exotic atmospheres and tells a multi layered story with pulls at your heart strings with its twits and turns that will hold the readers interest.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love this game. It came in great shape, and was cheaper to buy on Amazon than at Target (one of the only stores that sold it). It's highly addictive, and fun to play with anyone. Great for families or parties (there's an expansion pack that's pretty cheap if you want to play with more than 4 people also).
B003008RWA|5.0|This is a great review of what's going on in our country.  Moore's perspective is always extreme, but it reminds me that my sense of reality needs a good shock every once in a while.  Even though this is not completely current, I would recommend a watch.
0141040378|5.0|Very pretty cover, I actually cut all the pages out and made it a hollow book box. It'll make a great gift!
B009NXAMW6|5.0|Richard Gere is a lawyer the best in town.<br />But he client lied him.se doesnt,he is defending a real criminal
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling  has given us a clear, insider's view of a collection of families living in a small West England town.  A single event has a different effect on each family and all their disfunctions come into play  while respondinrg to this singular event.
B0053B347M|5.0|I purchased this item after searching for a reasonably priced back-light. The first one I received from Amazon was damaged, but I was promptly shipped a replacement that works fine. Some people are stating that it is not bright enough, I feel that the 6 tiny L.E.D.'s on this strip are bright enough for their intended purpose. I have a 24\\" monitor (largest the product claims to fit) and it works fine. I didn't notice much difference in picture quality, BUT I have noticed reduced eye strain. I will probably be buying more of these, one for my second monitor and maybe some for my work computers.
B0046179EO|5.0|Highly recommended to any Beatle's fan - great recording, great songwriting, tragic story. If all you ever knew about was just their music it would be enough!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Purchased this to accompany theater tickets... great holiday gift. Our family loves the score and listens frequently in the car, especially.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please buy it's fun plus multiplayer coming soon<br />can't wait till updates gonna be fun EPIC GAME BUY NOW PLEASE!!!
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|I wish this was the unedited version.  If anyone can find it please direct me to it so that I may purchase it.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|While I have no doubt SEALS are incredibly tough and skillful, Chris Kyle comes across as a borderline Sociopath. Perhaps this is necessary but it is frightening all the same.
0316228532|5.0|If J.K. Rowling continues in the style she has established in The Casual Vacancy, lovers of Barbara Pym and Jane Austen have a new, and living, writer to read.  I had no interest in this book based on many of the reviews. Although I know Rowling is a craftsmanlike writer, H.P. was never my cup of tea. Then,  somewhere, I read that this book is about ordinary people. Having finished it today, I cannot wait for her next book. Finally a still living author who writes un-bombastic, intricately crafted, tales of how people of all classes live their daily lives. She understands children, teens, adults, the elderly. Rowling is such a marvelous student of human nature in all of its glory and shame. Again I must compare her to Jane Austen in both the intricacy of her plot and the basic simplicty of her characters, many of whom, sadly, never seem to get the lessons Rowling clearly understands. Can't wait for her next one!
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Good movie.  Not a great super duper exceptional movie that you will want to own or watch every year, but a good movie.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|This is a great tv series.  The second season strays from the book more than the first season, but it's still a great story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Makes checking battery status much easier.  Never have to go into device settings...I love this app and highly recommend it.
B00003CXGG|4.0|Have been looking for this movie for awhile. Like the action and the music is pretty good and Aaliyah is too.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|awesome!!! If you grew up in the 80's you should own this movie and this sound track.  It's &#34;Grease&#34; for my generation!!!!
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|This movie has it all! A classic underdog story and great special effects. A very engaging movie that you will find yourself watching it over and over. Once your done you'll want to get in the ring and duke it out with someone! I recommend to everyone and a definitely must see movie!!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|awesome!!! If you grew up in the 80's you should own this movie and this sound track.  It's &#34;Grease&#34; for my generation!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Same style game as Temple Run, but with a unique feel. Swipe to go left and right instead of tilting your device. Only drawback to me is that the abilities aren't as good as TR, and double coins is an in-app purchase that I feel is a bit expensive.<br /><br />Fun game!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|That was 90 minutes of my life I will never get back.  This was the worst movie ever! Julianne Hough is a great dancer, but she's a horrible actress.  I just can't believe there are that many A-list stars in such a terrible movie!
B00B18OL78|5.0|Sure, what he did with the Animals was great, but this is like a genuine update of it in every way and I understand why he calls it &#34;Until your river runs dry&#34;...
1932907009|5.0|It really helped me enormously to structure my script and make sure that everything happens when its supposed to happen. well worth it!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Why follow trends? I mean, when the secret was big and the crowd was following it, it meant nothing. When the crowd is not following, that is when it all means the most when you really consider things. After all, the real secret of the successful few is that they do not follow the crowd when it is &#34;fashionable&#34;, that they are genuine individuals. In fact, there is a subtle warning throughout the book about this fact, although Dr. Robert Anthony, if you read his works and advertisements is more overt and honest about the fact that I am talking about. The secret is not a fad or a fashion, it is what a genuinely successful individual uses to become a genuinely successful individual, not a &#34;dedicated follower of fashion on a given day.&#34; In fact, this sort of &#34;fashion for a few seconds in history&#34; is what keeps the secret a secret from most people. I know, I am an individual, I do not follow fashion or trend. I am.
B00621E94E|5.0|This series was fantastic. I feel like a part of my life is over now that I've finished the series.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I found it very convenient having the top videos at my finger tips, I should have downloaded it a long time ago.
0316216453|5.0|\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" transports us to the memories of Charles Ryder, a young official of the British army in World War II. Fate makes him come back to Brideshead, where years before his best friend's family -the Flyte's- lived. He first met Sebastian Flyte at Oxford, then he introduced him to the rest of his family.<br />Evelyn Waugh illustrates a passionate story of real people who face real problems, and who have to take decisions from the deepest part of their conscience. Disagreements will be clear between the disbeliever Charles and the members of this profoundly catholic family, whose charming siblings Charles could never forget. However, time shall put everything right.<br />Sebastian is the perfect characterisation of the young student who faces a state of great freedom, living away from home, at Oxford. His eldest sister, Julia, is an independent young woman who tries to settle down in her life. Both of them would change Charles' mind in some way.<br />Maybe, it is the characters that I enjoyed the most about this novel. When I read it, I actually shared their aspirations, their problems, their thoughts.<br />I think that readers will find it easy to read, a gripping book which will introduce them to a charming home that would never be forgotten, as happened to Charles Ryder.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!! Lots of twist and turns. The author did a good job of keeping you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think you know, NO YOU DON' T !!!!!  Highly recommend
B003G4W49C|3.0|Hi there bob here. I had just read Enders game and it was okay. I would recommend it for someone who likes sci-fi books.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love this mini-series!  Highly recommend to everybody.  Every season from the first gets better and better and I am looking forward to a building climax at the end.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading 50 shades I couldn't wait to get  to this series. Wasn't disappointed. Will have a Christian/Gideon party soon
B002SSUQFG|4.0|All my life I had been a digital watch guy. Over the last 6 months for some reason I have been obsessed with getting a mechanical or automatic watch. I found this Seiko 5 on Amazon, and did an ungodly amount of research on watches before I bought it.<br />The watch showed up in perfect condition. It showed up a week before I was expecting it to show up. I Set the time, set the date, and began to wear it.<br />Initially, it was running 22 seconds fast each day.  I adjusted the regulator in the back and then it was five seconds slow everyday. Lol. So, i adjusted the regulator again and now it gains only two to three seconds in a day. Incredible. gaining or losing 30 seconds a day is within spec for these watches, however, with a miniscule amount of tweaking this watch is incredibly accurate.<br />Plus, it looks great  and the and the Lume on the hands and face work great all night long (slowly fading of course).<br />I am very happy with this watch.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|Not a big fan of in this moment. Don't get me wrong they do have moments of brilliance, but they are brief. This album however is exceptional. It has more raw emotion than any of their other albums. It is definitely worth a listen
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a fabulous show and I am watching all past episodes to get up to speed! Hope it ends up season this strong.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is a horror/science fiction book but, Dean Koontz loves dogs and if you do too, you will enjoy this book.<br />It  is based on an experiment with an animal and a human. The human part comes out within the dog and he cannot communicate with the young boy who takes him in. The boy is in grave danger...how can the dog tell him?<br />I loved this book and will read it again.
0385349947|3.0|Me - an executive mom and the daughter of an executive mom. So needless to say, I was super excited to read this book and get inspired. I was looking forward to the controversial messaging I had heard so much about on the news, but I was sorely disappointed. One would have to be ridiculously sensitive to interpret Sandberg's message as harsh or critical towards women. It's basically an editorial of her personal workplace experiences with women, the scientific research to back up her claims, and some ways women can recognize these behaviors. I had never heard of her prior to this book so the 'coming up' personal biography portions were boring to me, I liked the motivating messages much better, more of that please!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I love the show and the video was very clear!  I would order again.  The video feed didn't hestiate at all and we were able to watch uninterrupted.<br /><br />Thanks,
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My seven year old loves this move as do I! We watch it quite a bit and the price was AWESOME!
B009R659L8|3.0|Am not sure if MHC is losing her edge or if I have been reading so many other books of this genre and have become desensitised<br />to brutality, but I came away feeling as if I had read one of my teenaged grandaughter's novels.<br /><br />This book would have more appeal to the teen or church lady readers.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Thou this series is not as compelling to me as the Highland series, it is still a very good book.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|An entertaining book, but a little squirrelly. When reading a mystery, one doesn't expect a 150 year old woman, twins raised to provide spare parts, one for the other, a Nazi wannabe camp in the Brazilian jungle atop near-active volcano, all pretty bizarre stuff.<br />I also didn't like the way characters drifted in, only to reappear at the end of the book as a key player. I usually like Preston and Child, but not so much this time.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark never disappoints and this book is exceptional. I always look forward to a new story by her.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it. I was skeptical of the book because everyone sais it was so raunchy. It actually has a good romance story.
B000002KK2|5.0|I still remember the first time I heard Chuck E's In Love and was blown away.  Most of the album is as good or better than that.  Like most of her abums this one runs out of gas near the end but it is still as amazing and fresh today as it was 30 years ago.  Here is a song by song rating (5 is amazing):<br />1. Chuck E.'s In Love - 5<br />2. On Saturday Afternoons In 1963 - 5<br />3. Night Train - 4<br />4. Young Blood - 5<br />5. Easy Money - 5<br />6. Last Chance Texaco - 4<br />7. Danny's All-star Joint - 5<br />8. Coolsville - 4<br />9. Weasel and The White Boys Cool - 4<br />10. Company - 4<br />11. After Hours (Twelve Bars Past Goodnight) - 4<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Problem about this book is that once you get started it's difficult to stop reading it.<br />Countless sleepless nights as a result
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I enjoyed angry birds, and it was nice to see a new version of the same game.  Those piggies drive me crazy!
0375869026|5.0|This is not only a literary masterpiece but a book that makes you a better person and parent.  Better than any parenting book in the planet!
B00985E3UG|5.0|Great Book well reseached and written.  Very eye opening to one who is subject to this conspiricy!<br />Take Great Care<br />jim Labb
0385349947|3.0|The copy of the book that I received did not have its pages cut properly. The pages are all different sizes, and jagged at the edges. It looks like the machine that cut and bound the pages chewed on the pages. It is annoying to turn the pages with these screwed up edges. I should have received a discount on this brand new book
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Awesome movie by Universal. I had a fun time with Despicable Me. Steve Carrell really made me laugh as the  bad guy(who has a heart) Gru. The minions also kept me rolling throughout the movie as well. The Three girls Edith,Agnes,and Margo bring enough charm and warm heartedness that will result in some adorable moments in certain parts with the movie. I am a die hard Pixar fan, but I was impressed and glad that I was finally able to watch this movie. No complaints to be made at all with Despicable Me, overall, a great film that anyone will love. Despicable Me 2 Is already on my 2013 Must Watch list, so it should come as no surprise that Despicable Me itself gets:<br /><br />5 stars
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book. I hope there is another one. This book really made me feel like the books should go on.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This season keeps you enthralled and you get to learn more background information on characters that are common in the show. This season is still creative with the story lines but season has the edge in that department. Still very much worth seeing.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|simple and fun. as a basic car driving game it has a cartoon fun feel to it. i enjoy it and it will most definitely keep boredom away.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|it came in a good time and i was satisfied with the product! i would definitely buy from them again. even included another disney movie!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Needs a few Fixs and needs to add a few things it's a great game one of the best everyone should play thing game
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I purchased this for use in power outages. It met my expectations. The LED's give off a very bright light. I'll probably use it on my backpacking treks into the wild too. It's bright enough to give you that extra sense of security, in addition to a fire, when you are packing into country with large predators. I also like the dual light level settings, and the emergency strobe feature. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app allows you to add puzzles, so you'll never run out of puzzles. Best of all it has 288 pieces mode which make the puzzles quite challenging. Would have been nice if it had even a harder choice
B005DJREJS|3.0|Not the best show out there but it was something to watch. If you are bored then give it a shot,
B009AMANH4|5.0|Three of us watched.  Two gave it &#34;thumbs up&#34;.  The other said it was slow moving and unexciting.  The Academy Award winning film had something for all of us.  An interesting twist at the end.  Not that we are history buffs but we enjoyed it and learned part of history that we did not know about.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great show if you like horrors. It combines catholic church, exorcism, human experiments and mental illness. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Some scenes were gruesome.
B003OFHMKO|4.0|An interesting, eclectic album.  I use it to work out with sometimes, incorporating modern dance.  It is not a background music piece, it needs a person's attention.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book was a very good read.  It was very harsh at times but very interesting.  I felt very strong about the little girl and wished her well throughout.  Hard to put down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can build your own house.But becarfull because there's zombies.I hate the creeper because they blow up.love the game so much.Buy this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I play it like for 2-3 hours a day and I like when u r on the boards because she u crush u don't die!!!!!!!!!
1936891026|5.0|I am currently going to school for journalism and writing; to be honest, I had never fully committed to the idea of &#34;turning pro&#34; until after I read this book. It inspired me on so many levels.<br /><br />Since reading it I have delved more professionally into my education. On top of that, I have started writing daily blog posts so as to combat what Pressfield calls, &#34;Resistance&#34;.<br /><br />The best thing is, this book is great for anyone struggling with procrastination!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book so much . It is the best . I love the whole series. It is fun to read on a kindle too.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this is the most funest game in the world.<br />I like that you can play with your frends and you can bild stuff.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|This is a continuation of Lauren Olivers first book Delirium.  It takes a very different turn with the same characters.  Lena needs to learn to survive in a world that is truely alien to her.  Even the her love for Alex is tested.  A nice second book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|No spoilers ...<br /><br />If you are considering this book you have read all the rest.<br /><br />* It ties up the major plot lines well.<br />* The action is intense to the point you can get tired reading it as your body has stress reactions to the various maneuvering of the armies<br />* The major characters play their expected parts in expected ways, but do it well.<br /><br />Sanderson also leaves some of the major questions open for exploration (e.g. The Seanchan) so that we will hopefully get new authors adding to the history of the world Jordan built.<br /><br />Enjoy the finish to this epic series for what it is and move on to some other great epics:<br /><br />* Malazan - Book of the Fallen<br />* A Song of Ice and Fire<br />* The Assassin's Apprentice
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Simple game that keeps us both entertained. We take turns and try to beat each others score. We also like the gadgets we can purchase from the coins we get in the game.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I was a huge Cinderella fan in the good old days so I was expecting a more rocking album from Tom.  That said, I can still recognize and appreciate great songwriting and great playing. This album has both great songs and performances. Highly recommended!!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I can play it just fine but my seven year old dies all the time and does not like it as much because of it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|great movie. Watched with my boys and they loved it. Re-reading the books as well :) As a mom of three, any movie that also fuels the fire to read is a five star plus in my book!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Excellent plot - parents, especially father, thorn between the love for the son and increasing evidence of his guilt. Interesting theory about the &#34;killing gene&#34;....
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great conclusion, action from the start to the finish. Nicely tied up almost all of the loose ends quite nicely.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Music better than some games, still gets annoying after a week-can't the music change as they achieve levels? Kids do learn problem solving.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|I sometimes used this movie as a feeling when I lived in Iowa. I had all these friends think being different was ok and they would take me places I really shouldn't be or never felt comfortable in. So, I would always say, \\"oh, that's some boys don't cry s***!\\" My friends didn't know what I was talking about. So I bought them this movie. They stopped asking me to go to those places anymore. You will love this movie, buy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game in the world I ever played in my life time and will be the best
1592332803|5.0|Fortunately for me, my wife loves baking. So this was definitely a great purchase for me. She gets to bake, then I get to enjoy the baked goods. Pretty sure we love everything Colleen does and Joy of Vegan Baking is no exception. The chocolate chip cookies are a staple. The chocolate cake and chocolate chip banana muffins are also delicious. This should definitely be a go to when baking vegan.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of super hero movies but this one has enough of a plot and humor to be the ultimate exception.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I found the movie to be very distasteful. When purchasing it I did not realize just how bad it would be. The preview made me this it was going to be a cute movie. Sorry.
B00ATX7FLA|5.0|Perfect addition to my son's collection. He has all of them now. I think I might even hang the planets from the ceiling for more enjoyment.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is hilarious. I never followed Tina Fey much, so some of the jokes went over my head, but I enjoyed her commentary on life. The only downside to the e-book is the footnotes aren't hyper-linked. By the time I made it to the end of the book to read them, they didn't make sense anymore. Great book though!
B000ZK4T98|5.0|Non stop thrills!!!  Definitely the best in the series to date.  Bruce at his sardonic best and a strong plot.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have this app on my tablet, phone, and pc. Really enjoy  that I can sync, buy,  and read the same material on all three devices.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love this app its makes teh fire app just like the phone app instead of it just opening the webpage now wish i could take the factory installed facebook app off my fire to keep only this one it is a thousand times better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is possibly the best show to ever grace the television screen. I'm really glad I have this to watch on my amazon account now!
B004LROUNG|4.0|After several best sellers, I had grown a little tired of Grisham novels.  While this book was not a heart-stopping thriller, the characters were human and the story made me hope there are lawyers out there who really change for the better!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever I love it so much I'm working on the second one now it's amazing so far. Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeee this is so amazing .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So enjoy the cast and the plot lines...those English are fascinating, indeed! Can't wait for the next season's episodes as well.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I was really surprised to find out this is a thinking game.  It makes you answer questions and you have to be able to spell as well.  So you get comprehension, critical thinking and spelling!
B002RT5SR2|5.0|This movie plus Part 1 and 2 of Atlas Shrugged should be a wake up call to all the people who love America and what it stands for.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Wondeful CD! Love it and her! Real favorite and a great addition to my musical library and life. High recommend
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved it!  It was free with Prime - wondering if they are going to offer Season 3 on Prime eventually?  It's a bit expensive to buy it, especially in HD.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|It is a cord-it is not included with the Kindle and to make it work you have to have it-right? Is it really necessary to leave a review for an item like this
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the challenging puzzles. The fact that there aren't instructions or `highlighted` hints like so many of the other games makes it even better!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I have been watching all the episodes nonstop and season 3 is no exception!! I will continue to buy them as long as they keep making them.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I had no idea how SM lived, always loved her, was glad to get the perspective from aa family member who lived it rather than 3rd person biography
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I love love love this show. I have watched all the seasons and this one is no exception. Totally worth buying all episodes as the suspense builds as time goes on.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|have yet to see it show up on my Kindle to even use.  Not worth the effort to chase, disappointing
B008O9V4C2|2.0|Sorry, the music presented here is too accessible, appearing to be an attempt to make \\"hit records\\" in a very conventional format. \\" Miss Marlene \\" is reminiscent of the high quality that Fagen /Steely Dan is known for. Compared to that \\" Sunken Condos \\" is quite corny. Nothing here to add to the Steely Dan Dictionary.    [...]
0345803485|1.0|This book was poorly written and disgusting. Author uses the same descriptions over and over again.  Numerous typos throughout the book.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This is one of the more entertaining movies to come out in a while.  The acting is superb.  Tarantino is back!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I was educated to the ways of the outside world.  Was shocked as to the way women are treated in other countries.  A must-read and cannot wait for his new book.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|If it wasn't for the absolutely phenomenal acting, I would unfortunately give this 2 stars.  I really wanted to like it more, but the pacing was just atrocious.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once I read the first book, I HAD to read the rest. Christian and Ana are enthralling from beginning to ending!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Less Facebook<br /><br />Too many goals I leave undone because of the excess of Facebook goals<br /><br />Be able to toggle Facebook goals in game plz
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I would not recommend this book as I did not like the way it was written or the way it ended.
B009R659L8|4.0|I have always LOVED Mary Higgins Clark.  She captures you from the beginning and takes you for an exciting ride.  At<br />night when I am reading her books it is always &#34;just one more chapter, just one more chapter.&#34;  No blood and guts just<br />good ole cat and mouse.
B008VBYN80|5.0|so much fun you will love it. really great. amazing.I loved it so will you. really great also try world at arms
B00ANMAH30|5.0|Absolute classic Genesis, one of the group's best! You can really hear the band becoming what they would become starting with this record. The elements of Trespass and Nursery Cryme mesh together nicely to create the band's signature sound.
B0037VNX44|4.0|intriguing character study.  Intensity of the main character translated nicely into storyline. well done. I enjoyed this movie. If you enjoy old time gangster flicks, you will probably enjoy this movie as well. amazingly well translated onto the screen.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I absolutely love this show! So many twists and turns! How do the writers think this stuff up?  It is definitely a \\"must watch\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down! As soon as it was over I had to download the next book and keep readaing!
B00A2FSSHK|5.0|Seemed futuristic years ago, but it's pretty believable now. We haven't gotten to retinal scanners yet, but cell phones track us almost as well.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is a very fun game to play when ur just sitting at home doing noting this game will always keep you busy!!!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|So Happy Amazon has the site because there are times you only want one or two songs and with this I can download it.  Its user friendly Can't go wrong
B00846REIS|5.0|Okay I have to write this review bc the main reviewer is wrong.. Gideon and Ava seem perfect but they are not<br />And that is what the story is about. How 2 broken people come together and figure out their relationship. Sylvia Day's writing is so descriptive you feel that you are there with them.. Don't pass this up. It's a quick and fun read.. It's addictive and in book 2 you really find out more about each of them and get their neediness for each other. I so enjoyed reading this book. Can't wait for book 3. Enjoy!
B000F90312|1.0|I hate this CD!  It is not representative of the music from the movie.  Instead of containing all of the beautiful songs from the movie, it contains three renditions of the movie's theme song (one good, two boring), while the rest of the songs are ones the movie only played a small portion of--and for good reason--they are TERRIBLE!  I played the CD for several friends who are professional musicians, and they hated it, too.  I feel like I got ripped off.  Can you return a CD simply because it doesn't meet your expectations?  The CD is in excellent condition, it's just horrible music, in my opinion.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow.. This book is a sequel and I liked it better than bared to you, which was a great read too. I don't know what is is about Eva and Gideon but I'm hooked. You want to think their relationship is unhealthy until you realize they are the real deal. Sylvia Day's writing is so unbelievable in this book, that I couldnt get enough and now I have to wait a month for the ending.. Only start this when you have time to get lost.. I loved this book. Goodnight finally.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I had seen this movie previously & liked it so much I saved it on my DVR - but with the DVD I can take it with me anywhere!
B000HF6XKO|5.0|I don't know why I avoided this movie for years.  However, I am glad that I finally saw it.  Dependencies of any kind can be very painful.  And, we all have them if you think about it.  For example, as countries, if we depend on the Middle East for oil, or on China for money and credit, or on Mexico for drugs, our dependency could eventually hurt us.  But, we don't even have to adopt a global view of this movie's message.  Just look at the Justice Department character who had an \\"emotional\\" dependency and enabling relationship with his alcoholic father.  I just buried my father, and I clearly see that a true dependency can hurt your life in ways that you cannot begin to imagine.
0811875040|4.0|What a beautiful book! Gorgeous, full of fun recipes. You need to be a somewhat advanced baker, but they forewarn you which recipes are more difficult before you start. All details included and the book's beauty can't be beat.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am so in love with these books.  I think this is the best love story I've read in a long time. Variety is the spice of life. Great job!!
B000NW5CDK|5.0|Fantastic history lesson. on a great artist.  Personally I am a big fan so enjoyed it immensely!  Well done and presented.
B001BANK32|5.0|Brilliant storytelling by Mr. King as always, just the right kind of crazy an macabre to get my day started.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I got this book thinking that it was strictly a biography on Nikola Tesla, but it's a little more than that.  It is an inspirational book, but it didn't get to Tesla specifically until about a third of the way through.  At first this bothered me, but by the time I was finished with the book I understood what the author was getting at, which is to stick to your goals and aspirations, and don't let the world get in the way of following your imagination.<br /><br />This is a well written book that does give a good overview on Tesla's life and struggles, and throws in a bit more to inspire the reader.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I have been told by several of our friends this is a must watch series - and they were right. We were hooked the first episode - can't wait to see what happens in season 3 now.
B0094M2SCI|2.0|It's the type of film where the villian is named \\"Craven\\". Yeah, we get it.<br /><br />Stylish as heck and Beckinsale is certainly visually striking, but this is a film devoid of any recognizable characters and which plods through a series of plot developments that no one cares about, really.  Cut the running length in half and I might recommend it as a bit of brainless eye candy.
1932907009|3.0|I bought Save the Cat because the write-up said that the author, Blake Snyder, had gotten his scripts made. It turns out his best-remembered movies were Blank Check and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. Even when I was 10 I thought those movies were badly written. Many of the example movies Snyder uses over and over to make his points - 4 Christmases, The Retreat, Ride-Along - aren't well remembered for their writing either. If you're not trying to write an old school, fluffy Hollywood comedy then you can still learn something from this book, but it probably won't, in fact, be the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book, what a page turner.  I don't normally read romance novels but this one is not the typical love story.  I would recommend this book.
B000VZUT64|5.0|You gotta love this album. Trower's best. Released back in 1974, but sounds like it was just yesterday. Great guitar riffs that equal the greats like Hendrix. If you like Hendrix, you'll like Trower!(many called him the &#34;White Hendrix) &#34;Bridge of Sighs&#34; is a trip back to the rock music of the early seventies. &#34;Day of the Eagle&#34; is undeniably a spin off of Hendrix style of music. The album in its entirety is an enduring work that merits the time to sit, listen and enjoy. Great care was taken remastering the tracks. If you enjoy(ed) Jimi Hendrix's guitar and effects, you won't be disappointed with Robin Trower's Bridge of Sighs.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was slow to start but man was it really good and it had several different small stories in it.  I would recommend this book.  The best part was the historical correctness.
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|It can't be more evident that the years have definitely polished Robin's guitar skills and vocals.He continues to caress his Stratocaster with a passion that could make you cry! Listen to his interpretation of &#34;The Thrill is Gone&#34; and you'll know why. And the Blues? Listen to &#34;Little Red Rooster&#34; you will hear what a master guitarist can do with his guitar. Definitely an album for Blues-Rock devotees.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I think this is one of the best books I've read ALL YEAR!!! I loved it! Such a romantic comedy.
B00B2064IY|4.0|If you're a Hendrix fan, you will definitely enjoy this album. This album sounds like it's right out of the 60's. The remastering of the tracks makes them sound like they were recorded yesterday. Among the better tracks &#34;Hear My Train A Comin'&#34;, and &#34;Easy Blues&#34;. This album is definitely  for a Jimi Hendrix fan.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Wish this game was more for young children, it's hard to understand. Not very easy to navigate. Positive side- it's Nemo! Color is Great!!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|this app is great.  It easily flip from categories of stories, ie, sports, news, etc. with just a flick of the finger.  Try it, you'll the features and action
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Excellant film, the secrets of family life where Popa is king. I now have watched it at least 10 times. found subtitles hard to read.<br />but then my screen is 7&#34; wide! Pay attention to what children don't say.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was an awesome read. I am 42 with 5 kids from the ages 22 to 3. I have read many many books in those 42 years and I have to say this book is in my top 20. Travis Maddox is one sexy guy! Abby is a tough chick. They may have an interesting relationship but I think they are great together. This is a must read along with the sequel. Walking Disaster.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|To many casualties in this book. I found it quite depressing.  Nothing happened the way I hoped that it would.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|it freezes takes your tokens and everything. ever since the update it has went downhill I used to love this game but sorry its gotten worse
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|It starts out fun. When you start getting into it.....it starts wanting you to go to facebook or Twitter. Will not allow you to go on playing unless you log in to Facebook or Twitter. It really gets annoying!!
B00BFBSV72|4.0|but its still fun could use a lil more tweaking especially during the boss battles. its a fun game ive enjoyed it so far. happy jumping
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is actually a challenge! A great problem solving game. Love playing it. It's addicting!! Requires you to use the creative engineer part of your brain.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is not meant to be a groundbreaking novel....its mean to entertain and it does.<br />Sometimes you just need to sit back,relax and read something fun and that is exactly what I did with fifty shades.<br /><br />However if reading something a little naughty is offending to you instead of entertaining and enjoyable then you need to pass on his series.
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|Like just about every other reviewer, I was hesitant about watching this.  Would it live up to the Silent Hill 3 movie in my head?  Well, I can answer that question for you: No, it did not.  But adaptations seldom do.  Truth is, I loved the movie.  Once I put aside my pre-conceived notions of what I wanted to see, I was blown away.  And I like the fact that it's a somewhat modern adaptation of what I consider a classic story.  I really wouldn't want to see a frame by frame reproduction of the game, I could just sit down and play it.  And that way I could immerse myself in that creepy feeling you can only get playing these games.  No movie is going to give you that.<br /><br />We Silent Hill fans are biased, to be sure.  But this movie did not fail.  References to the game are everywhere, and I'll admit I was miffed when other games from the franchise popped up.  Case in point: Pyramid Head.  Um, he died in Silent Hill 2.  But he's iconic.  Why wouldn't I want to see him in the movie?  They took a fascinating character, and one pretty cool to look at, and transplanted him into a new role that gives even more depth to his character.  And instead of looking for ways I thought the movie lacked the feeling of the game, I started wishing elements from the movie were in the original game.  Case in point: the Mannequin Tarantula.  How cool would it have been to fight that thing?  Visually the movie is off the charts, especially the scene in which Heather reveals Claudia's true nature.  Konami wishes they were capable of those effects when they designed the game!  Very little of the effects have that 'fake' quality, but some did (um, the mirror scene).<br /><br />Overall I wasn't disappointed.  But for me, the movie ended after the final fight scene.  I didn't much care for the bit that came after, the tidy wrapping up of the story.  I like to feel there's more to tell.  But I found myself hitting replay because I was so mesmerized by this 'version' of the game.  I can't give it five stars because I can't give anything five stars, but my final score is this: watch it for the special effects alone.  You'll be glad you did.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I have been reading this book since I was a child and any chance I get to have my own copy .. I am jumping on it. I love that it has all the stories and not just the one story told the Disney way. Thanks
B008602KQI|5.0|I really liked it, it was very exciting, different story setting unlike any other, it's a little predictable but good enough for me to want to read the books
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app works as functionally as Splashtop and has two features that are mildly better. The mouse's location is mirrored to the PC, making it somewhat possible (with notable lag) to play video games. The circle for fine movements of the mouse is a godsend for those of us with huge fingers that obscure whatever is below them.<br /><br />Ironically I used Splashtop to remotely install the client program on my PC. Everything works great, even with Google 2-factor authentication.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|the best film to come along in such a long time........My 11 yr. old granddaughter has watched it over a dozen times and sings along with the movie.  Money well spent, by far.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|The story was compelling, the acting was riveting, and the scenery was gorgeous. DeNiro, Irons and Neeson were all superb. I didn't like the ending, but it reflected how events played out during the time period.
0897502027|3.0|I've owned several copies of Tao of JKD over the years. Loan it out, lose it, replace it, repeat. So the last time I went to a brick and mortar store to grab a copy I find this \\"New Expanded Edition\\".<br /><br />In a word: ugh.<br /><br />All the new formatting is awful. It's like the editors decided to make it more \\"now\\" and fashionable but really only succeeded in obscuring the content. Tao of JKD was always somewhat disjointed, but the over-large fonts and formats make it feel stilted now, as if there's less content on each page. I did not like it at all, did not find it readable, and refused to pay the cover price for what I felt was now a worse layout of the book (at least Amazon gives customers a great deal on that last point). I put the book back on the shelf and ordered a used reprint of the original for a third of the New Expanded Edition's current list price from an online seller.<br /><br />The content of the original is still there, but it's lessened by the new format.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show has instantly become one of my absolute favorites. I highly recommend fringe to anyone who enjoys a touch of the  supernatural/science.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun the whole family enjoys playing. Always someone yelling it is my turn now.<br />Makes time pass quickly.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|My family loves this holiday movie.  We usually watch it 2 or 3 times every fall.  Both kids and adults find it hilarious and entertaining.
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|It's a fun game but sometimes I will build something before they ask for it, and it won't give me the credit for it. How do I fix that problem.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|drawn out a little too long could have been half the time not anxious to see the next one ok?
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|I'm not saying that this is superior to Olivier's, Henry V,  but for a comic derived action film, it is quite good. The Good Monsters are satisfying and the Bad pretty bad. Rasputin, the victim in a classic silent with the Barrymore Brothers, comes alive nicely as does his invincible robot swordsman (or whatever may be his substance). The plot is pretty straightforward with only the love interest deviation from the main track and that fits nicely into the line of action. The comic relief is not overdone and, in general, the human and monster creations do the job they are supposed to do.<br />All in all, a film suitable to pretty much all age groups, with a minimum of gore and  realistic brutality, but lots of banging around in the style of the Saturday morning animated children's shows of  an earlier generation (and, perhaps, of today, too).
B00005N6KG|1.0|I don't know why these are so highly reviewed--these are the worst headphones I've ever owned.<br /><br />The main problem is that the cord is so short, I can't put my phone in my pocket. It'll come unplugged constantly.<br /><br />Second, the headphones are supposed to \\"sit\\" in your ear. If you're perfectly stationary, maybe. Walking, they pop out constantly.<br /><br />Third, the audio quality is not good. Typical of headphones that cost much less.<br /><br />I am literally throwing these away. And when I bought them, they were mid single digits in price. Not a good deal even at that price.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|One of the best series to watch with the family. It not only has stunning pictures but has so much information that will amaze anyone. The kids love to watch it over and over again.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|It is very useful book. It presents a practical way of thinking to evaluate new or existing products or services. It is also very well designed and printed.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Savored the entire experience.  Great writing, excellent character development, rich storyline. And I'm seconds away from reading the next book in the series!
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Being a huge fan of the original, I have always been leery about a remake of this classic adventure film. The 70's version was horrible in my opinion with a sequel King Kong Lives that is probably one of the worst films ever made!<br /><br />After reading Jack Black was starring in the remake, I was again very skeptical about the outcome of this film. I went to the theater with an open mind and hoped for the best.<br /><br />The film being set in the 30's like the original was key for me and I found Naomi Watts to be a fine Ann Darrow. Jack Black also impressed me because while his usual persona is a zany comedic actor, he plays Karl Denim with just the right amount of cheesy Ed Wood glee.<br /><br />The trailers I watched of this film made me think the FX would not impress and looked cartoony, but seeing the film in a theater I was totally amazed (most of the time) especially with the FX used for Kong.<br /><br />The film is long at close to 3 hours, but I was never bored, it takes a third of the film before we reach Skull Island, but it gives us a chance to soak up the characters and the beautiful detail Jackson put into this film. I own the extended version as well and even though it runs longer it actually feels shorter and is worthy of a purchase as it adds more dinosaurs. It also has a huge amount of brand new extras to help temp you even further.<br /><br />OK, now we've reached the island and instead of having comical natives with coconut bras and bones through their noses, we are treated to some seriously disturbing ones who are quite scary and violent with the island intruders. I'm pretty sure everyone on this planet knows the story so I doubt there will be any spoilers in this review.<br /><br />Now we reach the make or break moment when we see Kong for the first time. He is a sight to behold and I actually like the extended version at this point because the chase is much more hectic with more monster mayhem.<br /><br />There is some controversy with what happens between Ann and Kong. In the original, Kong is a monster and even though he is fascinated with Ann, she is terrified of him from when she first lays eyes on him to the finale. In this film and the 70's version (which I loathe!) there is a connection with Ann and Kong, in the 70's version it is quite silly and comes across campy, but in Jackson's version it seems very believable because Kong is an intelligent creature,  an ape, not a monster. The scene where they bond is very touching and I find it believable to a point, the point being if you can suspend disbelief for an ape that is 30 feet tall, then you can believe the bonding of two intelligent creatures.<br /><br />Kong acting more like an ape helps give the story more depth and I found this version to really be the most interesting of all of them. Like I stated in my first sentence, I am a huge fan of the original seeing it 100 times in my lifetime, but this is the reason for a remake, to bring something new to a story without losing sight of the original concept.<br /><br />Some other fine examples of worthy remakes being The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986).  Both films only add to the original, not taking anything away from them.<br /><br />The dinosaur fights, especially the triple threat T Rex battle with Kong are long but impressive, the most unconvincing is the Brontosaurus stampede, over the top, but still very good for the most part.<br /><br />One big controversy is the addition of the infamous spider pit scene that was cut from the original film. It really isn't necessary and it is quite ugly and long, but who am I to argue with more monsters? It is a nice contrast to the sappy story between Ann and Kong so I liked it overall.<br /><br />OK, now we get to the Big Apple and the inevitable, the sad demise of this beautiful creature and while in the original we feel empathy for the little animated puppet Kong brought to life by Willis O'Brien, in Jackson's version it brings you to tears. There is one shot in particular that I found extremely heartfelt as Kong takes his stance atop the Empire State building not knowing exactly what he is up a against, he prepares to battle and protect Anne no matter what his fate. It is truly a wonderful moment, the kind of moment that is why we all go to see movies in the first place. If I had one negative thing to say about this film, it's that I didn't believe Jack Black when he spoke the famous last words......maybe no one could get that right?<br /><br />The Blu Ray includes both theatrical and extended cuts of the film, but I'm not sure it includes all the extras from both editions. I've seen both DVD's editions selling for $5.00 each and are well worth it for the extras alone, but Kong looks incredible on Blu Ray, so that is the way to go as far as the movie is concerned.<br /><br />So overblown or not, Jackson's King Kong is one of the greatest remakes of all time and something he should be proud of!, making possibly the best giant creature film ever made.s one shot in particular that I found extremely heartfelt as Kong takes his stance atop the Empire State building not knowing exactly what he is up a against, he prepares to battle and protect Anne no matter what his fate.

B0089LOG02|4.0|Well, I did enjoy the book (actually, I read it a few weeks ago and just now had to sit and think about what the heck it was about...orphans?  trains?).  It initially caught my eye because I recalled a terrific PBS special on the orphan trains some time ago.  Anyway, I'm assigning 4 stars because I felt the ending was a little bland.  It seems like all the books I read lately are a little lacking in the wrap-it-up department.  The similarities between the 2 major characters were interesting and not too much in-your-face - I especially liked the elderly character and her back story.  The foster parents were just a little too believable (that's a compliment to the author) - if you live in a rural area you'll know what I mean.  All in all, a good read and a good summer read at that.
0307887898|1.0|I tend to think that tech people should not try to write, and Eric Ries proves my point. The writing is dense, and almost exclusively from a tech startup point of view. Not helpful.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|So well written.  The author trusts the reader to fill in the &#34;blanks&#34;.  All of the characters are so well developed during the story they feel like complete people.  This book may be one of the best I've ever read!

B0079R8IYW|4.0|I bought this as gently used/returned merchandise and was impressed with the quality of the Kindle case cover with stand.  I looked all over in order to find the imperfection on it and it must have been so slight that I couldn't see it.  A handsome and expensive leather looking case.  And I got it for less that $4.00.
0385474547|4.0|Great story of cultural and religious clashes from transformations too rapidly instituted by colonial governments at the bequest of religious zealots. Unfortunately this is still happening in many parts of the world today. In Europe the religion is Banking and Finance. In the Middle East its still religion and energy.

You come away with a lot of insight into your own leadership strengths and how to maximize them in your work and personal relationships.  You also learn about others' strengths and how they might work with your own strengths.  Definitely worth it to buy the book and take the online inventory.

0143034901|3.0|Well I can't truly be fair in reviewing this book so I will do my best to explain why. Things have been hectic in my life right now and I have not been able to focus on this book like I should. For the most part I was just using it as background noise to help me pass time. I will defiantly need to re-read this down the road and more than likely it will change my review and the way I feel about this book.<br /><br />First my few little pet peeves, the biggest thing for me was the fact that a good bit of this book seemed a bit slow for me. It seemed to lag a bit around the more romantic parts. Now I knew there was going to be a romantic undertone throughout, but it was a little much for me. I wanted more of the main mystery and less romance. Again, this was probably not the time to read this book because I couldn't seem to commit to the story over all.<br /><br />The plot was very interesting and it caught my attention at the very beginning, I really thought I would be glued to this story all the way through, but then towards the middle it started to loose me a bit. This book was wonderfully written, the language and style was almost poetic, and where a poetic style is not normally my thing I really liked this. The characters were very well done and full of depth. I think had I read this any other time I would have enjoyed it so much more.<br /><br />As I said I will be re-reading this some time in the future, I feel I need to just to be able to catch every bit I might have missed. I also must mention that I listened to this, and throughout there was this music that accompanied different parts. I really liked this and at then end we find out that the author composed these pieces, it made me have even more respect for Mr Zafon's talents because the music was very well done as well as the writing.<br /><br />I will say this, if the plot interests you at all I would encourage you to check it out. It may not be your type of book and that's ok, but you just might really enjoy it and find it worth a read.joy it and find it worth a read.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Well done, and a reality check to those out there so wrapped up in their own world that they forget the world! I would recommend this as something we all should watch and then take our own thoughts from it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'm of two minds regarding Firefly. Every time I revisit it, I feel immersed in a world I don't want to leave. Each time, after viewing the last episode, I feel the same pang of regret that it was cancelled. And I immediately scramble to load the movie sequel, Serenity, which takes the saga in a scant 2 hours where it could have gone if it hadn't been axed.<br /><br />But in an odd way, I'm also happy it all worked out this way. Almost as much as I value the show, I prize the bittersweet melancholy of missing it. The few episodes crafted have become singular jewels, the characters, the universe and the noble values now steeped in the coppery glow of legend.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this show, if you've skipped it because you're not a fan of science fiction, do yourself a favor and watch the first episode. It's ninety minutes in which you fall in love with one character after another, care instantly what fates await them. The stories are inventive and fun, building this new universe layer by layer. The look of the show is fantastic and convincing. The humor is sly, loving and knowing, and carries over into later series like Castle. The action has the panache and wisecracking, accidental quality of the first Star Wars movies. The music is like a set of wings that buoy each story aloft, leaving a twang in your ear after the credits fade. And the performances are as letter perfect as you will find anywhere on screen or stage.<br /><br />Enjoy it, and be prepared to enjoy missing it...over and over.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Always a good perspective that gets your attention, Michael Moore does it again. He needs to keep doing this to remind people of reality, not media propoganda to guide our thinking and keep us real on our perspectives :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|I admire her honesty, perseverance, and determination. She opened up about the less than admirable choices she made in her younger years, which showed her to be thoroughly human and flawed...and then she described her quest to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. The description of the blisters on her feet and her times of isolation were so hauntingly painful...I felt the pain...a great memoir from a great writer.
0545265355|5.0|LOVED these books - and we aren't teens! In our 40's we could not put these down. Two of us read them all in about 3 weeks. They get loaned out alot, and I'm glad I had all three to start out and I dont think I could've waited to order the next book! Get all 3 at once if you haven't read these yet. You will want to know what happens next.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|If you love old-time gangster movies then you'll love this movie. Costumes, sets, and props are what I enjoyed as much as the story line. How I wished owning one of those old cars today. The acting, directing and screen play were also great. You'll love watching good cops rid LA of bad guys. Car chases, shootouts, and explosions were right-on. Sean Penn was outstanding in his role as the big bad ass gangster guy. What an actor and super star. You'll want to add this movie to your gangster movie collection for sure.
B009K86D86|5.0|Great movie exposing the ills of the food industry. Highly recommended viewing if you care anything about what you put into your body.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The connection allows you to easily transfer all or some of your photos to an iPad.  The files can then be deleted or kept on the card.  I have not used the camera connection.
B00001QEE8|1.0|We aren't too happy that we wasted $20 on a DVD that only played the first few scenes.  It would have been nice if we got a quality product.  Once it froze, we weren't able to forward it to any other scene.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I was anxious to add this to 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, I thought it was a free standing explanation of how Bilbo came by the ring. Imagine my surprise when it ended, not concluded without resolution. Then I read the back of the case; it's actually the first book of another trilogy. Nowhere in advance publicity did I see or hear of this fact. That is the only reason it received four stars not five because now I have to wait additional years for the additional two books although the story, with Peter Jackson directing is excellent, I hate waiting. When complete I'm sure the trilogy will be Five Stars if someone reminds me.
B00821OX98|5.0|I watched this series and wanted to catch-up on some that I had missed.  I like the plot and how the writers handled all the too human aspects of it.  I have never been disappointed watching the series.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It is so fun to see it move and spin in 3d.  The only draw back I can find on it, is that you cannot see your time and or score at completion.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Awesome DVD! This is the Blu-ray  to get for a fan of the series. Great show to watch when you want to see gladiators and romans in a battle.
B006S08RLU|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME! I've seen this movie three times and each time, it gets better and better. I start to understand more of what the film means to me. And each time, the movie ha a different meaning!

0525478817|2.0|TFIOS is a hard book to review. It's very well liked and on every Best Of list there is. I can see and understand why but I'll stand over here in the Unpopular Opinion Isle feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. I'll admit the first time I read it when it came out, I fell for the hype. It wasn't until the second reading did it hit me what this book actually tried to accomplish. I should have left it alone after the first time, and now I'm left cold and kind of mad.<br /><br />There is a good reason why the words \\"pretentious\\", \\"contrived\\" and \\"trite\\" float around on the negative side of reviews for this book - none of these people, excuse me, CHARACTERS felt natural and real.<br /><br />John Green is a fabulous writer. His prose is beautiful, clear and imaginative. Some of the quotes and thoughts in this book hit close home and I giggled and smiled because it brought on some interesting memories and personal quirks of mine. His characters are usually the oddballs, the nerds and \\"losers\\" rising above the stereotype into the shining stars. But Hazel and Augustus did not do it for me one bit. They are sort of empty shells without personality and the only way to make them interesting was to rush them into romance, provide something sad (cancer) and have them quote ton of deep stuff which was so repetitive I skipped many pages. It's the excessive beauty of his prose that completely takes away any realness from the story and the characters themselves. Nothing about them felt natural. Their interactions were nothing but series of pretentious poems, references to indie bands, some quote about something COSMIC and DEEP, books and authors I've never even heard about. John Green is a smart, well articulated ADULT without a doubt. But he tried to translate his intellectualism onto these cancer struck teenagers so hard, they both came off so unreal and corny, I felt no connection to them. Teenagers are NOT 40 year old men, John. The illness is only there to cause an emotional reaction because otherwise you'd be stuck with two HOT, nerd hipsters with NO romantic chemistry and forced into a love story that fell flat. Gus's \\"I'm in love with you\\" speech on the plane made me roll my eyes. 17 year olds DO NOT TALK LIKE THAT. I hate being manipulated and that's what this book did.action because otherwise you'd be stuck with two HOT, nerd hipsters with NO romantic chemistry and forced into a love story that fell flat.

1594746168|5.0|Had the book only contained the intriguing, very detailed anatomical sketches of mythical creatures with human characteristics (or vice versa), The Resurrectionist still would have been a curious but fascinating tome.  Hudspeth's imaginative rendering of fantasy in a pseudo-medical setting is ingenious.  But the sketches are preceded by a biography of the enigmatic Dr. Spencer Black, which provides a very sinister dimension, one that is only fully realized once the reader arrives at the last set of sketches.<br /><br />There's a quietness to the narrative style which makes the strange events of his life all the more startling, beginning with a childhood spent robbing graves of their corpses to provide anatomy specimens for his father, a medical doctor.  From there, Dr. Black's life seems to settle into normality, only to veer into the macabre, and then the horrific.<br /><br />Warning: bad things happen to animals.<br /><br />With the exception of one very graphic scene, however, Hudspeth mostly clouds Dr. Black in suggestive mystery.  Is he mad?  Is he a genius?  A charlatan?  What happened to his wife?  What happened to him?  The biographical section ends with all of these murky questions swirling around.  But with the illustrations of these strange human/mythical hybrids, some of them are answered.  I turned the last page, thinking, \\"Oh!\\"

B00BEN0YP8|5.0|This is a very touching movie. The quality of the player was great. Although this movie is very sad, it is also very educational of the history during this time period.
B004PGO25O|2.0|A thematic exhortation of nominal utility - overcoming inner \\"resistance\\" in facing the quotidian challenges of life. Pressfield  writes at the fifth-grade level with generous use of artifices like one-sentence paragraphs, gratuitous exclamations, cartoonish insights into human behaviour, and a tedious, patronizing reliance on using ALL CAPS to illuminate \\"big ideas\\" of his for the more crepuscular intellects among his readership.  In short, a typical excretion of the burgeoning leadership industry picking the wallets and corporate accounts of an insecure public. I (big idea alert) RECOMMEND that one instead faces down that \\"resistance monster\\" with a couple frosty pints at your favorite pub.

Stick to the vinyl version, unless you do all your listening via your car audio, or MP3 player.
0802473156|5.0|This book was not only a breeze to read, but it made all the sense in the world.  I tried just a few things in it in one day just to see how the outcome would be, and it was incredible.  The responses from my husband were so positive and I couldn't be happier.  This book gives me hope that even if only one person is willing to work on a marriage, that significant changes can be made with furvent dedication and a bit of faith.<br /><br />There were points in this book where I was hesitant to believe in the results and there were times in this book when I had to set it down because reality struck me so hard I was sobbing.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I was recommended this book and it has been the best purchased I've ever made on Amazon.  I will now recommend it to everyone that need understanding or wants the best from their marriage.  Thank you Mr. Chapman!

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Definitely 5 stars!  I got it for free when Amazon had it as the &#34;freebie&#34;... I &#60;3 u Amazon!!  I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus.<br /><br />Game: you are a small blob and your objective is to absorb other blobs to grow.  I know that sounds basic but each level has different caveats.  Example: in one level you're moving around an axis like a planet moves around the sun, in the next level you can't absorb certain objects, in the next the blobs are intelligent and are trying to grow faster than  you... etc etc..<br /><br />Pros: cool concept, great graphics, controls work well, lots of levels with minor changes to keep your interest peaked<br />Cons: None... it was free :-)<br /><br />Conclusion: I would definitely get it again.  I would even pay .99 cents to get it if I had to!  It is a fun game and with each level comes a new set of objectives and challenges.  Buy it, u won't be disappointed!

B0031RDUX8|5.0|i loved it. I have a strange fascination in myths and legends. if you are like me, this book is for you. Though, i did feel that Michael Scott could have put in a little more detail in terms of character description.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Read this book basically to see what all the hype was about. Call me crazy but I just don't get it. She can definitely write a nice steamy sex scene. Props for that. But I felt the storyline and the characters were not very relatable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Discovered Downton Abbey at the end of Season 3,  caught up on missed episodes on Masterpiece Theater,  then bought Season 1 and 2.  Can't wait for Season 4 to begin! It is well done in all respects, casting, acting, story line.  Maggie Smith  is awesome.  Her double takes are hilarious.  The rest of the cast is superb.

B007MU85D0|5.0|Unique sound, fun music I think that Of Monsters And Men has music that will appeal to all age groups of listeners.
0385349947|3.0|I liked the book as a success story of a determined,talented woman who actually \\"has it all\\", despite her protestations to the contrary.  I got a bit tired of the stories about boys still, in 2013, being favored by teachers while girls are still urged to wear pink.<br /><br />Christa Hoff Summers, 12 years ago, painted a completely opposite picture in her \\"The War Against Boys\\", and it's time the feminists stop whining as women excel in law, business, and increasingly in science and medicine,as well as politics.  Sandberg's definition of \\"equity appears to be the old \\"affirmative action\\" approach that 50% of executive jobs \\"belong\\" to women, despite her own statements that many, many women choose to be the traditional moms, a role she admits is perfectly legitimate.  Sandberg's solution seems to be that we must have an revolution in male roles with a lot more stay at home dad's and many more doing the housework.<br /><br />Still, I found it a good read, full of great stories by a successful executive that happens to be female.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|This movie is watchable, but not anywhere near as good as I expected from all the hype. Lawrence certainly didn't deserve an Oscar, unless all the other nominees were even worse. She, Cooper, even De Niro--all just okay. No great acting, certainly no believable chemistry AT ALL.<br /><br />Absurd story, unbelievable dialog, sloppy directing--and the climax at the dance contest was just ridiculously bad. The more I write the worse the movie seems, so I'll stop while I can still give it two stars. I guess the Weinstein brothers still know how to sell movies, which is the best I can say about this clunker.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|This is a hard review to write as I have been dying to read the third book in the Delirium series and have had it for a couple of months and you know how life just chucks obstacles in your way and you find yourself a bit waylaid and then when you finally get around to it , you are like omg , feverishly reading it as you just have to know what happens and then you get to end and you are like ... speechless and you don't know what to say but all you can do is scream. That's what I felt with the book Requiem, just so you know I loved the first two books and rated them both 5 stars and OMG the cliffhanger that book #2 left us with - with Alex's return AARGH. I found personally that Requiem for myself fell short of my expectations as the whole Alex, Lena and Julian love triangle fell flat as come on - I have waited and built up over a year for the first chapter as here I am with this view of OMG Alex's back and then it was like oh, ok. I did love how they brought Hana into the book and how she got to view the both sides of the cure - the cured and those they nickname the Invalids and definitely loved the reunion of Lena and her mother Annabel aka Bee.<br /><br />The other awesome thing with Requiem was the added bonus of a short story from Alex , talking about his love for Lena and the first time he met her and fell in love with her as remember Alex meet Lena when she arrived at the Lab.<br /><br />I am curious though, that the way Lauren Oliver finished Requiem, it does make you wonder if there is any more books to follow.<br /><br />I have to warn you guys, do not read this book unless you have read the previous two books :)<br /><br />#This was an Library Book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I think it was a great book I could not put it down<br />It definitely got you wanting to try new thing's  lol.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Yes, the special effects are nothing compared to today's special fx, and yes, the acting can be a bit cheesy, but considering the time period in which it aired originally, the social and political commentary in the series was not only cutting edge but also insightful and extremely forward looking.  The relationships between the characters are 'fascinating', and it's great to see how much of the technology used in Star Trek is now in every day use, invented by engineers inspired by this series:  people are now working on the tricoder to win the Qualcomm X-Prize money--I can't wait for someone to start working on the transporter!
0811879542|5.0|This story does is all without batteries.  Highly entertaining, interactive, and keeps the children's attention.  A great book for preschool teachers to use when their is nothing to do and a time filler.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Every month the game changes its location. The game was in New York and Rome. GREAT for the whole family.This game is better than Temple Run hands down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and the changing locations keep it fresh.  Get the double coins purchase as it is definitely worth it.  I'm never going to get that alien, though.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The author makes you feel like you are hiking the PCT with her.  You feel her pain and struggles and brokenness and then you see her come out the other side. It's a great read!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|pretty fun until you hit higher levels and then the game play slows down. I play this mostly to killntime between phone calls at work.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend it to everyone, especially Nicholas Sparks fans.  It's even better than the movie.  Easy reading and hard to put down.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|very enjoyable, heart-warming movie;Zac Efron gives an excellent performance;a nice love story;I recommend this movie;good purchase;I hate having to write 20 words
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Huge story that needs to be told about addiction, risks, falling from grace and redemption. Well done! Great performance by Denzel!
B00571F26Y|3.0|Have not finished it yet; but there are too many technical, chemical terms listed.  I just want to know what I should eat and what I should not ea.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed reading Daddy's gone a Hunting. It is another good creation by Mary Higgins Clark. I would recommend this book...
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I downloaded the sample at the suggestion of a friend. I was hooked. The first few pages and chapters are very enjoyable. The world is mysterious, yet familiar. It's set in a very interesting post-apocalyptic world, where life exists within an underground silo. Social structure is defined by floors, with the affluent living in the highest floors and the working class far down below. Most important of all, many of the characters are engaging, well written, and relatable.<br /><br />I devoured the first book and was disappointed with the end. I trudged on and finished the second book and was met with a very familiar and specific sense of disappointment. I finished the book out of a sense of duty, but all of the initial excitement I had for the story had been sent out to clean.<br /><br />This book loses itself after the first two chapters.<br /><br />:::MILD SPOILER ALERT:::<br />Between an abrupt shift in character focus and a departure from the book's original promise, I just couldn't get into the latter half of the book. Just as I was getting used to the main character, he left the story. Then, as I adjusted to that and started to enjoy the next round of main characters, they left the story. I understand the point of this with regard to the overall plot, but it was too jarring for me to forgive. The next main character was a flat, thin copy of the original, and the story suffered for it.<br />:::END SPOILERS:::<br /><br />This book has a great premise, and starts out very strong, but it fails to move forward with the same momentum established in the beginning. By the end of the book, I had lost all passion for the story and mainly just wanted to see how it ended. I had all the time in the world to finish it, because I was sitting on the beach on my honeymoon.<br /><br />In the end, though, this was a disappointing read. ESPECIALLY after I saw so many 5 star reviews on here. Amazon reviews rarely let me down, so I think this might be a first.<br /><br />I also read two Star Wars books on my honeymoon, and both of them were infinitely better than the second half of Wool.<br /><br />**UPDATE 6/24/13**<br /><br />After reading about an upcoming movie called Snowpiercer, which is based on a 1987 French graphic novel called Le Transperceneige, I'm inclined to just not like this book at all. The only thing I found interesting was the concept, and come to find out it seems as if the entire thing is stolen from the concept/plot of Le Transperceneige. The only thing the author did was replace train with silo and create the somewhat interesting concept of \\"cleaning\\". Though, for all I know, he could have stolen that from Le Transperceneige as well, because I've not read it.<br /><br />Terribly disappointing overall.two Star Wars books on my honeymoon, and both of them were infinitely better than the second half of Wool.<br /><br />**UPDATE 6/24/13**<br /><br />After reading about an upcoming movie called Snowpiercer, which is based on a 1987 French graphic novel called Le Transperceneige, I'm inclined to just not like this book at all.

B00AERRKHA|3.0|A fun read for those who know the characters well. Not her best book but it's nicely paced and nice to enter Barrayar through a different viewpoint.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Each time I watch this version of Persuasion I catch things I never did before.  Each time I watch this I am so impressed by the degree of fidelity and the reward for patience.<br />Anne, a tired and responsible person who loves her shallow family and tries to do the right thing by them and others, has made so many sacrifices.  But her one regret is having allowed older ones to persuade her not to accept Captain Wentworth's suit at a younger age.  Then a second chance comes along, and we see the blossoming \\"spinster\\" come alive.  By this time, she is a woman who knows her own mind and has more self assurance than before she was persuaded at a younger age.  This actress is true to the character of \\"Anne\\".
B007RCJNDE|4.0|I started reading these books close to 20 years ago, so I knew I was going to read the last one. It was well done, I think choosing Brandon Sanderson to finish Robert Jordan's work was a brilliant choice, and I enjoyed it, but there was just a bit lacking at the end. The fight with the Dark One reminded me of the fight at the end of the Matrix between Neo and Smith. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just say I wished the ending could have been a bit more sophisticated/original and less derivative.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|The price was RIGHT ($0) that saved med $39.50 for the book that was required for my Lit course.  Good deal for those of us who like &#34;horror&#34; love stories or who need to write a paper on it.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|Hands down, this release looks &#34;more like Blu-ray&#34; than the original Blu-ray release, but the coloring of this remaster doesn't seem quite right.  One can argue over how it looked in theaters or what the director intended, but ultimately it doesn't look like the same Terminator I've watched over the past 25 years.  It's a big improvement in some ways and a failure in others.  Can't do anything about it except buy them both and don't look back.
B00BU8RNCE|1.0|We bought the Impossible electronically from Amazon.  We have purchased many electronic versions of TV shows and movies.  However, this one had very bad picture quality.  It was difficult at times to discern the actors.  The sets were very hard to see.  Since this is the only time we have had this problem, I presume it is with the electronic version of the movie itself.  Be forewarned!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore is a master of his craft. He writes meaningful lyrics with catchy riffs that are sure to get your head bobbing. Strong album, even if you only know &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; you'll enjoy the rest of the tracks.
B0052QXAEK|5.0|Do you think your better then everyone else? Kyle sure did. Because he doe, he is turned into a beast. You ask how? Well, that's for you to find out! Since he's a beast, will he fall in love? Love is never ugly!!<br />I think everyone should read Beastly! You learn a big lesson from this book. Never think you better then anyone!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|What can I say. Danial Craig is turning out to be a great Bond. The gadgets I like are missing and some of the sexuality is missing as well that was with the previous bonds. Oh yea lets bring the shaken not stirred back. The action is great so is the acting. Another great bond film.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Bradley Cooper's character, a hostile but lovelorn high school teacher, wrangles an early release from institutionalized captivity on the condition that he reside with his middle aged parents (including his volatile father played by Robert De Niro), take his meds, and otherwise behave himself.  This is quite a challenge for the poor guy, still traumatized by visions of his ex-wife cavorting in the shower of their once happy home with another man--who made the discovery even worse by telling Cooper's shocked and cuckolded character \\"you should leave.\\"  Clearly, such an interloper richly deserved a pounding--and that is indeed what he received at the hands of our protagonist--who landed in the slammer as a result--a terrible injustice if there ever was one!<br /><br />So now we find our poor hero, alone except for his eccentric parents (his father a rabid Philadelphia Eagles fan banned from his beloved stadium because of a fight he once precipitated) and his good-natured shrink who hails from south Asia.  But never fear!  The up-to-now unlucky fellow soon stumbles upon Jennifer Laurence's hot and emotionally-damaged widow next door--whose caustic and often lewd observations complete her persona as something that dreams are made of!  Sadly, however, Cooper's still traumatized and seethingly hostile fellow only has eyes (in his imagination anyway) for the ex-wife who has placed a restraining order on him!  Still, the two immediately click, and in a way that is reminiscent of two socially-challenged high school kids--with him as the guy who's too stuck on the head cheerleader to notice the hot girl next door making eyes at him!<br /><br />Fear not, however!  She soon cons him into becoming her partner in a dance contest.  What's more, his old prison buddy, played wonderfully by a charming Chris Tucker, gamely teaches them how to \\"black it up\\" for their dance routine.  Jesus!  How Cooper's character is able to keep his hand off his now sensually gyrating dance partner (other than in a quasi-platonic dance-move way) defies the imagination!  But hey, the guy IS crazy after all!  You begin to wonder if he will EVER snap out of it!  And that's the hook of this show.  Will true love win out?  See this movie and find out!  I highly recommend it!!her than in a quasi-platonic dance-move way) defies the imagination!  But hey, the guy IS crazy after all!  You begin to wonder if he will EVER snap out of it!

B0011Z51QG|5.0|What can I say he is one of the greatest musicians I have in my collection.  I have seen him in concert 4 times and always checking to see where he'll turn up next.  Keep it coming and i'll keep looking for you!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Really detailed. I like it a lot and I'm not usually the one to give recommendations. I suggest this book to all sci-fi space readers.
B002VX0A40|5.0|My baby girl likes it a lot. She can get bored with other toys, but with Dee Dee she can play all the time.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great time passer. Gets competitive when you compete with facebook friends. Its fun. Get it you'll love it too. Okay
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|We have purchased all the 3D/2D combos from Disney up to now. (We don't even have 3D equipment yet, but we've been collecting in anticipation that Santa will be extra kind this year.)<br /><br />We saw and loved the movie in the theater, but will NOT purchase this movie in any format until 3D and 2D blu rays are packaged together as per past Disney practice. Ditto any future 3D releases packaged and marketed the same way.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent game.  Good challenging puzzles.  Mostly doable without clues but it was helpful to have clues in a few places.  Wonderful graphics.
