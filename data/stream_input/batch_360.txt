B000001FQQ|5.0|I HAVE BEEN A KISS FAN FOR MANY MANY YEARS. I AM NOT A DIE HARD FREAK BUT, I KNOW MY MUSIC. KISS HAS CHANGED STYLES MANY TIMES AND LEAD PLAYERS AS WELL. LETS FACE IT ACE WAS GOOD ONLY ONLY ONLY ON THE FIRST ALIVE ALBUM. BUT WAS GREAT ON THE ELDER. HE DID NOT PLAY IN THE SAME STUDIO BUT THAN AGAIN HE CANT PLAY ANYTHING ELSE BUT THREE CHORDS. WOW LISTEN TOO THOSE HOT CHORDS THAT I CAN PLAY MYSELF. WHAT A SHAME THAT THE ELDER DIDNT SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY IN CONCERT. DARKLIGHT WAS A GREAT SONG AS WELL AS ONLY YOU. LETS GET ANOTHER KISS ALBUM PUT OUT AND NOT A GREATEST HITS OR LIVE ALBUM WITH SAME BORING TUNES. NEVER SEEN A TOUR WITH SONGS LIKE DIRTY LIVIN OR ROCKET RIDE OR LARGER THAN LIFE OR SAVE YOUR LOVE  ETC............ LATER MAYBE!!
B000002L9O|5.0|This is by far the most hardcore Ramones album. This album has an angrier edge to it than all the others. I think this is the album before he went insane. Everyone knows an artist is at their peak when hes completely lost his mind. Its a pure adrenaline rush and bangs it out harder than any other Ramones album. Who is this guy who says Somebody put something in my drink doesnt work? Thats bizzare. The song is a classic. Love Kills is my favorite Ramones song.
B000058983|5.0|Okay, so the Beatles developed a perfect mix of experimentalism and melody for Sgt. Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour, Nick Drake had incredible string arrangements backing his intimate performances on Five Leaves Left (even better than this album- you may not agree but give \\"River Man\\" a listen) and Tim Buckley's vocals, however understated, always achieved devestating power on Goodbye and Hello and Happy Sad (Love from Room 109 at the Islander is one of the best songs ever recorded- You didn't like it?  Much too long and slow? No, listen again and let its atmosphere envelope you - there's a reason I said best song ever recorded and not written). <br />For moments of stunning beauty, however, moments where you just can't help going \\"Ooh, i really, really like the way that sounds\\", look to Forever Changes.  The unbelievable bridge in \\"The Red Telephone\\", where Lee sings \\"I don't know if the third's the fourth or if the/the fifth's to fix\\" over a swelling string arrangement. Or the second part of \\"You set the Scene\\", where Lee's voice absolutely soars over the breathtaking orchestra(\\"This is the time of life that I am living/ and I'll face each day with a smile\\"- Lee's delivery is so powerful, the verse compels and resonates like some exquisitely melodic call-to-arms).  The shimmering acoustic guitar at the core of \\"Live and Live and Let Live\\".  The orchestral fluctuation as Lee sings \\"Hummingbirds hum, why do they hum-\\" in \\"the Good Humour Man-\\". The eerie moment in \\"The Daily Planet\\" when Lee sings \\"I feel shivers in my spine/ when the iceman, yes his ice is melting-\\"<br />Bryan Maclean contributes two songs that are perfect to the second- \\"Alone again Or\\" and \\"Old Man\\".  Both are achingly beautful.<br />Forever Changes is the 60's psychedelic equivalent to a Broadway Musical.  It can be corny at times, but overall, the emotional payoff is enormous.  A quote on the back of the outside covering of the album sums it up best: \\"1967.  Nothing caught the strangeness of those days, or captured the combination of beauty and dread they contained, quite like Love's masterpiece Forever Changes.\\"
B0000TB03W|4.0|If you caught Shania's recent special on NBC, then you are in a better treat as you purchase this DVD. The DVD is better than the special because it is longer and she puts even more into the songs. Check out the DVD because I know you will not be disappointed!
B00003CXDD|5.0|The story revolves around a &quot;little&quot; farmer named Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis). Willow finds an abandoned baby. According to an ancient prophecy, the baby will grow to put a stop to the evil reign of Queen Bavmorda ( Jean Marsh). Since Willow was the one to find the child, he is selected by his village to go on a journey to deliver the baby to safety. Now with only a single swordsman named Madmartigan ( Val Kilmer)at his side, Willow must overcome the the Queen's evil forces of darkness, and keep the baby safe at all costs... <br />With the acception of the Lord of the Ring films, &quot; Willow&quot; has to be the best fantasy film I have ever seen. The story itself is outstanding. Watching a man of Willow's size have to overcome numerous obstacles, is really inspiring. The film also offers non stop action, and tons of laughs. The special effects are out of this world. Especially with all of the sorcery, the two headed dragon, and all of the other creatures. It is all amazing to see. The acting is great all around. Warwick Davis ( known for his role as the Leprechaun), really shines here. He shows fierce courage, determination, and unending love for the baby. Madmartigan might be one of Kilmer's best roles ever. He is courageous, great with the sword, and extremely funny. Joanne Whalley does a nice job a Sorsha. The chemistry between her and Kilmer is outstanding. The two eventually became married in real life. Kevin Pollack and Rick Overton are hillarious as the &quot;Brownie Soldiers&quot; and provide for most of the film's laughs. But the best performance hands down came from Jean Marsh as Queen Bavmorda. The first time I saw this film as a little kid, she really gave me the creeps. She is still just as dipisable today, as she was then! Outstanding performance!! Ron Howard did a great job with directing the rest of the little people in the film too. They came together and really made Willow's village seem believeable. <br />&quot;Willow&quot; is definately at the top of the Fantasy genre. The story involves one small man overcoming the odds, the special effects are incredible, the action is non stop, the film is extremely funny, and all of the performances are great. Watching this film, is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The DVD makes the film even better. You get two featurettes, a behind the scenes gallery, and a lot more. Definately a must own!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Come On!   Reloaded was even better than the first! Anyway, even if it isn't good (but it is), this was only a 'filler' movie, trying to bridge the gap between #1 and #3. Any two-year old could see that. Plus, you get to see Trinity naked!
B0000T6JH4|2.0|Not enough difference from the original--except the original is better.  &quot;Let It Be&quot; bootlegs are way better.  I always love John's comments on the original, as well as, &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;--what's Paul's problem anyway!?
B0000TB03W|4.0|This concert just had so much energy and anyone that passes up this DVD does not know what they are missing!! And yes, there are extra songs that Shania performed at Chicago that were not shown on the TV special so you are in for a real treat! I'm telling you, anyone would love this for a present and if there is no one to buy it for, then buy it for yourself because this is one awesome energy filled concert! Shania definitely rocked this country the night of that concert!!
B0000TB03W|3.0|First of all, I do like Shania Twains music - it's catchy &amp; fun, but not too deep &amp; meaningful.<BR>In this concert, Shania again proves that she can indeed sing (in case there were still any doubters), &amp; both she &amp; her band do a great job.<br />Why then do I only give it 3 stars?<BR>The whole thing is just a little too slick &amp; soulless.  It's massively overproduced, &amp; I'm left with the feeling that the whole thing was gone over with a magnifying glass to make sure that it fit the image that Twain &amp; her team wanted to project.<BR>Nothing seems spontaneous, &amp; even Shania's pulling kids out of the audience seems carefully staged.  I was left with the feeing that I was watching an overly long music video, not a live performance.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I know there is some debate about this album.  After reading the reviews I expected it to be speed metal from start to finish.  Instead, I found another DT masterpiece.  O.K., maybe it is a little heavier metal than some of their other CD's, but still very much Dream Theater.  I was hooked from the very first track that starts out with a very deep dark distorted bass guitar effects riff, and then a total Black Sabath sounding guitar riff tranitioning into a Metallica groove.  There are still some quieter moments on this CD.  The lyrics are certainly the darkest and angriest of anything DT has ever done.  I think you have a mature band that musically is as tight as ever.  The instrumental stuff will knock your socks off.  It is hard to pick out the best song, but track 2, The Dying Soul, rocks harder than any other DT song has gone before.  I have not even made it through the entire CD yet, but I'm thinking this will probably end up being either my favorite DT album or a close 2nd to Images and Words.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00003CY6M|5.0|If you love romantic comedies and stories about fate than you will absolutely love &quot;Serendipity.&quot; John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale make you fall in love with the story! Not only is the story lighthearted and warm, but it is also suspenseful!  &quot;Serendipity will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole way through!  I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you hate romantic comedies! You are sure you be in a happy mood after watching.
B0000TB03W|4.0|This is a great concert. I recommend this DVD to every music lover. Some of the songs performed are:&quot;You're Still The One&quot;, &quot;From This Moment On&quot;,&quot;Any Man Of Mine&quot;, &quot;Forever and For Aways&quot;,&quot;Up&quot;,&quot;Gonna Get You Good&quot; and my two favorites from her UP! album: &quot;She's Not Just a Pretty Face&quot; and &quot;Nah&quot;!!!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I really dont know what all of you one star reviewers talk about. Her voice is so beautiful and her style is so amazing. I like this cd a lot. She is truly one of the best singers in the world ( together with mariah, she is still my all time fave) I like the way she sings on this album as well as on the &quot;just Whitney&quot; Cd. She has more control now and dont just scream just beacuse she can. The problem with singers with a huge vocalrange is that it can get a bit &quot;screamy&quot; and anoying after a while. but on this album whitney sings. Not screaming. Its a big different.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Oh my gawd! This DVD  Live uP! in Chicago is so amazingly done. Shania gives her all in the performance. The phyros, the music, the fan interaction every thing about the DVD makes you feel like your actually there. Even if my 1 year old little girl dances and babbles away. How cute is that! This is a must gave DVD! If you know someone who isn't a fan of shania then this is the DVD you need to buy for them cause after this they'll will be hard core shania twain fans! All her songs are awesome! Your talking excellent quality here! A must have
B00005AXEL|4.0|I think that the album was really good Stevie has a nice voice.I think that the other albums that she did was a little bit better then this one.I just hope that Stevie will continue with her singing she has a beautiful voice.I have listen to the cd and I do like it but it could have been better.The song say you will i could realate to but her other songs I can also realate to.Stevie when she sings her songs they have meaning and she want's to people to listen to her music and like it for good not bad.Stevie sings from the heart and thats what Ilike so thats my review.    Thanks.
B000068FXX|5.0|If Supertramp had only recorded this album's title track and the epic &quot;Fool's Overture&quot; they still could have made musical history, because almost 30 years after the recording of 'Even in the Quietest Moments' the sound retains its original nature of a classic. To attempt to describe 'Fool's Overture' in words is doomed to failuer, because words fall short when you try to describe a piece of art: such is the beauty of this -in my opinion, the band's best- work, one that at times reminds me (don't ask me why) of Yes' &quot;Turn Of The Century&quot; (ironically recorded in 1977 as well) but with a more epic feel to it. If you're in the mood for great live versions of this song and &quot;From Now On&quot;, I advice you to check out the band's live album recorded in Paris, one of the best live albums you might ever hear.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Director Peter Jackson's movie version of The Two Towers pays full respect to the most sorrowful part of J.R.R. Tolkien's mighty Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />This is a sadder, more frightening film than The Fellowship of the Ring, but it is also more exciting, more visually dynamic and more sweeping in its vision. This, film fans, is an epic with a capital E. <br />FILM REVIEW  <BR>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers<BR>(PG-13; epic battle sequences, scary images) Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Peter Jackson. 179 minutes.<BR>The story picks up almost exactly where Fellowship ended, with the original adventurers separated, and Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) facing the next perilous journey alone. All we see from the first film is the wizard Gandalf's apparently fatal plunge into the center of the Earth as he battles the horrendous Balrog monster - a special-effects scene as masterful as modern technology and artistic imagination will allow.<br />A short while later, an even more astonishing techno-wonder awaits in the character of Gollum, a creature generated entirely by computers based on the body and voice of actor Andy Serkis. Gollum has been kept largely under wraps in advance of the movie, the better to astonish audiences with his shocking authenticity. This is by far the most expressive, least mechanical, computer-generated figure ever seen on screen, and the movie's most engrossing character to boot.<br />Once a Hobbit-like being named Smeagol, Gollum was corrupted by the One Ring that Frodo now carries. Gollum dogs Frodo, hoping to steal the ring back. Frodo's appeal to the part of him that is still Smeagol reveals a divided person who carries the battle between good and evil in his own head. <br />Frodo's goal is the ring's destruction in the pit where it was forged, thereby stopping the resurrection of the disembodied Sauron, who has set his wicked wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) to the task of wiping outbeauty, peace and freedom among humans, hobbits and their friends.<br />The movie crosscuts from place to place as Frodo and Sam struggle toward Mordor, tracking friends Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) in a magical forest overseen by ancient, tree-like beings called Ents, as well as the race by dwarf Gimli (voice of John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) to save their friends.<br />The action peaks when the Fellowship warriors find a reborn Gandalf (Ian McKellen in another sharp, detailed performance) and rally the humans of Rohan to fight Saruman's massive forces. (Be advised that the movie earns its PG-13 rating with thrilling but often horrific combat.)<br />Mr. Jackson, who wrote the screenplay with Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair, interprets Tolkien's stormy vision with tremendous insight and empathy. Frodo's weakening spirit, Gollum's pathos, Sam's loyalty, the fury and dread of the final assault on Helm's Deep - it's all there on the screen, as powerfully as it was on the pages of the great novel. Mr. Jackson has taken a few liberties with the book, but none that destroy its sense or sensibility.<br />Plot complexities are explained in part with flashbacks, flash-forwards and narrative recaps. It is possible the tale could confuse some who are not familiar with the books, but even non-readers of Tolkien stand to be swept up in the film's urgent pace and emotional intensity - not to mention its breathtaking visual riches. <br />The Two Towers is every bit the momentous event fans have been hoping for. All it lacks is three more hours of the story. That comes Dec. 17, 2003. Mark the date.
068485743X|4.0|Noah Lukeman writes as though he's 100 years old, so finding out he's actually quite young gave me a shock. The tone in this book reminds me of a finger-wagging, stern English teacher.<br />On the other hand, if you read each chapter carefully and do exactly as he says, your writing will definitely get better. No question.<br />The small flaws that clutter the first few pages can ruin a book over its length. Usually they point to someone who isn't good enough at their craft, hence the name of the book.<br />Removing them will do your writing a lot of good, however finicky they may seem at first.<br />Experienced writers will gain little from reading this, though. Instead, I'd recommend Noah Lukeman's second book, The Plot Thickens.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|You dudes have some serious thrill issues if you don't go out and get this movie.  I have watched this movie so many times with my kids, they don't get tired of it and neither do I.  Marlin fights all obstacles to get his son Nemo back after he is captured by a SCUBA diver.  Dorie and Bruce are two of the funnier character he meets on his journey to find his son.  Do he find Nemo or does he get thrown in a frying pan full of Crisco?  You'll have to go by the movie to find out.
B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid does it again with a release that's even better than their previous effort. Track one is incredible as is the rest of the album. Rancid is great and every track is a masterpiece of punk, and if you have any taste what so ever, you will quit reading this stupid review and buy the freakin CD!!!!
B00005JMFO|4.0|To the rare person who didn't like this movie (see one below), I say, \\"Check your pulse! Maybe you're dead!\\" since I'm firmly convinced that only the deceased will not be moved by \\"Love, Actually.\\" I was smiling so much during it that my face started to hurt. Yours will too.<br />P.S. I'm not only going to see it at least one more time. I'm going to buy it when it's available.<BR>P.P.S. I'm a guy.
B00006BTCA|5.0|That's so freakin' funny - Thank you!!!!<br />I think Interpol has already redefined Rock and Roll for the 21st Century. Thought it's clear there's a Division in these reviews, I'm confident that the Joy they have created will never cause their recordings to Fall from the charts. They are a Cure for the Echo of bad pop dancing in our ears from the radio's of the brain-dead masses. Their Psychedelic element, though a throw-back in time, makes me with wish I was in my Kitchen making special brownies. <br />Those stale fools that comprise that `other' band so many people keep referring to don't hold a candle to Interpol. They're so lame they haven't even put out an album of new recordings in how many years? Talk about lack of creativity! <br />Interpol - the New Rolling Stones! (Beatles shmeatles)
B00008WG3U|5.0|This is easily the best NOFX CD ever! They are political and sarcastic, and they won't ever sell out! They really have no potty humor on this one, it's all sarcastic and serious. The first song is an anthem against the modern &quot;punk&quot; of the mainstream and how punk has become safe. These guys have and always will be punk, and this is, in my oppinion, their best CD yet, and if you have any taste whatsoever you will buy this now! Yeah that means now! You stop reading now, NOFX awaits.
156898443X|5.0|Danny Gregory's book is a journal of impressions, discoveries and reflections on coming to grips with the tragic turns life can take. He guides us through his thoughts and feelings in a unique and evocative blend of writing and drawing that is engaging, wry, insightful and unexpected. He confronts the big questions of life as well as it's trivialities with a fresh and open honesty. We aren't treated to pat answers but to a wonderful process of rediscovering the world in a new way. Of not merely looking but seeing. Gregory's delightful drawings and seemingly random notes come together as a memorable and moving reflection on life's accidental gifts.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I think the title of this review says it all. I lost count of the historical inaccuracies after the first ten minutes! Of course, the Germans were the brutal bunglers who cheated on zeir frauleins und vipped zeir dachsunds! No really, steer well clear of this disaster. If you wish to view a TRUE account of the Battle of the Atlantic as the sailors saw it, watch &quot;Das Boot: The Director's Cut&quot;...or better still, the unabridged version of the same movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i wasnt THAT big of a fan of miss spears before. but after this album, im obsessed! every song on this cd is amazing! from \\"breathe on me\\" to \\"toxic\\" this cd has got it all. these songs i can't help but hit the repeat button and listen to time and time again! so sensual, sexy, great beats and GROWN UP! britney has come a long way and i love it.  GO BUY IT NOW!!
B00004RFCM|5.0|Guys, if you are looking for the perfect holiday gift for your lady, this should be at the top of your list. My wife loves this series, it is cleverly written and even tolerable for the average man. Personally, I like the series (as it beats watching Days of Our Lives) and find the writing insightful as a man trying to understand women. Definitely a must! The characters are well acted, fun to look at and the storylines are very realistic. I think of it as a woman's version of Seinfield, but this one actually has a story line.
0767802470|5.0|Forget the popular portrayals of the German soldier in World War II, forget the Hollywood hype and such diatribes as U-571, this is THE submarine movie! Shown from the point of view of a German U-Boat, U-96, Petersen masterfully depicts a typical patrol for a German U-Boat in the years when the Battle of the Atlantic was starting to slip away from the Kriegsmarine's grasp. You cannot help but identify with each of the character's. The Captain, known with affection as the &quot;Old Man&quot; forever keeps a cool head under the most intense pressures. His death in the final scene is a true tragedy. The journalist, tasked with producing a report for U-Boat Headquarters is unfamiliar with the environment, and subject to many a joke by his collegues on board! As each minutes passes, you'll become more engrossed in the toils that face the crew.<br />You'll silently wish for them to gain a success after days upon days of waiting for orders, you'll laugh as they poke fun at the Reich's political leaders...&quot;Where are you Herr Goering!&quot; <br />But what is more, you'll be actively willing them on as they embark on a near suicide mission through the Gibraltar straits, with the Captain all the while on the bridge being drenched with seawater! You'll also curse the Allied bombers as they strafe the dockyards after the crew successfully enter port at La Rochelle - having spent almost an entire day lodged at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, with the crew living off nothing but spare oxygen tanks and stale bread. <br />Wolfgang Petersen is a master at his profession, and I urge anyone with an interest in military history, or action in general, to watch this superb piece. Pity only five stars are available!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been a dt fan for the last 12 years and I haven't heard playing as good as this ever! Yes, the songwriting is a far cry from Images and Words - but we don't live in 1991 anymore!! I think if Images and Words were to be released today it would be labeled as too cheesy, and dismissed as a bunch of show-offs releasing 80's like hair band music. We live in 2004 and long gone are quality heavy songs with any sort of hook. Dream theater have simply molded themselves into a band that plays music which fits into this new era. <br />     On TOT I hear the tightest, most well-orchestrated jams dream theater have played since Metropolis 1. As a drummer myself I'm not a huge Mike Portnoy fan, as I think his talent is limited. He really doesn't come up with any &quot;outside the box&quot; drum parts and it's very apparent that he's been touring with Fate's Warning when you listen to TOT. That being said I think Portnoy has hit the pinnacle of his career with his drumming on TOT. Out of everyone in dream theater my least favorite is James, who's presence on this cd is totally unremarkable. His voice is clearly going south and at least they have limited how much of him we hear on this album. I think Petrucci, Myung, and Rudess are fantastic, and all 3 play their asses off on TOT! <br />     Bottom line - I love TOT as parts of every dream theater release show up on the cd in one way or another. The production is raw and powerful. The jams are intense, well-written, and the co-keyboard/guitar soloing can't be touched by any other musicians I've ever heard. John Myung is just a flat out stud on the bass. Portnoy's playing is about as good as his talent allows, and his parts fit very nicely into the context of the music.<br />All in all - I give TOT an A!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I own all the other Britney Spears cd's, but in comparison to this one, they all suck.  Britney Spears has grown up so much and has left the teeny bubblegum pop for a more mature sound.  She was grown vocally, musically, and has become a better performer with her dance moves and dancers.  The album is very trance and vibe like, almost like you are in club atmosphere.  Her voice is not as raw and clean as some of the other singers such as Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson, it's very sythesized and computerize.  Here is what I think of the songs...<br />1. Me Against the Music - this song is her first single with Madonna.  It's a good song but there are far better ones on the album.<br />2. (I got that) Boom Boom - this song has to be one of my favorites.  The beat is tight and it's got a hip-hop feel to it.<br />3. Showdown - I think that the lyrics are good and her voice fits well on the song.<br />4. Breath on Me - this song is very sensual.  I don't think that many people could pull off this song, but Brit shines at it.<br />5. Early Mornin' - this song is really funny and it's something that you wouldn't expecxt from Britney, but it's good.<br />6. Toxic - THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!  This song is the greatest.  I love the beat and this should have been the first single.  It is a great dance song and her voice is amazing, though computerized.<br />7. Outrageous - written by R.Kelly.  This song has a hot beat with a mid east feel to it.  The lyrics are a little extreme but the song is fun to sing along to.<br />8. Touch of my Hand ...  This song showcases her voice, and the message is well...<br />9. The Hook Up - this song is something that you would hear Sean Paul do with some popstar.  It's got the reggae beat and the dance lyrics.<br />10. Shadow - one of my least favorite songs on the album, but it's still good.  <br />11. Brave New Girl - this song reminds me of a make-up commerical.  Britney takes up rapping, which she does surprisingly well but then she goes into more pop.<br />12. Everytime - this song is the secong best on the album.  It is haunting and her voice is wonderful.  It's obvioiusly about the notorious britney-justin breakup and the song is her sorry.<br />13.  Me Against the Music remix - it's a good remix, not much more to say.<br />All in all, the album is awesome.  I don't skip any songs at all.  You need to get this.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is truly a classic.  I jumped at the chance to get it on DVD.  The special features and behind the scenes are worth watching.  I never get tired of watching this, even though I know all of the lines and the plot.  Great special effects, even for today's standards.
B00005LOUS|4.0|The grinch movie is one hilarious flick! I have to admit that not many movies have so much sarcastic humour as this one.<br />The little girl in this one did a really good job in being the Little Who we adore and love. She is cute by the way.<br />Jim Carrey does an excellent job doing what he does best and that is to make us all laugh.  As I would say about this movie &quot;It reeks of sarcasm!&quot; across the board.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I have been an avid weightlifter for 20 years and a big Arnold fan, but I have never seen Pumping Iron.  I always knew about it, but just never saw it for whatever reason. When it became available on DVD I signed up to get a copy right away.  I was not disappointed.  It is an interesting look into Arnolds psyche.  He is truly a focused individual and it was interesting to see him get into Lou Ferigno's head. It was an amazing feat for anyone to win that many Mr Universe's, steroids or no steroids.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I absolutely love this Cd from beginning to end. My only complaint is that it is too short.  I hope Erykah is working on another soon.  I need a fix!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I'm still awe-struck and mesmerized by the Chicago outdoor concert. The camera pan shots that showed the entire crowd, everyone GOOFING on the LOVE and JOY Shania was generating. Everyone was transfixed and adulating with PURE JOY ! To me this is MIRACULOUS! To have such a huge and diverse group of people, all exhibiting the same effect, JOY ,is positively awe-some. A person that can generate this effect on such a multitude of people,is surly a gift! This DVD captures it ALL! Thank You Shania!
B00005JKC3|1.0|It's very sad how Ang Lee made a mess of the 'Hulk' movie. This could have been a great movie: action-packed and funny like Spiderman with great special effects - but no, they had to give it to the director of 'Crouching Tiger - Hidden Dragon'. I figure it is because the hulk jumps around a lot just like the actors in the 'crouching tiger' movie? They should try to fix it by making a movie called 'The REAL Hulk' and give it to a director who knows how to make action movies. The actors are a joke, the dialogue is boring and predictable. The split-screen technology is crap.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I purchased the soundtrack yesterday, and I must say that it lived up to - even surpassed - all of my hopes for the music.  The music for Return of the King is easily better than that of The Two Towers and Fellowship of the Ring.<br />Here are a few highlights:<BR>(5) &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; is amazing.  The instrumental opening is hauntingly beautiful, and captures the coldness of Denethor's halls in Minas Tirith.  Billy Boyd's vocals here are also wonderful, as Pippin sings of his uncertainties and fears about the road ahead.<br />(8) &quot;Twilight and Shadow&quot; is easily my favorite song on the soundtrack.  With Renée Fleming's gorgeous soprano voice as the highlight, this song brings Rivendell back into our minds.  Undoubtedly portraying Arwen's sadness at being separated from Aragorn, the orchestration and vocals combine to produce a beautifully melancholy song.<br />(16) &quot;The End of All Things&quot; is a choral masterpiece.  This time, however, it is peril rather than sadness that drives this song.  Once again graced by Renée Fleming's vocals, the track paints a dark portrait of the brink of Middle-earth's doom.<br />(17) &quot;The Return of the King&quot; takes you on a journey through Middle-earth, from FOTR's opening in the Shire to the closing of TTT in Rohan and Gondor.  Aragorn's incantation-like vocals are probably the highlight of the track.<br />(18-19) &quot;The Grey Havens&quot; and &quot;Into the West&quot; are perfectly joined together, bringing The Lord of the Rings to its tear-inducing conclusion.  The music provides the backdrop to what will undoubtedly be the most poignant scene of the trilogy.  Annie Lennox, a somewhat unorthodox choice for this soundtrack, proves her incredible versatility with &quot;Into the West.&quot;<br />The soundtrack is amazing.  I cannot wait until December 9, when the Limited Edition comes out and we will get a look behind the scenes of this musical masterpiece.

B00008PW3Q|2.0|Why they decided to stuff this album with so many below average songs is baffling.  Many of these were originally intended to be a Lindsey solo album pre-The Dance and it certainly sounds like it.   It's also quite obvious that some of these songs from Stevie were intended for a solo album but used for filler on Say You Will instead.  <br />One listen to the track &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; will let you know that this definately is not a Fleetwood Mac album.   With it's techno-style production and cheesy synths it would be more fit for a Cher album than a Fleetwood Mac album.  <br />Hey, I'm all for change.  It's good, it keeps things fresh.  But this album is too far removed from anything even remotely related to what the band sound like that I have a very hard time getting into it.  It either tries too hard to sound experimental or modern (Lindsey's &quot;Red Rover&quot; Stevie's &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;) or is just too bland or deviod of memorable melodies(&quot;Running Through The Garden&quot; &quot;Steal Your Heart Away&quot; &quot;Bleed To Love Her&quot; &quot;Whats The World...&quot; hell most of the album).<br />Another reason I loved Fleetwood Mac were the stellar vocal harmonies.  Without Christine, there really aren't much of any.<br />I will give them some credit though, they did an excellent job choosing what to take off the album for singles.  &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; would have been a standout Lindsey track on any classic Fleetwood Mac album, and &quot;Say You Will&quot; is one of their catchiest songs ever and is a great song of hope.   One album cut &quot;Miranda&quot; is one of the Mac's stompiest tunes and is the standout on the album.  You'll want to play this one loud.<br />The only other highlight I can think of is the killer guitar solo at the end of &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave.&quot;  Unfortunately, you have to listen to most of the song before you get to it. <br />Overall though it's just a major bummer.  Even if they had cut 9 or 10 songs out of it it still would be an average album at best.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Well- if you're a Beatles fan, you know you simply *have* to have any new release which features new material. Yes, this disc fits into that category. Featuring remixed audio from the January 1969 sessions, you'll find things here that you never heard before. The inclusion of Lennon's great composition &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; in a reasonably &quot;unheard before&quot; format makes this a must-have. Sonically sparkling versions of all the other Let It Be tracks will thrill and amaze- each one will reveal something you did not hear before, be it an alternate lead guitar track, a different vocal, or just a superior sonic landscape. <BR>   There are flaws however- the biggest one being the totally blasphemous omission of two original LP cuts: Dig It and Maggie May. The Lennon-driven &quot;Dig It&quot; was a very long studio jam session which on the original LP was cut to a few seconds. Maggie May, while nothing more than a short little old English ditty, fit right in with the Beatles' sense of originality, the obligatory curve ball thrown right at your head when you least expected it. It's glaring absence screams for vengeance.<BR>   Of course, there are those who will say that any new output from the Beatles after 50 percent of the group are no longer with us is okay. I find it a bit insulting that all they could offer on this disc, which was timed to arrive *just in time* for the holiday shopping season, was a mere 35 minutes of music! One more point of blasphemy: all between song chatter which was burned into a generations' memory has been thoughtlessly removed from this set...Personally, I would have liked to hear even more...<BR>   Had they included Dig It, Maggie May, and perhaps a few other tunes which were performed during the sessions, or perhaps a few more of the songs played on the rooftop of Apple Records, and left the chatter intact- it would have been a revelatory 5-star release. The cuts and omissions, including Spector's ravaging of Lennon's &quot;Dig A Pony&quot;(removing 4 bars of vocals) knocked 2 stars off...In all fairness, I'll give one back for the sonic polish of the audio...4 stars, begrudgingly...
B0000AOV85|4.0|This DVD is great, especially if you missed the airing on VH1.  Come on guys, $15 for a documentary of Pink Floyd's Dark Side on DVD?  How can you criticize the content for that price?<br />And to mvetzel from Rossville, who thinks he saw a performance of Dark Side at the Winterland during some 69-70 &quot;Dark Side&quot; tour (lol)... they didn't even tour the U.S. in 1969!  They did their 3rd and 4th U.S. tours in '70, and their 5th tour (Meddle) in 1971.  They played the Winterland on October 15th, which is the only place you could've seen them &quot;testing the waters&quot; with some Dark Side stuff.  Before that, they hadn't played the Winterland since 1967.  Their first full performance of Dark Side occurred on January 20th, 1972 at the Dome in Brighton, England.<br />Sorry to burst your bubble dude.
B000001GXB|5.0|These discs have been praised a lot, and rightfully. Maurizio Pollini's journey through the late Beethoven sonatas is a classic, a standard recording since it has appeared on LP in the seventies. Even those who find Pollini's readings too rigid and cold (I certainly don't) will have to admit that the clarity and force of his approach are just phenomenal. Still, there's more to this music, and you have not heard these sonatas in their entirety before you've heard Arrau, Schnabel, Solomon, Brendel and others alongside Pollini. There is more than one way to ascend the Mount Everest of Music, after all.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Salma Hayek goes very quickly from Tarantino eye candy to serious actress/filmmaker with FRIDA.  At first I thought she was too beautiful to play Frida but, with the exception of her nude scene when you see what a gorgeous woman she is, she completely inhabits the pain and despair of her character.<br />And this film really deepened my appreciation for Alfred Molina.  What a great actor.  He totally brings Diego Rivera to life.<br />(I remember Molina getting killed by bamboo spikes in the opening of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK--yeah, that was him!  He was also in CHOCOLAT with Johnny Depp, PRICK UP YOUR EYES with Gary Oldman.  I just saw him in LUTHER with Joseph Fiennes and Peter Ustinov.  The guy's great and he's been in more than you think.  Plus, you'll see him as Doctor Octopus in the next SPIDERMAN).<br />One of the main reasons I saw this film was that it had been directed by Julie Taymor.  If you liked FRIDA, see what she does with Shakespeare's TITUS with Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.  She has a very unique, vibrant style.<br />When I first started watching FRIDA, I thought of another film about a woman suffering at the hands of a great artist: SURVIVING PICASSO.  I found that film interesting but ultimately dry.  Picasso came off as such a thoroughly egotistical, selfish man, I found it hard to care about him.<br />But, by the end of FRIDA, I felt quite a bit for both Frida and Diego.  Their story was much more touching.  It made me feel that the ending was a bit abrupt and, even though it was hardly a short movie, I wanted more.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As a composer for a trilogy of movies, Howard Shore could've taken the easy way out.  With ROTK, he could've created a follow-up score that sounds very much like the score for TTT.  And subsequently, have TTT sound much like FOTR.  What Howard Shore has instead created could easily be considered his magnum opus - 3 splendidly layered and unique film scores that will be copied and admired for years to come.  Like Peter Jackson, Mr. Shore has succeeded in bringing us the world of Middle Earth and introducing us to its wide and varied cultures and creatures.<br />The soundtrack for ROTK is nothing short of magnificent.  This is when our favorite characters finally face the ultimate test - to sacrifice life and limb to save Middle Earth from the clutches of the dark lord Sauron.  The soundtrack reflects the prevalent moods and emotions of the book - it builds up a foreboding sense of doom (which climaxes with such powerful tracks as \\"Shelob's Lair,\\" \\"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\\" and \\"The End of All Things\\") and ends with a sense of calm, hope and melancholy (highlighted by the fabulous \\"The Return of the King,\\" \\"The Grey Havens\\" and \\"Into the West\\").  The film itself (judging from the soundtrack) promises to be the most powerful - not only in terms of action sequences and visual grandeur but also in its emotional impact - of the 3 films.  Many tracks in this soundtrack drove me to tears and I imagine that I, in turn, will be sobbing in the movie theater when I finally see ROTK on opening night. <br />With this trilogy, Howard Shore has created some fantastic and memorable themes.  When you listen to a track, you become transported to a certain place - whether it is in the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Rohan or Isengard.  In this sountrack, there are sprinkles of the familiar themes from the first 2 films: the lightness of the Hobbiton theme (\\"Concerning Hobbits\\" from the Fellowship score), the grandeur of the Gondor theme (which brings to mind the fabulous Boromir/Faramir/Denethor flashback scene from the Two Towers extended cut dvd), the ethereal Rivendell theme, and the majestic Rohan theme (as in \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\" from Two Towers).  However, Mr. Shore also introduces us to new themes depicting the menace and power of Mordor, Aragorn's new destiny, Shelob, the melancholy of the Grey Havens and Denethor's failing rule.  This is then topped off by what I consider the best theme song of the trilogy (with apologies to Enya) - Annie Lennox's stunning \\"Into the West.\\"<br />The highlights for me include:  2. Hope and Memory, 8. Twilight and Shadow, 10. Anduril, 13. The Fields of Pelennor, 15. The Black Gate Opens, 16. The End of All Things, 17. The Return of the King and 19. Into the West.  My favorite has to be \\"The Return of the King\\" which so splendidly weaves together all of the themes that we have come to love - the Gondor theme, the Hobbit theme, the Fellowship theme, Aragorn's theme and the Breaking of the Fellowship theme.  At over 10 mins, it is also the longest-running track.  Shore shows pure genius by adding fantastic new contributors to this score - James Galway's flute, Renee Fleming's haunting soprano, Billy Boyd's melancholy hymn, Viggo Mortensen's  elvish air and Annie Lennox's evocative voice and song-writing skills. Ben del Maestro's stunning tenor - a highlight in the Two Towers soundtrack - returns as well.<br />I am happy to report that the soundtrack for \\"The Return of the King\\" is just as good as - if not better than - that of the first two films.  It is a rich, layered, powerful score and I cannot wait to finally take it all in when The Return of the King opens in cinemas.  This is a must have for any The Lord of the Rings fan and is a fantastic addition to any music lovers collection.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|First of all, let me say that I have been a big fan of Britney.  I have all of her CDs and have seen her in concert twice.  I hate to say it, but this album is terrible.  This is the first time Britney is writing songs, and please God, stop. The lyrics are beyond pathetic.  Every song references shaking your ass or shaking your body.  I can't take it.  Surely, after 22 years on earth, Britney should have something more to say than \\"outrageous, when I move my body/ outrageous, when I'm at a party/ outrageous, in my sexy jeans\\" !!!!!!!!! Nearly every song is equally stupid, simple, and the lyrics are written on a third grade level.  I will admit, I was not exactly expecting Shakespeare but \\"get on the floor and shake that ass\\" is too ridiculous, even for dance/pop music.  Please, someone, take charge of this woman's career.  Madonna, please help!  Do not let her write anymore lines like \\"I really don't want to be a tease/Can you undo my zipper please?\\"  Britney, call Diane Warren and do not ever write song lyrics again or at least get an education first.  Pop music does not have to be this dumb.
B0000BWVCM|1.0|First of all let me say that it's a great movie and the movie disc is OK. It has DTS sound, something I always look for. That aside this has one of the worst special features discs I've ever seen.<br />  No Closed Captions! While I don't have a hearing problem, I sometimes use the captions if I'm watching late at night and have trouble catching some of the comments in the interviews. Especially if the actor has a Brit or other accent. I was under the impression that everything was captioned these days. If I was hearing impaired, I'd be seriously angry with FOX.<br /> No Time Code! Just more proof of how this disc was slapped together. Want to know how long a feature is to see if you want to watch it now or save it for another time? Forget it on this one. The movie disc has time code the special features one doesn't.<br /> Other obnoxious things... The disc has problems switching back and forth between the menus and sometimes sits black for 5 seconds before going back to the menu. It also has an obnoxious and unnecessary music score during most of the features. Do we need to have music while watching a rehearsal of a fight scene? I'd rather hear what the actors and crew were saying.<br />  Lastly the special features themselves are poor. The Nightcrawler one is good but the others stink and one seems to have been made for the 1st movie not this one.<br />  All I can say is it's a good thing this DVD was cheap. They'll probably be pushing an `Extra Special' addition next year. Buy it for a great movie but expect to be disappointed if you like extra stuff. Perhaps the people at FOX should watch the Lord of The Rings discs to learn how to make decent and interesting features.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Have this band sedated...please. This music is horribly sang and unimaginative.  If you want a great rap-metal band listen to Rage Against the Machine...This music is filled with whiny vocals, STUNNINGLY trite and myopic lyrics, and unnecessary rapping that annoys the listener by mangling itself around the so called riffs.  The guitar is boring and there is nothing here remotely inspiring.
0385504209|5.0|For those of you who love to bash the truth to serve your own delusion, wake up and smell reality - this is not a crock of crap - this is a great book and guess what? The history in this book can be independently verified by numerous sources, but obviously those sources are not the one's taught in your school - they are the sources of real research and discovery that no school would have the guts to teach because how could teachers explain that we have been shrouded from the truth for centuries and they have been willing participants in the lie because they are lazy. We have been lied to about religious &quot;fact&quot; to serve only the good of the &quot;church&quot;, to ensure that their power will not go away. To uncover the truth, writers and researchers like Dan Brown have to fly in the face of what we have been taught for centuries and begin to awaken our poor &quot;led by the nose&quot; population and take chances like this to print the truth. So for those of you, who are so ignorant and are professional &quot;followers&quot;, have fun in the god forsaken paper bag that you live in - because you'll never break out until you open your eyes.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle has defintatly evolved from mer de normas which featured the hits Judith (which i enjoyed), The hollow, 3 Libreas and that was a good listen...honestly not many songs stand out on this cd...but the one's that do make this album the great piece of art it is....Weak and Powerless is A Perfect Single for this album and is a big hit here in U.S as making 1# spot on the rock chart's maynard has a great voice in this song with somewhat disturbing lyrics.....The 2nd single The Outsider i love this song it contains Outstanding vocal's and lyrics this song is heavy and really kicks great in the system should do great as a 2nd single has dark feel to it....The Noose the only very slow song i can bare beautiful gutair's with a nice <BR>rythem.... Pet in my opinion should be the 3rd single great dark strange lyrics this song really kicks ass its somewhat i think the heaviest on the album reminds me of some Tool music....well that about sum's up all of the pieces until next time
B0000CFW87|5.0|I'm 29 and this is my first Josh Groban CD. I missed the first one. He has such a beautiful voice. I first saw him on the Winter Olympics when he sang with Charlotte Church. I'll eventually have to get his first CD, but this one is doing just GREAT!!! <br />I would encourage others to open their minds and take a listen to an incredibly gifted young singer.
B0000BWVCL|5.0|The X-Men movies and The Lord of the Rings are the two greatest movies of all time.  There's no need for me to even expalin the story of either of the two.  You know X2: X-Men United is great if you've seen the first and the same goes for any Lord of the Rings movie.  Yes, X2 is even better than the first.<BR>5 out of 5 stars, 2 thumbs up.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|My favorite CD purchase of the year!  This is a &quot;No regrets CD&quot;.<BR>After hearing &quot;Chariot&quot;, my interest was peeked enough to purchase the CD, and what a pleasant surprise it is.  The lyrics are strong, the music clean and his voice is captivating! Great songs from beginning to end.  If you recognize talent, the talent is here. Best new artist material.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Don't listen to those who have given reviews saying &quot;Slipknot sucks, they aren't metal, yadda yadda, listen to real metal, yadda yadda.&quot; Slipknot is still a developing band and they are not your conventional metal. They are different, so don't say that something sucks because you don't know what you just heard. To me a good band is a band that can produce something you have never heard before, something unconventional and that is what Slipknot is. If you ever hear their actual first album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. you really see what they came from and it has changed significantly. This hard and angry music. Enjoy it...
0689829590|5.0|Every night my daughter wants us to go outside and look for the moon. When I saw this book I knew I had to get it and she LOVES it. We change the name from \\"monica\\" to our daughters name, and when you get to the moon pop-out page she always laughs and screams and jumps. I also recommend \\"The night moon fell down\\" - another wonderful favorite.
0553274503|5.0|Absolutely an amazing book. Wow. <BR>I am not moved to cry very often, especially not by books like this.  <BR>But this was so clear about the humanity of menatlly retarded people, so moving.  It is a piece of expository prose, not a simple story. <BR>It shows kindness, love, and how these exist in such a pure form in a person who can't read this review.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Awesome !!!!  I just now finished watching everything from this Special Edition Two Towers and it is just wonderful !!!! The extra 43 min. of added Scenes to the film really made an allready great movie much better !! Not only was it better but it helps set you up better for The Return of the King !! <br />     We get a flashback of Denethor with his two sons Boromir and Faramir all 3 together and it's very nice ( Denethor plays a big role in Return of the King ). Also the Dead Haradrim and what Sam felt those words are given to Faramir in the movie. Also when the Orcs are taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman it explains more of the Rival with Ugluk and the Orcs of Isengard and Grishnakh and the Orcs of Mordor. Plus More stuff with Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and Fangorn Forest. I don't want to give to much away with this extra 43 min. so it just really explains a lot of things better and makes it more enjoyable. More stuff with Frodo,Gollum,and Sam including an extra Scene where Faramir tell's them the name of the pass into Mordor that Gollum is leading them to is Cirith Ungol where a Dark Terror Dwells ( good set up for Return of the King ) !!!!!!!!<br />     The Bonus stuff is awesome. 1,800 photos, the documentaries are awesome that explain all this work that went into the Two Towers. It talked some more about J.R.R. Tolkien himself and how he loved Trees and Nature. The 5th Disc was neat how it explained how they made the Gollom Statue and others like it. There is also a book on the Statue of Gollum and the Gollum Statue of him holding a fish is Awesome.<br />    P.S. By the way my name is in the Fan Club Credits :) Bye<BR>    P.P.S. No new Scenes with the Nazgul but for those who have not seen any version of the Two Towers you will get to see a little bit of them and there Winged Beasts , !!!!  Bye Bye
B000002KAT|4.0|...feel compelled to add my voice to the chorus because this IS such a special record. Van never hit it like this again, but so few have ever hit anywhere near this to begin with. From the general era, think Nick Drake's &quot;Pink Moon&quot; LP or the more intimate, quiet moments of the Velevet Underground's 3rd album.<br />My one caveat would be that you should be in the MOOD to take this one in. Ashamed to say it, but when I first heard this jewel I was having a rowdy, inebriated, punkrock evening and I thought it was hippie drivel.<br />Hearing it alone, late one saturday night and on into sunday morning, it was revelatory. Cathartic.<br />I am hesitant to give about anything 5 stars. This one's a close call, but perfect things are hard come by in this world.
0385504209|3.0|Reading the book I get the impression that Dan Brown spent many hours researching the Grail legends and its connection to the Priory, and, the Catholic Church. Much of this we can find in books such as Holy Blood; Holy Grail, etc. But - at least in my opinion - Brown does inject some less bandied elements into the subject in general: worship of the feminine principle, the concept the Sekinah, as the yang to YHWH's yin, and such. Brown then pours all these elements into a pretty good action-packed yarn about an American professor specialising in the Grail legends (Brown?) on the run from the French police and albino assassins for a murder of a museum curator. Interestingly the person he's on the run with is none other than the victim's grand-daughter. If you don't like the drama here then at least you might find the non-fiction elements refreshing. Brown's writing style is pretty good too: very short chapters with punchy scenes.
0316666343|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is as bold a book as I've ever read in my adult life and then some. Its chilling subject matter, audacious use of first person narrative, and provocative spirituality are just a few of the things you can look forward to in Alice Sebold's ballsy debut novel, with a little humor thrown in for good measure. I must warn you though, for all the bragging rights this book has earned, if you're looking for a clear resolution, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is not the book for you.<BR> Sebold's story teller, Susie Salmon (\\"pronounced Salmon, like the fish\\" as we are so often reminded) wields a compelling and poignant narrative that keeps the reader fascinated from start to finish. Our heroine is brutally raped and murdered at the young age of 14 and has already taken her place in \\"her heaven\\" when the story begins. However, she is hardly absent from the world as we soon learn she watches and even accompanies her family and friends on their journey through the grieving process and as they begin to move on with their lives. <BR> Unfortunately, Susie's family do not take her death nearly as well as she does, and as a result, begin to fall apart quickly thereafter. Susie's father nearly has a mental breakdown, her mother has an adulterous fling with the investigator of Susie's death, and Susie's two remaining siblings (a younger sister, Lindsey, and brother, Buckley) struggle to live their lives in the shadow of their sister's death. Susie also leaves behind a fledgling romance with Ray Singh, her pseudo boyfriend, and an odd friendship with Ruth, who actually sees more of Susie after her death than she does when she's alive.<BR> Susie's murderer Mr Harvey, we learn, is actually the perpetrator of several similar crimes and has been on the run for years. He is in fact a serial killer, but has yet to be convicted of any of his wrongdoings, including Susie's death. The reader knows that Harvey is the killer and Susie's father suspects as much, but unfortunately no justice is served; not in the legal sense at least. <BR> In my opinion, this lack of resolution is one of two near-misses of perfection for \\"The Lovely Bones.\\". As previously mentioned, Susie's killer is never caught and her family never learns what really happened to her. In accordance with that, the other near-miss takes place in an odd    moment when Susie switches places with Ruth and spends a few fleeting hours among the living. Instead of taking that opportunity to show Ray, her childhood flame, where her body is buried or spend her last time on earth with her family, she chooses to lose her virginity to Ray.<BR> I found both these instances to be fairly disappointing. While I'm aware that Sebold is in no way obligated to provide a resolution, you really come to expect it and desire it, for that matter. You want the resolution for yourself all most as much as you do for Susie's friends, family, and for Susie herself. In that respect, you could easily become disenchanted with the novel. In fact, my first thought upon finishing the book was \\"Is that it?\\" Honestly, I expected more, but after taking into consideration the wonderful journey Sebold and her Susie took me on, I realized I was just thankful for the experience.<BR> What \\"The Lovely Bones\\" lacks in resolution, it more than makes up for in poignant storytelling. Sebold uses crisp, yet detailed dialogue that captures your attention from start to finish. She has molded Susie into a brilliant storyteller and as she leads us down an intriguing and illuminating path, we become quickly entranced in Susie's world. Almost so much so, that you feel the need to separate yourself from the novel so that you can clearly distinguish fantasy and reality in your own mind. <BR> Susie's ability to follow one character and then the next gives the reader a sense that there are actually many stories being told all at once. Sebold has the ability to intertwine them all in a way that you aren't confused by the different stories, but that actually serves to enhance the narrative. Also, as the story is told through the eyes of Susie, a 14 year old girl, the world is presented with a kind of innocence that remains even as her family and friends mature. It's refreshing in some ways and chilling in others to think that the horrors being describe in explicit detail by a young girl barely past adolescence.  <BR>  Perhaps one of the most endearing concepts in the novel is Susie's own journey into Heaven. We learn that immediately after her death she enters into her own Heaven, which is a world filled with all the things she enjoyed most on Earth, or dreamed of experiencing in the future. The more time she spends in her Heaven, the more it evolves just as she does, mentally and emotionally as she can not do physically. Susie soon realized that she can not enter into the \\"real Heaven\\" until she first lets go of her attachments on Earth. It is this journey that is the central focus of the novel and it ultimately holds the story together. <BR> Alice Sebold's riveting debut novel, \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" is overall an expertly written, beautifully woven piece of literature. It is poignant and captivating from beginning to end and provides a heartwarming story set against the backdrop of a disgusting horror. Though it does not offer the kind of resolution some may be looking for, it does bring a different kind of storytelling to the table that has rarely been seen in the past. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an intriguingly daring piece of fiction that will make you angry, sad, and happy all at the same time, while also making you appreciate the good things in your own life that most of us take for granted. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" gets an A in my book.
0385504209|1.0|So the divine Jesus and infallible Word emerged out of a fourth-century power-play? Get real.<br />Perhaps you've heard of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. This fictional thriller has captured the coveted number one sales ranking at Amazon.com, camped out for 32 weeks on the New York Times Best-Seller List, and inspired a one-hour ABC News special. Along the way, it has sparked debates about the legitimacy of Western and Christian history.<br />While the ABC News feature focused on Brown's fascination with an alleged marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene, The Da Vinci Code contains many more (equally dubious) claims about Christianity's historic origins and theological development. The central claim Brown's novel makes about Christianity is that \\"almost everything our fathers taught us about Christ is false.\\" Why? Because of a single meeting of bishops in 325, at the city of Nicea in modern-day Turkey. There, argues Brown, church leaders who wanted to consolidate their power base (he calls this, anachronistically, \\"the Vatican\\" or \\"the Roman Catholic church\\") created a divine Christ and an infallible Scripture-both of them novelties that had never before existed among Christians.<br />Watershed at Nicea<br />Brown is right about one thing (and not much more). In the course of Christian history, few events loom larger than the Council of Nicea in 325. When the newly converted Roman Emperor Constantine called bishops from around the world to present-day Turkey, the church had reached a theological crossroads.<br />Led by an Alexandrian theologian named Arius, one school of thought argued that Jesus had undoubtedly been a remarkable leader, but he was not God in flesh. Arius proved an expert logician and master of extracting biblical proof texts that seemingly illustrated differences between Jesus and God, such as John 14:28: \\"the Father is greater than I.\\" In essence, Arius argued that Jesus of Nazareth could not possibly share God the Father's unique divinity.<br />In The Da Vinci Code, Brown apparently adopts Arius as his representative for all pre-Nicene Christianity. Referring to the Council of Nicea, Brown claims that \\"until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as a mortal prophet ... a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless.\\"<br />In reality, early Christians overwhelmingly worshipped Jesus Christ as their risen Savior and Lord. Before the church adopted comprehensive doctrinal creeds, early Christian leaders developed a set of instructional summaries of belief, termed the \\"Rule\\" or \\"Canon\\" of Faith, which affirmed this truth. To take one example, the canon of prominent second-century bishop Irenaeus took its cue from 1 Corinthians 8:6: \\"Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ.\\"The Da Vinci Code, Brown apparently adopts Arius as his representative for all pre-Nicene Christianity.

B000068PQ0|5.0|Maybe it's just me, but I think the 'Pink Robots' bears up better than 'The Soft Parade', or maybe it's just that I have not given the latter album a fair shake.  Regardless, 'Pink Robots' is an exciting album, full of new directions, new sounds, new landscapes for the band.  I think there are a few things that determine if an album is great - first, the difference in styles between songs on an album (the immediate change in tone from 'Fight Club' to 'One More Robot'), or even within a song (ex: In the Morning of the Magicians).  Second, does the album bear up under repeated listenings? (being a road trip warrior, it does).  Does the album define a mood (actually, this one defines several).  And finally, while most albums nowdays only have 2-4 good songs on it, does the recording stand as a unified whole?  (it succedes on both parts - the first 1/2 of the album as a collected piece, and the power of 'Do You Realize' by itself).  Overall, I feel the Lips have succeded on all accounts.
B000075BFK|5.0|yeah i wanted to say that this is the best cd he's put out since his &quot;death&quot;. until the end of time was garbage (c'mon, lil mo puttin her voice over?), and the rose from the concrete had other people recitin poems. but this time, they got some of the best previously unreleased music, and even though they changed some of the beats, it was still hard.<BR>y'all especially need to listen to Jazze Pha's Fair Exchange, U Can Call, Military Minds, There U Go (better than ludacris' &quot;Ho&quot;), and Who Do U Believe In. overall, this is a 4.9/5, cuz i still think the unreleased version of When We Ride on Our Enemies is better. alrighty then i'm out.
B00006F7S4|5.0|When I first finished this album, I thought 'Is this really Beck?'  Not that the album didn't have its moments, it was just so....different.  After 1 year, the album holds up and shows that Beck is one of the single greatest musicians in America today.  The sheer diversity of his work is amazing.  He is so talented it seems that if he as if Beck decided to write a book on macroeconomic theory or the sociology of ancient Peruvian nomads, he would create masterworks.  The album has moments of sheer sonic bliss - I'll never forget driving into Taos, NM in near a North Dakota haze of snow/fog with ice rime on all the scrub pine and 'Round the Bend' on the player.  It's amazing how on an album in which lyrically you are so alone you feel so comforted.  I feel Beck's songwriting and musical skills are at their peak on this album.  Give it a chance.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Ok, yes, we have all grown up with the fact that Let It Be came out in 1970 and, matched with the movie, turned into the last hurrah of the Beatles and becomes the end. Unfortunately, that isn't the reality. The reality is that Let It Be was created in January, 1969 to be a &quot;Back to Basics&quot; album after all the studio play that started with Rubber Soul. They felt they had pushed the studio stuff to its limits and wanted to just play music again. So they did. What was also going on, that the Beatles don't like to readily admit to, is that the band was also falling apart and breaking up. The film shows that and if you want a film soundtrack [which is a typical American thing], then buy the 1970 release and be happy.<br />However, this version goes back to what the entire band [and if you listen to the Fly on The Wall CD you can hear them talking about it] wanted: An album of songs free of any studio tricks. Just live and raw. Hell, even George makes the comment that they hadn't been playing their best in the studio lately because they knew they could clean it up later. They always tried to improve themselves. They stopped touring because they didn't play well in concert. They were going to this type of album because they were becoming ashamed of themselves as musicians in the studio. They didn't like to rest on their laurels.<br />As to the song line-up, one needs to only go to the Abbey Road Studio Tapes book by Mark Lewisohn that lists the song order Glyn Johns came up with and you will find it remarkably similar to this albums. Personnally, they could have gone with Johns' masters, but I think they wanted to create it fresh, which you can't blame them for. Remember: Abbey Road is the true final album, regardless of your personal preference. They think so, and everyone involved with them think so. Buy this CD, put it between the White Album and Abbey Road and go live your life. This album is just fabulous!!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|People new to Wilco, beware of this album - it is great for various reasons, but it will be a difficult pill to swallow for new listeners.  Being a longtime fan, it has been my pleasure to follow Wilco's evolution over the last several years.  From the died in the wool alt country of 'AM', they started to flex their muscles in 'Being There'.  Next, the magnafied the experimental aspects of that album into the wonderous, lush 'Summerteeth'.  Here is where the path becomes rough.  For people accustomed to their wonderous album with Billy Bragg or new listeners, I reccommend 'Summerteeth' as the one album that you must have.  Even those who were introduced to Wilco through 'YHF', I reccomend listening to the earlier albums to appreciate the changes.  Once again, Wilco follows the pattern of taking experiements from one album and maganfying them, creating the sonically adventerous 'YHF'. This album in more fragements, of which strong singles such as 'Heavy Metal Drummer' may entice people in, then expose them to 'Pot Kettle Black' or 'Reservations'.  While it may be intimidating at first, under repeated listenings, this album stands up with both 'Being There' and 'Summerteeth' to become yet another classic.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna's 1989 masterpiece &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; showed the world once and for all that Madonna was more than hype,  she was a great artist who was to be reckoned with.<br />The album opens with the one-two punch of Like A Prayer and Express Yourself.  Like A Prayer in my opinion is one of the greatest songs ever recorded.  Part rock, part gospel,  part funk.  The song is a masterpiece.<br />Track by track blow<br /> Like A Prayer -  excellent song,  funky, rock, gospel and pop at one.  10/10<br /> Express Yourself - a great funky song with an ode to the 70's soul.  Lyrics are great about self-respect.  10/10<br /> Love Song - a duet with Prince, probably the weakest song on the album besides Act Of Contrition, but still powerful.  7/10<br /> Till Death Do Us Part - while it's dancy,  also one of the darkest songs Madonna's ever cut, the album was released a few months after her abusive marriage with Sean Penn ended, and it's hard to think that this song about domestic violence is about anything else but her then-recent divorce,  chilling song.  9/10<br /> Promise To Try.  Her first, and probably still saddest, song about her mother.  10/10<br /> Cherish.  An about-face coming after songs about her mothers death and domestic violence.  One of the few songs on this album that would've fit on True Blue.  Cute poppy number that still gets airplay 14 years later.  8/10<br /> Dear Jessie.  Madonna meets Sgt. Pepper.  One of her most underrated gems.  Very trippy and daring to record in the late 80's.  You can tell Madonna listened to a lot of Beatles &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; as a kid.  Also a Madonna song you can play for children without worrying about what they might ask.  10/10<br /> Oh Father.  A brilliant heartbreaking ballad.  Unfortunately the song broke her string of top 5 singles, topping out at #20 in January 1990.  Oh well, in the midst of all the New Kids that was big at the time,  it was probably too dark for them.  The song is another one about how her mothers death at age 5.  Haunting and gorgeous.  10/10<br /> Keep It Together.  Funky 70's influenced dance track about the power of family.  Catchy and immortalized on the Blond Ambition tour.  9/10<br /> Spanish Eyes.  Another great ballad.  Many people believe this song is about Jesus.  9/10<br /> Act Of Contrition.  The album closer.  Nothing special except Madonna saying the Act Of Contrition while a remix of Like A Prayer is being played backwards.  Basically filler but a way to close the album.  5/10.<br />All in all, the album is a total 10/10.  If you like 80's/early 90's pop and want to try a Madonna cd that's not a compilation.  Get this one first.h at age 5.  Haunting and gorgeous.  10/10<BR> Keep It Together.  Funky 70's influenced dance track about the power of family.

0385512104|5.0|Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark relevations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughout the narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love.

B000092ZYX|5.0|This is not a review. A public forum is not the place for half-ass opinions on art. While I have no problem with fans of any music waxing on in perhaps unrealistic and non musical terminology, there does seem to be a concerted effort by some to absolutely dismiss this album as sonic waste. If you must do this, at least try to do so in a legitimate manner. Demonstrate some musical knowledge. Explain to us your musical credentials, perhaps some music you've made, music you esteem, why ANYTHING you say might have some value. Otherwise, shut up.<BR>     Art criticism feeds on the carcass of creative endeavor. It is, by nature, a form of parasitic infestation. Critics, paid or not, are forced to justify their existence by worshiping the greatest of American gods -- opinion. The collective damage caused by you demagogues has done far more damage than any possible benefits. Remember, Messiaen, Mozart, Coltrane, Stravinsky, Miles, Monk, etc., etc., were all panned in their lifetimes by critics whose names I don't seem to be able to recall. To borrow a quote from the end of a Welles masterpiece, &quot;What does it matter what people say? &quot; Indeed.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi by Yann Martel is a very difficult book to classify. It's one of those books that is what you make of it. If you're a religious person, it's likely you'll read religion into much of the story. Looking for an adventure tale? Pi fits the bill. Want an analogy on the difficulty of life and the importance of having hope? Yep, you can get that, too. Are you wondering how one book can offer such different interpretations? Well, I'll try to explain, but the only true way to understand is to read this book for yourself. Also recommended: Deliverance by James Dickey, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B00000JPH6|5.0|the dark crystal is an awesome movie for anyone to behold with any sort of imagination.  there is not one scrap of the real world in this fantasy world.  it is a totally alien experience.  the characters are all well defined and you know who is good and who is bad.  it is classically told in terms of good and evil, growth versus death, and a great coming of age story.  i believe that this movie is suitable for anyone above the age of 7 because yes there are some scary parts that might scare a child it is nothing that they will not get over, plus they probably wont understand what is going on in the movie till they are older.  the fact that this movie is solely performed by puppets makes its greatness even more profound.  the talent of jim henson will never be matched and he deserves so much credit for the endurance of this movie.  i remeber this movie from when i was young and i am so thrilled to have it on dvd.  anyone and everyone should go out and buy this movie because of it great stroy, great puppetry and just overall greatness.
156898443X|5.0|Dannny Gregory's wonderful little book is sensitive love letter to New York City and to his wife. It's a diary with drawings (or vice-versa) of a family tragedy that's chockful of wise and droll observations: about his feelings of insecurity, of paranoia, of joy and of deep commitment. The lucky reader closes the book, inspired and charmed by his life story.
B00009TB5G|5.0|For those who are sick of hearing this, please move on:<br />I waited for this version to come out, rather than buy the theatrical version. And I have to say I'm glad I did.<br />As with the 'Fellowship' extended disc, Jackson does an outstanding job of re-intergrating cut scenes that he had wanted in anyway. This in and of itself is important. Unlike many other 'directors cuts', which come about much later and seem a bit slapdash, these are saemless and well prepared. Additional soundtrack was recorded, the effects were of the same high calibre as its predecessor, and all the scenes are there for a reason. Many interesting bits of information are spread out within the main body of the film, as well as several humorous monents which help cut the sometimes pervasively dark tone of the film.<br />Buy this one, and sell your puny 2-disc set.<br />Combined with 'Fellowship', you have over 7 hours of great film. When the 'Return of the King' extended version comes out (of which there will be one: Jackson spoke of cutting several scenes dear to him for time), that will be almost a half-days worth of good filmmaking to veg out on.<br />Yay!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|The best of Rufus so far.  I can't quit listening to this--my favorites on this album are the opening track and &quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot;, which sticks in my head at 2:00 am--which may or may not be good...<br />The music is lyrical, sweeping, sweet and dreamy, with shades of Ravel in the first song. Very pretty piano work and lush strings throughout.  A romantic's jewel box, as evidenced by the artist photographed in full armor in the liner notes (and the artist is pretty as well--not helpful to this review, but just the same--!)
6305878323|5.0|This is one of the absolute best family movies ever, and has a message that is needed even more in this day and age. Filled with beautiful, memorable songs, and superb performances, Mary Poppins is a gem and a classic. It is enchanting to see how Mary is able to teach a work-a-holic, self-centered, uninvolved father, and a sweet-but-sidetracked mother what their most precious possessions truly are--their children and their family. And Mary does it all so subtly, even magically, that the medicine really does go down with that spoonful of sugar!    Along the way, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) take the children on magical adventures to an English countryside, a tea party on the ceiling, and a chimney sweep's paradise. Dick Van Dyke said that this is the best movie he ever did, and ever hoped to do. I agree with him! A must-have for every family library!!
B0000CAQ26|5.0|First thing I have to say is WOW!  I was really skeptical about Pink pulling off this style of music, but she did it--and much better than I thought she would!<BR>Pink just proved with this CD that she can sing anything!  Yes this is a punk-like album, but it's not over-the-top and it's just right for Pink's vocal talent.<BR>And for those of you not crazy about her first single &quot;Trouble&quot;, I have to admit it took me some time to like it, but there are much better songs on this CD.<BR>This is a MUST PURCHASE!  You will not be disapponted!<BR>Enjoy!!
B0000AM6LY|5.0|This is one of Simply Red's best albums in almost 2 decades.  Mick Hucknall's voice still sounds as soulful and powerful as it did when he recorded \\"Holding back the years\\".  There are two covers \\"You make me feel brand new\\" and \\"Positively 4th Street\\" on this CD which showcase his different vocal styles.  While his music mostly get airplay on adult contemporary radio stations this CD contains \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Fake\\" which are danceable songs as well as \\"Home Loan Blues\\" which is reminiscent of \\"Money's too tight to Mention\\".  The musicians on this CD are also awesome especially Ian Kirkham and Kenji Suzuki.  ...Mick wrote the songs on this CD which some are calling a come back album.  In my opinion, he never left.
B00005JMF6|4.0|With a title like Gothika, the brief descriptive blurb, and the haunting dark-blue tinted image of Halle Berry on the rear of the weekly TV schedule, I figured it merited a look.<br />Miriam Gray is on her way home after a session with Chloe at the Woodward Penitentiary, a correctional facility for women.  Seems that Chloe is re-embellishing the images of being assaulted by her stepfather, by saying it is the devil who is doing this to her, and it burns.  Miriam is naturally skeptical, as Chloe is dragged away kicking and screaming.  Doug, head of the facility and Miriam's husband, explains it by use of of water splashed on a mirror.  The distorted image is how Chloe sees herself, but the psychiatrist is able to see the actual person, giving him/her the adventure.  That's what the viewer must decide in the omniscient view.  What is real and what is not?<br />Innocuous beginning, right?  Cut three days later.  Miriam finds herself wearing a blue uniform, lying on a cot in a cell, with a glass door separating her from the hallway.  Horror of horrors, she realizes she is now an inmate of Woodward, and it befalls upon Peter Graham, a colleague who had an extramarital crush on her, to inform her that Doug has been murdered....by her!  Naturally, she is distraught, as she has no memory of the crime... but Peter thinks she is crazy, as the evidence points out she is guilty.  Chloe's words return to haunt her.  \\"You can't trust anyone who thinks you're crazy.\\"  Not even Dr. Parsons, another colleague, can help her.<br />She remembers going home to Doug, yet the last image we see of her was her discovering a strange blonde girl standing drenched in the rain, slash marks across her chest.  Could this have anything to do with her?<br />Miriam discovers what it's like to be an inmate.  She is now nobody, and the viewer is given a shot of her from behind, the zip on her ill-fitting blue uniform unzipped.  The shower scene with all the woman isn't gratuitous as in those women in prison flicks of the 70's.  However, none of those movies ended up with the main character slashing her own arm from a hallucinatory illusion.<br />This mixes the amnesia and flurry of images of Abre Los Ojos with the supernatural element of Ringu.  The jarring hallucinatory images come at a frenzy.  Some of them are bloody and violent, the rest involve the appearance of the blonde girl.  The movie is coded in the time old classic way--horrible things happen only in the darkly lit scenes.  Things begin to get weird when she is attacked by the girl, yet the guards watching the camera think she's trying to do herself in.  Hallucination or supernatural?  And what do the words \\"Not Alone\\" which she sees on the walls and even carved into her arm(!) mean?<br />And some of the red herrings, the dramatic music that swells up, only to reveal... nothing, do get excessive, so it's as if a gallon of sweat dripped off the movie watcher for nothing.  The obligatory chase and escape sequences are somewhat predictable.<br />The story and premise are intriguing despite the flaws.  Halle Berry does a laudable performance as Miriam, someone whose professional and personal life is put through the wringer and has to cope to get to the bottom of things and to determine if she really is sane.  But if anyone delivers a performance in this movie it is Penelope Cruz, who alas appears in only a few scenes, but what scenes!  After seeing her in Belle Epoque, Woman On Top, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, and Abre Los Ojos, her role as Chloe is a real change from romantic comedies or thrillers where she plays the romantic lead.  Her skin is a pasty white here, and in the beginning of the movie, her cropped hair, manic eyes, and broken words, are a real contrast from Pelagia in Corelli.  Then again, I wonder if she's finding this repetitive, having appeared in the similar Abre Los Ojos and Vanilla Sky.<br />The worst character here is Robert Downey Jr. as Peter.  He is barely audible in parts and delivers a wooden and not too likeable performance.  Still, a potent and gripping psychological thriller.ivers a wooden and not too likeable performance.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Howard Shore did an excellent job and composed a great finale to this epic trilogy. It is a very diverse soundtrack with songs like 11.Shelob's Lair, 13.The Fields of the Pelennor, and 6.Minas Morgul bringing the louder side. But there are many soft, beautiful songs such as 17.The Return of the King, 18.The Grey Havens, and Annie Lennox's OUTSTANDING performance of 19.Into the West. This song, 19.Into the West, is amazing. Just reading the lyrics makes you want to cry because you realize the trilogy is over, and Lennox sings it so wonderful. For those people who feel that this soundtrack is not at all good, I think that perhaps you should wait to see the movie because then you'll know how this amazing score fits into the trilogy. It is a very different soundtrack than that of Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers, but I think before anyone who hates this soundtrack begins cursing at Howard Shore (who put 3 years of his life into this) they should give it a chance. After Shore's extreme dedication and committment to this project, I believe he deserves more than being criticzed and ridiculed for his work on the Return of the King Score without giving it even a second look. With that said, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this soundtrack.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I, like many of Sarah's loyal fans, had greatly anticipated the release of her first cd in almost 6 years, Afterglow. I first came upon Sarah freshman year of college when I bought Mirrorball, which contains many of her great hits - Possession, Building a Mystery, I Will Remember You. Upon first listen to Afterglow, I wasn't sure what to think. Fallen was already a favorite but I wasn't sure about the rest. Since the first week it came out, the cd has not left my car CD player. I think there is something about Sarah's music that draws you in, with it having both a tranquil and emotional quality to it. There may not be 3 or 4 number one billboard hits, but each song is distinctly original and appealing and has something very unique to offer. I definitely recommend this CD if you would like to get to know Sarah and her beautiful music better, with all the enchanting melodies and lyrics she produces. In my opinion, she is one of the best female vocalists ever.
0743442539|5.0|John Le Carre's disillusioned, cynical and spellbinding spy novels are so unique because they are based on a wide knowledge of international espionage. Le Carre, (pen name for David John Moore Cornwell), acquired this knowledge firsthand during his years as an operations agent for the British M15. Kim Philby, the infamous defector, actually gave Le Carre's name to the Russians. The author's professional experience and his tremendous talent as a master storyteller and superb writer make &quot;The Spy Who Came In From The Cold&quot; one of the most brilliant novels I have read about spying and the Cold War. Graham Greene certainly agreed with me, or I with him, when he remarked that it is the best spy story he had ever read. The novel won Le Carr&eacute; the Somerset Maugham Award.<br />The novel's anti-hero, Alec Leamas, is the antithesis of the glamorous action-hero spy, James Bond. A successful espionage agent for the British during WWII, Leamus continued on with counter-intelligence operations after the war, finding it difficult to adjust to life in peacetime. He eventually became the head of Britain's Berlin Bureau at the height of the Cold War. Leamus, slowly going to seed, drinking too much, world weary, had been losing his German double agents, one by one, to East German Abteilung assassins. Finally, with the loss of his best spy, Karl Riemeck, Leamus has no agents left. His anguish at Riemeck's death is palpable. He has begun to tire of the whole spy game, as his boss at Cambridge Circus, (British Intelligence), seems to understand.<br />Leamus is called back to London, but instead of being eased out of operations, called &quot;coming in from the Cold,&quot; or retiring completely, he is asked to accept one last, dangerous assignment. &quot;Control,&quot; the man Leamus reports to, asks him if he is up to &quot;taking-out&quot; Hans Dieter Mundt, a top East German operations agent and the man responsible for the deaths of Leamus' agents. The ploy is elaborate, and if successful, it will conclude with Mundt's own men killing him. With much planning Leamus convincingly changes his lifestyle and sets himself up as bait as a potential defector to the Eastern Block countries. As Leamus works efficiently toward his goal, two unexpected problems come-up - problems that he is unaware of until much later, when it is almost too late to resolve them. First, he falls in love with a young woman, a member of the Communist Party, who was supposed to be part of his cover, nothing more. And second, Control and the Circus have embedded plots within plots to further their end, which they don't see fit to reveal to Leamus - now operating in the dark. Le Carre portrays spying as a dirty game of acting, betrayal, lying, excruciating tension, and assumed identities. The espionage methods of East and West are the same. The only difference is their economic ideologies. There is a seemingly endless game of chess between the superpowers, and spies are as expendable as pawns.<br />This is a short novel, 219 pages, and very tightly written. However there is much packed into this bleak tale of the espionage business. The story has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster. And the ride is well worth it!<br />JANAif successful, it will conclude with Mundt's own men killing him.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I definately recommend Donnie Darko for anyone who thinks a little outside the box. Its great for us teens who dont know what to think about life. It definately is NOT one of those movies you can watch and then be like &amp;amp;quot;oh, it was good&amp;amp;quot;. It makes you think. I watched it for the first time this last Halloween and i havent been able to get it out of my head ever since. Its hypnotic in so many ways. It has a great cast, great script(i think),and a great soundtrack!!! It has alot of potential into being a great cult classic.    By the way, the docter doesnt call in regards to his girlfriend.
0140182829|5.0|&quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; is, simply put, a beautiful novel. A friend recommended it to me recently, and after reading it once I know I will keep it to read over and over again. Alain-Fournier has written, with heartbreaking poignance, about a magical period between boyhood and manhood; a time that once gone can never be recaptured. The book's title has shifted over the years from &quot;The Grand Meaulnes,&quot; to &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; and then &quot;The Lost Domain.&quot; Alain-Fournier writes about a boy who is called &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; by his friends and fellow schoolmates. What does &quot;Grand&quot; mean? The novel's translator writes: &quot;No English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses. 'Le Grand Meaulnes' can be 'the tall,' 'the big,' 'the almost-grown-up,' even 'the great Meaulnes' - or with schoolboys, even 'good old Meaulnes.' But when the book has been put down, that phrase evokes in retrospect the image of someone not only tall or big, but also daring, noble, tragic, fabulous.&quot; And Augustin Meaulnes is all those things - as he is also a wanderer, searching for a lost domain.<br />The tale is set in France in the late 1800s. Our narrator is Francois Seurel, the somewhat sheltered, adolescent son of Sainte-Agathe's secondary schoolmaster. A new border comes to the school, Augustin Meaulnes, bringing adventure and a breath of fresh air into Francois' peaceful, rather sedate life. The charismatic young man easily becomes the leader of the schoolboys and much admired by all.  He is definitely not flamboyant nor a show-off, but a rather quiet, serious and sometimes introspective young man. Yet he has tremendous imagination and leads the boys on childish exploits, &quot;bold and dangerous.&quot; One day Meaulnes disappears on what the others believe is a seemingly harmless prank - an adventure. When he returns, 3 days later, he is forever changed. He becomes reclusive and obsessively works on a map he is making. He loses interest in everything and everyone, except for Francois, who has become his only confident.<br />The day Meaulnes disappeared from the schoolhouse, he became lost and disoriented. After an anxious overnight stop, in the middle of nowhere, he found himself in the midst of a grand and fantastic celebration in a forest clearing. The festival was held to celebrate the wedding of young Frantz de Galais and his beloved bride. At this feast, Augustin Meaulnes met the beautiful, gentle, mysterious Yvonne, Frantz' sister. Tragically, the wedding never took place, the party was disbanded, and Meaulnes, forced to take leave immediately, lost sight of Yvonne - his fairy-princess, his love dream of adolescence.<br />He returned to Sainte-Agathe but remained haunted by memories of the magic place, its trappings and most of all, Yvonne. Meaulnes' time was now almost exclusively spent trying to find his way back, but since he didn't know how he arrived at the domain, he didn't know how to return. Disconsolate, he wrote down everything he remembered about his trip and began his mapmaking. He promised Francois that he could accompany him when he finally makes his way back to the lost domain. Together the two friends attempt to retrace Meaulnes' footsteps. They journey together into the world of adulthood, trying to close the circle between what had been and what was yet to be.<br />Alain-Fournier's descriptive prose is exquisite. His narrative frequently reads like pure poetry, filled with magical imagery. I must say a few words here about Frank Davison's superb and faithful translation. Without Mr. Davison's work, I would not have been able to appreciate Fournier's prose. This story of friendship and love, of vows broken and vows kept, is one of the most original and unique books I have ever read. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />What makes this novel even more poignant is that theauthor was killed, at age 27, in the first actions of WWI. I was overwhelmed by sadness when I learned of this terrible loss. Alain-Fournier will always be remembered through his wonderful work.<br />JANAhe author was killed, at age 27, in the first actions of WWI.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|Mutants can't live with them, can't live without them seems to be the preveiling theme of the marvelous X2. Building on the momentum of the first film Director Bryan Singer continues to graft contemporary issues (although, to be fair, the original comic did so as well but not in such a compact fashion)to the X-men story. The major theme of the second feature, like the first, is prejudice and tolerance. Singer handles the themes and the film's story well. Although many of the original elements from the graphic novel involving Stryker have been changed, those changes work dramatically for the film.<br />When we last saw the X-Men, Wolverine had left Xavier's School For Gifted Children and the X-Men compound to discover his origin. He ends up at an abandoned research facility so it appears, on the surface, that his search has reached a dead end. Rogue mutants have become bolder making an attempt on the life of the President. This assassination attempt allows William Stryker the opportunity and excuse he needs to convince the President to sign an order giving him troops to invade Xavier's school and take the X-Men (and the children at the school)captive.<br />Encased in a plastic prison cell, Magneto is a caged bird. When Stryker arrives with a special serum to force Magneto to cooperate in revealing information about Xavier's school and the compound, Magneto sings giving up his old friend to a mutual enemy.<br />Jean Grey's abilities have blossomed in a frightening way since her encounter with Magneto at Ellis Island. Her abilities indicate that she might be more powerful than ever before. She and Storm go in search of the Presidential assassin so they can get to the bottom of who is trying to create a war between humans and mutants. Meanwhile, Stryker attacks Xavier's compound and with Wolverine the only adult around, he goes into high gear fighting them off. All of this becomes central to the conflict between Stryker, Magneto and the X-Men.<br />The performances are all exceptional in particular Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Famke Jannsen, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Brian Cox give considerable power and presence to the various roles they play. Unlike some films, the actors here are clearly committed to the material and aren't going through the motions.<br />The DVD looks exceptional although I did notice a bit of edge enhancement. Still, it's nothing serious and doesn't mar an otherwise exceptional presentation. The colors are rich and, unlike the film the Santa Clause (another recent release)the transition from one layer to another in the disc isn't disruptive.<br />The extras are an improvement when compared to the first edition of X-Men on DVD (and comparable to 1.5). On disc one there are two running commentaries with Bryan Singer, Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and a second audio track with various comments from a variety of the actors and producers.<br />Disc two focuses on a wide variety of extras. The Nighcrawler Attack sequence is a multi-angle interactive sequence that is actually quite cool although I doubt you'll go back to it again and again. The Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal provides the nuts and bolds of choregraphing a difficult and demanding fight sequence. The documentary The Second Unanny Issue of X-Men (cleverly titled I might add) is quite good and provides a good glimpse into the production process. It's not the best documentary I've seen included as an extra but provides considerable insight.<br />The Featurettes include The Secret Origin of X-Men, Nightcrawler Reborn, The Adventure Before X2, Introducing The Incredible Nightcrawler and character studies. As before there are deleted scenes although I haven't had the time to investigate all of these fully so can't completely comment.<br />Parents should be warned that there is a bit of bad language and also some suggestive sexual situations in the film.are all exceptional in particular Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.

B00009Y2K9|4.0|I have only listened to part of the title song, Lagrimas Negras; I gave it 4 stars.  Went to buy the CD and was asked $25.  I refuse to shell out this much for a CD which in addition has the names Tata Guines and Changuito associated with it; I suspect some royalties end up in Fidel Castro's pockets.  Back to the material itself, I did not like some carelessness with the lirics on the part of Sigala; if he did not know the words, certainly other cuban born personnel should have intervenned.

014100018X|3.0|In \\"Chocolat,\\" Vianne Rocher, a single mother, arrived in a small French village with her 6 year-old daughter, Anouk and opened a store selling chocolates. Vianne had always been moving constantly, first with her mother, a witch, then with her daughter. Settling down in a place was a new concept for Vianne and she wanted some stability in her life. Unfortunately, the village priest, Father Reynaud saw Vianne as somewhat of a bad influence to the villagers and considered something like chocolates as temptations, which the villagers should avoid. Despite the hostility of the priest, Vianne was determined to settle in that village.<br />This book deals with temptation, love, friendship and also hate. I like the secondary characters of this book as the author is able to describe their characters vividly. I feel that this is an okay read as sometimes, there are things which I feel is a bit hard to believe; such as the threat that Father Reynaud felt of Vianne. In addition, I also wonder about the time period of this book. At times, the setting seems to be in the nineteenth century but references to Disneyland eliminates that possibility. However, it is still an interesting read as the author writes very eloquently and smoothly.

B0000DJZA5|2.0|Not much new here folks.  We've heard it all before.  Some people have been saying that this is not a McCartney vanity project by contending that decisions like rearranging tracks and eliminating material is all the responsibility of EMI technicians. I find it extremely hard to believe that the idea to redo Let it Be the way Paul wanted was not Paul's idea to begin with. On the other hand, if those were EMI decisions and not decisions by members of the band, then how on earth can anyone claim that LIBN is a true representation of how the band intended LIB to be?  You can't have it both ways.
B0000AUHQT|1.0|Despite a beautiful soundtrack (with Nelson Riddle orchestrating variations on Irving Berlin's haunting ballad \\"What'll I Do?\\"), this is an almost unwatchable movie, thanks largely to Mia Farrow's excruciating performance as Daisy (she seems to think she's playing Blanche DuBois and boy does she stink). The directing by Jack Clayton doesn't help either --- it's wooden and obvious in its choices and at times the shot set-ups and dissolves are downright ugly.  The script is pedestrian, listless and finds no way to deal with the fact that \\"The Great Gatsby\\" as a novel gains a lot of its power from Fitzgerald's narrative voice. I've heard stories about the legendary screenplay which was written by Francis Coppola of all people and which supposedly got ruined by director Clayton -- but it seems like hackwork to me; Coppola didn't solve any of the problems in adapting this book into a movie(neither did any of the earlier screen versions). The scene in which Daisy is moved to tears by the sight of Gatsby's beautiful shirts is a textbook case of a scene which works beautifully as a metaphor in the novel but which lies there on the screen like a dead trout. It's really too bad, because Robert Redford in his prime is a perfect choice for Gatsby. And the supporting cast (Sam Waterston, Karen Black and especially Bruce Dern as Tom) would be hard to improve on. My advice to anyone thinking of watching this fiasco -- first, put on a nice recording of \\"What'll I Do\\" -- and then sit down and reread the book.
0385504209|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read. It was very informative and intriguing. It gave me a lot to think about. It opened me up to a secret society world I had no idea existed.
6304806426|5.0|One of the movies that I'll keep remembering and watching again.<br />The cinematography, the exotic desert landscape, the portrait of the European/ African Muslim cultural harmony, the beautifully haunting music, the intricately layered story (takes more than one viewing to fully understand), the way the two lovers have to part and the way he chooses to end his life and have his nurse read to him his lover's last writing as he passes away... <br />All these just gel so well into a sad and beautiful art work, to be savoured again and again.
B00008PW3O|5.0|One of the best albums Fleetwood Mac has recorded. I would say that this could be one of those rare records where none of the tracks can be singled out as the best or the worst-They're all great. It's amazing how this band has evolved and moved on over time, and this is a great example of that. &quot;Say You Will&quot; has gotten horrible reviews as a whole and those are reviews it doesn't deserve. I think many were disappointed by the sound  sans Christine McVie, and hopefully that won't stop you from buying this CD. Be warned- This is NOT &quot;Rumours&quot; - but it is one of the best records Fleetwood Mac has put forth.

B00008K7AM|3.0|I came to the movie for Rob Schneider but I left with a newfound admiration for Anna Faris.  Come to think of it, is there any other female comic actress out there who can match beauty and comic timing as well as Faris these days?  Her strange attraction to her transformed best gal pal (embodied by Schneider after some strange Egyptian hijinx) gives her plenty of room to stretch to show off her dazzling eyes and magnificent smile and also to bounce hysterical one-liners and overt innocent verbal pellets (&quot;Can I see it?&quot;) off the walls.  No one expects THE HOT CHICK to be Shakespeare but if you approach it with the right frame of mind you will enjoy the laughs and the occasional uneasy situations (O'Keefe is a joy too).  The DVD has plenty of extras to keep you happy.  If you saw it in the theaters there may not be enough here to make you spring a few extra bucks but the laughs and Faris might entice you back.  If you haven't seen THE HOT CHICK, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
0385504209|1.0|This book started out with some promise, but before long I decided it was poorly plotted, poorly researched and poorly written.  Some have compared it's pacing to that of a Saturday matinee serial, but I've seen much more compelling Flash Gordon serials.  Langdon and Sophie were absolutely flat on the page, without even enough life to be called caricatures.  The &quot;revelations&quot; were without any emotional component and were dryly retold through narrative.  The codes were so simplistic that I figured out most of them before Langdon or Sophie.  This is like a &quot;paint by numbers&quot; suspense novel, but without the numbers.  I think the book panders to its audience by giving readers who aren't educated in religious history or art history the illusion that they're reading something intellectual.  Although certainly one of those rare publishing &quot;phenomenas&quot;, I'm not even sure this one deserves a space on the bookshelf next to BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY or JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL.  Harry Potter, where are you???
B00009TB5G|5.0|After watching Two Towers on DVD that contained the original motion picture version, I was a little disappointed.  The relationships between the characters, and the relationship between the different peoples, and races were not clearly established.  I went off a little confused about the overall plan of Sauron and Saruman.  The extended platinum version took care of that.  It had extended scenes where, if you had seen the original Two Towers, after seeing the extended scene you were saying to yourself, &quot;Okay, I get it now&quot;, or &quot;Okay, that makes better sense&quot;.  If you are going to purchase the Two Towers, most definately get the extended edition.  It will be worth it.  As you watch the new scenes, pay close attention to the dialog.  There are several extended scenes where it sets you up for the third movie.
B00009TB5G|2.0|I really liked the extended edition movie.  It was even better than expected.  Some pretty funny parts left out of the theatrical release.<br />HOWEVER, as I see from other posters here, I am having the same problems playing any of the extras Discs.  I've tried 2 players and neither of them can play them.  To Amazon's credit, they've shipped out replacements quickly, but I give the &quot;studio&quot; or the &quot;distributor&quot; of these DVD's poor marks for quality control.
0780622553|4.0|I would agree with almost anyone who says that &quot;Dark City&quot; is one of the most visually arresting cinematic efforts made in the last few years. Alex Proyas's film employs shifting set pieces, hallucinatory effects, downright bleak atmosphere, and bizarre characters to create a science fiction tour de force of epic proportions. I have never seen a movie quite like &quot;Dark City,&quot; and I do not expect to see something like this again for some time to come, if ever. The movie seems to divide viewers; either you will like this one or absolutely detest it. Either side can make strong cases for their opinions. Fans can point to the devilishly clever plot, the casting of well-known actors such as Jennifer Connolly, Kiefer Sutherland, and William Hurt in key roles, and the nifty special effects work. Detractors are correct when they spotlight the movie's tendency to embrace style over substance, the paper-thin characters, and an occasionally convoluted plot. I am going to take the middle ground with this picture because I feel that &quot;Dark City&quot; is a wonderful idea in terms of special effects and plot but too often fails to realize the human aspects of its story.<br />John Murdoch awakens in a bathtub with a raging case of amnesia the likes of which few people have ever seen. He simply has no memory of how he got into the bathtub, why the lamp above his head is swinging as though someone just bumped into it, or why there is a body in the other room. Over the course of the next few minutes, Murdoch realizes he has a wife and that the police think he is a serial killer of some sort. To make matters exponentially worse, a group of flying humanoids who look a lot like Uncle Fester on a diet occasionally turn up and attempt to do Murdoch some serious harm. Our forgetful hero must find out who he is, track down his wife, and figure out why a place called Shell Beach is so important before the Fester-like creeps hunt him down. Throw in a strange doctor who appears from time to time and spouts rather cryptic statements about the city, an alien conspiracy that would make even the most levelheaded soul paranoid, a truly mind blasting conclusion, and you have all the makings of a film that will stay with you for quite some time. To reveal more could very well spoil the whole movie, as &quot;Dark City&quot; utilizes each and every one of its scenes to build to a shattering conclusion. This movie reminds me of &quot;Memento&quot; in the way that you need to pay close attention to what is going on in order to arrive at the ending fully informed.<br />The special effects are the best aspect of &quot;Dark City.&quot; Proyas and gang constructed a truly frightening, grim backdrop for their characters to explore. The city never sees the light of day, and at midnight all life in the city comes to a screeching halt. The urban landscape itself is like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle, capable of assuming new forms on a daily basis. The film reeks of noir stylings, as characters amble around in circa 1940s clothing, drive outdated automobiles from the 1950s to the 1960s, and occasionally banter using dialogue right out of a Raymond Chandler novel. The floating Festers who appear from time to time and talk in a strange lisping accent work as well, especially when we discover exactly what these creatures are and what their relation is to the humans in the city. What is this place and what does it all mean? A good question, and one that very few of the people in the city think about let alone can answer.<br />Regrettably, I thought the characters in the film often took second fiddle to the special effects and eerie plot. Kiefer Sutherland does an effective turn as the nervous Dr. Schreber, a guy who knows everything about this city and the shenanigans taking place within its parameters but who has no idea how it all started. William Hurt turns up as the meticulous detective Frank Bumstead, a man who notices minute details within the conscious world but has no understanding of the reality of the city. Jennifer Connolly is completely, utterly wasted as Emma, Murdoch's barely remembered wife. Any Connolly fan that watches &quot;Dark City&quot; is sure to experience disappointment about how little she does here. Rufus Sewell, an actor I am unfamiliar with and whom I thought was miscast here, plays the amnesia addled John Murdoch. I never felt much sympathy with Sewell's character and I kept thinking of other actors who should have played the part. Ian Richardson turns up as one of the creepy Fester creatures.<br />&quot;Dark City,&quot; while failing to fire on all cylinders, is still an enormously entertaining science fiction film. As others have mentioned, it is easy to see this film's influence on later blockbuster sagas like &quot;The Matrix.&quot; The extras on the DVD, including a couple of commentaries, cast biographies, and an interactive game, spare no effort to convince you that the film is nothing less than visionary. In fact, the producers of &quot;Dark City&quot; even draw comparisons between their effort and Fritz Lang's monumental epic &quot;Metropolis.&quot; I wouldn't go that far, but Proyas's film is amazing on many levels and certainly makes for a couple of hours of great amusement.world but has no understanding of the reality of the city.

B00006AW2G|5.0|Trust me, this is one of the absolute greatest rock albums ever recorded.  If you like classic rock and blues, this is the album for you.  It also happens to be one of the two best Stones albums (Sticky Fingers is the other).  I have read alot of the other reviews of this album.  I have never written an online review about any album, but some of the comments I read forced me too.  Every song on the album is a 10 and anyone who doesn't like &quot;Country Honk&quot; is a moron.  It is far superior to the single version on the radio and it fits better with the album.  The remastered SACD disc sounds incredible even without an SACD player.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This cd is great to dance to, but there is just so much of the same beat and themes. I wish that Britney could have talked about things other than sex. She is such a huge role model that when all she talks about is sex and breakups, it kind of sends out the wrong message... so, for some, the record is a good time, but for others, I would pick something else like india. arie, or eamon, or even missy elliot. It's your call....
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious D expresses in this 21 track album true artwork with what I think they feel about things, they are a truely wonderful band with notes and vocals that are too good. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, BUY IT!!! Only a true lover of music will get their stuff and not download.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|DT continues to deliver quality music with TOT. There is definitely a progression in thier music style to a more aggressive and heavier direction. James vocals are awesome and he experiments with some other effects to his voice at times. Petrucci remains a God among guitarists with perfect technique and his usually progressive touch. At first the CD seems to lack something but as you listen to it more, it progresses and becomes a better and better piece of music. While it does not sound like Images and Words thats good since I already have a copy of that CD. Without a doubt one to the best CD's of 2003 and a great addition to the Dream Theater evolution.
0790731509|5.0|\\"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\\" Whoever has seen this film surely remembers that line - and the scene immediately following it. The opening scene is a winner, too: Newman, drunk and still drinking, walks down a street with a pipe cutter, whacking the heads off parking meters. Right there, he's put the audience 100% on his side. Brilliant. So he goes to jail, and the film pits the individual against the institution in a classic power struggle, the outcome of which is rarely in doubt. Oh, and don't forget the hardboiled egg eating contest, and the size and drum-like tenseness of Newman's stomach...<BR>Cool Hand Luke made an icon of Paul Newman and cemented his place in history as an actor who could play a loner, a stubborn rebel. He's played in many times since, always well, but never better than in this movie. Just watch it. Invite your teenagers to watch it with you. They might learn a thing or two about Life.

When I heard everyone talking about a &quot;revolution&quot; , I thought The Strokes were the Nirvana of the 00's and thus was really disapointed by those weird and childish songs . It took me two years and a couple of other listenings to understand what &quot;Is This It&quot; was really all about , to understand it wasn't a record that took itself seriously at all and that it was never meant to fill stadiums. The Strokes is exactly the kind of bands you'd enjoy in small , private nightclubs where you can smoke and drink as you wish to fully enjoy the music .<br />This isn't The Beatles , Led Zeppelin or Nirvana . This is merely one of the greatest albums of all time , and that's good enough for me .

B0000DD7LB|1.0|This cd is awful.  The lyrics are so filthy.  It seems Britney Spears is taking great links to be the next Madonna.  It's a good thing the music is so loud that it drowns out her singing, if you can call that singing...not that any of her other albums sounded professional.  In my opinion, Britney Spears better thank her looks for where she is today.  This album is a disgrace.
B00005JM02|5.0|Ok, I give this movie 5 stars because it is definitely a wonderful movie if not one of the best Disney movies ever, especially in terms of the Pixar line of movies. It is definitely a family movie, and in terms of that it does a great job of keeping the adults interested with a lot of great humor. The animation is great as are all the special features, which are fascinating as well.<br />So, what's the But for... Well, my biggest complaint, and this is looking at it from the perspective of a parent or a little kid is what I perceive to be a little bit more violence or implied violence than what some kids might be able to handle.  Granted, it isn't something that is going to bother most kids, but the horror of seeing Nemo's mother killed (even though it isn't directly shown) seems like it could frighten a lot of kids. Frankly, I found it a little depressing, and I am 27.<br />The shark attack scene and the subsequent mine incident also seem a bit frightening for a young child to see. In fact, there seemed to be quite a few &quot;startling&quot; scenes that could easily scare a young child.<br />Now, I hardly think it detracts from the movie as a whole, but it is also common to sit the little ones in front of a tv to watch a movie such as this, and I think this movie is one where a little adult support could be helpful. I would hate to have my child be waking up in the night dreaming of baracudas and sharks attacking....<br />Of course, in the end, a lot of other Disney movies have the same type of dramatic and even someone morbid aspects to their plots, and perhaps it is these aspects that make the movies great to begin with.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Go Whitney!You rule, I love this NEW holiday album from Whitney Houston. All of the songs are for you to relax to you on the December holidays, trust me, Ill be listening to this album on Christmas, so will you! Good luck, and you WILL love Whitney's powerful voice on this album.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I bought the DVD largely out of curiosity, as I've watched it from time to time on TV over the years.  I was completely fascinated by the quality of this film, made 65 years ago, and the restoration. It simply can't be faulted.  The extras are just as good and tell how the film evolved from what  was to be a humble B&amp;W affair, with James Cagney as Robin Hood ( ???), into a Technicolour spectacular with the then, new boy on the block, Errol Flynn.  <BR>Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is - a very well made fairy tale movie, with a great cast of legends. <BR>Loved it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King has been my absolute favorite movie ever since it &quot;pounced&quot; it's way into theaters. The story of Simba is a complicated one, with tragedy and facing one's responsibility being the key moral issues dealt with. The story, animation, score, and characters are top notch. This is probably one of Disney's most original works, and is a masterpiece on all fronts. Whether you are a fan of lions in general (which just so happen to be my favorite critters.)  doesn't  matter.<BR>The Lion King is a masterpiece, and well deserving of the royal treatment Disney has bestowed on it for it's inaugural DVD release.
B00004BZ0N|2.0|I've heard my share of punk rock albums, and I'm definitely skeptical that this one actually lives up to the hype, even though I've never heard any of it.  Haven't you people ever heard of Green Day and Nirvana?  What about Blink-182?  Shan't they count for something?  Let's get into the modern age, folks. <br />I just remember this band's dumb song from 1982 or something, &quot;Rock the Casbod.&quot;  Man, that song was annoying!!  So was the dusky video!! What did any of it mean?<br />No disrespect to the Clash, for I know they are highly revered, but I feel the Meat Puppets and Journey were much better.<br />Hope this helps...
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The resequencing of songs on this revisionist creation is superior to the original Spector version: it's fitting to have &quot;Get Back&quot; first (the project's original name), and it's lovely to have a George, John, and Paul song back-to-back for the finale (&quot;I Me Mine,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;).  &quot;Two of Us&quot; works nicely in the middle. (I do wish &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; might have found its way here in a &quot;cleaner&quot; Beatle version than that of the Anthology.)<br />One cannot be objective about the Beatles if one grew up with their music, as I did. I love this remix. The &quot;ooh oohs&quot; of John and George in the first verse of &quot;Let It Be&quot; sent shivers down my spine on first hearing. This new version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; brought me to tears (it's now my favorite version,  though I also love the &quot;Anthology&quot; version).<br />It's fun to hear the old material in a new form, and the &quot;Fly On the Wall&quot; disc also is fun. I do wonder why no official compilation of the Fan Club Christmas Messages has ever been released on CD by the remaining duo: there's clearly an endless market for these sounds of the sixties.<br />Let the daft critics argue which version is best, worst, blah blah blah. This album is a small bit of history from an era when it truly seemed that Marching For Peace could end war; when it seemed that there was hope for the Little Guy; when love couldn't lead to AIDS; and when Strawberry Fields did seem Forever.<br />Times have changed, although Love still is the answer. How nice to have those Words of Wisdom Whispered: &quot;We're Going Home.&quot;

[...]  Its just sad, I wonder what influences caused Britney to turn out this way?<BR><BR>However we are talking about BRITNEY SPEARS, she will sell because she is Britney Spears. Her glamour appeal is stellar and it will take at least 2 more garbage albums for her career to go the way of \\"Paula Abdul\\" the opposite of \\"Straight Up\\" yo, and if you dont believe me, ask Paula yourself and ask her what ruined her career. The garbage music will be the final blow to Britney and Justin Timberlake will tell you all about that.

0062502182|1.0|I flew through The Alchemist and was disappointed by the end because it was thoroughly boring and the resolution was horrible, albeit I understand that it was supposed to be symbolic.  The grand message of &quot;following your dreams&quot; is 'nice', but it's been done before, and BETTER.  I compare this story to one of my favorites, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, and I can see Ayn Rand turning over in her grave if she knew how big a hit this one was.  Following your dreams is one thing.  Learning to turn into the wind and have telepathy with sheep and incurring the wrath of the sun is just plain silly.  I wish he (Coelho) had emphasized more of his fable around &quot;work hard to earn that which you desire&quot;, rather than &quot;float through life keeping in mind what you want and somehow the universe will magically make it happen for you.&quot;  It does not hurt Coelho's cover that the story started out with OTHERS (the soothsayer and the &quot;king&quot;) actually TELLING the protagonist what his dream in life is, rather than him figuring out what he wants consciously, which is what Coelho is pushing in the first place. Maybe the United Fortune Tellers Union had a hand in making this story the hit it is today...hmmmm.  It's all mumbo-jumbo and it needs serious criticism before too many people actually start believing in it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is at the top of my wish list! I had the bootleg &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 1971 (can't even remember how I got a hold of that gem) and always preferred it to the released version. The album was too fragile to continue playing, not being pressed on vinyl, so I had a cassette copy made of it, but that has been lost. I wonder if the release of this CD makes my album more or less valuable? Regardless, I consider this far superior to the Spectorized one. Everything shines through unadulterated and clean, and you will find yourself singing these songs all over again in their new resurrected form. BRAVO!!
B0000CDL93|5.0|Whatever  you feel what went down that fateful day you gotta give him a hand for having the gumption to tell a political story.Hollywood is a gutless and braindead junkyard.I become interested in the JFK case when I first seen this film in the theatre back in '91.I was really impressed by this film.Film has it's own langusge and Oliver Stone is a master of using film to tell a story.This is one of the most engrossing films to watch.It should be studied by film schools and used as a bible on the art of becoming a movie director.I SENSE STONE believes there's a conspircy and cover-up.And a clue leads me to think a general LANSDALE played a important part.All the actors were very good but I was especially impressed  by John Candy as Dean Andrews and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw.I love this film and think its a one of our great american films but there's one or two flaws.First as much as     I love Joe Pesci I think he overdid the David Ferry   part.He comes off as a ranting clown.Also some of family comes of  f bad in diologue.I know Oliver used some F-words so Jim Garrison doesn't come off as  a flawless saint.I wish he could of been more<BR>]subtle.Oliver Stone is not a subtle type of guy.He's the closest thing next to a modern day Sam Fuller.Like Fuller he's passionate and very opinionated.He pisses off alot of folks butwe   need more  people like him .
B00006JIA4|5.0|This anthology is a jewel.<BR>It is a tour trough the history of one of the most important bands in rock history. <BR>The three cd's (previously released), contains 50 tracks that define the most remarkable moments of the Queen History.<BR>But it also contains many other rare songs, (at least for all those whom are not truly fans) like &quot;Driven by You&quot;, solo by Brian May and &quot;Barcelona&quot;, Freddie's &amp; spanish soprano Monserrat Caballé duet.<br />This compilation contains many larger-than-life classics, such as:<BR>Bohemian Rhapsody (with the Galileos in the opera section), We are the Champions, A kind of Magic, Show must Go on, We will rock you, Somebody to love, Under Pressure, Crazy little thing called love, Save me, Killer Queen, It's a Hard Life, I want it all, Inuendo, among many, many others.<br />This anthology has to be analyse with care, but it can be define like this: There are two albums with the best songs of the Queen history (GH I % II)and an album that allows you to discover the complexity of Queen's career and evolution. (GH III)<br />Highlights: The remixed Under Pressure with David Bowie, Show must go on with Elton John, Only the good die young, song written specifically by the other three members of Queen (Roger, Brian and John) for Freddie, among others.<br />Good music listeners, this is a Must-Buy.

You HAVE to watch the extra footage, it gives such a great insight into the lenghty proccess of making this SAGA.<br />A special THUMBS UP goes to the entire STUNT Team, you guys (and gal!) are marvelous.<br />The extra footage is WELL worth watching. So many extra scenes bring even more light into the storyline, for those who never read the actual books.

1577311523|5.0|recent Ph.D. engineering graduate<br />The &quot;Power of Now&quot; book enables a person to free themselves of their mind, which is the sole cause of worry, doubt, fear, discouragement, anger, anxiety, ups and downs, as well as all other mind based causes.  I use it continuously to produce desired effects that allows me to continuously GROW.  Time and mind are synomonous as the book states because the mind acts now on possible future negative conditions as they are real and completely upsets your actions in manifesting desired goals.  Additionally, it puts off future events that should be done NOW.  It does this so that it can remain &quot;comfortable&quot; and maintain its current state.  As the book states, all a person ever has is now and by accessing the power of being which is present in each and everyone of us, the way will be shown to solve a problem or manifest a desired goal and the necessary changes in our environment will be made by the being.  All of this will occur according to Universal Law.  By the person acting on the &quot;intuition&quot; that it receives from the being (i.e. the way to go) along with the changes that occur in one's environment, a union will occur at which time the problem will <BR>be solved and/or the desire (the being seeking expression) manifested.  <BR>By repeatedly using the technique of focusing on the now consciously whenever a problem or desire is realized, <BR>the unconscious will connect to the being on a continual basis.  Basically, it becomes a habit.  Hence the removal of all mind based causes.<BR> By simply reading the book, one will develop an inner peace, which can only be achieved through the being. Additionally, if one performs work in other &quot;realms&quot; or &quot;planes of existence&quot; this work will help immensely as demonstrated in my own practice.  In addition to the &quot;Power of Now&quot; I personally <BR>recommend the following books to call upon the &quot;being&quot;<BR>or &quot;universal life energy&quot; to assist one in realizing one's dreams.  Before I proceed, a word of caution must be used.  If anyone is doing work with other systems which would <BR>include but not limited to the occult, mysticism, and witchcraft, I would abandon these systems for a period of time before attempting the following works, if one felt that these books is the way to go.  The reason is that by &quot;mixing&quot; <BR>systems one will create cross currents which will create no end of problems in attempting to manifest their desires.  I personally, would work solely with the works below (each one separately), assimilate them, perform the exercises &quot;achieve the positive results&quot;, and thoroughly think through what I have learned and experienced.  I would then integrate them into <BR>my being before returning to the system I was originally performing.  One needs to develop their own eclectic system, which is comprised of many systems along with their own personal discoveries, to develop their own personal system that a person will be using on a permanent basis.  Needless to say, this process takes much work and time.<br />From Health Research Books in Pomeroy, WA which can be found on the Web by typing in &quot;Health Research Books&quot; in a search engine, I recommend the following:<br />The Science of Being Set for $58.50 as well Hilton Hotema's works on <br />Ancient Secret of Personal Power: Tetragrammaton ($11.30), The Magic Wand ($11.30), and Man's Higher Consciousness ($23.60).  <br />Fersen's Works allows one to contact Universal Life Energy to assist one in solving financial and health problems as well as allow one to develop their own latent powers.<br />Hotema's works allow one to access their spiritual centers to solve practically any health problem.<br />From Robert Collier Publications in Oak Harbor, WA which can be found on the web by typing Robert Collier Publications in a search engine or a bookseller, I recommend:<br />&quot;The Secret of the Ages&quot; and &quot;Riches within your Reach (The Law of the Higher Potential)&quot;.  These two books allow one to develop their own latent powers as well as better understand the full meaning of past experiences and solutions in overcoming present hurdles.<br />Finally, if these books are out of stock, I have had good luck purchasing used books at the Abebooks web site.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|This Soundtrack is very good, but... if there were more of the movie music score, that would've been 5 stars. As the score from the movie was fantastic.  Anyone know if such a CD would be coming out?
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Some of the plots turns are random and manufactured, and the suspense is weak and sometimes predictable. But this is a decent heist flick.<br />The acting's weak, the dialogue weaker, and the plot thin. Norton's better in _The Score_, Wahlberg's better even in _Boogie Nights_, and Green's better even in _Austin Powers_.<br />But the venice canal chase scene is nice, the heists planned outnumber those executed, and Charlize is easy on the eye.
B000023VR6|4.0|While the Chronic 2001 is an excellent album, one must ask is it anything like the chronic before it? The answer is no and that is why i gave it 4 stars. <br />The album does have some decent cuts such as Xxplosive, Whats the differance&quot; and the extremely emotional Message. but there are too many skits and too many guest appearances from 2nd rate rappers (although snoop, devin, em, and this new gut hittman shine). It also suffers because of the lack of g-funkness that made the chronic so party-ready. <br />Is the album the best, absolutely not. The chronic was for warm summer nights and 2001 seems to be for a cold winter
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|This album is great, but there are some important differences between the International and American versions: the American version is missing the Prime Minister's and Portuguese Love Themes (two of the three instrumentals from the film). I'm ordering up the international version instead.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I vividly remember the release of Sleeping Beauty. I was old enough to go see it myself - just barely.  There I was sitting way up front eating my popcorn and all of a sudden this spectacular dragon materialized right before my eyes.  Popcorn forgotten, I was hooked.  Cartoons never looked the same to me, and I spent the rest of my life inhaling fantasy and science fiction on a quest for the same thrill.<br />Animation has changed quite a bit in the ensuing years, but even today Sleeping Beauty is a towering achievement.  Now I'm more sensitive to the tricks of the art and can see the masterful use of perspective that made the scenes leap out at you.  When I first picked up this DVD I half expected to be disappointed, to find it really wasn't so glorious in retrospect.  This is hardly the case - this film is just as vibrant and alive as it was in 1959.<br />The added dimension now is that I can see how Disney's work was a formative influence on animation even today.  Artist/Directors like Miyazaki owe much to this film and its predecessor Snow White.  And they freely admit it.  As a production, Sleeping Beauty created a sense of legitimacy for animation that proved that high quality animation was something well beyond the Saturday morning funnies.<br />Disney took a great risk when creating this film, pouring a tremendous amount of resources in making it something as perfect as was possible for his time.  While the studio reaped the financial benefits, the audience was the real winner, as a whole genre exploded before our eyes.  Even now, with anime rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, this film stands out for story, art, and music.<br />The additional features, especially those that retell the making of the film, are excellent as well.  All captures in fine detail on this DVD.  This is a must see for anyone who still loves a fairy tale.
0385504209|5.0|Not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  The great thing about this book is that it's one of those books that gets you excited about reading and the subject material.  After reading this book I wanted to get my hands on anything related to Da Vinci and Jesus Christ's origins that I could.  It ultimately led me to read several other books and watch a bunch of TV specials just try and recapture the enjoyment I got from reading it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|The very first time I heard this Cd I took it out from the library, and I must admit that back then, I didn't like it. I thought it was just too sexual.<br />Three months passed and one day I decided to watch all of her videos at msn.com. When I was done a part of me said that I had to buy and really listen the lyrics. When I did, I was amazed. It is one of THE most beautiful albums ever. It is personal, it is human. It says the truth.<br />I truly think that you will love the cd IF you begin to put aside her stereotypes, and please erase all previous concepts you had about her. She is not the same person. Don't expect a CD filled with up-beat, meaningless song; because if you do you will feel very disappointed that you purchased it.<br />There's not more to be said but to say that this is a Cd created from the soul and for the soul.<br />Jess ;)
B00005JM0B|4.0|This movie has a finality about it and coinciding with Arnold been selected to become the Governor of California definitely puts the nails in the coffin once and for all.  Here, The Director manages to convey to the audience about the inevitable, that is irrespective of how much young John O'Connor tried to avoid Judgement Day, he can't change his destiny.  Here, we are introduced to his future wife, in the form of feisty Claire Dane from &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; fame.  These days, it seemed like all action movies tried to outdo one another in car chase scenes as we have witnessed in Matrix Reloaded, Bad Boys 2, 2Fast 2 Furious, and what we have here is just as good, if not better than the one in Judgement Day.  A lot of my mates told me that Judgement Day is simply a more superior offering.  I concurred to certain extent.  Perhaps, this movie lacked of James Cameron's clinical direction of the movie but Jonathan Mostow opted not to go head to head with James' style.  Rather, he went for the joyride, pop-corn style with lots of actions and memorable but hillarious one-liners.  I disagree with some critics who said that this is simply a repetition of Judgement Day with the nemesis replaced by a female version.  On the contrary, I see this movie completely from a different light.  Rather, it's simply an entertaining movie that promised to deliver &amp; it delivered well.  Definitely enjoyable to watch &amp; a movie that I wouldn't hesitate recommend to other viewers!
B00009UW0N|1.0|The most overrated horror movie ever,Michael Myers kills his sister and on Halloween 1978,he returns to kill his other sister Laurie a babysitter,she must protect her kid she is babysitting before Michael kills them both.The plot is original and the movie dosen't need gore to be scary,but this boring low budget mess is not worth it,The Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition DVD is alright but lacking deleted scenes.Don't waste your money on a rental or buying.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Note that John Lennon's first two post-Beatles albums, the classic &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; and the classic &quot;Imagine&quot;, were produced by Phil Spector. Note that George Harrison's first post-Beatles solo album, the classic &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, was produced by Phil Spector. These votes of confidence suggest to me that both John Lennon and George Harrison were satisfied with the work Phil Spector did on the last Beatles album. <br />It's a strange thing, by the way, that Paul McCartney should set himself up as the Beatles custodian. After all, John Lennon quit the group so as to be finally rid of McCartney, and George Harrison and Ringo Starr agreed to dissolve it after John Lennon announced his departure with, to a considerable extent, similar motives in mind. The break-up of the Beatles was essentially a forced removal of Paul McCartney from the group; if Paul McCartney had quit (they should be so lucky), the Beatles would probably have continued as a group for several years without him. (In a sense they did: John Lennon's first post-Beatles album had Ringo playing drums and Klaus Voorman playing drums on every track as well as Billy Preston playing piano on one track. John Lennon's second post-Beatles album used George Harrison playing lead guitar on several tracks, including &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;, as well as, again Klaus Voorman playing bass on every track. George Harrison played lead guitar on and co-wrote Ringo's first hit single, &quot;It Don't Come Easy&quot;. And so on.) In any case, a custodian who is continually rewriting history is hardly a trustworthy one. (The rewriting started almost immediately: Paul McCartney secretly recorded a solo album--a home-made affair to ensure secrecy--and released it in competition with the real &quot;Let it Be&quot; accompanied by a press release he'd fashioned that falsely claimed he, Paul McCartney, had quit the Beatles. His rewriting of Beatles history reached its stride, however, after--almost immediately after--John Lennon's murder.)

B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes have created the best album of the year with &quot;Elephant&quot;. No other band out there today can compare with the originality, sound and simple yet perfect songwriting of Jack White. He shows time and time again on this album that he can write the perfect combination of blues, rock, country and folk, often in the same tune. Filled with endless hooks, nearly every song on this album could be a hit single. This is a disc for people who love music, and forget what good old rock and roll really sounds like. The White Stripes have now officially emerged from the pack of &quot;The&quot; bands (Strokes, Hives, Sounds, Raveonettes...) as the leaders, and a force to be reckoned with in the music business. Truly a masterpiece, five stars all the way.
B00004U8JU|3.0|I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the video transfer on this 'Collector's Edition.'  Yes the sound DTS sound is great, but the poor quality video transfer is just flat-out terrible on my progressive scan television.  It's not my hardware - most of the movies I own look terrific in 480p.<br />Grainy and pixilated, the transfer quality looks more like an Asian VCD knockoff.  By far the worst looking in my collection.  If you're collecting DTS versions, by all means get it, but be prepared for a less than stellar video performance.
B000002H33|5.0|Simply put, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is the greatest metal album of all time, and should be considered in the same breath as other rock classics like &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. It is that great. Absolute thrash, from the fury of &quot;Battery&quot; right until the blazing speed of &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot;, this album barely lets you stop for air. The mid-song buildup of &quot;Orion&quot; could be considered one of the most classic pieces of music in rock history, and no song on the album dissapoints. This album reinforced the fact that James Hetfield could churn out amazing guitar riff after amazing riff, and Kirk Hammett could play with the most speed and detail of any other metal axeman out there. The songwriting is complex, the songs intricate, the lyrics powerful, truly timeless. For those who consider themselves Metallica fans since the Black album, it is more than important to go back and listen to Master, to know where the band has come from, and to know an absolute masterpiece. In the metal world, this album has achieved its lofty status for a reason, and for ages to come, will probably be known as the standard to which all other thrash albums will be compared. The best work of Metallica, and the best this genre of music has put out. Must have.

Synth <BR>to the max with unforgiv<BR>ing drums, dreamy <BR>acoustics and mystic <BR>vocals, it's all rather too <BR>decorative to ever be <BR>haunting. There are some <BR>moments _ the wonder<BR>ful opener From East to <BR>West and the entrancing <BR>Page of Cups _ where <BR>things are beautifully <BR>soothing and even <BR>majestic. But it then slips <BR>into cheesy-as-Stilton <BR>territory with the &quot;oms&quot; <BR>on Incognito and alarm<BR>ing lyrics to wince at, <BR>such as &quot;My heart goes <BR>boom boom boom <BR>boom, every time I think <BR>of you&quot;. Some enigma.
B00006RINF|4.0|All in all I liked this album, though I want to mention something that the other reviews hasn't mentioned. I have realized that the lead singer Cristina, sounds allot like the lead singer of &quot;Guano Apes&quot;. <br />No one has picked up on that. Given I know that they are entirely different bands, and different vocalist's, but, I guess in my own little world they sound similar.<br />Next, I saw the reviews comparing &quot;Lacuna Coil&quot; with &quot;Evanessence&quot;, and let me say, that they are nothing alike. The dumbass who said that they are a spinoff should quit asking his mommy to write his reviews for him, and then go screw himself.<br />I liked the &quot;Fallen&quot; album, but in all honesty, ALL THE SONGS BY EVANESSENCE SOUND THE SAME. Amy Lee does have a great voice, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY FRIGGIN RANGE. <br />To sum up, this album kicks ass, and if you are really into Amy Lee, despite her not being able to change her voice range, and despite the fact that the rest of the band plays all their songs so that it's hard to tell them apart, then by allmeans go get &quot;Fallen&quot;. In short Buy this Album.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Every official Beatles release must receive approval from all people with a controlling interest in Apple.  Not just Paul, but of course Ringo, as well as Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison.  Can Paul personally assume control of Beatles product and do whatever he wants?  No.  What he does on his solo releases (i.e.- the songwriting credit reversal on Back in the U.S.) is his own perogative, but that's simply not the case with Beatles releases.<br />Ringo's statements of approval regarding &quot;Let It Be Naked&quot; have equalled Paul's.  That said, this is in fact a case of revisionist history that is very dissapointing.  But the blame should fall on everyone who okayed it.  It's sad that John and George aren't here anymore, but this Paul-bashing has just gotten out of control.<br />The best thing that can be said about this release is that it shows how much better sonically the Beatles music can sound when remastered.  Apple is doing Beatlefans the world over a great disservice by not overhauling the catalog, originally mastered for CD in 1987.  Instead of remixing, re-editing, etc, albums like &quot;Let It Be&quot;, the priority should be on getting the full original catalog sounding as pristine as humanly possible- while preserving the ORIGINAL mixes (both mono and stereo where applicable).  The music on &quot;Naked&quot; has a much richer bass end and greatly improved clarity.  But this could've been achieved without mucking with the tracklist and such.<br />Why couldn't they have done a remastered edition of the original album on disc one, and filled up disc two with alternate takes and rehearsal material?  Why couldn't they have released the two Glyn Johns original &quot;Get Back&quot; album mixes, which at least have actual historical significance?  Why couldn't we have had the complete rooftop concert on disc two?  Why this, why that- it isn't going to get us anywhere, though I think fans would've preferred any of those ideas to this.  <br />The &quot;Bonus Disc&quot; is interesting at the very least, but why stop at 20 minutes?  It's ridiculous when you consider the oodles of recorded material from these sessions (most, if not all, of it available on bootlegs).  Would anyone complain if the selection was haphazard?  Maybe some would, but I think many more would agree with me when I say that it would've been nice to have ANY complete performances on the &quot;bonus disc&quot; in addition to the dialogue snippets.  Having heard a good amount of the material from these sessions, I know that much of it is uninspired and just plain boring-- but by including some complete songs or jams, we'd at least get a good representation of what the session were really like.<br />I've gone on far too long.  I just want to say I think it's highly unfair to point the finger solely at Paul.
0060920432|4.0|While I do not agree with Csikszentmihalyi's philosophy or religious positions, I think he has some valid insights on the process of creativity. In writing on the internal rewards of creativity, he says &quot;There is no question that to survive, and especially to survive in a complex society, it is necessary to work for external goals, and to postpone immediate gratifications....The solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one's own powers.&quot; One such system of internal rewards is the enjoyment of accomplishing something creatively. He says such an experience can become a positive addiction.<br />In the flow experience, one loses a sense of self in that one expands beyond self to an &quot;undreamed of state&quot; of consciousness. One is lost in one's work. &quot;Everything the body can do is potentially enjoyable&quot; he tell us. He quotes Thomas Carlyle saying, &quot;Blessed is he who has found his work; let him ask no other blessedness.&quot;<br />There are some highly useful insights in this wonderful book. He causes you to realize overcoming obstacles is not the exception, but the expectation in life. Flow is the process whereby creatively overcoming challenges is redefined in a positive perspective.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|This release just validates the fact that Phil Spector added a lot to the original version.  &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; are all better on the 1970 release.  It also validates to me who was the primary ego that broke up the group.  This is embarrassing.<br />Maybe one day Ringo will have the opportunity behind Paul's back to re-do lightweight songs like &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; and add drum tracks to them.
B00004XOWM|2.0|I loved Limp bizkit i nthe days of three dollar bill ya'lll and half the songs oof of signifigant other but what is this! it seems like a poser rappers album the only reason i didn't rate it one star is theres one or 2 decent songs but thats it, i  feel that Lb is going down the mainstream road and it pisses the sh*t out of me they had so much potential! and im dissapointed in them.No wonder Wes left the band he wanted to rock he wanted to play metal!!!!!! SO fred stop worrying about britney spears and go back to your roots.
B000002UAR|2.0|I read where &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; was Paul's attempt to write a song as good as &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by Brian Wilson on Pet Sounds.  I'd say that the word &quot;attempt&quot; accurately describes the effort.  Who knows, maybe someone will &quot;re-produce&quot; it one day to change the song to their taste.<br />As for the rest of this album, Taxman stands out the most.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|back in the day you used to have to have talent to get a recording contract<BR>these days hell if i know<BR>i am a true music fan <BR>i love music like you people do<BR>but <br />to say this is music is insulting to my intelligence<BR>i am a music major<BR>and to get a recording contract you need four of the following <BR>qualities<BR>1. you must be able to carry a tune britney cannot whatsoever<BR>2. you must be able to play instruments britney cannot whatsoever<BR>3. you must have songwriting talents i know britney co wrote some of the songs but her song writing talent is horrific at best<BR>4. you have to have intelligence which britney does not have whatsoever she is a airhead with no brains at all<BR>music was good up until 1989 after that forget it i gave up!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|My two favorite groups, The Beatles and Deep Purple have put out new albums.<BR>One is pretty good and one is excellent. Let It Be... Naked (yes, we are living in a Britney/Madonna world) is a stripped down version (no strings &amp; no horns) of the original 1970 classic. The songs are also in a new running order and have been digitally remixed to sound...AMAZING! The clarity is just breathtaking.  It sounds as if the Beatles are playing right in your living room. Great production job! It is less about Phil Spector and more about moving the Beatles into the 21st century. But, as a few of the critics before me said: Nothing really NEW is on this release. Which leads me to BANANAS, a great NEW album by another legendary band... Deep Purple. This album is so strong from first song to last it simply blew me away and I have not been too thrilled with their last couple albums. Great songs, excellent musicianship, terrific arrangements and a wonderful production. Singer, Ian Gillan still sounds great after all these years. BRAVO DP!!! <BR>Naked: 3 stars<BR>Bananas: 5 stars
B000127LW2|5.0|i got this from a friend of mine ... your local store... and this is the best it has it all if your gone to buy anything buy this PS I got it 3 Months before it was scuduled to come out so ha Enjoy the wait!...
B0000E1ALR|5.0|My two favorite artists (Deep Purple and the Boss) have NEW releases and both were birthday gifts and both are great. <BR>Bruce essentials IS a no brainer, but BANANAS by Deep Purple was a pleasant surprise. BRAVO DP!!! <br />Essential Springteen: 5 stars<BR>Bananas/Deep Purple: 5 stars
076790592X|5.0|I bought two books..Tuesday with Morrie and Nightmares Echo. I was enlightened by both. What a wonderful experience to get to different and unique books and yet both telling a story that are compelling. I highly recommend This book. Every person should read this.
B000002NBY|5.0|Paul Simon is and was an extremely under-apreciated, musical genius, and Graceland is an often overlooked work of art.  It is an exploration of African music and an incredibly rare bridge between our culture and theirs.  Every single song on the album has a good reason for its  being there.  Every single song, from the joyous opening song \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" to the beautiful \\"Diamonds on the Souls of her Shoes\\" to the gratifying concluding song \\"All Around the World,\\" is its own masterpiece.  They all come together to make one of the greatest collections of music I 've ever heard.  I highly reccomend Graceland to anyone and everyone who has even the slightest interest in Paul Simon, Folk/Rock music, or African music.  Anyone else should at least consider buying this masterpiece.
6302765536|5.0|I loved this one, Harry and Marv get messed up really bad.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Every second is beautiful. Play it over and over again and be amazed at how it somehow becomes more beautiful.
B000069AUI|5.0|There isn't really anything to be said for this album that hasn't already been said many many times before. At this point I'm just writing this out of respect for this work and that I feel it can never get enough praise. <br />I loved Parachutes. It was a great album, and set the stage for what Rush of Blood would be. Everything that Parachutes was, is ten times better on this, their sophomore release. The experimentation factor is through the roof, and it manages to produce some of the most fulfilling tracks to be pressed in many many years.<br />Basically it comes down to this: Listen to Clocks, Green Eyes, and Amsterdam. If after absorbing these you aren't convinced, then there's really no hope for you. This is easily one of my favorite albums ever and absolutely everyone should check it out.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|She sounds great! Her voice is mature and deep.  She sounds like the woman she is.  This CD is better than Just Whitney.  Her voice is more like My Love is your love.  She still sings loops around other singers.  Her voice is not as young sounding, It is deeper and richer.  My favorite track is&quot;O Come Emmauel.<br />#1Whitney fan, NYC
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful discs of plastic I have ever owned.  When I read other reviews, I am confused as to why people are disappointed that this album fails to bring anything new to your ears.  Well, personally being someone who listed to &quot;Is This It&quot; everyday or so for about 2 years, I can definately tell you that there was a HUGE evolution in the sound.  Even if there wasn't to some; the music is near perfection, I'm not sure what exactly The Strokes should have done to make people happy.  I think people listened to this album already skeptical.  I haven't liked a band this much since Nirvana, just awesome :).  Beautiful album, definately a classic.
B0000039PW|5.0|\\"Ready To Die\\", Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album, is the most complete album of his short discography. While his 2-disc opus \\"Life After Death\\" in 1997 was indeed an ambitious album, \\"Ready To Die\\" is simply stronger and more captivating. While \\"Ready To Die\\" is not one of the best albums ever recorded by all means, it is a landmark force to be reckoned with. <br />Lyrically, Biggie was several notches above average. His rhymes and wordplay were complex, and his subject matter was introspective, autobiographical and significant on tracks such as \\"Things Done Changed\\", \\"Respect\\", and \\"Everyday Struggle\\" respectively. At times, he would be braggadocios regarding his assets sin life, such as his pimp game, how dope an emcee he was and such (this can be heard on tracks such as \\"Unbelievable\\", \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" and \\"Big Poppa\\"). His lyrics were indeed great, but I find myself more captivated by his intense and riveting delivery. Booming vocal tones are evident on this album, especially on tracks such as \\"Juicy\\" and \\"Gimmie The Loot\\". Overall, he had lyrical proficiency and talent that is perfectly utilized on \\"Ready To Die\\". <br />The production on this album is mostly great. Easy Moe Bee produced a lot of the cuts, and DJ Premier, Puff Daddy, and the Trackmasters make contributions as well.<br />Standouts: \\"Things Done Changed\\" is a powerful track where Biggie first reminisces on his life in Brooklyn and how good it was before crime and violence crept in and deteriorated it to the point where it simply wasn't safe to live in. Biggie's complex lyrics, yet simple storytelling is nothing short of spectacular. His wordplay is second to none here (\\"Instead of a Mac-10 he tried scrapping/Slugs in his back and, that's what the f**k's happening\\"). The production is nothing to scoff at, with a scarce drum-loop, horns, jazzy sprinkled piano keys and some restrained but audible violins. There is a sample of Dr. Dre speaking fitting words of wisdom for the track. \\"Gimmie The Loot\\" utilizes a concept where Biggie plays two characters. The story involves two hoodlums going on a robbing spree and eventually being infiltrated by the police. This is a largely interesting cut. First off, the interactions between Biggie and himself with a high-pitched voice are darkly humorous. He managed to fool me to the first time I heard it. The lyrics are top-notch, though they are brutal to the point where there some of it is edited. The production is simple, but good. It consists of a loud drum-loop, some suspenseful flutes, a catchy guitar-flick, strangled trumpets, and a hard bassline. There is a sample of Guru after the second verse. \\"Warning\\" has a similar concept with Biggie playing both characters, one of which is on the phone. It's a narrative where a friend warns Biggie in the middle of the night over his pager that his peers are becoming jealous of them to the point where they want to raid his crib, kill him, and steal his possessions, making Biggie prepare himself for anyone attempting to rob him. There is a mixture of riveting narrative, story telling, and braggadocio, though marred slightly by a predictable outro skit. It's not completely straightforward, but it works all the same. The beat is one of the hottest on here, with an organ-lick, a loud drum-loop, assorted guitars, and a thumping bassline. The title track is one of the darker songs that Biggie did in his career. The haunting, intensely violent lyricism is depressing to say the least and it definitely works (Sample: \\"In a sec I throw the tec to your neck/Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some wreck/Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking/You better act like CeCe, and keep on walking/When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat/You swung a left you swung a right you fell to the concrete/Your face, my feet, they meet, we're stomping<BR>I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton\\"). The track mainly succeeds due to the amazing beat with a dark church organ, a loud drum-loop, an amazing guitar flick, and occasional scratching. \\"The What?\\" features Method Man and the two spit verses trying to outdo each other. It's a dope, unforgettable collaboration. You decide for yourself who is better. The production is surprisingly melodic, with synthesizers, some catchy keyboard effect, bass, and a drum-loop. \\"Juicy\\" is probably has the best lyrics on the album, with complex rhyming, honesty and introspection. The Trackmasterz produced this cut. \\"Everyday Struggle\\" has a really hot melodic beat with an opening rhythm that I've probably heard somewhere on a kid's children show when I was young. This isn't helpful, but this particular rhythm fire, accompanied by jazzy, mournful trumpets, a perfect drum-loop, and piano keys. The lyrics have to do with Biggie's drug-dealing times, and his hardships with this profession. The chorus is a definite standout. \\"Big Poppa\\" is a refreshing change of pace, with laid-back macking lyrics. The Trackmasterz beat is a standout, with an Isley Brothers sample and a loud and complex drum-loop. \\"Unbelievable\\" is a braggadocio cut, with dope, unimportant lyrics with excellent rhymes. DJ Premier's production is banging, so be sure you hear this track. \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\" is the disturbing finale where Biggie speaks to Puff Daddy over the phone about his contemplation of suicide. In doing this, he is introspective, socially conscious and truthful. This is scenario immediately followed up on the intro of \\"Life After Death\\". This track has the best beat.<br />No, I don't regard Biggie as the best emcee who ever lived, in fact I believe that he may have lost serious respect if he lived and continued to work through the years of Puff Daddy's rein of bling-bling rap. But this is unimportant. Biggie's album is highly recommended by me to all. Overall, Ready To Die is an absorbing album with many standouts. <br />Overall rating: 4.8 stars.<br />If you like this album, I would also recommend \\"AZ's \\"Doe Or Die\\"
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This c.d. is definitley her best out of all the other ones. This one she sounds more mature and relaxed. Not everyone has to sound like Christina Aguilera or Mariah Carey to make it in the music industry, and obviously tons of people adore Britney because she has been making albums. I really like the ballads on here, she shows more of an adult side to her rather than the typical love song like she used to sing when she first bursted onto the scene. I really like this c.d. and hopefully she'll make plenty more!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill Volume 1 is a cinematic masterpiece. Its the most exciting and daring Hollywood film I've personally ever seen in my life. 60s/70s Grindhouse Cinema is Kill Bill's roots, but as those roots grew they transformed into something brand new that Ive never seen before in a movie.<BR> <BR>The film is a work of cinematic art only a guy named Quentin Tarantino could create. A cinema lover long obsessed with the pop art films of Sergio Leone, Brian DePalma, Chang Cheh, Lucio Fulci, Kenji Fukasaku and Mario Bava to just name a select few. A guy who loved the down and dirty Grindhouse-Drive In films of the 1960s and 1970s growing up. Tarantino has created something that has surpassed the original written script (which I read and LOVED). The visuals along with the music will boil your adrenaline. Kill Bill is a testament to what a true love of cinema can bring to the screen. As opposed to popular belief, Its NOT about making the AFI Top 100 List or winning shiny awards. Its about LOVING CINEMA in all its forms. Thats EXACTLY what you get when you pay to see a Tarantino film. <br />The Kill Bill story is very simple. Its the standard spaghetti western or kung fu Revenge plot. But that \\"plot\\" is only the framework to hold something much richer and deeper. You could say Kill Bill is an exercise in highly stylized cinema, and it DEFINITELY is that, but Tarantino has also brought something else to it: Heart and Soul. <br />Kill Bill has audible languages in it (including Japanese), but the one language that QT speaks fluently and perfectly himself is the language of cinema. Its in every shot, every scene. Running through the film like a river.<br />Kill Bill deserves all its praise and for real film fans like myself, its great to see someone in love with making movies as much as Tarantino.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I never saw the theatrical version and DON'T want to. First time through extended version was interesting (to say the least) due to the changing of some parts from book; but after seeing the appendiceses, it made sense the second time around. Most excellent on P. Jackson's direction.  Remember, it is very hard to make a movie out of a book this huge but he has succeeded with this movie. I can't wait for the extended version of &quot;Return of the King&quot;.  I always want what the director intended and not the &quot;suits&quot; in H.W.  Also don't fall for the &quot;gag/toy&quot; gift versions either.  Get the extended version always. Your friend/family will sooner or later appreciate it.  Maybe P.J. could do &quot;The Hobbit&quot; also.
0142000663|5.0|Steinbeck is the best American writer of his time.  His power of observation is amazingly acute.  Recommended reading for anyone interested in understanding the depression era.
B000002KIE|5.0|This album may seem pretty weak today, but thats only because you are most likely comparing it to bands that wouldnt even be around if it wasnt for the pistols. In its time it was revolutionary. This band has spawned many other great bands, although unfortunately, for every good band, about five teeny pop rock bands spring up. Nevertheless, the sex pistols produced some amazing songs, such as anarchy in the UK, God save the queen. And never mind the bollocks all the other people keep saying about them (Im very, very, very, very sorry for that) they could play their instruments (except Sid), proof of this can be seen in pretty vacant (which is by far their best song) where they open with a great sounding guitair solo. Sure the sex pistols lyrics and message may seem pretty tame by todays standards, but in its time it was outright shocking.<br />Buy this if you like real punk rock, or just real rock in general, dont buy this if the heaviest thing you listen to is pop rock where a bunch of bored teenagers with stupid hair sing about how much they hate school (not that I have anything against bored teenagers who hate school, I am one in actual fact).
B00009TB5G|5.0|You can probably tell that I like this DVD.  Well, duh.  It's a little bit hard to not appreciate this DVD and all its awesome features. Just looking at the cover of it makes you go 'aaahhh'. The added scenes, I think, (well, maybe except for the Ent Song scene), make the movie 200% better.  Gollum trying to eat lembas bread (aka &quot;hobbit food&quot;) makes me laugh my head off.<BR>  I haven't even watched all of the special features yet, since I just got it yesterday, but oooh dude, believe me, I will.  The little I have watched is SO awesome--it makes the special features on the original 2-disc version look like nothing.  <BR> I really appreciated seeing the documentary on why they made the changes that they did in the movie.  Now I understand more why Shelob's not in it and why Faramir is so different.  I mean, you're probably thinking 'woopdeedoo, throw a party' but, you know, it's how I feel.<BR>  But dude, watching this whole movie now takes three hours and forty or so minutes, and let me say, it's exhausting.  But so what, you know?<BR> DO I RECOMMEND THE TWO TOWERS SPECIAL EXTENDED DVD VERSION?  YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT! CLICK 'ADD TO SHOPPING CART' NOW! NOW! COME ON, CLICK!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an outstanding depiction of a company of soldiers in the 101st Airborne in World War II. It is produced in the unusually realistic style of Saving Private Ryan. The film shows the very humanistic side of war including leadership (at its best and worst), fear, suffering, courage and loyalty. The cinematography is unsurpassed.<br />The film is one of the two best war films I have ever seen and it depicts a time in our American history which makes me well with pride for our fathers, uncles and grandfathers who proved that they could overcome their own fears to literally save the world.<br />I have read reviews like the simplistic and sophomoric review by Ian Cooper and I am reminded of the pacifist Neville Chamberlain who sold Britain out to the early Nazi Tyranny of the war. What branch of the military did you serve in Mr. Cooper that entitles you to even think you understand the dynamics of bravery and patriotism?<br />Want to be proud of our forefathers? See this film, you will be!
B000002BYD|5.0|Thats what this album will make you think, it HITS you hard &amp; keeps moving you in such different ways until the very end... itll take you through dark songs, angry songs, wishful songs, freedom songs.... there's not one bad song on the album, you HAVE to get this, probably the best 90s album
B0000YEEGM|3.0|This is my favorite movie, and the dvds that I've got so far of this movie are all really empty on extra material. This one;<BR>1. The commentaires- Barry, Barry and Ronald. Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman should've had put commentaires on there too. That would be very nice, 'cause the entire movie is about these two guys!<BR>2. The deleted scene of them in K-mart, that's very nice and all but hey! ONE?!<BR>3. The photogallery. Nothing bad about that.<BR>4. The behind the scenes show, great. But I sure hope it's not the one from AMC!<BR>So you see, I don't think this has the right to be called a special edition, when there's just a few small changes from the other dvds I've purchased!<BR>'COURSE THIS IS DEFINITLY STILL THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER, DEFINITLY!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|With the release of \\"One Wish,\\" Whitney has proven once again that she is more than equipped at effortlessly singing any style of music.  Her luscious vocal cords wrap themselves around such holiday classics as \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" with such emotive grace that it will leave the listener stunned in amazement.  She not only conveys the meaning of each song with her vocalizations, but she finds the HEART and graciously transports us to another place... far, far away.  On more religious offerings such as \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel,\\" and \\"O' Holy Night,\\" Whitney outdoes herself with spinetingling interpretations that are AWE-INSPIRING.  <br />Whitney Houston is THE Premier vocalist of her generation.  <br />Easily a ***** star album.
B00005JM02|1.0|The video was beyond stupid. It was idiotical. The story begins like this. Marlin and his fish partner, have baby clownfishes. However, before the eggs can hatch, a baracuda comes and kills the mother and eats the eggs. However, the Baracuda misses eating one egg. Marlin (the father) names the egg Nemo. Marlin is very concerned about protecting Nemo. On the first day of fish school, the father attempts to convince his son to stay home for another year, but to no aveal.  <BR>   On the first day of school, Nemo and his friends, although I would call them acquaintances, are playing together. The teacher is nowhere is sight. Nemo's friends dare each other to get as close as they can to the butt. (The butt was really a boat, but Eisner HAD to add that detail so kids can go around saying. \\"I dare yay to touch the Butt.\\") <BR>   Well, Nemo disobeys his father and gets closer to touching the boat or butt if you prefer. Nemo's dad tries to threaten Nemo to return, but Nemo's dad (like Eisner) fails to realize that threatening makes kids, or in this case fish, more apt to disobey then beforehand. Nemo touches the boat, and a diver captures Nemo. Nemo's dad tries to save him, but to no aveal. The boat speeds away with Nemo on it. <BR>   Like all Eisner vidoes, everyone always turns out all right, and the bad guys, or jellyfish, are defeated. However, how and were Nemo's dad finds Nemo is something you will have to discover for yourself. <BR>   However, I was very disappointed with the plot line. In one phrase, one fish says, \\"Don't you realize that you are swimming in your own shi(the starfish cuts in, so as not to say the \\"T\\"). Half the fish in this video are morons, and the other half cool. The only thing this video teaches is that you can do anything you put you mind to doing. I wonder if that counts in shooting a rifle at three, or defying gravity by believing you can. Eisner forgot to specify that. <BR>   This video does not teach any good character traits. The \\"ho ho hehe\\" chant gave me a headache. I would not recommend this video to anyone. The actors, effects, and scenery are the only pluses to this horrible motion picture.

1563894696|5.0|This novel was astounding! <br />\\"Halloween\\" was a great read for me. I have liked Batman since the 1989 movie came out, but more in a childish way until a few months ago. By childish, I mean that, I liked the toungue and cheek 60's show and the motion pictures. I even followed the Animated Series. When Batman Beyond came out, I lost interest. After a three year hiatus from the Dark Knight, I went into a local book store and picked up \\"Cataclysm\\" which opened up an entire new world of Batman for me. On to the review:<br />I read the book in two days, and that's long for a comic book. This book takes place in what I think to be Batman's second year in the cape and cowl. The story is phenominal, a classic murder tale of a crime family member being killed every major holiday. Batman and Catwoman's relationship grows stronger, Harvey Dent starts to dive into what he is now, the Two Face, and Captain Gordon's struggle to spend time with his family while solving a year long murder.<br />I would STRONGLY reccomend buying this book after you have read Batman : Year One by Frank Miller. Some of this story will make more sense to you as the reader.<br />I also would suggest buying the following Batman books:<br />Batman Year One<BR>Dark Victory<BR>Robin Year One<BR>Batgirl Year One<BR>The Killing Joke<br />Cataclysm<BR>No Man's Land<BR>and the classic<BR>The Dark Knight Returns<br />I had no idea Batman could be so cool and dark. This story tells you what Batman really is like.<br />Hope you like it as much as I did.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|It's a must buy.  It's slightly less accessible then its predecessor, but after a few listens the songs flow together great.  This is my second favorite album of the year right behind Radiohead's &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;.<br />A lot of people criticize the Strokes for not evolving their music in the past 2 years, but they really are doing what they do best - making great songs with catchy hooks, mixed with the outstanding laid back vocal stylings of Julian Casablancas.<br />This one is definitely worth the money!!
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth`s latest relise, Damnation, is nothing but a journey into a dreamy atmospheric world with a melodius sound. The music runs deep because of the mellow sound they have createt on this album.<BR>It`s a different, more accustic Opeth this than on the other records. Without gruff singing it becomes superior for my ears, her the singer sings mellow,harmonic and it`s just wonderfull to listen to.So are you looking for a chill out sone to relax to this is the album for you. Great songs on this record I think is: Windowpane, In my time of need, To rid the disease, Ending credits, Weakness and rest of the album, because this hole album is superior.
B00005Q3KC|1.0|It was 2001, Christmas time was coming and it means also a gift time... and flooding of music market with a variety of compilations started. Also The Corrs took part. It's so simple! Just record two new songs, add some remixes and the rest stuff with songs that were released sevral times on studio albums - there's always someone to buy it! Well, if a &quot;best of&quot; is released by some music group that has been together for twenty years, for example - it's not my cup of tea, anyway, but The Corrs after just six years in showbussiness... I can't name it but money-drawing, stupid and commercial act. Only two (!!!) tracks of 18 are new, then there is one remix and the rest is all the material we know well, some as &quot;radio edit&quot; (it sounds the same, just a bit shorter than standard version). The artists usually claim that the &quot;best of&quot; is for the new fans. And what about us, the old??? After this act, people, don't be surprised that MP3 spreading via P2P is growing quickly, because not everyone has enough money to buy the same just to get two new songs... What's more, Would You Be Happier and Make You Mine are, hm, well, average - considerating the Corrs musical abilities... And I think that then release of Non-LP and bonus tracks would be much more welcomed, because they are still sought-after as well for all those who are not Japanese. I'd like to rate this album by no star, but some might not understand it - so here is one...
B00005OAIE|5.0|yes.. the title of my review says it all. i looooooooove this cd!! it must be one of my favorite cds of all time.. john mayer is awesome.. it's hard to put down in words why i like this cd so much.. all i can say is....very recommended! go get it right now!
B000099T2L|1.0|This album is awful, the only good song worth listening to is be with you. The first single crazy in love gets on my nerves. Believe me don't waste your money on this rubbish.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This CD is a must have for anyone. Regardless if you are a fan of the movies or not the score to this movie should be in anybody's collection. The tracks are well written and paced. Hats off to Howard Shore for doing it once more just as he did with Two Towers and Fellowship. All of the tracks are great to listen to including the final one from Annie Lennox called Into the West. It is different from May it Be and Gollum's Song in a good way. Minas Tirith and Return of the King are defintely worth the price of the CD by themselves to have. I'd give this CD a 10/5 stars if Amazon would let me. Incredible CD. Definitely buy it. You won't be dissapointed!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I agree with the points that critics have been raising.  First of all, I was annoyed with the radio ads and the ABC 20/20 spot for \\"Naked\\" pointing out it was being released without strings and choirs.  When I heard that I thought: That doesn't make sense. What about Anthology and Past Masters?  All the songs have been released \\"naked\\".  Then I saw the CD in a record store with the sticker stating this is \\"the band's cut\\" and I thought: Hold on a minute - as of November 2001, half the band are no longer with us.  How could John and George possibly have approved edits, remixes and track arrangements done in 02 and 03?  Did they hold a seance? I love the Beatles but this is crap of the highest order.  It annoys me that EMI - or whoever - would insult fans by pushing this as something it's not.  As if we didn't know this isn't the first time that LIB songs have been released without Spector's production and as if John and George were participants in this.  To top it all, everyone knows that there was a ton of material recorded during the LIB sessions.  They could have put a lot more material on this and quite frankly, it would have been really cool if they did.  Another reviewer pointed out how that could be done with material that's been released on Anthology 3.  Taking that further, with other material that's found on bootlegs, they could have filled out a full CD, with busking and jamming intermixed with good song takes.  In a way, the original LIB attempted to do that with Dig it and Maggie Mae.  Carrying that idea further to fill out a full CD would have been very cool and would have given the fans more.  Thanks for nothing EMI/Apple.
B000099T2L|3.0|In today's music industry sex sells, there's no getting around it. Unfortunately, that's all that Beyounce Knowles has to offer is her delicious body image. Her slightly raspy voice does not possess the captivating edge that tantalizes the listener to want more. The only song that I like is Baby Boy with Sean Paul. He certainly adds flavor to the single with his accented lyrics.  Beyounce is NOT all that!!!! Maybe she needs to quit the singing business and take up a day job as a model?
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I NEVER THOUGHT, WHEN I PICKED UP MY DVD ON TUESDAY, HOW UTTERLY DELIGHTED I WOULD BE! THE DVD ITSELF IS BEAUTIFULLY PACKAGED, THE PICTURE QUALITY AND DTS SOUND ARE AWESOME AS WELL! THE MOVIE IS WONDERFUL. BRILLIANTLY ACTED BY THE ENTIRE CAST, WITH SOME REALLY JAW DROPPING SPECIAL EFFECTS AND GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY, THIS ONE IS A REAL KEEPER FOR YOUR DVD COLLECTION!  SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN THE FIRST FILM-GO FOR IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED AT ALL-SURE TO BE THE BIG XMAS DVD HIT. GREAT FILM, MR. SINGER...KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've been listening to britney spears since 1999.I have her first three albums,but seriously i never liked most of the songs.All of the potential songs were cut as singles.I've waited a long time for In The Zone and i must say that i expected the same kind of music from Brit but after listening to this CD i was left astonished.She really has changed her musical style and this album proves it.She's experimented with everything from techno to rap to reggae and although many critics seek to belittle her i think her effort was worth it.I have read over 200 reviews from this site and i have come to the conclusion that Britney has definitely changed and it is evident because most of her former fans now resent her music and former \\"Brit -Haters\\" now welcome this new change.True is the fact that you can't please everyone and as time goes by one develops and comes out of his/her shell and that's what happened to Britney,people her age can relate to her music and not everyone wants slow,sad ballads,the two on the album are great ,but what makes this album fun is the fact that it has plenty dance tracks and the music has many influences( the production team did a great job).Every one is busy comparing Britney to Christina Aguilera but a comparison cannot be made because they're two different people with two different personas which are expressed in different ways,where talent is concerned i don't see Britney lacking any ...i only see that people always wish to criticize when they can't be better than their successor.All the trash spoken about Britney is beside the point.Her music isn't as vulgar as it seems,there are many other artists who come out very explicit or as one might say \\"raw\\" on their tracks but somehow don't get enough publicity as Brit does,there are also those who wear next to nothing and have very loose morals and yet no one makes such a big fuss about it as they do when Britney slips up.Give her a break ,her album is very good and i recommend it to party lovers and people who are not afraid to be open with their sexuality.(...)and i think every song is a potential single.She doesn't have a voice that will leave you in awe but her music will surely make you relax and enjoy life a bit.<BR>Me against the music(remix),toxic,shadow,the hook up,everytime,touch of my hand ,showdown and breathe on me are very cool tracks.I give Britney an A for this Cd and hopefully she'll continue her good work.Everyone has their own opinions,but music is meant to be enjoyed and she experimented with alot of different genres,so there's something for everyone.She's almost 22 years old and you can't expect her to be a perfect role model because she's human and she'll make mistakes too.Respect her as an entertainer because she's great at her trade and she's living her dreams(most of us dream but seldom get to live it out ,so be happy for her).Thumbs up for In the zone!
B00008G1KJ|5.0|This is one of the best double albums ever released.  Jimi Hendrix included a very diverse group of songs, from blues to jams to guitar freakouts.  It even includes his only American pop hit, a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower\\".  This is an essential album for Hendrix fans.
0375713751|4.0|This book is written by a woman with a remarkable command of metaphors. I wondered throughout the whole book if Allison Pearson wrote the book, or if her wonderfully talented husband, Anthony Lane, did. The book is witty and touched deeply into the subject of working woman. Being a career woman who left her own job to be home with her childre, Kate Reddy's observations of the sacrifices were right on. Two concerns: until the end I did not like this woman, she was truly an unlikeable person; also I wished the author would have started more sentences with pronouns. The use of verbs to begin a sentences (\\"Ran to store to get hosiery..\\")started to wear on me after a while.
B00007AJF9|1.0|Okay,granted, the costumes were wonderful, but please,HM Elizabeth I would spit on this film. It takes more liberties with her story than should be legally allowed. I will not go into a boring recitation of every fact this movie bastardizes, but Norththumberland was a twit, a brainless, spinless twit who couldnt make up his mind to save his life. To portray him as a 90's style skinhead was just plain wrong. And, there is no proof that Elizabeth slept with Robert Dudley. If you know anything about her psychology, you just know she wouldn't have taken the chance of getting pregnant. This was the 1500's after all. Birth control did not exist. Suffice to say, I hated this film for its inaccuracy and almost blasphemous portrayal of one of the greatest monarchs who ever ruled England. Take my advice and pick a book on the lady, you owe it to yourselves and her to read the truth.
B000000JO3|4.0|I'm not sure if anyone's read it, but there's a review on here saying that Minor Threat are &quot;talentless posers trying to make a quick buck off a passing trend&quot; and that &quot;TRU&quot; punks should stick to &quot;Good Charlotte, blink-182, Green Day, Sum 41, SR-71, and of course, Linkin Park.&quot; Holy sh*t, you are very f**kin' misguided! You seem to be under the impression that Ian McKaye heard Good Charlotte on the radio and said, &quot;I Wanna do that!&quot; and started a talentless band. If you ever read this: this is a collection of hardcore classics from the EARLY 80S! If you listen to Good Charlotte's dismal new album they pay tribute to Minor Threat in their &quot;thanks&quot; sheet and in the song &quot;Riot Girl.&quot; (I don't own their album, it was my old girlfriend's). Everything you're decrying about &quot;Complete Discography&quot; is what makes it REAL, what makes it the essence of PUNK!
B00005QZWJ|5.0|The special limited edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; packages the soundtrack to one of 2001's best films in an elegant and upscale, yet still very affordable, deluxe package. Bound in red leather, it has two parchment-look pockets inside, one containing the CD, the other containing the CD booklet on heavy cardstock paper -- this is one CD booklet that won't be in tatters after a few readings.<br />Unlike so many soundtracks, this one holds up as an album in its own right, with the pastoral hobbit themes -- one of the highlights of the soundtrack for all three movies -- clashing with the dramatic themes accompanying the agents of Mordor. This latter is especially impressive, since John Williams' bombastic Imperial March for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; has set the tone for years for over the top themes for movie villains. In contrast, Howard Shore's music would sound as at home in the concert hall as in a movie theater, while Williams' work is increasingly unable to transcend its origins.<br />Recommended for fans of the LotR movies who want to own a handsome collectable version of the soundtrack.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This may be there most over-rated cd, and it is for a good cause.  It contains the hits &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Geurilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;, &amp; the most under-rated single &quot;Calm Like A Bomb&quot;.  My personal favorite on this album is &quot;War Within A Breath&quot;.  I'm normally not a huge fan of rap-metal but Rage makes it so you want to listen to more and more to Toms aggressive guitar playing.  There are only 2 flaws on this compact disc , but you can easily get around them by listening to them more and more.  I won't say em but I'll let you find that out for yourself.  Here's how I would rate there CD's in order:<br />RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE<BR>THE BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES<BR>EVIL EMPIRE<BR>RENEGADES
B0000DI7UR|4.0|This record is a great improvment over Elements pt1, it has a very good production and good songs overall. Its a shame, Strato used to be my favorite band but in the last 5 years it has go down to the 5th or 6th place in my list (of course X Japan is the best band ever!), all this because of Timo Tolkki leader of the band's childish attitude; Ive heard 3 members will leave the band and i wish the best for them, and the remaining member too, but Timo you can go to hell for screwing one of the most promising bands in metal.<BR>Now lets go to the review:<br />ALPHA &amp; OMEGA (3,5):   I dont mind much about this song,butits ok, i still think Elements should have been only 1 album so all the fillers will get dumped and have the best Strato album, but its done already, so just wait til next record.<br />I WALK TO MY OWN SONG (5,0): First single, similar to Eagleheart, Save our Souls and Hunting High and Low.<br />I'M STILL ALIVE (5,0): Very Good song, sounds a lot like old Strato, will please old fans.<br />SEASON OF FAITH'S PERFECTION (4,5): Reminds me of Visions era ballads, nice effort.<br />AWAKEN THE GIANT (3.0): Boring and overrated, just like Soul Of A Vagabond, this is what u call boring,extremely slow paced metal.<br />KNOW THE DIFFERENCE (4,8): I like the keyboards here, like Find your own voice; i dont know why ppl complain about Koti singing high notes, it doesnt sound that bad.<br />LUMINOUS (4,8): I dont know whats in ppl heads, this is a very good song, just what Strato needs which is exploring new sounds without screwing up, i must say Tolkki did a good job with this song; hope he's as good in attitude as he is writing songs.<br />DREAMWEAVER (4,5): Heavy song, its ok.<br />LIBERTY (5,0): Nice ending for a nice album, very good song not like A Drop in the Ocean which is Celestial Dream pt2<br />Overall rating (4,5)
B00005JKC3|4.0|Director Ang Lee made only one mistake with \\"Hulk\\"--overestimating the intelligence of movie audiences.  This is a sensitive, ambitious, innovative, and moving adaptation of a complex comic book hero.  (...)a movie that has a balance of darkness and light, quiet and noise--a movie that gives you some space to think and breathe.  <br />Eric Bana lets the role take him over: he's very understated, no star trips going on here.  Jennifer Connelly is gorgeous, and her emotion reaches out not only to Bruce Banner but to the audience.  Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte are superb as the duelling fathers.  But the real achievement is Ang Lee's.  He shows remarkable respect for the actors, the material, and the audience with this film.<br />There are times when Lee, who usually makes far different movies like \\"The Ice Storm\\" and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" struggles a bit to keep things in balance and this affects the movie's pacing.  But still, I would rather see a director take risks and make a few false moves, than to treat me like a consumer who needs his buttons pushed every few seconds.<br />The DVD is beautifully done and Lee's simulation of the comic book visual experience with split screens and other dazzling effects is groundbreaking.  The special features DVD is packed with worthwhile extras, especially the documentary on Lee.  A misunderstood movie that deserves an open-minded viewing; one of the best movies of 2003.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|I thought this movie was one of the best i've ever seen!  It has really great characters who are very funny.  I think many of the sayings are very creative.  My favorite characters were Dory and Jauques ( the shrimp guy).  All ages can enjoy this movie and laugh.  The one problem i have with it is that the plot is just a little stupid but everything else was great!  I really think this movie was AwEsOmE and i give it 5 stars!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Absolutely amazing. This CD reflects everything that Pearl Jam is. Love the song stories!
0156027321|2.0|Confusing, dark and way too discriptive.  I enjoy an author who develops an idea to help the reader view the story accurately but I do not need 10 descriptions of the sky, or the ocean or any other part of the book.  I found myself skimming parts because they were unnecessary.  The only reason I finished it was because of a book club and I resold it immediately. I would not recommend it.
B00000DHR0|4.0|I'm not a big listener of Christmas music so I'm not very experienced in this field. My take on Celine Dion's These Are Special Times CD is: It's very traditional sounding. So if you like your holiday music without synthesizers and stuff, this one is right up your alley. This is pure vocals and feeling. It's also kinda boring for me. Besides the couple of standouts, nothing really jumps out at me. The standouts are O Holy Night, the first song, Feliz Navidad and Les Cloches Du Hameau, the last two songs. In between, it's not that exciting. Celine's family contributes in Feliz Navidad and Les Cloches Du Hameau. They sound great and that spices it up some. There's a picture of Celine and the family in the CD cover. My ratings of each track is below.<BR> 1. O Holy Night 5/5<BR> 2. Don't Save It All For Christmas Day 4/5<BR> 3. Blue Christmas 2/5<BR> 4. Another Year Has Gone By 3/5<BR> 5. The Magic Of Christmas Day (God Bless Us Everyone) 4/5<BR> 6. Ave Maria 3/5<BR> 7. Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful)4/5<BR> 8. The Christmas Song (Chesnuts Roasting On An Open Fire) 2/5<BR> 9. The Prayer (Duet with Andrea Bocelli) 3/5<BR> 10. Brahms' Lullaby 2/5<BR> 11. Christmas Eve 5/5<BR> 12. These Are Special Times 4/5<BR> 13. Happy Xmas (War Is Over) 3/5<BR> 14. I'm Your Angel (Duet with R.Kelly) 2/5 <BR> 15. Feliz Navidad 5/5<BR> 16. Les Cloches Du Hameau 5/5<br />Another thing, where are the high notes? Besides O Holy Night, much of the singing seems emotionless. Another downer is the presence of R.Kelly. That's not good. Putting these things aside, I still give this CD four stars for effort and I do recommend buying it because most people seem to enjoy it more than myself.
B00005JLYW|1.0|The Angels must recover a pair of rings that hold the code for unscrambling the Witness Protection Program database.  Naturally, this provides them with lots of opportunities to change their clothes and strike poses.  I realize that this film is meant to be nothing more than dumb fun, but it had far too much \\"dumb\\" in it and not enough fun.  Boo./
0790744295|5.0|One of the great underrated horror/comic movies and one of the best adaptations of Steven King material for the big screen.  The five stories are artfully tied together by the sinister score and the very creative animated sequences (also look for the marble ashtray that makes an appearance in each of the segments).  The acting is all over-the-top hilarious.  Subtle it is not.  Who would guess director George Romero could bring out the humor in King's material better than any other director to date?
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pink's latest work.  I was not thrilled with her first cd, but I did love her second, Missundaztood.<BR>This cd is fabulous.  I can hear Tim Armstrong's influence on a couple tracks, which is great because I love Rancid!  Pink does a wonderful job mixing all sorts of genres.  If you like punk, rock, meaningful and fun music, go get this cd.
0800129806|5.0|I saw this movie in school yesterday for the first time. And if you do not have it.i reccommend putting it on your Christmas List. I would not recommend it for children under seven due to the violent parts in it. Overall I thought it was a great movie and I definetley want to get it for christmas and if not that see it again
B000002GQE|5.0|I have the LP record of this album. It's good from start to finish. Sure it has the hits &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, but the other songs are great as well.
0385504209|5.0|This is a great suspense book that really keeps you on your toes!  The basic outline is that a museum curator gets murdered and a cryptic message left via the Mona Lisa.  His cryptologist granddaughter, Sophie, must then try and decipher the code and figure out who killed her grandfather.<br />I don't want to give anything more away, you really have to read it for yourself!  The book is gripping and really makes you think.  It gives you the codes to try and crack yourself along with Sophie.  It also is chock full of information about history and art, this book ended up being quite educational!<br />I highly recommend this book.. the plot twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat!  Believe me, once you start reading it you won't be able to put it down!
0671015206|5.0|This book dispels the myth that most millionaires live an ostentatious lifestyle. Quite to the contrary. They became millionaires by living within their means. The book also drives home the point that it's not what you make, it's what you keep.<br />It's too bad that there isn't a 6 star rating, because that's what this book deserves. It's that good.<br />John White, Author of:<BR>&quot;I'm in Debt, Over 40, with No Retirement Savings. HELP!&quot; <BR>ISBN: 0974068748
B000001EKX|4.0|In 1974 Kiss released its first album which didn't sell very well. While touring they recorded another album and released it as soon as they could. This album was rushed and the production is a bit thin. Especially the drums which don't sound very powerful. Production flaws aside the songs themselves are killer. I like the muddy, heavy guitar sound. In fact this is Kisse's heaviest album of the 70s. This album is best heard cranked to the max at home or cruisin down the freeway.<br />1. Got to Choose. 8/10 Paul really plays great rythmn guitar on this one. Ace throws in a great solo as usual.<br />2. Parasite. 10/10 One of my favorite riffs in Kisstory. I like Gene's powerful vocals on this one.<br />3. Goin Blind. 1/10 I don't like this song. Just something about it doesn't have the Kiss magic. Even Ace's outstanding solo doesn't salvage this song for me.<br />4. Hotter Than Hell. 9/10 Much slower than when they play it live, but the studio version is still great. Has a nasty crunch and mean swagger. Ace & Paul really compliment each other on guitar.<br />5. Let Me Go Rock & Roll. 10/10 Adds a great 50s flavor and just rocks out. Great guitars, great song!<br />6. All the Way. 7/10 Good singing by the Demon but not a classic.<br />7. Watchin You. 10/10 Very catchy guitars on this one. Classic Kiss.<br />8. Mainline. 7/10 Peter sings on his one and does an outstanding job.<br />9. Comin Home. 9/10 Very sexy, hard rock swagger on this one.<br />10. Strange Ways. 9/10 Heavy song for 1974. Good album closer.<br />This is a good addition to your Kiss catalog if you are just starting to build your Kiss Kollection. Must have to be in the Kiss Army. Also pick up Dressed to Kill and Destroyer.
B00005NIL9|5.0|1 can argue about which lp is Free's best. But this one always did it for me. Pauls guitar crys emotion that techincally superior guitar players know nothing about. Heavy Load is the soulfull straw Mr. Rogers has been grasping for ever since. Mr Big places Mt. Frazier on the map for ever and ever. Simon Kirkes drumming is the glue that holds the landscape together, Stellar at every turn in this audio masterpiece. An incredible cd.
B00005AFMT|5.0|&quot;Discipline&quot; is King Crimson's most musically complex album to date. Each instrument deals an amazing attack of baffling textures that is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Robert Fripp took a slight critical lashing for deciding to resurrect the King Crimson banner in 1981. He had claimed when he first dissolved the group in 1974 that the band was &quot;over forever and ever.&quot; But no good thing ever dies, and the unbeatable line-up of Fripp, Adrian Belew, Tony Levin, and Bill Bruford confirmed this with a mighty fist.<br />&quot;Discpline&quot; also marks the point when Belew's lyrics were at their clever, brilliant height, and had yet to dry up, as his &quot;elephantosity&quot; became less and less inspiring over the years. His manic-American vocals and words make even David Byrne (of the innovative Talking Heads) look like a mere naive poet. 'Elephant Talk' is one of rock's most genius takes on wordplay, while a more simplistic but intriguing approach is taken to the rushing 'Indiscipline,' which is capped by a memorable cry of &quot;I like it!&quot; In a predictable run-down of the instrumentation; Levin's bass devices are a marvel, while Bruford's percussion remains unsurpassed, and as always Fripp's guitar is still a cornerstone. The wailing cries his instrument releases on the heartache 'Matte Kudasai' is unlike anything King Crimson has ever recorded. The two instrumentals that close the album ('The Sheltering Sky' and the title song) are two of their best wordless compositions, and both yield some of Bruford's most skilled and inventive percussion. 'Thela Hun Ginjeet' remains a puzzling masterpiece, and perhaps the most musically complex on the album; the taped conversation that plays throughout the song is just as interesting as the music.<br />The brief laughs that Robert Fripp received for reviving King Crimson were well worth it, not to mention silenced by the mighty frame of &quot;Discipline.&quot; And as 'Elephant Talk' proclaims, &quot;Criticism...it's only talk.&quot;ism...it's only talk.&quot;
0783232039|5.0|As cult horror films go this is one of the best I have seen in quite awhile.  Not so much scary as it is a brilliant dark comedy with witty horror film touches.  This is easily the best film featuring Chucky and one of the best films of its kind since Dead Alive.  Highly recommended for those of you out there with a twisted sense of humor and an open mind.  Great effects, score, cinematography and voice acting by Jennifer Tilly and Brad Dourif.  This would make a terrific double feature with Meet the Feebles.
0156027321|4.0|I completely enjoyed \\"The Life of Pi.\\" The writing was brisk, the story well-developed, and (as the mark of most great novels) it can be read (and enjoyed)on many different levels. However, Martel hints (in a not-so-subtle-way) that his story will, \\"Help renew your faith in God.\\" I have to say, it definitley fell short on this promise. In fact, especially at the begining Martel's description of Pi's various beliefs is both convuluted and confusing. Who knows, maybe I am in the minority in my misunderstanding.<br /><br />  So we are back to having a book that delivers heavily on being a great fable. The book drives homethe concept that man has an overiding fear of death despite the odds of living. That while even the most miserable of people can find the fear of death more unbearable than the thought of living.<br />  Pi overcame many hardships on his life on his boat (Boy there is an understatement). Simply put- if he can remain alive for 9 months stranded on a lifeboat with a Tiger, surely we can make do with 8-hours a day with an grumpy boss.<br />  Definitely worth the read
0790731894|3.0|Enjoyed the film especially the casting but where is the action?  I don't like &quot;action&quot; movies without action.  There is some suspense though.  The cast is great with everyone from David Suchet (Poirot) playing a villain to Leguizamo, Berry and Steven Seagal who gets ousted in the first few minutes.
B000001ELD|2.0|I heard Gene thought his solo album was the best of the four.  Oh really?  Only the song \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" saves this effort from sinking to a one star rating.   After listening to all 4 solo albums (on vinyl)  again after 25 years, it is way \\"too\\" easy to see why Kiss went downhill after Ace's departure.  Paul's effort is solid, but only a shade above ordinary hard rock.  And bless Peter for trying.  This?  You'll maybe listen to it once all the way thru;  that's if you don't keel over laughing during the final track.  The sound samples here are all you need to convince you.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|whitney sounds like a woman now.her voice doesn't sound like she's 20 or 21 anymore.she has skills and quality music. go pick it up and email and tell others about this cheerful cd.
B000002P2W|5.0|The production on this album is not as powerful in intensity as &quot;Who's Next&quot; or &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.  However, the overall sound needed to be more refined and smooth to compliment Townshend's early mid-life crisis material.  Arguably some of Townshend's best songwriting.  A solid effort throughout with no weak songs whatsoever.  Moons drumming is brilliant.  The bonus tracks are a treat;  3 live tunes recorded in 1976.  Fans who own the bootleg &quot;Who Put The Boot In 1976&quot; already have heard these tracks. Excellent.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is the definition of Heavy Metal.  Flawless from start to finish.  I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.  This album is AMAZING!!  Even better than &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot;<br />Standout tracks:  Mastef of Puppets, Disposable Heroes, Orion
B0000C1733|3.0|....how the fk does 'Parallel Universe' make it on to the Best Of cd over 'Around the World'???? Who agrees? <BR>Around the World is the rockinest track on Californication and sounds like something off BSSM compared to other tracks. <br />Actually one more question. Does anyone else think that some parts on 'Parallel Universe' sound like part of the chorus from 'By the Way'? If so, then how dumb is it to put both tracks on a Best Of cd, with one right after the other, no.8 &amp; 9. Parrallel Universe shouldnt be on the cd at all. <br />Also The Zephyr Song is easily better than Universall Speaking, it shouldn't have been left off. <br />Lastly, there shouldn't be 5 tracks from Californication, if BSSM only has 4 tracks. Road Trippin should have been left off and been replaced by another track from BSSM which had way better songs than Californication. <BR>End.
B000002H6C|4.0|This album was met with a lot of mixed feelings.  It's a very different feel than Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning.  The lyrics are the best the band had ever done up to this point, but the production, in the eyes of many, lacked a lot.  The bass guitar is not audible at all on this album for undisclosed reasons.  This is a very dark, cold, and serious album.  I, for one, really like the &quot;cold&quot; approach to the production.  One thing is certain; this was a very mature album, possibly partly due to the untimely death of Cliff Burton after Master of Puppets.  The only thing that brings this review down one star is the inaudible bass.  Everything else, even the drums, sounds great in my opinion.  This is also the album where James Hetfield fully developed his trademark growl.  A true metal classic, just not quite up to par with the previous two.<br />Standout tracks:  Blackened, One, Harvester of Sorrow
B0000E1WNV|3.0|It's a show from relatively early in the Rising Tour . . . the Summer 2003 shows were definitely better.  The audio on the DVD is only average and disc 2 is defective in many cases.  <br />This set is better than no Bruce DVD at all but definitely not the best they could offer of the 2002-2003 Rising shows that were recorded . . . here's hoping that full-length versions of some of the Giants Stadium shows that were recorded make their way to the legions of Bruce fans.<br />So, three stars . . . the set has it's moments but just doesn't stand up to the quality of the shows later in the tour.  Plus, how many more times can Bruce re-release Darkness on the Edge of Town and Prove It All Night?  These two songs in particular are just worn out and are filler material these days as far as I'm concerned.  With his vast body of work, you'd think he could do better than just sticking in these two songs over and over again.
B000002H97|4.0|I'm not basing this review on the popularity of the album, but on the music alone.  Based on that, this is a very, very solid release and it propelled Metallica to the throne of Heavy Metal.  Despite the &quot;radio-friendly&quot; production, a lot of this album is still really heavy.  The intro to &quot;Through The Never&quot; sounds a bit like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and the intro to &quot;Holier Than Though&quot; is brutal.  There is a noticeable &quot;simple&quot; approach to many of the songs... but just because a song isn't an epic full of time changes doesn't mean it can't kick ass!  It's obvious that Metallica were trying to reach a wider audience with this... and it's probably the album by them that I listen to the least because it's been rammed into my head so much by radio that I just got sick of it.  The album's anchor though... is its lyrics, they are VERY well-writen and seemingly introspective.  The lyrics, in some places, even outshine those found on &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;, and that is really saying a lot.  The bottom line is, I don't care of an album is loaded with time changes, as long as it's powerful and the songs are good.  That is definitely the case with this album.  It didn't receive 5 stars because of the aforementioned &quot;radio-friendly&quot; approach... but these songs really do kick ass!<br />Standout Tracks: The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Of Wolf And Man
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Sarah is heading steadily downhill.  Her first album, Touch, wasn't that great, but it showed a glimpse of greater things to come.  Solace, the second, showed her beginning to really take form in her songwriting, which fully blossomed in Fumbling Towards Ecstacy.  FTE is probably one of my absolute favorite albums ever, and I will always love Sarah for it.  But Surfacing, the next album, began to show a dilution in her potency, leading us to this album, Afterglow.  Pain creates great art, and I don't think Sarah wants for much of anything anymore, leaving the songs on Afterglow as nothing more than what anyone else could have done.  If you want to hear Sarah Mclachlan, listen to Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, Solace, or her B-Sides.  Leave the rest to her radio babies.
B000002H2H|5.0|It is amazing that this masterpiece is only Metallica's second album!  As with Master of Puppets, I can't really say anything here that hasn't already been said because every fan of Heavy Metal music is probably very familiar with this gem.  The growth that Metallica displayed between this and their debut &quot;Kill Em' All&quot; is absolutely mind-blowing.  That kind of evolution has never been matched by any other band.  Incredible.<br />Standout tracks:  Fade To Black, Creeping Death, The Call of Ktulu
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I don't understand why people who review this album are quick to say something negative.  May it be that you don't like this genre of music, it shouldn't give you the right to put down a woman who is 26-times platinum... Britney Spears returns after two years with an outstanding album, which is bound to produce hit after hit!  Everyone can count on me to break it down...and with all honesty, you'll understand why you gotta get \\"In the Zone\\".<br />#1 Me Against the Music featuring Madonna (3:43)-The first single to be released from the album, at first, didn't show as much promise.  It sounds like everything that Britney Spears has done before.  Madonna is featured, which doesn't make for the <BR>right blend in vocals.  Yes, we have all seen the video, we have \\"the kiss\\" burned in our memories, but it probably wasn't wise to have released this particular song. (6/10)<br />#2 (I Got That) Boom Boom featuring the Ying Yang Twins (4:51)-This was unexpected, but I like the song!  We don't know if this means that she'll be collaborating with other \\"Southern boys\\" out there (think Ludacris and Jermaine Dupri), but it is definitely one of the standout tracks.  The bass line is awesome <BR>and the extended intro and bridge are sure to make this a hit single...SHOUTIE!! (8/10)<br />#3 I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) (Unreleased in U.S.) (3:22)-This song is hot!  I suggest right now that you get the import CD from Mexico that contains this song.  The beat might bring to mind No Doubt's \\"Hella Good\\", and is definitely worth searching for. (8/10)<br />#4 Showdown (3:17)-Call it the reaction from Justin<BR>Timberlake's \\"Cry Me a River\\", \\"The Showdown\\" is one of those tracks that portrays Britney's sexuality.  This song has a great beat, but her sound on vocals can get annoying at times. (7/10)<br />#5 Breathe on Me (3:43)-It is very evident that Britney has been influenced by Madonna in more than one way.  The best song on the album, in my opinion, is \\"Breathe on Me\\", a club trackthat is similar to a cross between Kylie Minogue's \\"Come Into My World\\" and Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" album.  I love this song...and I  <BR>can't wait to get to the clubs to hear this song play. (10/10)<br />#6 Early Mornin' (3:45)-Produced by Moby, this is another track that is awesome.  All about partying at night, it's sure to bring to back memories of the times we've all \\"partied to the break of dawn.\\"  Something different for Britney is, of course, the melody, but the outcome is brilliant. (9/10)<br />#7 Toxic (3:21)-This song blows my mind!  It leaves me speechless.  I'm sure that it will be one of the upcoming singles to be released from the album.  \\"Toxic\\" has a <BR>very infectious string arrangement, which is noticeably clear in the intro andthroughout the song.  Though it sounds comical, there won't be anything to laugh about when she breaks records with song. (10/10)<br />#8 Outrageous (3:21)-This is the cut!  \\"Outrageous\\" has been blowin' up on radio stations here in Chicago.  With a beat that is just truly the genuine mind of R. Kelly (think \\"Snake\\" and \\"Thoia Thoing\\"), Britney crossed into another level of talent when she showed us that she can record an R&B song and still sound flawless in it.  Just wait for the remixes! (9/10)<br />#9 Touch of My Hand (4:19)-This is just to prove that Britney isn't a little girl anymore!  She had no problem expressing the thought of indulging in oneself.  What's clear here is that she is breaking barriers that only Janet Jackson wasn't<BR>afraid of doing.  Is there a possible collaboration with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis? Could be...but nonetheless, as long as Britney keeps exploring herself, we're all bound to be \\"coming\\" back for more! (10/10)<br />#10 Don't Hang Up (Unreleased in U.S.) (4:02)-Yes, another sexual, but very innocent, track.  \\"And she's coming too...\\" A song about not wanting to hang up the phone with her lover, Britney makes it obvious that she will continue to do whatever to make us \\"delirious\\".  Love the beat and keyboards! (10/10)<br />#11 The Hookup (3:54)-The REGGAE song!  Where's Sean Paul when you need him! \\"Certified quality...\\" YES!  With a traditional Jamaican rhythm, Britney sings about dancing and \\"taking it lower, lower to the floor\\".  A classic jam in the clubs. (9/10)<br />#12 The Answer (Unreleased in U.S.) (3:54)-THIS IS THE BEST SONG BY BRITNEY!  Off of the Australian import, \\"The Answer\\" is the greatest song ever recorded by her.  I don't even know where to start.  I guess what I like the most is that Britney experimented with rhythms from South America.  Everything from the safari sounds to the woodpipes that remind me of the Incans and the Aztecs, this song leaves me speechless! (11/10)<br />#13 Shadow (3:45)-A haunting melody about feeling someone's presence, despite them not being there.  Very beautiful, but it is another track that sounds like something Madonna would have recorded.  (Think of anything from the \\"Something to <BR>Remember\\" album).  Regardless, it is still another standout track. (10/10)<br />#14 Brave New Girl (3:30)-My least favorite track, it sounds like something that should've been left on Pink's \\"M!ssundaztood\\" album.  Britney tries her hand at rap, and inadvertently fails.  Not worth listening to...should've been replaced by one of the songs from the imports! (3/10)<br />#15-Everytime (3:53)-The final track on the album, \\"Everytime\\" is a luscious ballad which explains her true feelings about losing someone, even though she still loves them.  Bound to be another single, it is a great closing to the album! (11/10)<br />Bonus-Me Against the Music featuring Madonna (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Mix) (4:30)-Way better than the album track, the remix has distinctive Indian rhythms that definitely save the track from total devastation. (10/10)
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is a delightful movie, full of the kind of overboard heroics, histrionics and mayhem that made STAR TREK as popular as it was.  Seeing the conventions with all the GALAXY QUEST questies is so incredibly ironic.  But what makes this movie work is the superb direction and acting that manages to bring such wonderful life and credibility to its pedestrian plot.  Although the idea of having actors forced to do the real thing is far above pedestrian, so forget that comment!  It's a good plot.<br />Tim Allen is wonderful as the Shatneresque hero who uses his egotistical bravado to commandeer the Thermian's ship.  And yes, it's funny how he loses his shirt to the rock monster!  Sigourney Weaver, a simply amazing and versatile actress, shines as Tawny, the blonde airhead who repeats everything the computer says.  (She's quite dishy too as a blonde!).  Alan Rickman is wryly humorous as the serious actor who abhors his role, but comes through solidly when necessary.  A marvelous performance.  Sam Rockwell as the only non-series persona is hilarious as the actor who knows he's gonna get killed because he's just a &quot;guest star.&quot;  Tony Shalhoub is great as Fred, too.  The entire cast of Thermians is delightful in their innocence and awe of the actors who they think are the real thing!<br />It's a fun out of this world comedy and one of the best spoofs in a long time.<br />Relax and enjoy!!!!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000002H33|5.0|Okay, so I'm not Metallica's biggest fan, I haven't listened to every album, but I have to this one...anyway, this was the second Metallica album I bought. After the disappointment with the &quot;black&quot; album I picked this one up, and was pleasantly surprised. The guitaring and bass shine (RIP Cliff :() and all of the songs fit together very well. Battery is a good opening, although not a favorite. Master of Puppets is probably worth at least half the price of the album. It may take a couple listens to get used to, but every second is terrific, and the instrumental section never falters. The Thing That Should Not Be bores me a little and seems a bit too repetitive, but it's not bad. Sanitarium is my favorite Metallica song and my second favorite song of all time. From the first note till the last I am in awe of the way it builds, and of course the lyrics. Disposable Heros is not to be missed...a great view on anti-war, didn't need to be that long, but great. Leper Messiah seems kind of unoriginal...Orion, though a bit repetitive, is still brilliant. Damage, Inc., is a good way to finish the album but not the best song. Buy it for Master of Puppets and Sanitarium like I did, and you'll probably end up liking the other songs.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Obviously it does not matter if she can sing or not, she has the image and edge required to sell millions of copies of her cds.  Yes, I believe she is not the best singer, but there are many artists out there who can sing but don't have the edge or catchy tunes.<br />From listening to this cd, Britney has come a long way since her very first cd, and this cd has to be one of her best.  Her music is up to date, very catchy, and GOOD!  I pick this cd, &quot;In The Zone&quot;, over her previous release, &quot;Britney&quot;.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This CD is one of the best Christmas Cd's I have ever heard. Many people talk about how she doesn't sound like the &quot;Old Whitney&quot;, but given the events in her life, I think she sounds wonderful. The only complaint I have about this CD is there aren't enough songs. I would have loved to her Whitney sing, &quot;What Child is This&quot;, &quot;Oh Come All Ye Faithful&quot;, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, and &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot;, but I guess there's always next year. God Bless You Whitney.
B000002BYD|5.0|It's gonna happen, Pearl Jam fans are gonna get this album to 5 stars so PJ has 1 album on amazon thats a 5 star album - &amp; rightfully so, this is the perfect Pearl Jam album to start with
B00005JM02|5.0|This show proves that men can actually care for a child when the wife either dies or get's a divorce. This movie really moved me. It's more of a father/son relationship that shows the parent really care about their child. Love is the key to happiness and you have to open up and let your felling's soar is what this show is saying.<br />Anyways clown fish...ya. Ok this movie starts off like any other with the parents taking care of their to-be children and then out of no where a baracuda comes along. The father of course get rendered unconsious and the mom is no where to bee seen by him when he wakes up! *GASP* No more eggs. but wait there is one left. I meant the whole start made me cry but in a good way. The rest of the movie brings a fish with long term memory loss who travels with marlin go on a quest to look for his son.
B000084T18|5.0|50's first major-label debut album, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin' &quot; is a street masterpiece. The album, full of hard-hittin gangsta hits, not only shows that 50 has street credibility but gives you an insight into his life, trials and tribulations. Tracks such as &quot;Heat&quot; show exactly what his life is on the street doin' coke deals, etc. tryin to get rich or die tryin'. Production by Dr. Dre among others gives you the head-bangin beats you need to listen to 50's flows. <br />This album is great and every track is a hit. This is coming not only from a 50 fan but an overall hip-hop head. Get this album and feel the streets.
B00007BH5C|5.0|In my opinion, this is an even better soundtrack than the first!  They feature many different music artists.  First of all, I love the Rohan theme!  It's very pretty on the violin! Isabel Bayrakdarian has a beautiful voice.  It gives me chills on &quot;Evenstar&quot;!  Shelia Chandra has another great voice!  It captures the moment perfectly on &quot;Breath of Life&quot;!  Ben del Maestro has an excellent voice also!  I just love &quot;Forth Eorlingas&quot; and &quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot; because of him!  Emiliana Torrini has an interesting voice.  At first I didn't really like it, but then I began to think that it's the perfect voice for &quot;Gollum's Song&quot;.  This is yet another LOTR and Howard Shore must buy! Happy Listening!
630512762X|4.0|I thought this film would be a lot more confusing than it actually was. I was expecting them to be constantly changing faces, rather than keeping the switched faces for the duration of the film.<br />After realising John Woo directed this, and after not liking MI:2, I was expecting to sit back and yawn right the way through it. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of Nicolas Cage, and a little bird told me that John Travolta was so camp in this film! But instead, I found myself on the edge of my seat. It's action right through from start to finish. A very concept for a film, although there a few bits I could criticise - possibly a brain transplant to ACT that much like the other person?! And of course there were the predictable moments - of course, Nicolas Cage would have John Travolta's face transplanted onto his. How weird. And of course I was sickened by the glimpses of Nicolas's cage meatiness without a face - UGH!!!<br />I actually found myself liking Nicolas in this film, and John managed to capture his moves and gestures down to a T - although he became too evil for me at one point, and I found myself not liking the character he was playing.<br />It reminded me a lot of the Matrix with the moves, and True Lies, with the fact the daughter was involved.<br />Not much of extras, but the theatrical trailer was great! For once, I enjoyed the shortness of a theatrical trailer. If I'd seen that when this originally came out, I would definitely have gone to see it.<br />If you like your action movies, you have to see this. You won't be disappointed.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I would have to say that this is the best Howard Shore has ever done!  I cannot wait to see the movie now that I've heard the music!  It is wonderfully beautiful.  I love the Gondor theme!  I heard it for the first time in FOTR when Aragorn and Boromir were conversing in Lothlorien (they gave a little sneak preview there)!  There are also several flute solos.  Being a flute player myself, I was excited to hear them!  I usually couldn't exactly pick out the flutes in the previous soundtracks!  Ben del Maestro returns in this soundtrack and is wonderful yet again!  Billy Boyd is another person featured; he surprised me greatly!  I didin't realize he had such an enchanting voice!  Renee Fleming has a beautiful soprano voice! She's featured 3 times throughout the entire soundtrack!  Sir James Galway is an excellent flutist!  He's featured several times throughout also.  Viggo Mortensen has a surprisingly nice voice also!  Annie Lennox has an awesome voice also.  If &quot;May It Be&quot; didn't win Best Song (or something like that) in the Academy Awards, &quot;Into the West&quot; will!  This is a fantastic LOTR and Howard Shore buy! Happy Listening!
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is defenently my favorite movie. I think this is David Bowie's best work.  The goblin king displays David perfectly.  The leather and all the other stuff he wears is so cool.  The style of hair he has is my favorite of all the different cuts he has had done.  I recommend this movie to everybody; it's just an amazing piece of work.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I am amazed that Howard Shore could just create a masterpiece such as this! The FOTR soundtrack is a wonderful introduction to all 3 soundtacks! Enya has a beautiful, enchanting voice! This is a good buy if you love the Lord of the Rings and Howard Shore! Happy Listening!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh has knocked another one out of the park.<br />This CD and Genie's Wildflowers are my two favorites now.
0816131244|5.0|This book by Eric Segal speaks of a huge sacrifice by a<br />woman. Man, Woman and Child touches upon the right emotions.<br />He brings out the characters into life-like forms.<br />The story protrays a very difficult situation brought about<br />on a family but a mistake in the past. It takes us on a<br />journey through this situaion as the family faces it. Eric<br />Segal goes on to describe the frustrations felt by each<br />member of the family, and how they overcome the problem.<br />All in all, it's a very touching story which brings out a<br />host of emotions in its readers. A great story about the<br />forgiving capability of a woman to save her family.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed each page and by the end I was emotionally drawn out by the book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones and Genie are definitely the two coolest piano/vocal singers right now.<br />Norah's record is not as interesting as it has been touted to be, but it's still great.<br />I highly recommend you also have a look at Genie- her WIldflowers CD. it's a little different - more lush and enya-like, kind of like a cross between Norah and Enya.
B000089RVR|4.0|I, like many of the other reviewers, have been anxiously awaiting this new album. I don't think I'm your average Dido fan -- whose average age I think skews more toward 40 than 20. I went to a Dido concert in an arena once and was surprised how many people just *sat still* in their seats even though there was plenty of floor space MUCH closer to the stage.<br />Back to the point. I heard the album on VH1.com before the actual release date, and was pretty disappointed. My words then were: bland, monotone, etc. etc. I didn't even like White Flag, the first single. What a great voice wasted on boring material! Why shell out more money when I can already enjoy No Angel?<br />But given that it's Dido, and she does have an awesome voice, I gave the album a couple of more listens (again, free on VH1 before release date). With each listen, I gradually started enjoying the tracks more. My favorite turned out being the hidden track (&quot;Closer&quot;). If you liked &quot;Thank you&quot;, you will likely enjoy this song. I also enjoy the song, &quot;Stoned&quot;. Yep, that kind of stoned. The other day, I fell asleep and had the album playing on repeat. Okay I was kind of sick of it when I woke up, but here I am a couple of days later listening to it again. <br />So, &quot;No Angel&quot; fans, I suggest giving &quot;Life for Rent&quot; about 10 listens before making a final judgment. I recall Dido saying in an interview that her criteria for making CD's was whether she'd listen to it ad nauseum in her car many years later. I don't know about Dido's tastes in general, but on this one count I'd agree.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is in one word - unbelievable!  I admit I wasn't that great a Christina fan before I heard the album.  She is now my favorite celebrity!  This album is so amazing!  From the crazy &quot;Dirrty&quot; compilation with Redman that makes you want to get down and dirrty with her, to the extremely moving and heartfelt &quot;I'm OK&quot; written as a result of her father's abuse, Stripped is easily the best album I have ever heard in my life.  This album is full of attitude, heartbreak, and pain.  I consider myself quite the music critic, and this one does not in any way disappoint!  This is the only album I listen to all the way through every time I listen to it!!  Christina has the voice of a soulful angel!  Her songs on this album, most of which she cowrote, have great messages, from amazingly fun and wild to sing in the club, to songs to get you through the toughest of times!  It is right at this moment in my cd player, and since I got it forever ago, has rarely gotten taken out!  You think you know about this album from the songs played on the radio?  You don't even have a taste of it!  GET THIS ALBUM!!!! I personally promise that you will love it, and you will forever be affected by it!
0743455967|5.0|I enjoyed all of this book.  I listened to the audio version, and I felt like I got a private tutorial from Stephen himself!  The book has lots of different parts, all worthwhile.  The recommendations for writers are honest, useful &amp; to the point. I highly recommend this book.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The 2nd matrix(reloaded)in my opinoin was the best matrix out of all three of them! Why? Well, it was a movie that really told you what the matirx was all about. You find out about how the maxtrix really worked! And you realize that the proficy was all a lie. the ploit and everything was all perfect! Everything made scence and help me out alot!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I can't really make up my mind if it is her best yet but it is definately brilliant. I admit I am a fan of Britney, even her first album which was pure pop but she did sort of grow up as I did so thats why I always liked her. People say this album is all about sex sex and more sex. Well I disagree, it has a few references but how many artists don't refer to sex these days. I love every song on this album apart from Shadow which is good but a bit boring. (I got that)Boom Boom is definately one of the best tracks on the album but a lot of them are good. I think people should stop criticising her because this album is brilliant. And whoever compared her to Kylie by saying at least Kylie can sing and has some class has not listened to this album and obviously hasn't seen some of the clothes Kylie wears.
B00008S2VG|1.0|its sad to say that the woman who must be bigger than life has now succumbed to making bad music....her previous album ' MUSIC ' sucked and to release this one SUCKS more...im not sure how the album did internationally but here its obvious its AWFUL MADONNA MATERIAL...im not sure wether to laugh at her or to let her lean on my shoulder for releasing this album nevermind the previous one too
B000056K04|4.0|I like Dave Matthews. A break away from the regular hard rock/metal genre's; a good band to listen to that you won't have to pause after a few seconds because it gets too annoying.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I can't believe my ears!  Finally Britney makes a CD in which the songs aren't all bubble gum and sugary crap, and people don't like it.  Her music has been crap up to this CD, because I did not like any songs at all from former discs, but this one has a few that I absolutely love.  I don't recommend or condemn this CD, but if you buy it, I think you'll enjoy it, if you don't buy it, no biggie.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Showing love in many different ways across many different cultures etc. It a great romantic comedy all round. A must see.
B00000AFGM|5.0|After the unbeatable brilliance of \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" filled with raw power-enduced rage, no casual music-listener would ever believe that the group known as Marilyn Manson could put out an album that could actually soothe the eardrum along with its conceptual brilliance and beautiful song-writing. Then they put out this, Mechanical Animals, one of the most beautiful and thought-provoking works of the 1990s. Although not embraced by those looking for the same kind of energy and rage that made Antichrist rule the charts, the listeners who actually gave this piece of art a chance were thouroughly impressed.<br />The first chord of the opening 5-minute GREAT BIG WHITE WORLD already brings the listener in a world not seen in \\"Antichrist Superstar\\". This beautiful and sad rock song shows our world as a place where nothing heals and nothing grows, it is simply just a great big white world and we are drained of our colors.<br />The enchanting opener then goes into the pop hit THE DOPE SHOW that is not really talking about drugs, but actually about pop culture and how people make money off of your face and then in the end leaves you behind.<br />The title track MECHANICAL ANIMALS then shows the hollowness in a woman that has displeased the character of Omega and he tries to assure her that he himself am not \\"mechanical\\" and therefore they will never see eye to eye.<br />The rocking ROCK IS DEAD gets the message out that whatever makes rock and roll or shock rock so exciting is something we create ourselves and that it is getting old, anyone can shock anyone, just put it to bed already.<br />The beautifully tragic DISASSOCIATIVE has a David Bowie-\\"Space Oddity\\" feel to it as the perspective of a floating and stranded astronaut in space is compared to Omega sitting on a world that's been slowly killing him.<br />THE SPEED OF PAIN, another beautifully depressing song shows what it's like on the verge of suicide, but in the end he doesn't care as long as he dies holding someone's hand...<br />POSTHUMAN then rocks onto the speakers with the assurance that God is only a statistic and then kindly Coma White reminds us all that \\"all that glitters is cold...\\"<br />At our half-way point we are then introduced to the band Omega and the Mechanical Animals as they rock into I WANT TO DISAPPEAR, an anthem saying that all is gone so they might as well disappear as well.<br />I DON'T LIKE THE DRUGS (BUT THE DRUGS LIKE ME) talks about all the different addictions and what it does to us, like drugs, sex and television, turning us all into zombies who ultimately \\"fill our souls with dope\\" in order to feel fine.<br />NEW MODEL NO. 15, another raging and catchy rock song shows how sex has become meaningless, that pretty soon we'll all just be having sex with machines, just so long as they \\"got nothing inside\\" and are good \\"in bed at the office\\"<br />The rant on sex continues into USER FRIENDLY, chronicling a woman who uses sex as her weapon to get what she wants for the time being and then \\"deleting the ones that she f***ed\\"<br />FUNDAMENTALLY LOATHSOME then gives a lounge-singing type feel as the protagonist wants to \\"wake up in a world with no pain\\" but instead \\"just suffer in a hope to die someday\\" and then in the end simply states \\"shoot myself to love you, but if i loved myself i'd be shooting you.\\"<br />The beautifully tragic and glittery THE LAST DAY ON EARTH then paints a picture of a world completely shutting down and two lost souls finding each other while the planet dies... they'll never say goodbye...<br />The album comes to a climatic close with the wonderfully written and played ballad COMA WHITE, a memoir of a girl who was from \\"the perfect world\\" but let herself go with drugs and suicide, with the protagonist Omega analyzing that \\"all the drugs in this world won't save her from herself...\\"<br />At almost an hour in length, Manson's second masterpiece finally ends leaving the listener wanting more and also the final piece of the trilogythat started with Antichrist Superstar, but don't fret, for he saved the best for last...
B00006CXXU|5.0|this album is her best!! her powerful voice REALLY shows through a lot better than from her previous more bubblegum pop-ish albums. she really has a lot of talent and i love the fact that she wrote so many of the songs. the lyrics are also really meaningful.<BR>my favorites are &quot;the voice within&quot;(beautiful ballad), &quot;dirrty&quot;(a great dance song), and &quot;Walk Away&quot;
B00000K3CK|5.0|It hardly seems necessary to write a review on &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; because it's hard to believe that anyone hasn't already seen the movie. I'm 57 and I'll bet I've seen &quot;Miracle&quot; 50 times. Every year somewhere between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve I watch it again and every year I laugh in the same places, somehow surprised over and over even though I know most of the dialogue by heart. I also develop a few little tears here and there, also at the same scenes year after year. And every year I find some new little detail that I've missed. <br />Well, perhaps I'm a little too sympathetic having been born on Christmas, but I can't imagine what Christmas was like before &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. It is a thoroughly delightful movie that could not be improved on by the two remakes since its production in 1947.<br />Add it to your Christmas collection.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|i have never like britney spears and when i heard this cd at my friends house, i hate her singing even more. she has NO VOICE (liek always) and NO RHYTHME watsoever, and in addition to that, the music also sux. People who say some of the songs on this album are good dance songs with good beats are so wrong. Do you people even know wut a dance songs is?? it needs a good beat and good vocals too!! all these songs are are jumbled notes and her in the background moaning and singing a couple notes here and there!<br />HORRIBLE voice, bad music, bad cd!!
B00005NWLO|5.0|I admit I hadn't heard this material since I owned it on vinyl back in the late 70s.  Hearing these CDs, I was blown away.  <br />First, the sound quality: Normally, digital technology reveals analogs imperfections.  The liner notes claim the 2&quot; master was baked and fed through a vintage analog mixer.  Whatever they did, this is one of the warmest, richly textured and best mixed live albums ever.  It even makes my stock Tahoe stereo sound like a Levinson.<br />Next, Ronnie my buddie....on the original albums, due to time, they cut short many of the 20-40 second intros he does.  But these CDs have it all.  Hearing these for the first time, after knowing the music so well, added much to the enjoyment.<br />Lastly, about the band overall.  In today's climate of over marketed, hyped-up cheezy artist, I cannot believe how many quality tunes this band put out in 4 albums and under 4 years.  I can't think of another group that was as prolific.<br />Run, don't walk to get these CDs.
B0000027RL|2.0|There r a few things Id like to say.Fred Durst guy,your a retart.Thos bands u said came out over a decade after the real grunge,dumb****...<br />Ill admit this albums alright but pearl jam`s later stuff isn`t grunge,its rich kid music.Nirvana used simple catchy chords and created a fanbase that were inspired to try rock.By the way,ALICE IN CHAINS ARE THE BEST GRUNGE!!!THERE ORIGINAL.<br />Anyway,so nirvana were better.They didnt play with good guitars and be all fancy like pearl jam.<BR>Nirvana dude,IM WITH YA!!!!!!!!!!
B000002JB3|4.0|I'm a fan of Phils music mainly because my mom always played his music from when i was really little. I'm now sixteen and i love it. I think my favourite song on this CD is &quot;Just Another Story&quot;. <BR>I can't really write much seeing as most of his fans were fans when he was in Genesis, but i do love this style of music, Phil has great vocals and I admire the way he can make you feel things through his lyrics. Not a lot of artists can do that successfully these days. (Ok, maybe an exception with MJ).
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania never seems to lose the ability to entertain and bring the crowd on their feet. Back up by the Fabulous Falls she once again delivers an amazing performance. The best part of the dvd is that by owning it Shania will be able to give you a private concert in your home every single night. Delivering hit after hit from Honey I'm Home to Your Still the One. Want to hear the new songs. There on here of course I'm Gonna Getcha Good and boy does she. Love Nah! and seeing the crowd do the Nah wave great fun!
B00004T9VY|5.0|To me, I feel so close to Cat Stevens as I listen to his peaceful music. I listen to the words he sings, and I can't help but feel like I've known him my whole life- I almost feel as close to his music as I do to my own father. <br />Now I understand if your reaction to all of that is, &quot;What the hell? Who is this psycho-chick?&quot;. Get to know this album well; buy it, listen to it, listen to it again, listen to it again, and so on until you can memorize a bit of the lyrics. Then[say that with emphasis] read what I have to say about Cat Stevens over. By the end of this assignment, being that you dared to take it on, you will feel completely nourished. Word.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's first concert here in the U.S. in over 2 years and wow did she deliver one great show! You get to see the excitement of appoximately 50000 people. Who all look thrilled beyond description. The dynamic performance of Shania Twain will leave you breathless. There are 22 amazing songs. Each one will have you singing along. Shania has intertwined her classic hits beautifully with her new sure to become classic songs in this cooncert.
B000002BSG|4.0|I saw that Jamiroquai video (we all know which one).  I swore I'd get that album because that song was so good.  Years later I did.  Not only was \\"Virtual Insanity\\" good, but the title track was kick ass!  \\"Didjital Vibrations\\" is very slow, but original; I really like it.  And \\"Cosmic Girl\\" is a nice pop-type song. I didn't give this 5 stars because I didn't like every song.  But this album demands that I investigate more Jamiroquai CDz because this music is more sophisticated than most pop music I've heard.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I saw the tv special when i was watching the dvd i noticed there is footage that was not included on tv. So that alone makes this dvd a must! Shania is an incredibly talented singer whose energy never fails to come across she'll have you tapping your toes unable to sit down the entire length of the dvd. You never waste your money when you purchase something from Shania! 105 minutes of Shania is never bad. Quick camera shots during the fast songs keeps you on your toes as a viewer. Blink and you'll miss something. If you attended the concert you may even get to see yourself on camera. If you didn't attend you'll want to see what you missed out on!
B00005RHGK|1.0|Okay for some reason I can get involved in a movie/TV show extremely easily. If it's the worst thing in the world I still want to see how it ends. There are occasions however when I'll watch a movie and it just doesn't appeal to me and I don't mind not seeing the ending. This movie on the other hand I actually wanted to stop it as soon as it started. This movie was TERRIBLE. I've read the the beginning is good and then it flops from there. The beginning was the worst part. The two main characters are annoying and extreme idiots. There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie in fact it just annoyed me. I can't decide who I hated more: the boy, the girl, the old woman who rambled the whole movie, or the stupidest looking creature I have ever seen. The only reason I sat through the whole movie was because I was at someone's house who'd I never been to there house before and walking out tends to make a bad expression. I thought to myself 'Is there any way I can hate this movie any more than I already do?' Well for awhile my answer was 'No it's not possible'. That is until I found out that the director was a child molester. The only redeeming factor of this movie was the end and it's because...well for those of you who still haven't seen it and want to I wont spoil it for you. I hate it when someone spoils a movie for me so it would be hypocritical for me to do the same. Don't watch the movie, but if you do don't say I didn't warn you.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This dvd instantly became my favorite and i'm sure you'll feel the same way. The sound and the look of the video are fabulous. Shania looks so incrediblely happy. If you saw the tv special you'll find by watching the dvd 6 extra songs.No way will any fan be disappointed by adding this to your collection. If you went to the chicago concert you just might see yourself as there are plenty of fans shots.
156898443X|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It is an honest and open insight into how things touch our lives, how we come to terms with them, and how indeed 'everyday matters.'  You will have your eyes opened and with Danny's help you will find yourself looking at your world in a very different way and you will find it a much nicer place to be than you may have thought before.  Buy it and then buy it for all your friends.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I didn't have the pleasure of attending the Chicago concert but i got to see it on tv and now am a proud owner of the dvd. From the moment the dvd starts you will be in heaven. Shania is definitely the most amazing performer today. There are 22 mesmerizing songs in all. With fantastic upclose footage of Shania and the wonderful Fabulous Falls band that backs her up. Lots of shots of the audience who are obviously loving every single second will leave you wishing you could have been there. I will positively be buying another copy for this one will soon wear out with all the playing of it over and over and over again i'll be doing.
B000002J03|5.0|...Right on the heels of the explosive self-titled debut album, Led Zeppelin released \\"II\\", with a greater focus on rock and a bit less on blues. It is simply an awesome record, deep while at the same time very accessible.<br />I'm more of a newcomer I guess to Led Zeppelin (I've only been listening for a few months) and so I decided to take a crash course--this was my first and favorite out of all the albums. <BR>It built on the solid foundation that the debut had laid out, and it was unprecedented at the time for just how HEAVY it really was. Nothing like this album had really ever been done before.<br />\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is an explosive opener that really grabs the listener's attention and lets them know that they're in for something different. The break in the middle is awesome, makes the end that much better.<br />\\"What is and What Should Never Be\\" I have to agree with some of the past reviews--I really love it towards the end of the song when Page's guitar is moving from right to left--it adds so much dimension to the song and it's one of the best bust-outs of all time to me (up there with the one from the Stone's \\"Rocks Off\\").<br />\\"The Lemon Song\\" Good steady rocker with great beat...Plant having some fun playing with words--\\"Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg.\\" We all know what you're talking Robert. <br />\\"Thank You\\" Really great songwriting, a touching ballad-type song that's sort of accoustic. A break in the hard stuff that makes the next song seem that much heavier...<br />\\"Heartbraker\\" A great riff, a great song. Page really showing off his chops here. The solo in the middle is unbelievable. Then Bonzo's drumming really kicks into high gear until the song climaxes.<br />\\"Living Loving Maid\\" A good song, got a lot of radio play back in the day, not my favorite on the album but it's catchy as hell. Too bad it's so short though--the suits saying that singles need to be under 3 min. So much good music was degraded because of how radio workedin those days.<br />\\"Ramble On\\" I love this song, it's got such a great tune and beat. If you listen to the lyrics carefully enough you catch some Tolkien references. Just a cool song.<br />\\"Moby Dick\\" Bonzo gets to show off his drumming skills. Great hook to it. Plant takes a break to rest his throat before belting out the finale. Bonzo really was a wildman. <br />\\"Bring It On Home\\" Awesome closer that leaves you wanting more. Real music. They used it as the closer to their live set.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Whether you were at the Chicago show or not what better way to experience this concert then on the dvd. Unlike some performers Shania doesn't lip-synch she sings every note herself. The energy of the band is incredible. The costume changes. Lots of audience shots. Definitely a dvd you want to add to your growing collection.
B000002UJQ|4.0|I'm not quite as enthusiastic about Radiohead as some people are, but I'm definately not one of those idiots who can't give slightly different music a chance and gave it 1 star. That is definately not appropriate for Radiohead. This album is an inspiration and a work of brilliance. It doesn't take a genius to see that there is a great amount of talent here, and I can't really find any problem with it. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it isn't my usual preference of music styles. Nonetheless, this album is defniately worth getting. I'm sad that their other albums don't quite reach the greatness that this one does, but oh well. 4/5
B0000TB03W|5.0|Non-stop entertainment from start to finish! Scenes of fans will have you eager to get concert tickets to go to a show and see first hand all the fun. Some of the best moments are on stage with shania and the fabulous falls. Extremely Entertaining! You'll want to go to a Shania show to see for yourself!
B0000640SA|2.0|The movie was enjoyable, good performance by pierce. You all forget the biggest hole. HOW DOES HE REMEMBER HIS CONDITION!? Good premise is ruined by bad script!
B0000TB03W|5.0|From the scenes of Shania and her band playing along side one another to Shania going down into the crowd. You won't want to miss one single second. The picture comes in crystal clear as does the sound. All the songs are a must to see performed especially Juanita, men will love the shimmy Shania does while singing this song. This dvd proves without a doubt Shania owns any stage she sets foot on!
B00001ZULV|3.0|Genesis were a fine pop band in the 80's but harmless and predictable, sure. But this release totally overlooks their most important work i.e 1970's art rock with Hackett and gabriel etc.Hopefully a boxed set of that era will be released in the future as it would be far more interesting and representitive of the real Genesis music. I mean in 1000 years time will Genesis be looked upoun as one of the Michalangelos of music? Not if this is how they want their legacy to be perceived. I mean they release 17 albums and they include 5 tracks from the invisible touch, one of their weakest albums???<BR>Its a bit of a joke. EDIT: My mistake there is already a boxed set from Genesis available 1967- 1975. Clap for a dummy?
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's energy never fails. She is upbeat and enthusiastic right from start to finish. Her interaction with the crowd is effective. Many times you see the crowd sing along. The bands joy and love of what their doing and the music their playing is energizing. If you weren't a fan before this DVD will make you one!
B000055ZDT|5.0|I was praticing with my band one day and after the pratice, we went for a ride. Our bassist later on put on a mixlist of his mp3s. One song was a long bass-heavy slow song, but with Radiohead ambiences. I asked, &quot;Who is this?&quot; It turned out to be Electric Wizard, and the song was Barbarian. After downloading several of their songs from the website, I ordered a copy for myself.<br />This is the best stoner metal album ever. Everything is long and thick and heavy, and druggy. Just what a stoner metal band should sound like. Every song is a classic. &quot;Vinum Sabbathi&quot; and &quot;Barbarian&quot; are slow heavy groove songs with some great production. &quot;We Hate You&quot; could be the single off the album, but it's too good for radio. The real fine work off the album are the REALLY long songs that are 10-15 minutes.<br />&quot;Weird Tales&quot; is the first big song, and my favorite song off the album. There are 3 parts, one is very groove heavy, the 2nd part a lot slower, and the third part the heaviest thing ever recorded on tape. &quot;I, The Witchfinder&quot; is another great epic, with the longest ending ever. Jus Oborn's vocals are just awesome. There's a great effect on his vocals that makes it another instrument, instead of being up and front, like a lot of bands. Then, there's the really cool &quot;Dopethrone,&quot; which, despite saying it's 20:48, is actually 10:26. It's still cool though. It's like a longer version of &quot;Barbarian.&quot; This is a great album with some unforgettable riffs. Get it as soon as possible if you're a true heavy metal fan.
B0000TB03W|5.0|UNBELIEVABLE!!!!. Those who haven't picked it up...RUN. It's crisp, very close-up we see shots never seen before it delivers tons of energy.<BR>The tv special could not show all the energy and fun with all the commercial breaks the special on tv was great it doesn't compare to the dvd. <BR>If you've been to a Shania concert you know the woman doesn't stop the energy and vivaciousness for anything. This DVD captures Shania's breath-taking beauty and spirit and boundless energy.
B000002BYD|5.0|So to speak.. even if it's not Pearl Jam's &quot;best&quot; album, it is their most straight up timeless rock n roll album...<br />This is Pj's, &quot;led zeppelin 4&quot; album... <br />their... &quot;abbey road&quot; album, if you will...<br />But whatever album you want to call this PJ's version of, one things for sure, at least in my mind... (its better than any other album by any other band you could compare it to)
B0000TB03W|5.0|What is taking you so long?! Buy this dvd! I must say never has there been a more charismatic performer. Shania twain will have you on your feet singing and dancing along. From the first song to the last all 22 of them. You'll really see and feel the passion that shania has with every song see sings.
B00000J7JO|2.0|It's a shame such talented musicians could make such bland radio friendly pap. Parallel universe and californication are the only standout tracks. The rest of it plays like a bad self parody. Get Blood sugar sex magick of even better one of john frusciante's solo albums.
0393057658|5.0|I loved this book and when I finished the last page I was wishing that it had been twice as long.  With unparalleled access to the innner workings of the Oakland A's front office, Michael Lewis gives a rare look at a baseball organization which has broken the paradigm of Major League Baseball.  Great reading and a totally different type of baseball book. Throughly enjoyable.
B000002MUW|4.0|Madonna's BEDTIME STORIES album was her answer to all the bad press her overlooked 1992 EROTICA album received. &quot;Human Nature&quot; is her response to critics, a highlight from the album. It's a classic Madonna song in every sense. She dumped Shep Pettibone on this album and worked with producers like Dallas Austin, Babyface, and more. The sound leans itself mostly towards R&amp;B, and it seems to work for the most part. &quot;Secret&quot; was the first single, and a good hit for her. &quot;Survival&quot; is a fun uptempo song about her survival in the music industry. The title track is a great piece of music written by Bjork, but it was a little ahead of it's time so it mostly was overlooked as a single and flopped. The big hit from the album is the Babyface ballad &quot;Take A Bow&quot;. There's some nice ballads here like &quot;Love Tried To Welcome Me&quot;, &quot;Inside Of Me&quot;, and &quot;Sanctuary&quot;. The only song that I can't enjoy is the inane &quot;Don't Stop&quot;. Overall not a bad album, but not great either.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|If a christmas album, by a rock group, could win a grammy for best record.... this is it.
B000002C4J|4.0|I have the Canadian version of this CD, which includes the song Amar Haciendo El Amor, instead of To Love You More. This was a big CD for Celine, due mostly in part to the success of the song My Heart Will Go On. The album teams her up with a lot of different producers, and guest stars. The album is made up mostly of ballads, good thing since the uptempos here are hardly worth mentioning. What is the point of Treat Her Like A Lady? Celine's own version of jamaican rap? It's horrible, I mean you have to give her credit for trying something new but sorry that just did not work! Ballads have always been her forte, and there's plenty of great ones here like Where Is The Love, Us, Love Is On The Way, The Reason, Miles To Go Before I Sleep, Immortality, Tell Him (with Barbra Streisand) and the title track. Why she covered the bland When I Need You is another mystery to be seen. Overall, not her best work but there's some great stuff here, in between the filler tracks.
B00000DFTG|4.0|When I got this CD I could tell that it wouldn't be the same. Well all the members of the bands have ten times the talent, exept Ozzy. His vocal's have changed for the worse over the last 30 years. Don't get me wrong he is still great on the CD exept for a few slip ups of his voice, exept the sad preformance of Sabbath bloody Sabbath which I usually skip over. Iron Man is terrific if you fast forward through the first minute of crowd pleasing. In short you will love this CD if you have heard the studio before, you'll love how the band (not Ozzy, though he has his moments) sounds. I'm going to have to end the review here, because the new unrealased sabbath tracks &quot;psycoman&quot; and &quot;Selling my Soul&quot;, words cannot discribe how great they are.
0790740443|5.0|I just want to thank Kurt Russell for doing this movie.  It's not often that A-list quality actors do movies like this.  Sure, it had a fairly low budget, but that never got in the way.  Every dollar is on the screen.  I'm glad I bought it; I've already seen it two or three times and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you're searching for a plot heavy, dramatic, Oscar-caliber movie, then I would urge you to keep looking. If you're a guy (or gal) who is sometimes in the mood for a good, lean, military sci-fi flic, then I urge you to check this one out.
B00005JMFR|2.0|A major let down, gloomy from start to finish. Mentioning no names but killing off two of the main charachters did not help.<BR>The likes of Larry Fishburne and Lambert Wilson are woefully under-used, two great charchters that made Reloaded great!<BR>However the final showdown between Smith & Neo stands out, a great set piece that reminds me of Superman 2!<BR>Jada pincket Smith and Marvin Gay's daughter are very sexy.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I just purchased this album three days ago ,and I love it! A lot of great dance beats, and I must say she was very brave to come out with this album. Not your typical Britney. My favorites include &quot;Outrageous&quot; and &quot;Touch of my hand&quot;. It's the only CD I have been listening to. It's Great!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This collection is packed with so many special features!!  This is the right way to treat fans.  Forget Indiana Jones and Star Wars;  They are kiddie cartoons compared with the Lord of the Rings series.
0816193940|3.0|I'm a fan of Ken Follett's work & intend to read all his stuff.  I have read 5 books so far.  This was a disappointment, though.  At first it seemed like nothing more than a historical novel bodice-buster, but then the plot did pick up.  The main problem, though, was the character of Feliks.  Follett wants to make him at least a little sympathetic, maybe a lot, but it didn't work for me.  Feliks is a big, smelly, dirty, cruel, ruthless, coldblooded Communist assassin.  The fact that he's good in the sack & glib with words does not compensate for his evil.  And can Charlotte really be that stupid?  Oh, well.  They can't all be winners.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I would like to say first and foremost that this is a good album, and is definitley worth buying if you like pop, trip hop, and mostly songs with a heavy dance beat. But don't listen for a minute when you see Britney Spears on tv saying this is the album in which she became a woman. She obviously has not yet grown at all. A true woman knows that staying out drinking and partying, passing out on random couches and having sex sex sex are not the things that make a woman a woman. This album is yet another step in how Ms. Spears is growing, but this is not the final phase of her evolution. I just hope young ladies out there don't think this is what a woman's about. Overall, nice album...but listen lightly.
B0000AI44Q|3.0|Okay, I admit it, I didn't get it until I played the bonus DVD and heard Maestro Young explain the story and the &quot;concept&quot; as he went through each of the songs. I'm more than happy to defer judgement on the audio disc until I give it a few more plays, but my initial impression is that this is a &quot;solo&quot; Neil Young album screaming to be released from its &quot;Neil Young with Crazy Horse&quot; prison. The sound is the muddy murk everybody's come to expect when Neil and the Horse team up; some people call it grungy, but &quot;goopy&quot; might be more appropriate. The live DVD, by comparison, is clear and clean, which, when you strip away everything except Young and his guitar, shows everything (including the performer) off to maximum advantage.<br />It's way past time for people to stop kissing Neil Young's rear end and call him to account when he's shooting himself in the same anatomical region. And, yes, this is still a pretty [EXPLETIVE]good album.
B00005JKC3|1.0|It's amazing how much you can be fooled by a films trailers and advertising. What looked like a good picture to watch this summer, turned out to be a major bore. This was an insult to the comic strip THE HULK , a story line that never gives the viewer the action expected, it would have been a relief if the HULK in the movie would have ended up in Hollywood and destroyed the studio and production team, ending by smashing the producer and writer,,instead, it open-ends leaving you to believe that a sequel could be better. better,,better get some sleep instead. very poor movie.
B000069AUI|5.0|There are some songs, or at least moments in songs, that can just make you cry. It happened the first time I heard Eddie Vedder scream his lungs out at the end of the chorus on a live cover of &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot;. And it happened on this album several times, including &quot;The Scientist&quot;. My God. Hearing that song for the first time is a ridiculously emotional experience. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; is a similarly powerful song. &quot;Green Eyes&quot; tends to have that same effect - I performed it live with a friend of mine, and it killed (in a good way). &quot;Warning Sign&quot; is awesome too. Other songs, like &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;Politik&quot;, etc. aren't as emotional but have their virtues, as well. &quot;In My Place&quot; is a bit cliche, but I recently got their DVD performance, and remembered what a great song that is, how happy it makes me. A fantastic album, indicative of a gift for melody that I haven't heard in God-knows how long, maybe even since, dare I say, Lennon/McCartney? Maybe not, but still, this is one album everyone should own.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended edition of the movie is even better than the original!  Lots of small clips really contribute to the story and fill in holes if you haven't read the books.  The extras are also incredible in this film.  I'm only on disc 3 and I'm already loving it.  Definitely worth the purchase!
B00005JM02|5.0|Few movies in recent years have done as impressive a job as Finding Nemo in giving us uplifting, truly fun entertainment with a wonderful message. Nemo is a nonstop journey from fear to joy, from struggle to triumph, from grasping and clutching to courageous self-abandonment. I will not say an ill word about this movie. I cannot give it less than a full five stars.<br />Pixar has put out some great movies--but none of them hold a candle to Nemo.<br />Visually this movie is unlike any of its pixar predecessors. The Toys, Bugs and Monsters of the past have all been skillfully executed. They have also all been very anthropomorphic. They not only acted like humans, they took very human forms. Not so with Nemo. This movie is set in a very believable, but wonderfully alien seascape (and aquariumscape).<br />Yet what Nemo and his Father go through is the most human of stories. The over-protected child must come of age. As is often the case, the protector (Nemo's Dad), finds that he must do likewise.<br />Nemo's Father only wants the best for his child. Yet, like too many fathers, he unintentionally fails to heed the teaching of Colossians 3:21-- &quot;Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.&quot;<br />Nemo becomes lost in his rebellion against his father's discouraging nagging. However, it is in the darkness of the proverbial &quot;far country&quot; that Nemo comes to see his life more clearly. In time he finds things inside (and outside) of himself that he never suspected were there.<br />This story of the unexpected Rite of Passage has an almost mythic power to it. Along the way we as viewers cannot help but find ourselves laughing, being moved, and--always--entertained.<br />Albert Brooks has always been on my shortlist of the best voice actors alive (listen to his guest-voice work on The Simpsons). He does not disappoint as Nemo's Dad. He and Ellen Degeneres absolutely carry this movie with their brilliant acting. Wilhelm DeFoe is wonderful as well in the role of Gill.<br />I cannot recommend this movie enough. I'm still waiting on The Return of the King, but Finding Nemo may well win my personal movie of the year award.<br />Watch it Today!ful as well in the role of Gill.<br />I cannot recommend this movie enough. I'm still waiting on The Return of the King, but Finding Nemo may well win my personal movie of the year award.<br />Watch it Today!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Those who say Radiohead simply don't care are just a bunch of people jumping to conclusions. I recently saw them in concert and all the songs they played off HTTT had as much magic as anything else. If these people really didn't care and just wrote to please then we wouldn't have a million people bashing them every time an album comes around. Everytime i play Radiohead at work someone always has to come around and change it because it's hard to apeal to Radiohead. Radiohead has a sound that evolves all the time. I mean seriously would we not get bored if we were still listening to the same sound of 'The Bends' for several years. Things change around the world as the years roll by and Radiohead change with the rest of the world. Those who criticize about not having enough guitar since &quot;Ok Computer&quot; it's still around...not as much but it still is (even if it's with some crazy effect). Keep in mind these people are talented musicians...they don't just stick to playing with one instrument like most blatant boring bands. Go out and buy this album don't remain living under a rock listening to 'the bends'. If it wasn't for everything in-between that and now we wouldn't have the truly unique Radiohead we hear in HTTT.
0553208845|5.0|Although written in 1922, Hermann Hesse's \\"Siddhartha\\" is still poignant.  Siddhartha, a young man, is the son of a Brahmin (a Hindu man of the highest caste traditionally assigned to the priesthood).  However, Siddhartha is not interested in pursuing this avenue for himself.  He wants to contemplate Self (life).  He does so by becoming an ascetic for several years then decides that he needs to experience more of life.  He turns to seek out all the pleasures of life.  From one extreme of life to the other Siddhartha comes to realize that a true life seeker cannot accept the teachings of others if he wishes to learn something himself.  He learns that true seeking is having no goal, finding means, being free and being receptive.  He realizes that wisdom is not communicable.  It cannot be taught.  Only knowledge can be taught.  In addition, truth has two sides (yours and mine), life is an illusion (things do not make you happy) and time is not real (life continues into death).<br /> \\"Siddhartha\\" will make you appreciate life.  You will find that in order to appreciate happiness you have to experience sadness.  The things that others claim make you happy will only bring you grief.  Happiness is what you make of it.  Accepting life is the road to peace.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|I would have never thought Badlands could surpass their first two cds, I was totally wrong. When I first received the Dusk cd, I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this cd. As most people know, a bands best music is usually their first efforts. I was only hoping to hear at least a resemblance of their earlier pressings. When I popped the cd into my player wow, I was totally blown away. The Dusk cd not only resembled their previous cds but also surpassed them as well. Totally rockin cd the way it should be.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This album is okay.  Has some interesting club beats, and a couple nice up tempo tracks.  Nothing substantive or revolutionary, but you wouldn't expect that from Ms. Spears.  Her vocals will never be that great.  The rancor of her in-your-face...faux-liberating-fem exhibitionism can be criticized from an intellectual standpoint, but it fits with the pace of most of this album.  As for the exhibitionism from a male standpoint: Britney, less is more!  Take that anyway you like.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain is the best female country singer at this time and this DVD proves it. She can sing, dance a little and reach out to the fans to make them feel a part of the show to. She loves her music and the talent and ability she put into this DVD is more than excellent but I cannot think of the word that would really fit the beauty of this DVD. When Shania sings the songs on this DVD you can see, feel, hear and know that she really loves what she is doing and her fans.
B000002LPD|5.0|This CD is quite simply fantastic. Every song was memorable, but I'll write my thoughts on some of my favorites.<BR>&quot;Poundcake&quot;- A terrific opener. The lyrics could've been better, but in my opinion the guitar solo more than makes up for that.<BR>&quot;Spanked&quot;- This song is a little slower, adds for a nice change of pace with a smooth bassline.<BR>&quot;Runaround&quot;- I guarantee this song will get stuck in your head.<BR>&quot;Pleasure Dome&quot;- An exciting drum-frenzy.<BR>&quot;Man on a Mission&quot;- A great song with some nifty solos and riffs.<BR>&quot;The Dream is Over&quot;- An epic song with an amazingly catchy refrain.<BR>&quot;Right Now&quot;- I'm in my early teen years, too young to remember &quot;Right Now&quot; in Crystal Pepsi commercials (or even Crystal Pepsi, for that matter). An excellent song with a catchy introduction.<BR>&quot;Top of the World&quot;- An upbeat song with some great guitar playing and vocals.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce's cd is one of the best R&amp;B albums. Although I feel like she could have added more to her album, the songs are the best. Her songs display different aspects of realtionships and love and its a cd most can relate to. I listen to her cd every morning and every night so I know her cd is good as hell. This is a cd that deserves at least 4 and 1/2 stars. Much love to Beyonce and her first solo effort.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|This is Celine's best work ... ever! I've never enjoyed Celine's English work as much as her French's and this is her most accomplished and enchanting French work to date. It's phenomenally lyrical and melodic and full of classic tracks like Mon Homme, Des Milliers De Baisers, Tu Nages, Apprandes-Moi and Rien n'est Vraiment Fini<br />This album really proves that music knows no borders or language barriers. Regardless of your familiarity level with the French language, this album will find its way to your heart in no time. Celine's angelic vocals will alleviate you to a level of music enjoyment only this album can create. It's that powerful.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Should have been released as a 2 cd set with the first cd remastered and remixed as it was originaly released and the 2nd cd containing this &quot;naked&quot; version along with some previously unreleased tracks from the Let it be sessions. A missed opportunity E.M.I. In fact I would go so far to say the whole catalogue should be rereleased as 2 cd sets with the originals being remastered and the second cd being remastered and remixed for a more up-to-date stereo sound.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has preformed one of her best ever if not the best ever preformence in Up Live in Chicago. The songs are excellent and talk about values she believes in as far as I am concerned. The total show was one that was so good it was over before I even realized the time had gone by. She could do a three hour DVD and it would seem to be only a few minutes. She is so talented that people cannot help but to love her.
B00008CLOA|5.0|It's nice 2 see pink floyd's dsotm back, which there best album by FAR! I don't have this anneversry edition, but I imagine it's just as good as the original
B00004R99J|4.0|For those of you who criticize Pocahontas because it does not protray her actual life correctly, you must remember that this movie was not supposed to be a documentation. Disney movies are aimed toward the kid audience and they have to be appealing to them. Pocahontas is a great movie, Disney did very well with it, and although the facts are not all necessarily correct, you should try and realize that they weren't supposed to be.
B0000BWVCL|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this film. The plot gets better and better as the movie progresses. The special effects are incredible and the acting put out by this awesome cast is superb. This is one of the few genuinely intelligent sci-fi flicks out there. See it!
B00008S2VG|1.0|The whiny, thin production of \\"American Life,\\" coupled with Madonna's less than satisfactory vocal talents have combined to produce an unlistenable disc of epic proportions. Forever a chameleon, Madonna flies by any current trend the world is captivated by...but for the first time, her wings have been clipped. The result: Madonna has crafted an American tragedy. She discovers acoustic guitars and combines them with her masterful electronica technique, but she must have missed the memo: the two don't mix. What ensues is about an hour of clunky, choppy, broken beats and miserable music. At times swallowed up by the jagged and uneven instrumentals, Madonna's vocals sound strained, and even, at times, damaged. <br />\\"American Life\\" is chock full of mock-irony and shallow insights into today's world. Penning a lyric like &quot;I'm not religious/ But I feel such love/ Makes me want to pray&quot; is one thing, but repeating it twenty-plus times is another. Throwing in some gospel background vocals at the end didn't hurt in Madonna's smash \\"Like a Prayer,\\" and the pulsing electronic beats in \\"Ray of Light\\" were amazing, but combining the two in the song sounds disjointed on \\"Nothing Fails.\\" The hideous, embarrassing rap on the title track only adds to Madonna's confusion on this album: is she trying to be a dance diva, a politician, or a poet?   <br />Madonna should be none of those. Ever since the opus that was the \\"Ray of Light\\" album she seems to be struggling to find herself. \\"Music\\" was an attempt to make it in today's pop world (which failed) and \\"American Life\\" contains no radio-ready material-she merely sounds dated. \\"Die Another Day\\" (from the Bond film) is the only worthy track on this album. The vocals and violin-laced orchestration are a throw back to Madonna's good times, but they also glaringly point out how terrible this album is.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is the best now but how does she compare with the greats of years past and those still recording after many years. Well this DVD puts her right in the #1 spot for all time. She has sold millons and millons of records and yet she gets down off stage and shakes hands and lets a young lady sing with the music. She has the title of the best all time female country singer as far as I am concerned and this DVD just is the latest peg in the ladder to give her the title. She has such deep caring and concern for her fans and her music. She wants to record only the best for her and her fans and this DVD provides just that the best.-
B000001EHS|1.0|Boooooooo! Def leppard suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckz. BOOOOOOO! HISSS! this album is a testimony to there horriblenesss! LAlALA! If you hate this you might like P. diityo!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Ok, I'm by no means THE CRITIC of music.  But i do consider my taste to be eclectic (Coldplay, Norah Jones, Kylie Minogue, Outkast are just a few favorites).  And I know it's the COOL THING to hate Britney and call her just another pop starlette quickly on her way out.  But that's where you're wrong. This album truly does show that her style has been kicked up a notch and is moving in a direction that i think many of her fans will see as the RIGHT step.  her voice is less the central focus as is the music, style, beats ... but it works!  This is by far her best album.  DONT LET 'EM PUT YOU DOWN BRITNEY!  YOUVE DONE GOOD!<br />FAVORITES:  TOXIC/breath on me/EVERYTIME/showdown ... oh hell! they're all pretty good!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears really can do anything. She's conquered the music world with the smash albums Baby...One More Time, Oops...I Did It Again!, and the considerably less conventional (and more well-rounded) Britney. Although the latter was considered a flop, it pointed her in a more artistic and more unique direction of electro-funk and dance-oriented music. Britney continues in that direction with her fourth, highly anticipated disc.<br />Although In the Zone has been touted as the album on which Britney reaches her womanhood, this is only partly true. Yes, she does don revealing outfits in her videos and her lyrics carry many sexual undertones, but really, is that any surprise? What is a surprise is how good this album actually is. A woman she may not be, but savvy she is. Roping in crack producers like R. Kelly, Moby, Bloodshy and Avant, the Matrix, and more, Britney's musical backdrops are deliciously orchestrated and varied, from the hip-hop stylings of the R . Kelly penned and produced \\"Outrageous\\" to the pulsing beats of Moby's \\"Early Mornin,'\\" the spectrum of music styles is amazing. Britney holds her end on the electronic portion of the offering with dance-lite cuts like the blatantly sexy \\"Breathe on Me,\\" the brash lead single \\"Me Against the Music,\\" and the Southern fried hip-hop \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" (which features the Ying-Yang Twins). But Britney also ventures into slightly more risky musical territory, with the soaring and delightfully arranged \\"Toxic,\\" the echoic Matrix-produced \\"Shadow,\\" the slick \\"Showdown,\\" and the airy grace of the sexually charged \\"Touch of My Hand.\\" But with all of the musical strides she takes, she has a flaw. She doesn't seem to be able to shake her old pop persona, as is evident in the sugary \\"Brave New Girl,\\" which is loaded with an irresistible hook and predictable subject topics. Also, \\"The Hook Up,\\" which tries to implement elements of reggae, pop, and electric guitars (?) falls just short of awful. <br />On In the Zone,Britney proves she has the versatility and staying power to remain in the music industry. She pushes all the right buttons. Although she begins to brush more serious topics (such as, umm-lets call it self love-in \\"Touch of My Hand,\\" the openness of \\"Everytime\\"), Britney's talents still seem to pepper the love/breakup/clubbing territory. Although this album definitely has Britney locked in her new musical style of club-ready danceable anthems, it still manages to be the Ray of Light of Britney's career. This album is what the teen-pop boom veterans should have created: a fun, while still serious, musically varied creation that shows credibility beyond the sugary sweetness.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's Up live in Chicago is loaded with songs that carry a meaning. Like Shes not just another pretty face tells a woman she can be what she wants to be if she just puts herself into it. I think that only Shania could come out with songs such as this and pull it off where everyone loves her and the song. She is the #1 Country female recording person at this time as far as I am concerned. She shows strenght, talent, joy, love and happiness when she preforms and it comes from the heart. It is not fake or just for the stage it is Shania.
B00005YW4H|1.0|A bright and shining piece of mediocrity, well produced but shallow and emotionally constrained. The kind of pointless superficially impressive fluff used in demonstrations at audio shows and the like.
0345452577|3.0|Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist at City Central Hospital.  Jeremy spends all his time at the hospital, mostly to forget the painful memories of his relationship to nurse Jocelyn Banks.  Jocelyn and Jeremy didn't break up, Jocelyn was murdered and her killer still roams free.<br />As Jeremy is struggling to get on with his life a new string of murders rocks the hospital...murders committed in the same fashion as that of Jocelyn, and Jeremy is the prime suspect.<br />Trying to clear his name and catch a killer, Jeremy begins his own investigation which leads him to a dark secret being kept within the hospital's walls, and as more information is found out he is drawn into a game of cat and mouse with a diabolical killer.<br />`The Conspiracy Club' starts off slow and picks up speed about half way through.  The first half of the novel is a character development study with some medical drama thrown in for good measure.  The second half kicks in with the murders and the action that leads up to a satisfactory climax.  This novel is well written and easy to read, as you would expect from Jonathan Kellerman, but the thriller aspects come into play a little too late into the novel to compare it to some of his best work.<br />Jonathan Kellerman has introduced a new character (Jeremy Carrier) in a novel that could have been explosive...the plot is very interesting, the characters are all likable and the plot twists do surprise, but...Kellerman takes too long to get things cookin and when they do the novel ends.<br />Fans of Jonathan Kellerman and his Alex Delaware series will welcome the introduction of the new character but will only be mildly satisfied with this new novel.<br />Nick Gonnella

0767817486|3.0|Barbarism, shmarbarism.<br />The opening 30 minutes of this film were quite possibly the hardest to watch as this doorknob makes one lame-brained move after another.<br />A: Smuggling a large amount drugs, through an AIRPORT, from a country through an with NO MIRANDA LAWS, in the middle of a period of EXTREME international tension from many sides. FREAKIN GENIUS!!!!<br />B: Running from the police after getting caught (you have no money Einstein, how far do you think you are going to get?)<br />C: going directly against what your told after getting incarcerated.<br />All I could think when he was dragged down and chained upside-down was &quot;YES!!

On that note, I think someone inclined to smuggle drugs through international airports will find a good many countries in many regions of the world (including the U.S.) very unaccomodating, possibly quite ugly.<br />Was a good story nonetheless. I could have done without the homoerotic shower scene
0140143505|5.0|On October 5, 1949, a woman in New York sent a letter to a London bookstore she had read about in the Saturday Review of Literature.  She was anxious to purchase a few out-of-print books, so she enclosed a list and money with her letter.  She had no idea that she had ignited a relationship through letters that would last for 20 years.  <br />Helene Hanff and Frank Doel enjoyed one of the most unusual relationships ever recorded in print.  If you're a book lover, this is one book you must have.  In less than 100 pages, you'll discover two people that embrace books with an intense passion.  Touching, funny, and personal, 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD is a great way to spend an hour or two.
B000062XM7|2.0|If you are expecting a film that is true to the novel, FORGET IT.<BR>If you want a film that is historically accurate, FORGET IT.<BR>But, if you just want an 18th Century (Okay, pseudo 18th Century) action flick, go for it. We've come a long way since the Randolph Scott version (and the silent one with Bela Lugosi as an Indian) but this could have been SOOOOO Much BETTER. The unrealistic dialog of the novel was dropped (THANK YOU) but some of the fighting sequences looked like the belonged in a Jackie Chan movie. The musical score was fantastic, (especially the opening music) the seige and massacre sequences were quite good, but it ends there. Even though reenactors provided invaluable assistance and knowledge, Mann didn't use it enough. The real saving grace for this one was Wes Studi as Magua. He didn't play the part like a cartoon character. You actually felt sympathy for his character in places.(It makes me detest the British even moreso)

B0000CAQ27|5.0|I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM NON-STOP FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS. IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT P!NK IS DARING TO TRY NEW GENRE. THIS ONE HAS A LOT OF ROCK ELEMENTS -- QUITE REMINDING YOU OF 80'S ROCK N' ROLL ERA. OH! A LITTLE ALTERNATIVE ERA TOO! BUT YOU'LL GET BORED WITHIN A MONTH'S TIME IF U JUST KEEP IT ROLLING. P!NK'S VOCAL IS GETTING PRETTY 'UNNATURAL'. HER FORCED CROAKY VOICE IS SOUNDING MORE LIKE A 'SULKY'. IT'S WORTHWHILE, BUT NOT IN A LONG RUN. IF YOU ARE A FAN, YOU CAN ADD THIS TO YOUR P!NK'S CDS COLLECTION. IF NOT, DON'T BOTHER
B00005JKC3|4.0|If you're looking for an action movie with an explosion every ten seconds, mindless dialogue, and stupid characters, HULK is NOT the movie for you.  <br />That may explain why so many people either didn't like or didn't get the movie.  Based on the Marvel Comics mag \\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" the film version stays somewhat faithful to the original: Scientist Bruce Banner becomes exposed to gamma rays, causing him to transform into a gigantic green...well, Hulk.  Banner's colleague and former love, Betty Ross, tries to help him discover the mysteries of Banner's power and his troubled past.  The problems mount when Betty's father, four-star General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross, is obsessed with putting Banner away, as he did with Banner's father thirty years earlier.<br />What probably bored some movie-goers was the film's slow pace.  A good 45 minutes goes by before any real action happens, but those 45 minutes lay the foundation for the rest of the building.  The performances and the writing are both good, but the screenplay is excellent.  Director Ang Lee knows that any good film (action or otherwise) HAS to focus on characters, and this one does.  Action is not the name of the game here, it's character.  HULK is more about family, relationships, our past, and how we cope with them than it is about a big green galoot tossing tanks around.   <br />Lee's use of split-screen and other photographic effects is outstanding.  You really can't imagine telling aspects of this story WITHOUT split-screen.  And Hulk himself?  For me, the look and feel of the character was entirely believable and realistic.  <br />On the negative side?  I can't give the movie five starts, but I'd give it 4.5 if I could.  The movie does drag on a little too long and at times tries to cover too much ground.  But the thing that really irks me is Universal's \\"Coming Attractions\\" that run roughshod over the viewer, not even allowing you to skip to the main menu.  Really irritating, Universal.  I'll remember that the next time I consider purchasing a Universal product.  <br /> But enough ranting.  For a non-mindless action flick, give HULK a try.<br />137 minutes
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic was one of the top five hip hop albums of all time. With his first album Nas mastered all the main citeria's which makes an album a classic with incredible lyrics, a strong flow, and a genuine mature older man style which helped to bring hip hop attention back to the east coast in the early 90's. Even with the limited production and old school beats illmatic is far better than the commercial garbage most MC's put out now just to run the money out of your pockets. Even some of the so called brillaint MC's that hates on Nas style sampled and stole the way he sound and his style (Ex Jay-Z). If your thinking about buying illmatic it's definitely worth the money, pay no attention to the commercial fans opinion on hip hop, they're mindless zombie's with no true appreciation for hip hop.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I thought this was a better story than the first. Without the Wolverine character this would be another super hero movie. I can see why there are plans to make Wolvie star in his own film. Hugh Jackman carries the story.<br />Well, on to my review....with the mutant registration act the government believes the X-Men pose a threat to society.  It has a great battle scene when the dark forces of Washington D.C. decide to raid the school of mutants. Wolvie has a few more beserker rages in this one but they are not the gory mess I'd thought they might portray. This film is just like a Chris Clearmont scripted X-Men saga. And I have to wonder why the producers didn't get him involved in the story process.<br />If it wasn't for writers like Chris Clearmont... and lets not forget artists Jim Cockrum and John Byrne; the X-Men would have never got off the ground in the mid seventies.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|I first saw alien several years ago on t.v. Ever since then, I have been a huge fan. I isnstantly rented Aliens and Alien 3 and loved them the same. It was when Alien: Ressurection came out that I first saw one of these movies in the high quality format of a theatre. I must say, I was astounded. It is for this reason that I was delighted when I heard the quadrilogy was being released on DVD. And what's more, with alternate endings. I cannot wait. However, if you are worried about the R-ratings scarring your younger ones, besides occasional language, the entire collection is PG-13 in my opinion. Whether you are a big fan of the Alien series, or just enjoy a good action/horror film, the Aliens Quadrilogy is right for you.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Subtle, sublime, and nearly perfect -- I've listened to this CD hundreds of times and I *still* get shivers up and down my spine.<br />Like most great works of art, it takes time to really appreciate it's subtleties and beauty.

0743424425|5.0|Stephen King really outdid himself this time with my favorite book of all time. You fall for the characters almost immeadiately and you feel their pain and their happiness. I thought this book was extremely creepy and it toyed with my mind. Just when I thought that ghosts couldn't get you during the day I was soon watching around the corner and pushing open the shower curtains at a much faster speed than what most people are used to. If you saw THE SHINING with Jack Nicholson in it, be prepared for a shock because it is nothing like the movie at all. I truley think it was his best work and is a MUST read.
B00004YWEA|5.0|What would the world be without AC/DC? A lot less sexist, that's for sure. But despite the band's misogynistic mischief, \\"Back in Black\\" remains my most treasured hard rock album. The album's brutal beats, crisp guitar grooves, and delightfully guttural vocals offer a kind of raw redemption for the the band's debasing lyrics. On this album, AC/DC ministers the perfect marriage between soulful blues and slammin' rock and roll. The best part about \\"Back in Black\\" is its refreshing lack of pretense; unlike many hard rock albums from the same era, it's a polished but pure package, trading in cheap gimmicks for jagged sincerity. Cacophony never sounded so good.

B00005JKC3|4.0|Distant memories from my teen years were brought back by this new release, and I must confess that the original series' recollection was stronger than Ang Lee's movie. <BR>However, the director must be praised for his ability to tell us the whole story within less than 2 hours. Hulk is convincing, Nolte is perfect in his madness, Sam Elliot was the right actor for the role.<BR>But Jennifer is the binding substract the gives the film a credible and quite pleasant entertainment. Although we could not expect A Beautiful Mind's replay, Jennifer continues to grow as an exceptional actress, where her sensitivity and incredible beauty merge to make us believe that tear drops from her green eyes are little diamonds...
B00005JM02|5.0|The entire family loved this one.  It shows why a child should listen to their parents and the value of friendship.  Great Film
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I'll admit: I'm biased against current rock and alternative music, as most of it is generic waste. But Manu Chao is an outstanding original. The elusive Mr. Chao, former Manu Negra frontman, is a brashly inventive wellspring of talent, churning out quirky, catchy, funky tunes that embody seemingly every musical style in existence. I love the Zen zaniness exhibited on some songs (\\"Me Gustas Tu\\"), and the luxurious beauty of others (\\"Denia\\"). The musician's eclectic soul must be owed to his roots: he hails from southern France, but lives as a nomad of sorts in Latin America. Chao sings mainly in Spanish, but he displays an impressive multi-lingualism, crooning in his native French, as well as in English, Portuguese and even Arabic. Indeed, on some songs Chao mixes French and Spanish with such facility that it's easy to forget that they aren't the same language. Manu Chao embodies a true world music ethos, with a bohemian twist.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|&quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is one of the best albums that I have ever heard. I put it in my stero and positioned the 4 speakers all around me, and if I didn't open my eyes, I would swear to God that I was in Apple Studios. It was simply amazing. I don't know what they did, but I wish that they did it to every album.<br />I have only 1 problem with this album. &quot;I've Got A Feeling.&quot; I wish they kept the origial version. The guitars are to stinking soft! That part after John sings, and then he plays that opening riff realling loud, that is the best part of the whole song! I wanted to cry after I heard &quot;naked&quot;'s version. <br />But, for the rest of the album, I have nothing but praise. &quot;For You Blue&quot; is one of those songs that it sounds like your there. I will admit, I hated &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; until I heard it on &quot;Naked.&quot; WOW!!! It simply blue me away. All of the rest of the songs great. Especially &quot;Across The Universe&quot;. The best part is at the end where John's voice fades away. That is cool. &quot;Let It Be&quot; is the same, except the solo is the one that you see George play in the &quot;Let It Be&quot; movie. And, also, the third verse is different. <br />To wrap it up, it doesn't matter what songs are on it, as long as it is the Beatles singing and playing. This is one of my new favorites!
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Capitol recoreds relased a different version in 1982 for LP and Cassette with side 1 featuring either extended intro's or small musical differences in the music I noticed hold back the rain was longer hungry like the wolf had a longer intro my own way was diffferent and a little longer in the middle I think.  Almost all of side 1 was remixed but side2 I think stayed the same.  The 9 track remastered cd time is 42:41 where as the tape runs to 47:16 (give or take a few seconds) Thats almost 5 MINUTES LONGER. I think capitol should re-release this one in its proper form. I am still giving this cd 5 stars despite the short length of the disc when compared to the tape.  Before I go I saw these guys back in July at The Joint in Las Vegas they were fabulous.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|The best thing since ol' ACDC, (which happens to be a band they admire) Jet has brought back rock and roll that rocked. With pure sounding, rock sound and punk leather attitude, Jet is a refreshing break from todays emo and generic so-called &quot;rock&quot; like Good Charlotte. &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; brings back the good old tamborine and simple yet great guitar. And songs like &quot;Rollover DJ&quot; makes you want to don your old leather jackets and fluff up your hair, and rock your heart out. This is rock the way it is supposed to be, and I think ACDC themselves would by this CD!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Holly thats all i could say when i saw it in the theater it provoked the mind and stylimated it with the quick plot and the amazing fights and i cant even comprehend why people dont like if you are reading this review WACH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW.<br />Heres a message to all the people who dont like it its boyond your tiny little minds and this movie is beyond your comprehension.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this CD is so good....keep up the good work britney!!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|If you thought his first cd was great, you'll be blown away by this one.  I love it when you can listen to an artist's different works and hear them mature and, as unbelievable as it sounds, Josh has.  My favorite songs would have to be Oceano, My Confession, and Remember When It Rained.  Josh has made his songs much more deep and I absolutely love it!  I hope he stays around for a very long time because it's very hard to dislike ANY of the songs on this cd or his other.  I garuntee anyone would like this cd and I encourage everyone to buy it.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Having been a Bowie fan for many years, it's no surprise that I've followed his recordings in the 90's with due interest and curiosity and I always get enormously excited when I hear of a new release by one of my all-time favourite artists. I also think it's hilarious, and some people may agree with me, that every single Bowie album in the 90's has been declared as &quot;his best since 'Scary Monsters'&quot;...no matter what! I always roll my eyes whenever I read that. I think some people cling to an unnecessary air of nostalgia, especially when considering a music artist that's been around for more than 20 years. It's an unfair wish, really, to EXPECT an artist to keep making music that sounds the same as their past material. What keeps somebody like Bowie in the music business in the first place, if not the need to experiment with different sounds and styles? I think a lot of folks forget that the much-hallowed 'Scary Monsters' (which is one of my favourite albums) was yet another of his more brilliant experiments not only with sound and atmosphere but also with image...as the two are inextricably linked more times than not for Bowie.<BR>That being said, let's move on to &quot;Reality&quot;. When I first heard &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, I was breath-taken! I thought to myself, &quot;Bowie is in the mood to rock!&quot; In fact, the entire album has an inescapable, driving energy that's not really been present since &quot;Earthling&quot;. &quot;hours...&quot; and &quot;Heathen&quot; were both pretty sombre, introspective works, with some wonderful rock-out songs but for the most part intensified in a more laid-back and emotional approach. &quot;Reality&quot;, in Bowie's own words, is more a collection of songs. But I have to say, &quot;New Killer Star&quot; is one of my new favourites from Bowie, which is destined to rank right up there for me with &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;...and &quot;Station to Station&quot;...and &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;...and &quot;DeadMan Walking&quot;...and &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot;...and, well, you get the point. LOL  It's one of those songs that really wakes you up and gets you moving with its raw energy, similarly tracks from &quot;Reality&quot; that share this are &quot;Looking For Water&quot;, &quot;Reality&quot;, and &quot;Never Get Old&quot;. I think with several years to delve into more contemplative territory Bowie was ready to let off some steam with this record, and it definately pays off.<BR>A moody masterpiece is fittingly the closing track for &quot;Reality&quot;, &quot;Bring me the Disco King&quot;, which I believe is a song Bowie wrote many years ago but just recently chose to record. I'm glad he waited so long, because this song is a sure-fire treat to Bowie fans. The cavernous drums, dramatic piano playing by Mike Garson, the overlap of textures and atmospheres, and...of course...Bowie's unmistakable, immortal croon...make this one for the ages. Definately a song to put the candles on for.<BR>All in all, I think Bowie &amp; Visconti have produced a great album. Whether or not it's &quot;the finest since Scary Monsters&quot; is irrelevant in my eyes. I think everything he's ever made has some brilliance in it, some more so than others but everything is of a great level of quality and I find that missing in most music today. I do know that &quot;Reality&quot; won't leave my CD player for many weeks to come, maybe even months!!...and I'll definitely be eager for another release by this incomparable artist.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|01 Me Against the Music (9/10)Catchy song ...i like it!<BR>02 Boom Boom (8/10) Good song...<BR>03 Showdown (9/10) Like the beat and the Lyrics<BR>04 Breathe on me (10/10) My favorite song of the album....i like how britney sings in it...<BR>05 Early Mornin' (6/10) Don't like it that much!<BR>06 Toxic (10/10) My second favorite song...like the beat of the song :)<BR>07 Outrageous (9/10) Its really good..but not my favorite!!!!<BR>08 Touch of my Hand (10/10) I like this song so much!!!!!!!<BR>09 The Hook up (6/10) Dont like it that much either!<BR>10 Shadow (9/10) Good ballad<BR>11 Brave new girl (8/10) The intro is cool but later it changes form &quot;rap&quot; to pop....its ok!<BR>12 Everytime (10/10) her best ballad ever....love it!
B00004TDRD|3.0|these movie wasnt toooo bad i did not not not not like the shark fx but the plot and actors were great! thats all.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|To all of you people that were talking bad about britney....shut up....this is her best work yet....2 songs are kinda boring ....but overall the cd is GREAT!!!.....i think you should go and buy it(if it was a bad CD why would it be the #1 CD on the billboard charts???)
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I liked her music when she first started, but as of lately, my wife and I have lost respect for her, as she seems to dress with less and less cloths.  No wonder there are so many rumors going around about her, and she wonders how they all start, the first place she should look is in a mirror.  I pay for the CD to listen to the music not for the \\"Sexy\\" appeal of the artist.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm not a britney fan but i have to say that this CD rocks...its different from her other CDs because there are different kinds of beats.......i would strongly recommend that you buy it...because its her best work yet......The other CDs are ok too....
B00005OM4N|4.0|TRUST me, i'm NO britney spears fan.... really.... when my friend told me she had this CD i was shocked.... but when i listened to it, i found myself singing along, or dancing, when it comes down to it, the beats are just too catchy on this CD for u to ignore... i don't like every song, but here are the good ones:<BR>1) I'm A Slave 4 U - a great dance track<BR>2) Overprotected - a fun song to sing, i can relate to the lyrics<BR>3) Lonely - good beats<BR>4) Boys - the remix is infinitely better, but the original is tolerable<BR>5) I Love Rock 'N' Roll - i like this mostly because i liked the original<BR>6) Cinderella - though i don't like the lyrics that much, it's still fun to sing to<BR>7) Bombastic Love - probably my favorite track right now, i don't know why, i just love the chorus and opening beats (&quot;bombastic&quot; IS a real word, by the way, to the reviewer before me..... try looking in a dictionary)<BR>8) What It's Like To Be Me - i think justin's voice is a nice addition<BR>the other songs i just skip over.... i really DISLIKE &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;... it's just a bunch of whiny fluff. and it reminds me of crossroads, which i hated. <BR>that aside, this is a pretty good CD... i'm not a professional reviewer so don't expect me to have commented on things like songwriting, etc, i just listen to the stuff and my point is, i can listen to it without experiencing (extreme) nausea, so.... there you have it.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Following the well-deserved success of the 2001 film &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, director Chris Columbus returned in 2002 with the impressive sequel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;.  Based upon the children's books written by acclaimed author J.K. Rowlings, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; is a much darker tale than its predecessor. As the famous Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) prepares to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his second year, he is saddened by not having heard all summer from his good friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).  One night, while his Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and his cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) are preparing to entertain important guests, Harry gets an unexpected and unruly visitor:  Dobby the House Elf (voice by Toby Jones).  Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts this year because he would be in serious danger, but Harry refuses to heed Dobby's warning.  Dobby then gets Harry into some serious trouble, but Ron and his twin brothers Fred and George (James &amp; Oliver Phelps respectively) rescue Harry from the Dursley's in their father's flying car.  Harry &amp; Ron eventually get to Hogwarts, but get into more trouble.  Also, suspicion towards Harry grows as people and animals start to become petrified with warnings written in blood that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened.  Can Harry find out who or what is behind it all before Hogwarts is shut down, and will he understand that he really belongs in Griffindore?<br />Returning Hogwarts staff in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; include Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Professor Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris, 1930-2002), Argus Filch (David Bradley) and groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).  Hogwarts new Professor Against the Dark Arts is the acclaimed author Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), and the magical plants professor is Professor Sprout (Miriam Margolyes).  Also returning is ghost Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese, who is well known for his work in the British TV comedic series &quot;Monty Python&quot;) and students Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), the obnoxious Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and Percy Weasley (Chris Rankin).  In addition to Mrs. Weasley (Julie Waters) is her husband Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) and their young daughter Virginia 'Ginny' Weasley (Bonnie Wright), who is going to Hogwarts as a first-year student.  Draco's father Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) is also introduced and illustrates where Draco got his attitude.  Also introduced at Hogwarts is another of its many ghosts, Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) and a past student named Tom Marvolo Riddle (Christian Coulson).  <br />It was very sad when long-time actor Richard Harris passed away shortly before the theatrical release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;.  He was twice nominated for Best Actor by the Academy Awards for his work in the 1963 film &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; and the 1990 film &quot;The Field&quot;.  He was well known for his work in the 1967 musical &quot;Camelot&quot;, in which he played King Arthur, as well as his leading roles in the films &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; (1970), &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1970), &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) and, of course, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; (2001).  Though Michael Gambon will play the character of Albus Dumbledore in future Harry Potter films, Richard Harris' contributions to these plus his other film roles will never be forgotten.  Thank you Richard Harris.<br />Memorable scenes in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; include the flying cake, the flying car scenes, the chimney, the bookstore, the whomping willow, the spiders, Moaning Myrtle, the transformation spell, Professor Dumbledore's office, the challenge with Draco, the chamber, and the final scenes.  Overall, I rate &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's a wonderful film that I highly recommend to everyone.
B00009V7T2|5.0|No way to sum this album up. It is flawless. It had to grow on me first though. But after that, it was all uphill. I love it how you notice little new things everytime you hear it. Also, I would highly recommend listening to this on headphones to hear everything that's going on.
6305508550|5.0|This movie is very funny, its not just for office people. Many many laughs and few stupid parts. Seriously if you havent seen this youre missing out!
B000084T18|1.0|i think it's disgusting how much hype this guy gets for his mediocre crap.  it seems that getting shot can't make you a good rapper, and 50 cent is living proof.  he can have all the street credibility in the world but it doesn't mean he has any substance.  like many others have said, this is mtv stamp of approval carrying tripe.  maybe he'll win like 10 grammy's so he can hang out with will smith and the other pop bs that passes for hip hop these days.
6305692572|3.0|This is just an OK movie I dont see whats so great about it. Meg Ryan's character is a drunk Andy Garcia is her husband and wants her to get clean blah blah blah. At least Meg isnt all perky in this one. In most of her films I want to bash her face in. 3 stars.
0064407667|5.0|The Baudelaires have led a comfortable life with their parents in their wonderful home. But on a particularly cloudy day at Briny Beach, their lives are shattered-The word shattered here means, \\"Their lives were ruined like a window being broken into a million pieces.\\" The curious Lemony Snicket uses this new approach to grammar and definition to tell the tale of the three Baudelaires, (Sunny, Klaus, and Violet) who were once the most fortunate children ever. In a heartbeat, everything changes. A fire consumes the Baudelaires' house, and their parents' lives. The well-intentioned, yet slightly daft, Mr. Poe now has the responsibility to find the Baudelaire children, now the Baudelaire orphans, a new home. He soon finds them shelter with a distant relative, who doesn't live so distant from the Baudelaire's old home. His name is Count Olaf, an evil man who is only keeping the children for his own benefit. The greedy count wants to steal their immense fortune, which Violet will inherit in four more years. In their first unfortunate adventure, the children encounter the friendly Justice Strauss, Count Olaf's cruel acting troupe, a very helpful cookbook, and a play with a script that could ruin it all. Will the quick minds of the orphans prevail, or will Count Olaf grab the fortune and win the game? Once I finished book one, I was begging for book two. Lemony Snicket's humorous writings are amazingly captivating from the first word to the last, a rare trait found in only the best books. Make sure if you read book one, you have book two and maybe even book three near by just to be safe, because even though these books are full of adventure and excitement, you'll find them to be quicker than you thought...unfortunately.
6305127646|5.0|I love this movie Val Kilmer plays a spy set out to steal a scientific formula from Elisabeth Shue. This movie is a lot of fun and a not too romantic. The soundtrack/score is GREAT.
0440237688|5.0|This book is amazing. The main character, Jonas is faced with some very important decisions to make. His experience mirrors that which many young people go through. Though his experience and world is fictional, he has to make very real decisions based on exposure to the truths and harsh realities that life can bring.<br />For Lowry's treatment of that issue alone, I think that \\"The Giver\\" is worth picking up for ANYone!!!
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Sandra Bullock's character goes to rehab. She hates it at first then sees she should be sober. Its a funny movie thats not very preachy and it has good characters. The dvd has cool features like how to make that gum wrapper chain thing, and actual scenes from Santa Cruz.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Somebody said:<BR>&quot;A public forum is not the place for half-ass opinions on art&quot;&gt;<BR>Sure it is, it's exactly the place for it. Intellectual opinions, gut-reaction opinions, silly opinions, they all fit right here.  All anyone needs to do is care about music and then they've got every right to express their opinion; they don't need to establish any music creds for their opinion to be just as valuable as the next. Someone involved in the music world  can't be relied on to have better taste in music or any special bility to discern what's good -- as a matter of fact, the layman is more objective and probably can tell the crap from the sublime better than the &quot;expert&quot;.  Any other point of view is pure elitism.  As for this album, though, it's great!
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Great tribute to rock. Contains great classics like &quot;Immagrint Song&quot; and &quot;Fight&quot; and much more. Jack Black may not be the greatest rocker of all time but he certainly does his part to keep ROCKING and gain fans for ROCK Music. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK JACK. <br />ALSO see the movie it's funny and entertaining
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I don't understand why they're getting bad review's they are the most mainstream rock band and people go and slash out at them...its so stupid just let them be the band that they are....i mean these guys plasy show's everynight though ive never been but i mean they put alot of work into what they do so just let the musci be the work it was put effort in into let it be what it is......and how hard it took to make<br />anyway's to sum this up this cd has some nice bonus tracks from various complation's...Someday is a great 1st single to sell record's but its no how you remind me...Flat on the floor is heavy and i like that im a metal head liek Korn.....and Figured you out is trhe best song on this Cd its really awesome and my favorite by nickelback
B00005R23S|5.0|Simply amazing, hours of feeling like you are at this magical concert, this is what music is all about...!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|first off, what was that critic talking about? radiohead doesnt have hooks? the song let down alone has more hooks than a whole oasis album.theyre great pop melody writers before anything else.they use great wierd chord progressions as well.thats the first reason you get into this band.<BR>       the melodies are great, the playing is superb, the lyrics are kind of abstract for a pop band which makes it all the more interesting.however, the key to this record is the production.its a depressed record.almost druggy in some spots but it still gives off a feeling of being crafted just so.some songs are nearly gothy.<BR>       its a great record.id say in a 3 way tie for second with automatic for the people, slanted and enchanted.its obvious what the first one is.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|For everyone who is in doubt, just buy it! It 's alive and kicking! The european crowd going nuts, jumping up and down! It is early in the tour, the arena pre-tour, so the athmosphere is brilliant and filled with hardcore fans only, which shows..! I got goosebumps all over of seeing the boss again.. it seems like years ago...
B0000AXE8I|5.0|If you like chase scenes, then you MUST have this movie.The creators of \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" must be awestruck by this flick.<BR>Unfortunately, this movie doesn't cause you to ponder the possibilities of our existence like \\"The Matrix\\" did. In the first Matrix, Morpheous asks, \\"What IS real?\\" And, the viewer thought about that question for quite some time after leaving the theater. There is no such thought-provocative material in \\"Reloaded.\\" But, this is not to suggest you won't be entertained by \\"Reloaded\\" - you most certainly WILL be entertained.<BR>It's excellent for its FX; plenty of eye candy; and it will leave you anticipating the third and final installment in the series.
B00006G8FS|5.0|A must have for any Arrested Development fan!
B0000E1WNV|2.0|The performance by Bruce and the Band are great. I have been waiting for this DVD ever since May after seeing a couple of shows. I am also very disappointed. Not in the performance by  2 things.<br />1. The sound quality is definitely not what it should have been. It isn't as clear or as full as the Live in NYC DVD. Bruce sounds like he is singing in a tunnel, Max's drums sound very light weight.  The whole sound seems dominated by vague keyboard and violin. This is incredible when you think there are 3 big guitar players there. But the guitars are barley audible.<BR>2. While the Barcelona show was great and the crowd very responsive, I would have opted for a show played in front of an English speaking audience. The dialogue seems missing, although there wasn't as much anyway on this tour. Bruce played nearly 150 different songs on this tour and what do we get 24 songs with only 13 we haven't seen before. Great, put the whole show out, but with a concert of this magnitude, it should have been Bruce putting out a 4 disc set, not the washed up Stones for heavens sake. All those different tracks we've never seen before are out there. Hope someone comes to their senses and re-issues this. Even Ramrod was not the version with the great piano solo by Roy missing. And it would have been great to see 7 nights to Rock  The first thing I would do would be, I'd fire O'Brien and Didia for mixing this poor excuse of a DVD. It almost seems as though it was stuck out there early to cash in on Christmas sales, something I wouldn't think Bruce would do.
B000001E7L|5.0|Music bands come and go. Some come and stay for a long time. Others come for a brief moment and leave afterwards never to be heard from again. The Cranberries can fall in both categories depending on what your point of view is on the 90's rock music scene or just this particular Irish band. One thing is for sure, &quot;No Need To Argue&quot; is a timeless work of art. The album mixes rock 'n roll with a nice cozy sentimental feel that would make any person weep. The album is brilliant really and I would have to be a biased reviewer here and say that I judge this album on my personal account on what it means to me personally. In other words, I love this album.<BR>From the beautiful hum and sing along tune 'Ode To My Family', to the deeply moving '21', 'The Icicle Melts', and 'Disappointment', the albums carries you along a flow of groundbreaking songs one track after another. To be honest, there isn't a bad track on 'No Need To Argue' even if I tried to find one. The music, the singing, and the lyrics all shape up together beautifully to form a masterpiece. Standout tracks, however, are 'Zombie' which remains to be one of The Cranberries most famous songs and one of the best songs written in the 90's; 'Ridiculous Thoughts' is the most haunting track on the album that plays with your ears and your senses for as long as it is, and its Dolores O Riordan's vocals that makes this song as well as all others an exciting listening; 'Dreaming My Dreams' is a beautiful love ballad and so is 'I Can't Be With You',; 'Ode To My Family' is as the titles states a beautiful ode to the closest people in your life. <br />Since 1994, when this album was released, The Cranberries have failed to equal the power and originality of 'No Need To Argue' They probably won't ever even if they tried to but who would need to prove himself after giving an excellent example of what a music album should sound like?<br />The Cranberries should enjoy what a successful album they put together here, andyou should too!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I concider myself a really big Britney fan, but once the newness of this album wore off on me, I realized it's a boring trainwreck of an album. <br />All of the songs are Britney's scream of her loss of innocence. This album seems waay to eager to please and to get Britney some credit back because so many people dont like her. Im not expecting Britney to be deep, but these songs are all meaningless. If one more song featured a line about her low-rise jeans, her ass or her belly, the whole cd could be turned over to some clothes company to mass-produce an advertizing campain. <br />If the songs arent about Britneys assets...its about Britney shaking them at a club. This album is completely entirely boring and pointless once the newness of it rubs off.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is an amazing spectacle directed by the best filmmaker in Hollywood today, Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs), and starring Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction), David Carradine (Death Race 2000), Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day), Daryl Hannah (Wall Street), Lucy Liu (Lucky Number Slevin), and Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs). <br /> <br />Kill Bill is a revenge tale that wastes no time in delivering a heavy dosage of blood, Samurai swords, and quirky dialogue. From the opening credit scene, we are introduced to the blood-splattered and very pregnant 'The Bride', or Black Mamba, played by Thurman, all beaten up and unconscious. Not even a minute later, The Bride confronts the first of the 5 people who betrayed and attempted to kill her, Vernita Green, played by Fox. The bloody battle goes down in Green's lovely home before her daughter returns from school and interrupts them. This is just one example of how Kill Bill, or shall I say Tarantino, mixes humor with hardcore violence. It turns out that The Bride used to be in a group of professional killers called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, or DiVAS, that, besides Green, included the leader of the pack Bill, played by Carradine, a one-eyed blonde maniac named Elle Driver, played by Hannah, a Japanese gang leader named O-Ren Ishii, played by Liu, and Bill's trailer dwelling brother Bud, played by Madsen. The Bride wants to kill each and every one of them starting with Vernita, then Ishii, then Bud, and Elle, then, finally, the head honcho Bill.  <br /> <br />Kill Bill Volume 1 covers The Bride's revenge spree that takes on only the first two characters. However, with a character background study on Ishii, shot in animation, and The Bride traveling to Okinawa to meet Hattori Hanzo, an infamous Japanese-steel sword maker, played by legendary Samurai-movie actor Sonny Chiba, so he can build her the most fatal weapon on earth, extends the movie's running time to over 2 hours. The other three on The Bride's list are taken care of in the equally long and outstanding Volume 2. <br /> <br />Kill Bill has been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. It is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films, along with it's sequel, of the first decade of the millennium. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A <br />
B000002IWH|4.0|&quot;The Crow&quot; soundtrack (which is dedicated to the memory of the late Brandon Lee who died while filming the movie and will always be remembered by the part he plays, whether he likes it or not) opens with a spellbinding, quintessential &quot;Crow&quot; song: &quot;Burn&quot; by The Cure, a song linked to the transformational movie scene where Eric Draven (Lee) decorates himself in white foundation, black leather and lipstick after revisiting his trashed apartment. Machines of Loving Grace's &quot;Golgotha Tenement Blues&quot; (#2) and Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (#4) follow in this same ambiance, keeping with the dark moodiness of the film. The heavier, more aggressive side to this soundtrack can found in tracks like [#9] &quot;The Badge&quot; by Pantera, [#10] &quot;Slip Slide Melting&quot; by For Love Not Lisa, and [#11] &quot;After the Flesh&quot; by My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult--all favorites of mine. After this last song, I generally turn the CD off before the remaining three sappy tracks, which wrap up with the Jane Siberry tune that's titled after the words in the movie: &quot;It can't rain all the time.&quot; If you're a fan of this 1994 dark fantasy--or you just like the majority of alternative rock bands/artists on here--then this soundtrack is certainly worth owning. It's a great piece of &quot;The Crow&quot; nostalgia.

B0000E1WKE|4.0|This Christmas album is a must-have for your Christmas collection.  The arrangements are fantastically well-done with plenty of new twists on old standards.  Although Whitney's voice is not what it was on her debut thru greatest hits albums, it's notably better than her last album, Just Whitney.  Her voice sounds like it's in a healing, transitional phase, but is well on its way back to its old ethereal form.  But if you weren't comparing her voice to her earlier work, she really sounds fantastic.  The album is a true joy, and has certainly become one of my top 3 favorite Christmas albums.
0385504209|3.0|I had told my friend how much I had wanted to read this book. I must've been crazy or something. And she just came to school the next day with a huge box in her hands and gave it to me. Yes, this book is not cheap. Borrow it before you buy it. Please, it's a waste of your money.<br />First off, I am Christian, and I knew I'd be insulted by the book, but nevertheless I started reading it. If you're Christian, I suggest you count to a 100 a couple times, bang your head against the wall and realize this book is going to contradict everything you've ever believed.<br />The book is entirely biased, which isn't suprising since it is a piece of fiction. But it annoyed me to a certain point.<br />The middle and towards the end of the book was so boring and dragging, I fell asleep, more than twice. Descriptive, that's great, elaborating, that's fine, dragging, I hate.<br />It's sort of like the latest Harry Potter book, dragging and boring, but you read it because everyone said it was good.<br />One part disturbed me a whole lot. People say that I'm pretty immature to say this, but it was a whole lot disturbing. I don't really know why I thought of it as disturbing, since many other books have similar situations, but the fact that it was some book that was dealing with a serious situation it sort of ticked me off.<br />It's well written, if not, I would've given it a 1 or less than that. I usually read books over and over again. I don't plan on touching this book again any time soon.

B0000DDPEQ|4.0|This is an incredible piece of work. The entire lyrics of the Let It Be... Naked CD have been painstakingly translated into Japanese by Yoko Ono. The vocal tracks of each song have been removed and replaced with Paul McCartney, Julian Lennon and Dhani Harrison singing these lyrics in Japanese! When Dhani and Julian sing solo it's quite difficult to tell their voices from those of their famous fathers especially in Japanese, and when the voices blend in harmony it's impossible! It's such a heartwarming treat to know the Beatles have gone so far out of their way for the sake of their Japanese fans.<br />Nah! I'm pulling your leg. This is the same as the domestic version with only a Japanese lyric sheet added.
B00005QB42|5.0|I have a large CD collection, including many, many New Age-type CDs.  This is one that I come back to, again and again, in a hundred different situations.  It soothes me on a plane, it makes wonderful background music for almost anything except housecleaning, and just generally makes me feel good.<br />A diverse collection of people have heard this and loved it, from my mother-in-law to neighbor kids.  I played it continuously when my grandmother was ill and dying, and while I'm not sure what it did for Grandma, all the caretakers and family members said that it brought them great peace.<br />I'm buying &quot;Love Is Space&quot; today as a gift for my mother, who also loved &quot;The Essence&quot;.  If you are looking for something with a beat and a variety of tunes, look elsewhere, but if you want hauntingly beautiful healing music that washes over you in soft waves, then buy Deva Premal.
B00003CXXM|4.0|CIA intrigue, political assasins, an amnesiac hero, cool car chases, a lovely damsel in not too much distress, what more can you ask of a spy thriller based on a Robert Ludlum novel? Stop and breathe for a moment and you may realize this is little more than one long chase scene. But the exotic European locations, and believable if not comic book performances move this along faster than a high speed European railway system. It's all pretty exciting, if not complex. Give a CIA assasin amnesia and all sorts of things are bound to happen. But mostly he'll be chased. There's a conviction here that could wipe the smirk off James Bond's face in a moment.
B000067IZ3|4.0|\\"The war on drugs has many enemies. Sometimes the enemy is your own family. And I don't know how you wage war against your family.\\" - Dialogue from \\"Traffic\\" <br />Which is why the war on drugs, like the war on violence or the war on obesity or any other social war, will be difficult, if not impossible, to win. More than statistics and money, the war on drugs asks for an assault on desires of human consumption, which cannot be combated with any policy or criminal punishment. <br />The most powerful element of Steven Soderbergh's \\"Traffic,\\" quite possibly the best American movie in 2000, is how it lays bare the nuances of human nature that simply have no reasonable explanation. What leads good to bad? \\"Traffic\\" has no hard answers, but it does show a wide canvas of  protagonists either connected to drugs in some way (whether it be enforcement, sales, or use) or lost in the pursuit of some material or chemical high. If it isn't drugs, it's money or a lifestyle one can't give up. Faced with hardship all her life, the beautiful, pregnant wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) of a drug lord refuses to return to it, using her young son's golf putter as a sign of what she has to lose. When her husband is arrested, and faced with forfeiting his entire fortune, the wife is again faced with poverty. Just watch what she does to prevent it. <br />In another story, an Ohio judge (Michael Douglas) accepts a job as the nation's drug czar, and is immediately faced with his own domestic crisis; his honor student daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen) has fallen into drug addiction with free base cocaine. While the most interesting, best-acted segment involves a corrupt Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) trying to walk the fine line between death and profit, all while battling his conscience, the key, absorbing scenes occur with the father and daughter in Ohio. The screenplay, written by Stephen Gagham, is adapted from a British series by the same name, draws Caroline as a character who falls hardfor drugs, in the way that few people, I suspect, do. <br />She cries, literally, tears of joy, at the thought of getting high. She subjects herself to whatever demand it makes of her, sexually or financially. She represents the ecstasy end of the spectrum, and rarely has it been captured so well, the abject happiness of crack. The lingering images of the film mostly involve her character, and her boyfriend Seth (Topher Grace), who is just well-versed enough to justify the use of drugs as an escape from convention. <br />(...) <br />This is a statement you've heard, no doubt, in any after-school special. Really, there is nothing original in \\"Traffic.\\" It's been onscreen before, especially in the 1980s, when anti-drug films were the standard fare. What struck me in watching the movie is how familiar all this material is (the key drug witness wanting immunity, the corrupt cops, the daddy's little girl gone astray) and yet how the craftsmanship of Soderbergh's direction and camerawork tie it together into a moving, ambitious work. <br />Del Toro, as the cop, uses a quiet smolder to show his growing frustration with the Mexican status quo regarding drug cartels. Douglas, in a rather subdued performance, is troubled from nearly the opening frame; first, as he discovers how little can be done to fight drugs, and then, with his daughter, just why that is. A wide supporting cast, including Don Cheadle, Lusi Guzman and a nearly unrecognizable Benjamin Bratt, flesh out their small parts well. <br />\\"Traffic's\\" uncommon strength lies in its conflict of conventional morality vs. the baby boomer experience. There is a scene where Douglas asks his wife (Amy Irving) how long she's known about her daughter's drug use. The wife has kept her daughter's secret for six months, for no better reason than in college, she used drugs, came out all right, and look, now she's a millionaire. And so what harm could a little experimentation do? And how could she offer herself up as a hypocriteto her own daughter? <br />Another question is asked: What separates our fates? The user from the addict? The alive cop at the baseball game vs. the dead one in the desert, when they were both trying to do the same thing? \\"Traffic\\" plays these questions out; we aren't surprised by the ambiguity of the results, and yet the journey of this film is as absorbing and dramatic as any in recent years.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|At least Kylie Minogue can sing and has a bit of class.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|\\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" is a sloppy sequel of an original that was no masterpiece in its own right. The cars are arguably just as whatever-you-want-to-call-them, but the chases aren't, and the plot suffers from a severe case of reduced star wattage: Vin Diesel lended his dome for the first movie, then skipped town in favor of the \\"xXx\\" series. Actor/singer Tyrese and his dome fills in, but the inherent \\"Vinness\\" of the maiden road race has left the building. <br />Paul Walker's back, though, as Brian O'Connor, the most unconvincing cop to ever breathe air, only now he's been disavowed from the force for letting Vin's character escape and select another movie franchise. No badge in hand, Brian roams Miami, street race hustlin, catching the eye of a federal agent (Eva Mendes) who puts him undercover to land a major drug kingpin (Cole Hauser, channeling \\"Miami Vice\\"). Tyrese plays Roman, Brian's former buddy with an unclear grudge. Roman and Brian pose and paw and return smoldering glares at one another to such an extent it's possible to read the film with homoerotic subtext. <br />What an uninspired, pedestrian movie. \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" features Ludacris as a chop shop owner who does not seem to work - he emcees a jet ski race, though - and talentless model Devon Aoki as a street racing tart. Mendes is the flavor of the month but there's something curiously asexual and detached about her. <br />At least Singleton has enough integrity left spare the audience needless gratuity.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|As if there isn't already a glut, I'm a long time Beatle fan, and fairly familiar with their history.  For those of you engaging in liberal beatings of Paul's character, you need to listen very closely to the extra disc, which clearly exposes in short form where the members were in their heads.  Now, I know as well as the rest of you about Paul's, uhm, shall we say, &quot;character defects&quot;?  But I think, at least in this case, you've got it wrong.  From the sound of it, it seems like John was very much into the idea after he had time to absorb what Paul was trying to do.  Naturally, he wanted to give it a nice John-style twist, but he was with the spirit of things.  Funny, it seems to me, how Paul managed to place such relevent material on the supplemental disc that many people aren't evenpaying attention to.  It's almost like he anticipated beforehand the objections of the Anti-Pauls, and sought to give us a taste of what the other Beatles were thinking.  It's clear that George isn't very turned on by John's &quot;boat idea&quot;.  Also, equally curious, that the final audio on the second disc is Paul asking &quot;Which way did John go?&quot;  Think about it.  Paul may be a lot of things, but foolish and stupid are not among them.  Egotistical or not, he knows where his bread is buttered, and it isn't with &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;.<br />As far as the album, my sentiments are a mix of others already posted here.  The audio mixes are great.  But the material?  Rough and unfinished.  It's a miracle that Spector could accomplish what he did with the tapes.  I actually prefer Spector's takes of Long and Winding Road and Across the Universe.  When he slowed the tape speed down for Across, it gave the track more meat.  Final opinion?  Try this:  This album of rough-hewn, unfinished, mostly straight-rock numbers shows just how pitiful many in the biz today look when compared with these giants, barely awake at the time; nowhere near the top of their game, and still made an album (several albums of the same album?)generating this much interest...in 2003.  Wow.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Not 10 minutes into Michael Mann's &quot;The Insider,&quot; CBS &quot;60 Minutes'&quot; reporter Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) launches into a tirade at the notion that someone might control one of his interviews. His target begins as an Arab gunman protecting his leader, then transforms to everyone in the room. Wallace storms off by himself. The gunman rescinds his demands. And quietly, carefully, the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) approaches Wallace to see if he's &quot;warmed up.&quot; <br />&quot;I've got my heart going now,&quot; Wallace says. <br />The scene sets the perfect tone for the &quot;The Insider,&quot; an unflinching look at modern journalism. After that, can we look at Wallace straight? When, in another tirade, he accuses a corporate drone of strong-arming him, is he, in fact, strong-arming her? When he cries, are his tears real? And if Mike Wallace is an icon in this business, what does that say about the ethics of everybody else? <br />Mann takes those questions and applies them to the trials of Jeffrey Wiegand (Russell Crowe), a tobacco whistle-blower whose interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; was delayed for more than three months because of CBS's fear of lawsuit. Wiegand, under legal pressure from Big Tobacco, loses everything in the process: his wife (Diane Venora), money, reputation, freedom. And CBS hangs him out to dry. <br />The specific details of exactly what Wiegand knew - laid out nicely in the Vanity Fair piece &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; - are inconsequential in the movie, for they merely confirm what we've supsected for half a century. More provocative is Mann's two-fold approach that shows Wiegand's downward spiral, and Bergman's fight to keep the interview intact. <br />The film's second half proves it, as &quot;The Insider&quot; shifts to a behind-the-lies look at the CBS decision and Bergman's counteroffensive to get executive producer Don Hewitt (Philip Balker hall) and Wallace back on board. Bergman's crusade is a little simplified - Pacino's performance plays up the &quot;one-man-and-his-mic&quot; fantasy - and yet because Wiegand's livelihood is at stake, we root hard.  <br />Mann, a master technician, jams the camera up in everybody's face to create intimacy rare in a movie this big Cinematographer Dante Spinotti has always been superb, and the visuals are crisp and have a full-bodied atmosphere to them. <br />And then there is Russell Crowe, in the role that put him on the A-list. Wiegand, a brash, sometimes compulsive personality, is played body and soul by Crowe as a determined, principled man who refuses to be pushed around. <br />&quot;All the President's Men&quot; got most of its thrill in how it utilized the anonymous insider &quot;Deep Throat.&quot; This time, we know exactly who Deep Throat is, and how, unlike the 1970s, he doesn't call the shots anymore. That's how much journalism has changed.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie was superb!  The cast was magnificent, the scenary was beautiful, the costumes were fantastic.  This movie depicted the perfect small French town.  I do not like to tell story lines because I end up giving away the movie.  This was excellent, the characters were greatly depicted.  I am deffinately reading the book.
B000001Y2U|3.0|Antichrist Superstar is a concept album, which is a semi-autobiographical story focussing on the rise and fall of the character of Marilyn Manson. The overall theme of the CD is that of a young boy (who is a representation of Marilyn as a child) being forced by a corrupt society and a systematic program of indoctrination and abuse to turn into a horrifying creature.<br />There is a high degree of factuality in the album, especially owing to the song \\"Kinderfeld\\", which details the young Marilyn being abused by his grandfather (this actually happened). <br />The album succeeds on many levels. It is extremely deep conceptually, with the character of the Antichrist Superstar and how it originated, being based upon the concept of the Overman. Furthermore, the transformation can actually be felt, and as the album rolls along to its tragic conclusion (which is the fictional element of the storyline), you develop such empathy with the characters. The theme of the album, being \\"You are your own god, grab the power for yourself and do not let some church make the decisions for you\\" is extremely well developed. On the basis of concept and theme, it manages to be one of the most brilliant albums ever. <br />However, there is one level on which it fails: Music! I do not enjoy incredibly loud music so this album did not work for me on a musical level. In all honesty, it sounds like a chainsaw! The only songs that work musically (for me) are \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"The Beautiful People\\", \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" and \\"The Reflecting God\\", all of which are varied in their construction, avoiding endless metal assaults (whilst most of the other tracks are either ballads or guitar-driven metal).<br />Overall, if you want music only, than think twice before you purchase this, unless you are a fan of metal music. However, if you are looking for extremely deep, emotional, dark, philosophical and brilliant works, and do not mind having your ears ripped off whilst a sledgehammer is smashing you onthe back of the head by the music then I would reccomend this.<br />Even though I do not like it much musically, the conceptual brilliance of this album is stunning.
B00009M97Z|5.0|For a first album it is quite impressive. Of the lot only one song or two are average, the rest are originals, with a unique touch that have you come back again and again. One of the top 3 albums I have bought this year.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|It's always fun to hear what a good band considers its throwaway songs. In this case we have Pearl Jam's \\"Lost Dogs,\\" which is anything but subpar. \\"All Night\\" begins disc one at a brisk clip, and right away you just know it's gonna be the typically great Pearl Jam sound. Of course, disc one does have some stinkers. \\"Don't Gimme No Lip\\" by Stone Gossard sounds forced and contrived; \\"Gremmie Out of Control\\" is a fun surf-rock song that could have been left off; and Jack Iron's \\"Whale Song\\" is a bit tedious. Otherwise, these tunes are a great representation of what Pearl Jam was doing in the 1990s, a great era for the band. It's cool to read about the songs' incarnations and history in the CD booklet of \\"Lost Dogs,\\" written by various band members. If you liked Pearl Jam albums like [[ASIN:B000002BFZ No Code]], [[ASIN:B000002BYD Yield]] and [[ASIN:B00004T8RK Binaural]], then many of these tunes will appeal to you. There's a few good ones from the [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] and [[ASIN:B0000028UK Vs.]] era as well. \\"Hold On,\\" a song left off of \\"Vs.,\\" has a deep, sad riff and wrenching lyrics by Vedder that would have been right at home on that album. Other disc one standouts are \\"Down,\\" \\"In the Moonlight\\" by drummer Matt Cameron, and the rollicking \\"Black, Red, Yellow\\" by Vedder, which features a unique interlude where basketball player Dennis Rodman leaves a phone message to the Pearl Jam singer (from the \\"West, West coast\\"). Another Vedder tune, \\"Undone,\\" has a charming quality to it, best heard while driving at 40-60 MPH, on your way to a voting booth or demonstration, as he advises.<br /><br />Disc two contains a cohesive, albumlike feel, at least the first nine songs. Pearl Jam's normally hard-rock sound makes way for a beautiful starkness on such songs as \\"Fatal,\\" \\"Hard to Imagine\\" and \\"Footsteps,\\" which sounds a lot like Temple of the Dog's \\"Times of Trouble.\\" The band's ability to sound great in both electric and acoustic formats is uncanny. \\"Other Side\\" by Jeff Ament could bring tears to your eyes with its lyrics; \\"Dead Man\\" is a haunting ditty about facing the prospect of being put to death; Stone Gossard's \\"Strangest Tribe,\\" with its beautiful and primal acoustic sound and Vedder's close, breathy vocals, might rank as the best of the lot. \\"Sweet Lou,\\" written by Jeff Ament in homage to Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul Jabar) is horrible, but \\"Dirty Frank,\\" from the \\"Ten\\" era, is classic Pearl Jam. \\"Dirty Frank\\" boasts dirty guitars, Anthony Kiedis-like vocals from Vedder, and frightened lyrics about the band's strange tour-bus driver, who might just be a serial killer. Somehow, this comes off as funny. What's not funny is the hidden track at the end of the album, a stark, frank and dark tune by Vedder that recognizes the tragic death of Alice in Chain's Layne Staley (see [[ASIN:B0000028M7 Dirt]]), who died of a drug overdose.<br /><br />Pearl Jam fans should not pass over this CD; cumulatively, it ranks right up there with the band's best work.uld bring tears to your eyes with its lyrics; \\"Dead Man\\" is a haunting ditty about facing the prospect of being put to death; Stone Gossard's \\"Strangest Tribe,\\" with its beautiful and primal acoustic sound and Vedder's close, breathy vocals, might rank as the best of the lot. \\"Sweet Lou,\\" written by Jeff Ament in homage to Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul Jabar) is horrible, but \\"Dirty Frank,\\" from the \\"Ten\\" era, is classic Pearl Jam. \\"Dirty Frank\\" boasts dirty guitars, Anthony Kiedis-like vocals from Vedder, and frightened lyrics about the band's strange tour-bus driver, who might just be a serial killer.

B00008VA1J|3.0|There are legions of one hit wonders who had their one big hit and disappeared from the music scene. When Don McLean burst upon the charts with \\"American Pie\\" there was a good chance that he might quickly disappear as well since it was fairly obvious that the odds were against him ever having a bigger hit. But while McLean never had another hit as popular he certainly proved he had more than one great song in him when he wrote \\"Vincent\\" (a.k.a. \\"Starry Starry Night\\") and a couple of very good songs in \\"And I Love You So\\" and \\"Castles in the Air.\\" I even like his \\"Driedel\\" song.  Unfortunately, this import collection of McLean's hits misses out on his cover of Roy Orbison's \\"Crying,\\" which makes this a lesser collection that the original 10-track hits album from EMI and is not even worth comparing to \\"The Very Best of Don McLean,\\" which has 16-tracks, including all of the above and a new version of \\"American Pie.\\"  So, while there are songs on this album that are not worth listening to more than once, but the ones that are good are simply great. McLean is clearly one of those artists where you just need his \\"Best of\\" album, but you still want to be selective on that score, as indicated above. Final Note: I always thought that the name of the character of Vincent on television's \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" was taken from McLean's song given the line: \\"But I could have told you, Vincent, this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.\\"
B000089RVX|1.0|I have possibly never heard something so amazingly painful to the ears. The horrid nu-metal guitar riffs with the incredibly bad, overly dramatic vocals, and not to mention the annoying wannabe goth attitude Amy Lee just radiates. What the hell is a Christian band doing flirting with the Gothic sub-culture? Give me a break. The two do not walk hand-in-hand.<br />Even through her appearance, Amy Lee appears to resemble a country singer. Her singing gives off the same impression; the long, drawn out, melodramatic tone of her voice just makes me want to rip my hair out. I've seen some of these kiddies, who I imagine find the Linkin boys and Avril amazingly interesting, comment on how depressing this album is. Ha.<br />Yes, it IS depressing. Not in a way that makes you want to cry, but in a way that makes you ponder where our good music is really going. Poison the Well and Nine Inch Nails wont be common name for long, soon it'll be hardcore christians with mohawks screaming out with cracking teenage voices about the degradation of society and conformity. Oh wait, there already is a band like that.. Sorry, Good Charlotte.<br />I've gotten so much response about my views on Evanescence, mostly other opinions. \\"They're not christian!\\", \\"They're not Gothic!\\". You see kids, the band themselves have admitted it. You can't deny something about them when they've said it's true themselves. For crying out loud, they play for the same label as P.O.D. and Creed. Both of which are Christian bands, and both of which sing at the poor quality of Amy Lee.<br />Another point I'd like to make about them being \\"Gothic\\". What the heck is a gothic band doing on the teen choice awards? Have any of us seen Skinny Puppy performing with the likes of Jennifer Lopez and 50 Cent? Maybe it has to do with Skinny Puppy's lyrics not being written as badly as teenage poetry.<br />I'll be expecting to see Amy Lee kissing Madonna on MTV soon enough.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|Two of my favorite non-traditional Christmas songs are &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot; by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and &quot;Christmas Song&quot; by Jethro Tull, which are not exactly the sort of songs you would remember to pull out of your music library at Yule time.  Jethro Tull takes steps to remedy that with &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album.&quot;  What you will find here are some old songs that the group has re-recorded (&quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot; and &quot;Bouree&quot;), along with some songs from the vault (&quot;Last Man at the Party&quot;) and new songs by Ian Anderson (&quot;Birthday Card at Christmas&quot;), as well as some standard Christmas songs (&quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;) and not so stardard (&quot;Holly Herald&quot;), all of which are done as instrumentals.  The music approach is much more acoustic and folksy, with mandolin, accordion, and strings to go along with the expected flute playing from Anderson and Martin Barre's acoustic guitar playing, for which special mention of Gabriel Faur&eacute;'s &quot;Pavane&quot; must be made.<br />If you were trying to put your finger on where the sound of this 2003 album goes in the Jethro Tull timeline then I would say it is more &quot;Songs From the Woods&quot; than anything else.  I keep thinking that I want to say that I wish they had gone back a bit farther, to at least &quot;Thick as a Brick,&quot; but I think that is more just more my inclinations towards what I consider classic Tull rather than what best fits the music.  Actually if you told me that Jethro Tull was putting out a Christmas album and that the best tracks were going to be the instrumental pieces, I would have been surprised, and you probably will too.  I am always on the look out for some eclectic Christmas albums to put into the traditional holiday mix, and &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot; certainly fits the bill, reflecting as it does Anderson's peculiar and somewhat provocative notion of the holiday.  It is also a pretty good Jethro Tull album on its own terms.he holiday.  It is also a pretty good Jethro Tull album on its own terms.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|If I had to recommened only one album by Mr. Marley, it would have to be this one. Like most people, I've picked up Legend, then moved onto his albums. When I finally got around to this album, I noticed that all of the songs were well-known one's, so I was pretty excited to hear them live. I was not disappointed. As soon as the cd starts, you hear the crowd going nuts, with the opening of Positive Vibration. There is so much energy in just the first 15 seconds you will be compeled to listen to it the whole way through. And that energy is there throughout. The songs that had a slower tempo on the album versions have been picked up, and the change is amazing (like Exodus and Stir It Up). The band is excellent here...the rhythms could put you in a trance, and once the vocals come in...you can just close your eyes and BE THERE at the concert(s). Get this cd, and skank your ass off!
B00000E5E4|3.0|Emerson, Lake and Palmer was the first Progressive Rock supergroup, but the glory days are over and the magic is gone when they released this 1992 album, their first studio effort in a dozen years. It is not a question of their technical proficiency, because Keith Emerson remains my favorite keyboard artist and is in fine form, as he shows on &quot;Changing States&quot; and the piano solo on &quot;Close to Home&quot; (this was a few years before hand surgery affected his playing ability). However, from the start of this album with the title song and &quot;Paper Blood&quot; it is clear that these are much simpler songs than we recall from the past, with few bursts of the wonderful complexity for which ELP was rightly known. For me there is also the concern over the aging of Greg Lake's voice, which is really unrecognizable. In the days of my youth that was the voice that I most wanted to have (e.g., the live version of &quot;Lucky Man&quot; on &quot;Welcome Back My Friends&quot;); but instead of my voice becoming more like his it is the other way around, which is not a good thing. That is an admittedly personal problem, but on the professional level Lake is doing less of the songwriting than before and the best track on the album is the adaptation of the classical piece &quot;The Dance of the Knights&quot; from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet. &quot;Footprints in the Snow&quot; is a minor Lake composition at best, which is another disappointment. ELP was one of my favorite all-time groups, and hearing them play lesser songs without the fire that made them famous, is just another sign that we are all growing old.
B00005JLKN|1.0|Those who read the book knows that the movie is not 100% accurate. This really annoys me. <br />In the book, Francis Dollarhyde was supposed by really ugly. Ralph Fiennes does not seem to be ugly. In fact, he was more good looking. This is important because it is one of the reasons why he is messed up. His mom left him because of what he looked like and thus his grandma took care of him. That's why he still lives in his grandma's house. Anyway, there is more to Francis' background.......BUT WHERE WAS THIS IN THE MOVIE????There was barely any info on Francis' life. That's why audiences are like, \\"what the heck? why is he like this?\\" <br />Hint of advice for movie creators- Read and understand the importance of the book!
B000001ELL|5.0|Most die-hard KISS fans dismiss this album because of its disco influence.  Critics say this album is the beginning of the end for KISS.  As a huge KISS fan, I think Dynasty is one of their best albums.  The Musicianship and the overall feel of Dynasty seems more mature compared to previous KISS albums (especially Love Gun).  I'm proud that my favorite band had the guts to experiment with different musical styles at the height of their popularity rather than taking the safe route and releasing another standard KISS album.  However, I will admit that KISS's prime motivation at the time was probably to increase their popularity on a mainstream level which might be defined as 'selling-out' by die-hard fans.    <br />Any KISS fan knows that during this period (1979) there was some inner turmoils within the band especially with Peter Criss who consequently contributed his vocals and drumming on one song only (Dirty Livin) during the recording of this album.  The rest of the drum tracks were recorded by hired ghost drummer Anton Fig.  Knowing that, it does not change the fact that Dynasty is a great album.  The overall packaging of 'the Remasters' version is great.  The album cover is one of my favorites.  If you look close, you can see the green makeup on Peter is not equal on both sides of his face.  It makes you wonder if this was intensional or not.  Ironically, Ace Frehley has more contributions on this album than Gene does which I also find a bit refreshing.<br />As for the songs, I am not embarrassed to say that I love \\"I Was Made For Lovin You\\".  In fact, I think that \\"I Was Made..\\" and \\"Sure Know Something\\" are the best Paul Stanley songs ever recorded.  The live performance of the Stones' song \\"2000 Man\\" during KISS concerts and on MTV unplugged is a bit plain and simple but Ace's studio version on Dynasty is excellent.  As for Peter's only contribution, I think that \\"Dirty Livin\\" is way too underrated.  I believe this song is probably one of Peter's best.  It certainly surpasses the mediocre \\"Holigan\\" from Love Gun.  \\"Charisma\\", with Gene Simmons on lead vocals, is an awesome song.  I especially like the echoes of the chorus.  One thing however, that I don't like about this song is the lyrics.  Everybody knows that Gene Simmons has a big ego and most of the time he is full of himself, the lyrics to \\"Charisma\\" serve as a perfect example to this.  The lyrics remind me of a style reminiscent of that cheesy song \\"I'm Too Sexy\\".  I believe the song would've been much more stronger and possibly more successful if the lyrics had been switched to the 2nd or 3rd person (but that's just my opinion).  The song \\"Magic Touch\\" is another highlight that appropriately fits in well with the overall feel of Dynasty.  This song validates once again how Paul Stanley is a great song writer.  <br />The last three songs; Ace's somewhat autobiographical song \\"Hard Times\\", Gene's \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" and Ace's \\"Save Your Love\\" are also great songs but are probably the weakest of the album.  I don't think there's such a thing as a bad song on this album.  Dynasty is a fun album to listen to even today after nearly 25 years since its original release.  If I can quote a previous reviewer, 'I think Dynasty is worthy of cult status'.  It's certainly a must-have for any KISS fan.
B000002KD5|4.0|When Bob Welch left Fleetwood Mac in 1974, Mick Fleetwood brought in guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks to give the band a new sound. It is extremely evident on this first album. The album kicks off with Buckingham's &quot;Monday Morning&quot; which is good and short enough for an album ballad. After McVie's &quot;Warm Ways&quot;, a beautfiul ballad and &quot;Blue Letter&quot; comes &quot;Rhiannon.&quot; This is still one of the best songs Stevie Nicks has ever written and fits in perfectly. Next comes &quot;Over My Head&quot; a great single for McVie and &quot;Crystal&quot; a Buckingham/Nicks song brough in for this album. &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; is one of the most fun songs Christine has ever written. &quot;Landslide&quot; is a classic and the Dixie Chicks can't hold a candle to Stevie Nicks. &quot;World Turning&quot; is one of my favorite's and has a very neat guitar work. &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; and &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; close out the album nicely. A great intro to one of music's most diversifile bands. Excellent work! A great inclusion to anyone's CD collection.
B00005JKC3|1.0|You need a 16-speed DVD-ROM drive to view this move ! It is that boring. What a cheap remake.
B000063DS1|3.0|I expect to take some arrows from the Band fanatics, who seem to pretty much deify this record, but please just give me a listen. <BR>First of all, I think The Band was positively one of the great bands of their era. They put out some classic studio albums (to digress, at one time I would have put MUSIC FROM BIG PINK at the top of that list, but recent listens to the remasters forces me to revise my LP days opinion that THE BAND did not compare well with their first album; I now concede that THE BAND was the superior album, and I sometimes wonder how I did not notice that songs like ROCKING CHAIR and UNFAITHFUL SERVANT represented some of the finest music of the day (since I did not get stoned, I cannot blame it on that)! They even put out one of the top five live albums of all time. It just was not called THE LAST WALTZ. In my mind THE LAST WALTZ typifies the worst excesses of the period when it was created and the coming complete commercialization of rock, that has continued and run rampant to this day. The Band had had it when they decided to go out with a bang with this massive undertaking--they had been on the road too long, they had tired of each other (there was much bile among the members, which continues among those still living), and they had lost all spontaneity and real emotion in their music. And guess what? It shows! The whole thing (check out the DVD for further evidence) is tired, ponderous and just not very conducive to repeat listenings. It feels like a museum piece, not rock and roll.<BR>Oh, I did say THE BAND put out one of the great live albums of all time, didn't I? Yes, and it was called ROCK OF AGES, and it happens to blow the socks off this tired mess. I actually never picked up on ROCK OF AGES upon its initial release (I had hundreds of albums, but I could not own them all, no matter how hard I tried!), but the double set remaster of ROCK OF AGES has completely blown me away, and I would take it any day over THE LAST WALTZ.<BR>Well, I knowthis is supposed to be a review of THE LAST WALTZ, but I come by my opinion of this bloated package in the context of The Band's overall work, and particularly their live work. <BR>If you can only buy one of their live albums, I would humbly direct you to ROCK OF AGES in a heartbeat over this one.
0767802470|1.0|The original version of this movie is a German public television production<BR>and is 6 hours long. It shows the good and ugly in very young people who<BR>were sent to war. The absurdity of war as well as fear, desperation and<BR>suffering of the victims are in the spotlight. This is one of the best<BR>Anti-War movies. Highly recommended, if you can find the original version.<br />The &quot;Director's Cut&quot; is a carnage made by Hollywood's simple-minded<BR>monopolists. Every contrast shown in the original movie is gone. Only the<BR>faceless ugly side is left. Hollywood's wrongdoers take pride in replacing<BR>the sound of an exploding bomb.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|I really like this album.  It's fun and most tracks have a good sound.  a couple of boring ones, like shadow and brave new girl, but the rest are pretty good.  Toxic and Outrageous are a couple of really good ones.  If you're into dance music, or if you enjoyed madonna's last two albums, i would recommend you check this out.  True, she is not a Great singer, and her lyrics are far from poetic, but it's good dance music or driving in your car music.  If you're searching for more than that, i suggest you pass on this one.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is Radiohead's 3rd cd, the first being the \\"Creep\\" cd, Pablo Honey, and the magnificent \\"the Bends\\".<br />I dont know what else to say about this cd except what has already been said. Maybe I can add that Radiohead is this generations Beatles. Also, Let Down is one of the greatest songs Ive ever heard. The vocals are amazing and the guitar line is beautiful, like the whole album.<br />Definitly a must have album for anyone who knows what good music is.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I LOVED &quot;Is This It,&quot; so I was super excited to buy this new album.  Long story short, I was disappointed.  I guess there is only so much they can do with their sound.  They did not evolve at all from their last album, and at times it seems like they are trying too hard.  If you are a new Strokes fan, I recommend their last album over this new one.  It was hard to listen from the beginning to the end.  : (
B0000B3FCX|1.0|Chad sounds like Bolton with that croaking baritone,over-singing style.My sister has this and It is the biggest garbage I ever heard.I cant stand the lead singer's singing.He wants to sound like Eddie Vedder or Layne Staley but comes of sounding like a grunge Michael Bolton.He wants to sound deep but the lyrics are one cliche after another.And the mid-tempo post-Creed grunge might be huge on Light FM but as a rock fan,It made me cringe.
B00005JM02|5.0|The story is simple BUT very meaningful. A clownfish name Merlin lost his whole family except for one, Nemo. With that traumatic experience in his life, he became a very overprotected to Nemo. Nemo got kidnapped, and Merlin went to Sydney - with a help from the hilarious Dorry - to save Nemo. I was surprised that many people think that the story is so flat and that the characters aren't being developed. I think Merlin has been developed very well in the film. I mean he turned from a very overprotected and unfunny clownfish to become a more relaxed dad and learn to be more funny in telling jokes (hehehehe).<br />Pixar did amazing works and FN is probably my favorite at the moment.  Don't get me wrong, I adore Toy Story and Monster Inc, but I found FM to be more real that the others. I guess I can relate more to FN instead of Toy Story or Monster Inc cause I never really believed in any monster in my bedroom. I'm not a very imaginable kid back then I guess, quite a boring normal kid probably. I never really had any toys either, been playing with Super Nintendo, playstation, and PS 2 for all my life, and I guess they're not really  the kind of toys that I hope to be turned to live at night. Coming from a family with a very,very overprotected father, I can feel nemo's uneasiness with that situation.<br />However, the film itself has elaborated me to understand Merlin's point of view as well as my father's point of view. I can actually understand why overprotected fathers are really hard in letting go their children. It's their treasure! No matter how bad their children are, they're still willing to do anything to save their children. The most touching scene on the film is when Dorry said, \\"and when I'm with you...I'm home,\\" I realized no matter how annoying our parents are or how much we got angry with them, they'll always be there for us, and with all the stupid, annoying, and embarrassing things and moments that our parents gave us, but they are HOME to us.<br />At the end, this is a fantastic film. Maybe some of you who expect complicated story and psychological explorer wouldn't really like it, but an ordinary man like me found it amusing and simply amazing. The DVD is a must ! It has beat the DVD sales for Spiderman rite now, and I hope it'll win an oscar for best animated film this year, oh btw, I'm 23 and drive a landrover and got a nemo keyholder on my car key -!
0385504209|2.0|This book proves why the term \\"bestseller\\" should not be equated with the term \\"greatness.\\" Bestseller just means that many people have heard about a book and decided to go take the chance and buy it.<br />If you take this book at pure fictional value, then it is a decent suspense. But, it hardly deserves the accolades and the attention it is getting. Controversial? Yes.<br />A masterfully crafted work of art? No. There are many \\"movie\\" type action sequences and convenient escapes by our protagonists; it becomes a bit cliched to the reader after a certain point.<br /> This, for the most part, was a slow read that was tough to get through because of its lack of depth. The only deep part of the book is the seemingly endless \\"facts\\" that are discussed about Da Vinci, the church, the Holy Grail and this  amazing code that has seemingly no end to it. The characters are constantly trying to solve the code, but the process of bringing these facts to play is absurd.  And these \\"facts\\" are really not real facts (only facts for the sake of the book).<br />Much of the dialogue, combined with stereotyped good guy/ bad guy situations,  make for a mediocre story. The protagonists manage to just get by the bumbling police, who manage to blow several key opportunities to get them. It would not have been surprising to hear the police captain scream \\"Don't blow this case\\" to a lowly, but eager rookie officer who wanted in on the chance to nab our heroes.  The characters are either evil and corrupt, or good and benevolent; it is as simple as black and white.<br />If there is an aspect that should be applauded it is Brown's ability to take many aspects of history (as factious as they are) and attempt to intertwine them into the plot of a story.  But, these attempts fail because they beg too many convenient coincidences, and the authenticity of the characters is seriously lacking as a result.<br />This book will probably end up being some major motion picture in a few years, with big stars and a big budget.<br />As far as being a unique work of fiction, this fails.ig stars and a big budget. <br />As far as being a unique work of fiction, this fails.

B000002AZ8|4.0|The erratic smybol clicking and guitar plucking at the beginning of Vitaology is there just long enough to raise an eyebrow, and immediatly, is replaced by the explosive opening track \\"Last Exit\\", whose gorgoeus riffs and delicious melodies let you know long before masterful thumping bridge that, yes, you are in for an experince. As Eddie Vedder howls \\"Let my spirit free\\" into the final guitar chunks of \\"Last Exit\\", he does just that on what is, by far, one of Pearl Jam's most realized efforst of thier career.<br />\\"Spin the Black Circle\\" follows, a powerful, harsh, full-on rock song that is both an amazing head banger /and/ a tribute to the power of the vynal. The great riffs and somewhat simple subject matter is the perfect set up for \\"Not For You\\", one of the several moody masterstrokes of the album, and a staple of any PJ song collection.<br />\\"Tremor Christ\\" follows not long after, an apoctoplyic, mid-tempo story that is as gripping as it is oddly catching, mostly due to Vedder's unmatched baritone. \\"Nothingman\\" chimes in shortly thereafter, a beautiful, thick ballad that is both mournful and uplifting, and oddly explans the band as they are: aware of the past and going towards the future. This and the radio hit \\"Betterman\\", which just happens to be here as well, rank as some of the finest ballads ever written. Bouncing thereafter is \\"Whipping\\", a furious rocker which will get anyone with a pulse envigorated, and probably is the perfect followup to something like \\"Nothingman\\".<br />The album tugs and carries on this way and that, with rock staples \\"Courdoury\\" and \\"Immortality\\", the former a strong display of Vedder's views on materialism, and the later a mournful look into one's past reactions. Along the way are a few random quips, such as \\"Pry, To\\" a short diddy with Vedder spelling out \\"privacy\\" repeadtly, and \\"Aye Davantia\\", a sunny, upbeat little jam that shows off a more electic, exotic side to Pearl Jam. Also, \\"Bugs\\" features Eddie Vedder speaking, rather amusingly, over a accordian over what is quite possibily the most humorus and insightful songs ever to have an accordian dystroyed. Accordingly (bad dum ching!), \\"Satan's Bed\\" follows up, an ode to all things greedy in the human world.<br />There is one glaring point of arguement here, that, depending upon your view, is either genuis, or simply grateing and pointless, and that is, of course, \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\", a nearly 8 minute jam of feedback and children discussing abuse and suicide. There are certain times that this can be tolerated and actually enjoyed, but often, it seems entirely out of place with the rest of the album, and ends the album on a forced, unnatural note, which hurts otherwise potential perfection.<br />Despite this argueable track, Vitaology is anything BUT dissapoiting, and is by far one of Pearl Jam's most focused, inventive, and beautiful albums. Just enough of the hits for new fans to get lured in and enough substance for experinced fans to delve into time and time again, Vitaology is a classic that dosen't show any signs of sounding dated anytime soon.r amusingly, over a accordian over what is quite possibily the most humorus and insightful songs ever to have an accordian dystroyed.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Excellent bonus features.  Seemless integration of additional scenes, well worth watching in its entirety.  Extended scenes bring in key points from book (regarding gifts, Ent ale, etc) that were removed from final film version.  Fun if you're a fan of the book, not crucial if you just liked the movie.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As is to be expected, the third movie is tying together all of the plot lines and finishing up with the characters' roles. So few really distinctive themes are introduced. The only main character not already introduced musically in the theatrical release is Denethor, the father of Boromir and Faramir. And the only peoples not really visited in depth yet are the Gondorians of Minas Tirith, and the land of Mordor. But the music for these elements are not distinctly new. The album returns throughout to the earlier themes of Frodo's Shire, the duel between evil and good (most powerfully introduced during the wizard duel between Gandalf and Saruman in TFOTR), the White Rider, the grand Fellowship theme, Rohan's theme and Aragorn's and Arwen's love theme. All three albums, like the movies themselves, are really one continuous medley/story, and cannot be adequately appreciated taken alone.

The c.d is also great, it's the first cd that i've ever listened to where i don't skip around like i do with others. it's that good. my favorite songs are of course Harder To Breathe, This Love, She Will Be Loved, Through With You. Im in the process of getting Kara's Flowers, which was Maroon 5 before they became Maroon 5, same members but minus James cos he was still in Nebraska. i've heard the song &quot;myself&quot; from the Fourth World cd. and it's a good good good song.
B00005JM02|4.0|Do believe the hype.  Finding Nemo immediately captures the viewer's heart and imagination.  It's absolutely thrilling!  A great story told with stunning craftsmanship.  Yes, it's as gorgeous as they say.  The extras are fun, but I was surprised that there was absolutely nothing on the voice talent.  That's the only disappointment.
B0000AR8NK|2.0|Reality is not as derivative as most of Bowie's music.  Rather, it has a flat, generic sound that seems to be coming from several different places.  The best thing I could say about Heathen and Reality is that they are boring, which is is an improvement from the awful music he made during the 80s and 90s.  The serious-sounding cover of the Modern Lovers' &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; is baffling.  The only reason I even bothered listening is because Visconti is back in the loop, but not even he can bring Bowie's music back to life.  Bowie's vocals sounds worse on every album.  He used to have a versatile voice, but now he is only capable of a low murmur.
B00000273M|5.0|Me not getting this album until now is like a Gen X-er not seeing Grease until the 1998 reissue.  Wait, that was me too.  Never mind.  Anyway, having had all three of the Bangles albums, the Less Than Zero soundtrack, and both of Susanna Hoffs' studio albums, and me being aware that yeah, there were two new songs on there, I figured why bother, I wasn't missing much.<br />That changed when I chose it for an instore play during a late shift at work and I was impressed with those new songs.  In looking at the album, the songs are in order of release date.<br />All Over The Place (1984) is under-represented with the two rockers &quot;Hero Takes A Fall&quot; and &quot;Going Down To Liverpool.&quot;  On the first, Susannah lashes out at an ex-lover, while on the second, giving a nod to their influences, the Beatles, Debbi avers that she's &quot;going down to Liverpool and do nothing all the days of my life&quot;<br />Then comes five songs from Different Light (1985), the album that broke them wide open.  The Prince-penned &quot;Manic Monday&quot; sure beats the old Garfield refrain of hating Mondays, as it incorporates the rush to get to work on time or else not get paid, the Byrdsy &quot;Tambourine Man&quot;-like rhythms of &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, and the wacky dance tune &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot; are so memorable to me.  The poppy &quot;Walking Down Your Street&quot; is the single version featuring different vocals in the beginning and deserved a Top 5 rating at least.  The haunting guitar-only &quot;Following&quot;, sung by bassist Michael Steele proves she is a vocal force to be reckoned with.<br />With Everything (1988), the Bangles began to write their own material.  Before that, they hit the Top 5 with a cover of Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;Hazy Shade Of Winter,&quot; which outdoes the original with its fierce guitar and drum attack.  All the Bangles sing in unison here, and the haunting lines  &quot;Seasons change with the scenery/weaving time in a tapestry/won't you stop and remember me&quot; give an enchanting feel to it.<br />The psychedelic sounds of the frantic &quot;In Your Room&quot; has a Tommy James-type beat, a la Mony Mony, and incorporates weird strings, organs, and distorted Indian sounds.  Yes, the sixties are back.<br />Then comes the lush torch ballad that has been redone by Atomic Kitten.  Sorry, but the original of the #1 &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; burns twice as bright and more eternally than the remake, sung as it is by the one and only Susanna Hoffs, with some angelic chorals by the remaining Bangles.<br />The upbeat &quot;Be With You&quot; failed to break the Top Ten, as did the mid-paced sad number &quot;I'll Set You Free,&quot; which has an a capella beginning, echoing vocals, and Indian sounds instead of the usual guitar of the original version.<br />Now the new songs.  The engaging guitar rocker &quot;Everything I Wanted&quot; could've been a big hit, as it features Susanna on vocals and is classic Bangles instead of the matured songs from Everything.  Finally, there's their cover of the Grass Roots' &quot;Where Were You When I Needed You&quot;, sung again by Susanna, with sweet harmonies by the others, and which was the B-side of &quot;Hero Takes A Fall.&quot;  Dipping back into the Sixties was so fun for them, as they were heavily influenced by that music.<br />Mondays won't be manic, I'll always be in my room, walking like an Egyptian, and I'll be listening to a CD whose flame will burn eternally.time in a tapestry/won't you stop and remember me&quot; give an enchanting feel to it.<br />The psychedelic sounds of the frantic &quot;In Your Room&quot; has a Tommy James-type beat, a la Mony Mony, and incorporates weird strings, organs, and distorted Indian sounds.

B000084T18|5.0|I am a hip-hop historian.  I have it all.  From Cold Crush, to Run & D, to Kane & PE, everything.  I am an underground fan.  I know who 7L & Esoteric are.  I love Dr. Doom and Motion Man.  I know who the Freestyle Fellowship are.  That being said, I felt compelled to review 50's debut after reading the mixed reviews on this site.  It seems you either love it or you hate it.  The hate seems to come from underground/old-school snobbery.  To those I say lighten up.  It's just music.  Try being diverse.  There are more viewpoints on life than just Blackstar's.  The love seems to come courtesy of 50's persona.  Pay attention, he's a good lyricist with witty rhymes and he's versatile.  Fast or slow, simple or complex(see: Onyx's \\"React\\"), 50 has it.<br /><br />I just think that most of you are missing the point.  If Tupac and Biggie had a baby, it would be 50 Cent.  50 has Pac authentic thug credibility and Biggie's New York hustler swagger and ability to paint pictures.  He's an entertainer.  Michael Jackson's not the best singer in the world, but he's one hell of entertainer.  My advice; listen carefully and don't take it too seriously.<br /><br />The album is classic.  You can listen to every song without skipping.  No BS skits in the way.  Consistent.  Hardcore.  Fun.  Enjoy it!!
B000002N1E|4.0|Well ... i was on the edge to give this album 3 stars . I had only listened to it once then and was kinda disapointed . Many songs here were obviously meant to hit the mainstream radio . And sometimes such songs do hit indeed . But when they miss , they sadly exactly sound like your average teenage pop/R&B . I can see many rave reviews of \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\\" here , but seriously , hasn't Justin Timberlake written that kind of love songs like 1,000 times ? <br />P control (5/5) : Awesome Rap song . If you're a Prince fan , you'll definitly love it . You wonder what the P stands for , huh ? Well , Prince may have changed his name for The Gold Experience , but he's still the Prince we all know ...<BR>Endorphinmachine (5/5) : INCREDIBLE ! A Rock'n Roll song full of life and energy .<BR>Shhh (2/5) : Slow , mainstream R&B song . <BR>We march (4/5) : \\"Un por todos , y todos para un !\\" . Another R&B song with very interesting arrangements . <BR>The Most Beautiful ... (2/5) : I guess my sister would like it .<BR>Dolphin (5/5) : I didn't pay much attention to Dolphin at first , but it really grew on me . A sweet , joyful pop song .<BR>Now (1/5) : Atrocious , but ...<BR>319 (0/5) : ... this one is even worse ! By the way , the french girl doesn't say \\"Arret un je vous connecte\\" , but \\"Un instant , je vous connecte\\" .<BR>Shy (4/5) : Wow ! What the (...) is that ? I've never heard anything like Shy . There's almost no melody here and yet the song works very well . It just \\"sounds good\\" . I absolutly have no idea how Prince managed to do this . <BR>Billy Jack (...) (3/5) : Nice groove . Good R&B song . I wouldn't listen to it too often however .<BR>I Hate You (2/5) : Oh boy ... You might like it though if you're into this kind of love songs . <BR>Gold (5+/5) : The reason why i've bought The Gold Experience , and the reason why you should buy it too . I had only heard Gold once or twice when i was 11 years old , but 10 years later I was still able to remember each note of it . Last week , I was talking about Prince with a friend  , and Gold was one of the very few songs she knew he had done . For the \\"Purple Rain\\" generation , Prince was already \\"muerto\\" back in 1994 , but in fact , it seems that younger kids (including this one) were still really loving him .<br />As a fan i am actually glad he made this record . It gloriously shows how versatile The Artist was and still is . But wheter you like Prince or not , The Gold Experience remains a brilliant Pop album in its own right .
B0000C1733|4.0|If you love RHCP's newer stuff, this collection is for you.  Every song on this album (aside from the 2 new tracks) have been played to death on the radio.  Granted, I love the older stuff, but the newer stuff still has that Chili Pepper vibe and grooves in them.  However, they left off tons of material.  This could have easily been a 2 cd set. <br />If you have this album and only this album (which I find hard to believe) I recommend picking up &quot;What Hits?!&quot; as well.  That way you have the beginning of their career on one disc and their current stuff on the other.<br />Side note: The linar notes inside written by Flea and John are awesome as well.

B0000517BU|5.0|This album, from 1970, Amon Dl II's 2nd album is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Their improvisation, Yeti, defines the true Amon Dl II sound, in my oppinion and the guitar by John Weinzierl is brilliant.  Every other song is amazing and all different from eachother.  Its a very psychedelic album and I think its amazing. Its one of my favorite albums and I listen to it all the time.  Also if you like this album, check out they're 1st album, Phallus Dei and their 3rd album, Dance of The Lemmings, which is more progressive than the 2 before it.  The 4th album, Carnival In Babylon, from 1972, is good but not as good as the first three. The 5th album, Wolf City, is a great progressive rock album and the albums after up to Made In Germany all have atleast a few good to great songs.  Pyragony X and Vortex have a couple alright songs.  Incase you don't know, Dave Anderson, who played bass in Hawkwind from 1971-1973 was in Amon Dl II in 1969 on their 1st alum, Phallus Dei.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Ok,let's look at the cover. It is by far the worst this year, no design, no taste, no theme and simply lazy. Anybody noticed that the front cover and the artwork on the back of the album doesn't match?<br />Then listen to the album. Britney tried to copy Beyonce &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, tried to copy Kylie, and tried to copy the old time Madonna with &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;. Orignality? Whatever happened with it? The songs on this album is not particularly great either, not memorable, not classy, not original, and definitely not singing.One of the better track is &quot;toxic&quot;, which has a tolerable dance groove. &quot;Me against the music&quot; is alright, at least I can remember the chorous of the song after a few listens. I can't say the same thing about the other songs on this album. Any beautiful ballads? Yes, there are two ballads here, but they are not exactly beautiful. The one called &quot;Everytime&quot; is just horrible, unimaginative, no emotions, and that singing.......<br />Well, I must admit this one is actually better than Britney's last album, but still not good enough. And what's the deal with the lesbian kiss?I have nothing against lesbian, but hey, lesbian kiss is a natural thing, not a freak show, so don't make it looked like one. Relying on gimmics like these won't get Britney very far.......at least won't get people to consider Britney as an artist anyway. This album will sell for sure, but this will never be a legendery album which makes people to consider Britney as a true artist.
0385504209|4.0|Mary's Review on The Da Vince Code<br />Very well said, reader from the Bronx! I read this book because I was excited to hear that someone had finally written a fantastic novel combined w/Christian history.<br />I must say that I did find the book to be a page-turner but was disappointed with the ending. But, I am at least glad to know that it may spark an interest in people to get off of their butts and search for the TRUTH! It's out there for anyone who wants to sort through the many, many layers of muck...<br />If you are hungry for knowledge and are confused about Christianity, read \\"The New Dance of Christ\\" by Anthony T Massimini. It's a good place to begin your quest for understanding your Christian culture and the Christian psyche. It's wonderful read and although Massimini is promoting Christianity and trying to save it from extinction, you can draw your own conclusions with the \\"FACTS\\" that he demonstrates in the very well written book...<br />I wonder how many people realize that much of the mindset of Christianity stems directly from Plato's philosophy? Or that much of what is taught to Christians about its origins is Only A Shadow (pun intended! ;-)) of the truth?<br />If you are really serious about understanding your Christian heritage, read The New Dance Of Christ. It's a wonderful read-a real page-turner AND, you can be sure that what you are reading is REAL HISTORICITY...
0425098478|4.0|This is the book which tells how to manage the people in the better way
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Seriously.  This cd is one of the best pieces of musical work that you can get your hands on right now.  This is At the Drive-in's best cd they ever did.  I don't know how they would have topped this one.  Some of the songs on here are very catchy to but they are different in that they don't seem to get old.  A few in particular are Rolodex Propaganda, Enfilade (my personal favorite), Invalid Litter Dept. and Pattern Against User.  The way that they wrote all their songs isn't like alot of musicians do these days.  This cd was truely a great effort for them and belongs in a music lovers collection.
0385504209|1.0|If you study any religious history or art history you would know<br />this book is aimed at convincing only the ignorant they are reading great religious insights.<br />If you want to read a critisism on Christianity then read Neitzsche, so even if you beleive in Christianity you<br />have read an inteligent critisism not a totally rediculous<br />account of Christianity and art.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This cd is awful. Her music is terrible. Save your money and buy something else.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Ever since she first intruded on the already plundering mainstream music scene, BS has only been popular for her looks and sex appeal. Well, she was good for eye candy for the first 3 years or so, but after that, it just got ridicoulus with her \\"I'm a big girl\\" and bratty attitude. Pop music is so shallow and unrealistic, it's not wonder it's slowly but surely fading, and so is Britney's lackluster career, more than ever. Yes, this album may be selling, but compare it to her previous sells, and then, there's the though that that little kiss with Madonna could boost the sells, maybe, 100%? Yes, we all know of the fact she cannot sing, but she can dance, but who can't do that? Plus, it's not very entertaining. I'd rather be smack down in the middle of mosh pit than watching a girl twirl around on stage while lip syncing with 20 sweaty male backup singers. Now, on to the BIG news that she co-wrote (get that kids? She actually HELPED write a song, but not quite all by herself yet, even after 4 albums) 7 of the tracks on this album! The album with her name on the cover (even though she didn't write half of the thing). But it's a well known fact pop stars can't and don't write their own music. Oh well. This whole Britney thing will be over in the next five years, but by then, it won't matter. I would have found a way to completely blur out MTV by then.
B0000BWVCM|1.0|I am a huge fan of the X-MEn especially Wolverine and Colossus. First off the five original characters were Jean,Cyclops,Beast,Iceman, and Angel. Beast or Angel were not in this movie or last and will not untill X3 comes out in 2006 that is the real date. Stryker does not have anything to do with Wolverine at all I do not know where they came up with that. People if your favorite character is now Wolverine because these movies read the comics. Wolverine is the most dangerous mutant on the face of the earth because of master of all martial arts and because of his claws and healing factor. HIs real name is James Howlett and he has claws not because of the surgery but because he is a mutant. In the scene where Deathstrike is fighting Wolverine he is getting beat up most the time in the comics he destroys her with ease. I still do not know where they came up with Stryker having something to do with Wolverine!!!!! COlossus did nothing at all and Rogue who does not show up till the 80s in the comics is in the very first movie and has the main part with wolverine who did not show up untill the 70s along with Storm and Collosus also the girl screaming then who is shot in the neck with the darts is Siryn Banshee's daughter. So many flaws with this movie and the first it is basically X-Men doing entirely different things then in the comics. Oh WOlverine is 5ft no joke and he is alot meaner and more gruff in the comics. Also in the comics he would have destroyed Strykers entire taskforce himself. Really disappointing to me because i am such a fan. Good movie if you never want to know what the X-Men are really like. I would suggest going to tfaw.com and search under graphic novels for WOlverine and X-Men that is good stuff. With all this said I'am still going to buy the DVD just because it is the X-Men. Oh Nightcrawlers mom is Mystique. THe bird thing at the end is the Pheonix if you did not know and in the bar when wolverine is looking at the TV there is a glimpse of HEnry McCoy who is Beast, also on the computer when Mystique is downloading the files you can see Gambits name down. Sorry i trashed this movie but really read the comics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!To many flaws donot know why Stan &quot;the man&quot; Lee Produced it.

0060537639|3.0|I enjoyed this book and thought it had many interesting points but the logic is completely faulty.  He jumps from one conclusion to another and at times it as if he is writing a novel and not a serious analysis of history. If he wants to disestablish the myths around european explorers he has to do better than just come up with myths of his own.   He does have some good points about the maps that european sailors took with them.  The trouble is that Menzies points out that columbuses 'discoveries' were no such thing then goes on to talk about his own discoveries, nearly all of which are either well known to academics or baseless supersition.  1421 as a pet theory is probably about as good as the theory that Columbus had that Japan was 3000  miles off the coast as Portugal.  Like Columbus, Menzies is a great dreamer, but logic is his weak point.  I admire both men for following their dreams but does not prove either of their theories right.      Menzies starts with the undeniable fact that early maps made around 1500 show far more than europeans could have seen.  This does not necessarily mean that they were made by Chinese sailors, if they were neither  does it mean that they were made specifically in the time period he points out.  Alternative hypothesis's are casually dismissed whilst his theory gets built up on the flimsiest of evidence.  Early in the book he is commenting on a map that the Portuguese had in 1424 that shows islands in the atlantic.  He had already pointed out that portugal learned many navigation techniques from Arabs, particaularly after they captured the city of Ceuta in 1415.  It would seem likely that Arab sailors had made this map, the name Antilla itself is of Arabic derivation and Arab scholars as well known as Al Idrisi have mentioned Arab sailors crossing the atlantic. At least the idea would be worth a mention, but Menzies goes for the China option. My impression of Menzies is that being a British navy man he has looked at the 15th century found that Zheng He's fleets were the nearest thing to the British Navy, so assumes that they are responsible.  He may have learned about map making in the Queens navy but it does not seem the best breeding ground for logical thinking.  One of his attachments to China is via his childhood and his chinese nanny.  If his father had been posted in Aden and he had an Arab nanny this book would have probably been titled 1421, the year Arabs discovered the world - I don't believe it myself, but given ten years research, I could probably hotch potch together enough evidence to match Menzies.    The biggest shame about the book is that he does make some good points but they get lost in the nonsense.  His analysys of the Piri Reis being made by mariners searching for a place to identify Canopus's exact point in the sky is excellent.  The trouble is that he again comes up with the infuriating line 'it could only have been the Chinese'.  I am no expert but know that African sailors from Mali crossed the Atlantic and Mali's capital Timbuktu had one of the finest Universities in the world at the time.  It would also be credible that the Portuguese made these discoveries (unlike the Chinese,they are mentioned on the map) and sensibly decided to not tell the rest of Europe until they had time to exploit them. there are other options but Menzies does not explore them.     As well as this bias which is forgivable,there is a more of an element of dishonesty in Menzies.  His web sites talk of the book being launched by a speech given at the royal geographic society, but the society themselves point out that although he is a member and did was hire their hall.     The achievements of Zheng He should be more widely known, but frankly they deserve better than this.  The treasure fleets largely spent their time sailing established routes in the Indian Ocean.  It was an attempt to monopolize existing trade not discover new lands.  It wasn't even successful in this, the fleets were mostprobably scrapped as they were a large unwieldy state enterprise that wasn't making any money. They were the concordes of their day.  Thinking logically, if China had wanted to discover new lands would it have sent out a huge fleet built for trading purposes at extortionate cost? Surely a few junks would have sufficed     To call Menzies a fraud would however be a little unfair, he is to upfront about shoddy research for that.  There is one point in the book where he is discussing a stone with carved writing on it in the Cape Verde islands.  There are two languages, one portuguesee the other unknown.  Menzies obviously wants this to be made by the Chinese, but there is one problem, the script isn't Chinese.  The closest he gets to deciphering the script (yet not the message) is somebody from the Bank of India saying it looks a bit like Malayalam (a southern Indian language spoken in calicut, Kerala - the destination of vasco da gama's voyage).  This to Menzies is evidence that it was made by someone from a Chinese voyage specifically in 1421 and the discussion is taken no further.  Personally I believe if the Chinese had carved a stone they would have carved it in Chinese.  Obviously they are other nationalities aboard , but this means the only evidence Menzies needs is one person saying it 'looks a bit like' some Asian language.  A more obvious explanation is that the Portuguese brought back some Indians who made their carving next to the Portuguese.  BR&#62;  The book was a fun read but not a serious piece of scholarship at all.  By the end I was irked by his constant insistence that he had 'proved' things, when in fact all he had come up with was a rather interesting idea and bunged together lots of circumstnatial evidence.  This builds up into a house of cards as he uses his own previous assumptions to back up further ones.  It insults the readers intelligence and makes him look like a gifted and enthusiatic amateur rather than a serious historian.

0790729636|5.0|OK, I've read the other reviews...I think &quot;Twister&quot; is entertaining, with great CGI effects. The plot is intense, and most sub-plots are silly. Helen Hunt is beautiful, and quite a good actress. Bill Paxton is customarily hammy. Still I enjoy this film as entertainment. It's interesting to note that a lot of our current best actors today got a start in this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in particular, shows great flair, as well as Jeremy Davies, playing the wimp. Director Jan de Bont seems to use Alan Ruck a lot, and for good reason: He's talented. I was disappointed when Jamie Gertz won the Razz Award as &quot;Worst Supporting Actress&quot; in '96. I thought she gave a fine performance...her character was written to be reactionary, and I thought her every nuance was touching and sincere. As far as writing, well, some of the soap opera stuff could've been cut short. Jan de Bont, with all the films he could've chosen, showed scenes from Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; (at the drive-in), and Cukor's &quot;A Star is Born&quot; (before Aunt Meg's house is blown away). If these are homages, he has good taste. And Lois Smith was solid as the aunt; I've liked her since she played Nicholson's sister in &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot;. A fine character actress. With this stuff in mind, I watch &quot;Twister&quot; often, and enjoy it each time. Why be so analytical? It was made as mass-marketed entertainment and, on that level, it succeeds. Doesn't seem to matter that it was also on quite a few &quot;10 Best&quot; lists in '96. I like it a lot; if you don't, maybe you should get out more...
B00006M183|4.0|&quot;Riot act&quot; is not an album that you must listen few times before accepting it.it is definitly more difficult than &quot;Binaural&quot; or &quot;Yield&quot;.but that change of style made their music even better.<BR>from dark trippy opener &quot;Can't keep&quot; through agresive &quot;Ghost&quot;,psychedelic &quot;Cropduster&quot;,modern &quot;You are&quot; and anti-bush jr. &quot;Bushleager&quot; this album is pure emotions (and not always energy).pearl jam made such an emotional music last time on &quot;No code&quot;.their other albums where more rocking.<BR>songs from this album are sometimes flowing lazy along with distinctive guitars and a bit retro styled melodies...sometimes songs are simmilar to Neill Young (beautifull &quot;All or none&quot;) but definitly Pearl jam's classic rock style is above inspirations.the sound is more raw,not as clear ans on previous albums.it is a good experiment and a proof that The band is not afraid of discovering new territories.<BR>If you haven't buyed &quot;Riot act&quot; this is the time.i was feeling htat the band will be reborn after not that strong two previous releases.Vedder and friends didn't dissapointed me and fans.a huge piece of good music - not like &quot;Vs&quot; of course but you can't have everything.Pearl jam's grown up.for good.
B00005JLEU|5.0|And there's a reason for that.  Although the DVD is made by Disney, the movie is licensed by Disney, and the promotion (such as it is) of this movie is done by Disney, this is *not* a Disney movie.  And thank God for that.<br />First, allow me to start with the animation.  True, it is not as smooth as a lot of American animated films in several places.  However, it is still very smooth often enough, and never drops below an acceptable framerate.  In addition, it far more *detailed* than most American animation...yes, there are less unnecessary movements in segments, but there is far more detail in images.  American animation rarely has many shadows on characters or moving objects, instead having one base color for every (moving) object with another one to tell you that even though it *looks* like a hunk of concrete, it really isn't supposed to be.  The art in Spirited Away, although stylized, is far more detailed...most moving objects obey a &quot;three-color rule&quot; (one base color, one color for highlights, one color for shadows), and far more effort is put into details and backrounds than in any Disney film.<br />The dub is...well, it's servicable.  Apparently matching voices to animation is far more difficult than doing it the other way around, so the voices are somewhat stilted in places.  Disney also ruined an entire plotline, and a rather important one at that, so as not to confuse the little kiddies...or something like that, because they completely undid a major mystery of the story right off the bat, probably to try to hit the little kids in the audience over the head with the answer.<br />The Japanese language version, on the other hand, is excellent, although the subtitles aren't the most accurate translation.  Voice acting is believable and so on, and the writing is top-notch.<br />Oh, and the soundtrack *rules*.  You have to buy this if you like orchestrated music *at all*.<br />A lot of parents are complaining because it's &quot;too confusing&quot;and &quot;too negative&quot; for little kids to see, they say.  You see, this movie does not coddle its viewers.  In most Disney movies, the plot goes something like this:  A beautiful girl is forced into a life of &quot;horrible servitude&quot; (which does not stop her from constantly smiling, dancing, singing, and generally having a wonderful time for the first eighteen years of her life), and then is put to sleep until some random guy with a good smile comes along and even though she's never met the guy they decide to spend the rest of their lives together.<br />This story is very different.  In the beginning of the movie, Chihiro is severed from her only potential allies, her parents.  However, rather than mope around going, &quot;Oh my paws and whiskers, whatever shall I do?&quot;, she realizes that she's going to have to stand up and figure things out for herself, and in the meantime she has to survive.  It isn't easy, because this is nothing like her previous coddled existance...people are not all sugary sweet to her, and she's forced to work hard...and generally, she's forced into a life of servitude, and she does not get the chance to sing or dance or smile about it.  She meets a nice guy, but he has some sort of mystery behind him, and also works for the opposing side...however, in the end, through her own strength, and with a little encouragement she manages to (a) save the guy she's grown to love and knows well and (b) save her parents, and free *herself* from her problems.  There is no happy ending, she does not live happily ever after...rather, she has to grow up, and instead of living the rest of her life doing nothing must return to the real world, and deal with whatever problems come her way.<br />Chihiro is a rapid departure from previous children's heroines, because previous heroines did not really do very much.  The moral of their stories was that nothing could ever be so bad you couldn't be happy, and that other people would solve all your problems for you.  Chihiro, though, teaches us that things won't always be all right.  Problems will come up, and times will not always be sing-song-along happy...however, if you work hard you yourself can solve your problems, and although you won't have a fairy-tale ending, you'll be able to live happily enough in the real world, with no problems so great you can't solve them.<br />This is why I love this movie so much; because the only thing Chihiro gets from other people is encouragement.  She has to deal with things for herself.  Not only do you have great animation, a great story, and a really really REALLY AWESOME SOUNDTRACK *cough*...excuse me there, got a bit carried away...it also offers a lesson.  And again, unlike other films, it does not hit you over the head with it...but if you chose to grab it, you may.
B0000DC13U|3.0|Just to clarify: it's Godard, not Goddard. I know how snotty it sounds to bring that up, but it's gotta be pointed out.<BR>To get to the point, I bought my copy of Sympathy For the Devil cheap at a Futureshop display that also had a number of reissue CD's and that new 4 DVD set that's causing so much controversy. I actually laughed when I saw it there, because really, the film has little to do with the Stones and more to do with Godard's ideology. Hardcore fans will like the in studio footage of bored and/or doped up Stones wandering around figuring out how to arrange the number, but most of the rest of the film will seem pretentious and puzzling. Hell, Godard IS pretentious at times (and I'm a fan), but never less then interesting. It's weird as hell, but infinitely better then the 4 DVD set where they hit the stage like bobbing marionettes, recycling It's Only Rock n Roll etc for the umpteenth time. Particularly fun are the scenes of black revolutionaries hanging around wrecked cars, spitting out staccato rhetoric and throwing around guns. Fun!
B000002LCU|4.0|CLOUD NINE was released in 1987,six years after SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND. In '87 many &quot;oldies&quot; were being covered and on this album ex-Beatle George Harrison covered the 1961 Rudy Clark hit GOT MY MIND SET ON YOU. Later the music of the song would be recycled by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic for THIS SONG'S JUST(SIX WORDS LONG). The lyrics to the latter song were written by Yankovic. This album was produced by Harrison and his longtime friend Jeff Lynne of the Electric Light Orchestra. This album also is the intitial project for the pair. In addition to Lynne,guest artists include Elton John,Harrison's fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr and Gary Wright who wrote and recorded the hit song DREAM WEAVER in the seventies. WHEN WE WAS FAB was another hit from this album. I suppose it tells about Harrison's(and Starr's) Beatles era. It's just like ALL THOSE YEARS AGO from SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND which was a tribute to fellow ex-Beatle John Lennon who was fatally shot in December 1980. All the other songs are cool. THIS IS LOVE was another hit from the album. After this album,Harrison and Lynne would team up with Bob Dylan,Tom Petty and Roy Orbison to form the Traveling Wilburys with their own aliases.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This CD is very good comparing to her previous albums with one great hit and many fillers.  You might not tune into it the first time but it grows on you with more listening of it.  Keep an open mind and you will be entertained!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Despite what may be thought of Christina's recent wanderings into a more sexual territory, that is not all she has to speak upon.  A quick rundown of her lyrics (which she wrote, unlike many of today's pop \\"stars\\") will show that she is capable of delivering such messages that extend beyond the sexuality realm that is displayed in \\"Dirrty.\\"  Christina Aguilera will probably remain and prevail as one of the few voices of her generation that can not only sing, but can actually sing WELL.  Her voice can hold notes that other singers cannot even touch, as she ranges from subject matter as \\"I am beautiful\\" to \\"I can be dirrty.\\"  Nobody can dispute that her voice is amazing, and is the answer to the music business' prayer that somebody please have a voice that can be marketed to the masses, even if sexual appeal fails, which in her case does not.  She is an amazing singer and her subject matter ranges from domestic abuse to just having a good time on a Friday night.  I cannot sing her praises enough; even if you have a problem with the recent sexual imagery that has become sybmolic of her character, you gotta admit, this girl can SING!  She's got a lot to say in her songs, and I give her props for holding out to make an album that reflected her true being, rather than simply resorting to recording an album full of songs that other people wrote in the hopes of scoring a radio hit.  This girl is deep and, you've gotta admit, has balls, to record such hits that decry the double standards that have plagued women for decades as to their expected standards.  She is unapologetic and very certain of herself, and you can tell she has lived through these experiences herself, rather than simply resorting to having someone write her songs so that she can garner attention.  One listen to her voice will convince you - even if you don't agree fully with her message, you simply cannot deny the talent (which I thought would be a prerequisite for being in the music business, but in the case of Britney Spears, I can see it doesn't really matter) that exemplifies this magnificent voice.  She is simply destined to go far and wide and I applaud her for taking the stance that many of her peers have been afraid to take - just listen to her lyrics and you'll know what I'm talking about.
B00005AQE8|1.0|The difference between Tupac and Biggie is that Tupac spoke about fighting the struggle and Biggie spoke about The Struggle.Biggie was real and spoke about the realities and the struggles of the hood. Tupac forced the THUG in him by joining gangs so that society can recognise him as a thug and not the young geek who went to art school and studied literature and Ballet. When he moved to California everything changed from his attitude to the tatooes on his body so that society can then portray him as Tupac the&quot;gangster&quot;.  <BR>The only real thing about Tupac's songs where the ones about women because most of them were positive. The rest is all just a joke / a facade for you followers.<BR>That's all. Take it or leave it.
B0000CFW87|2.0|Josh Groban has such potential to create beautiful music with the voice he has.  And I continue to buy his material in the hopes that he'll create that &quot;one song&quot; that makes it all worth it.<br />Alas, this album has left me cold.  Contrary to what people say, I don't believe he means what he sings.  I hear him singing about love, but it sounds disinterested and aloof.  The richness of his voice is there, but not the connection that I would feel with someone like Patty Griffin.<br />This album is just like his last one.  So, if you loved it, you will most likely love this one too.  My best wishes to this talented singer.  I haven't given up on you yet, Josh.
B000002NFM|4.0|well.. First of all I'm a Metalhead and I like occasionnally to listen to other genre rock, classic, punk, techno, gangsta rap, <BR>etc and I have to say that this Cd contains essential electronica-rap symphonys. well, I dont know if youre familiar with Prodigy, but one thing is sure: If you have a brain and love fun : (some think they have a brain but guess I have pity of em) this is a great album. The only reason why I have this album is because I saw them on television last couple of years,in show in new york If I remember well and It was kind of serious kick ass electronica here. But Metal is HIGHLY better of course!<BR>thx have a nice day.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I have to agree with most of the reviews. I have seasons 1-4. The 5th season is only 8 sub-par episodes. You know they could have done better ... the sixth season is awesome. I love these girls ... but I have to agree ... the price is too high for what you get. I will probably skip it and wait for the final season to come out and buy it. Maybe season 5 will come down and I'll add it to my collection later.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I'll admit, I am a hardcore Britney fan. But when she decided to take her hiatus, which really for her, wasn't a break... I was kind of skeptical on how she might be able to return back into the music scene. Sure, Britney gets a lot of publicity - but not for her music. Even though I own all her previous albums, I think they're not really that good. 'Britney' was the best, and that's not saying much. So literally, I counted down the days until 'In The Zone' came out, and I got it the day after. I was totally blown away by this more mature Britney! Her lyrics are better, the music is better, and even though her vocals are computerized on most of the songs, they're not as computerized as much as you think. 'In The Zone' exceeded my expectations, and for the first time in a long time, I am not ashamed to say I'm a hardcore Britney fan!<br />1.Me Against the Music - if you judged how you thought Brit's album would sound by this song as the first single, you really should take more time to hear her album. The other songs are way better than this. Good effort from Brit and Madge tho.<BR>2.(I Got That) Boom Boom - Great song, definitely catchy. It's great that Britney worked with the Ying Yang Twins. Cool 'crunk' (southern-hip-hop) beat!<BR>3.Showdown - I'm still debating on whether I really really like the song, or if it's just ok. The lyrics are really cool though.<BR>4.Breathe On Me - GREAT song. Very sensual. Britney pulls it off well.<BR>5.Early Mornin' - Britney's track with Moby. The song's cool, and Britney convinces you that she's had bad experiences with hangovers, lol.<BR>6.Toxic - I LOVE this song! It's 'intoxicating'. lol. Definitely a good track.<BR>7.Outrageous - Ah, here's the song R. Kelly wrote. Got kind of an Arabic sound/feel to it. The lyrics are a little repetitive, but other than that, it's cool.<BR>8.Touch Of My Hand - This is definitely Britney's most mature track on the album. She talks about 'indulging in herself', and the music just sets everything right. GREAT GREAT song.<BR>9.The Hook Up - I don't really like this song. I tolerate it, and I'll listen to it, but you know. The lyrics aren't that great either. Britney can do way better, and her songwriting on other tracks prove that.<BR>10.Shadow - I didn't like this song at first... I love it now. Britney's lyrical talent really shines on this track.<BR>11.Brave New Girl - Bits and pieces of this song remind me of Madonna's 'Ray Of Light'. I like this song, it's a feel good and fun song.<BR>12.Everytime - One word: Haunting. This is definitely one of the best tracks Britney has ever written, ever sung, and one of the the best slow songs she's ever had on an album. Everyone says it's a response to Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me a River', but I have JT's album, and on his track, 'Never Again', he says &quot;and all you had to do was apologize...&quot; On Britney's track, it says, &quot;and this song is my sorry...&quot; So read into however you like. I love this song.<BR>13.Me Against the Music (Remix) - I like this better than the original 'Me Against the Music.' Not much is different except the music, but I like it!<br />'In The Zone' is Britney's best album yet. She shines on this album, and is more mature and in control of her musical direction than ever. I think she could pick up a new wave of fans, older fans, if they'd just take the time out to listen to her music and what she has to say. As for me, I'm gonna be with her until the end. And with this album, Britney proves that she's not going anywhere anytime soon.<BR> Go out and buy 'In The Zone.' It'll definitely be worth it!
B000003TAR|5.0|Better than Nevermind. I'm in love with every song on this album. Unlike rock today you can listen to this album numerous itmes over, and not get tired. Kurt Cobain was a musical genius. Too bad he did what he did. Maybe Nirvana would have made another classic CD, maybe they would have gone downhill, like Slayer and Metallica? Unlike some grunge bands, Kurt Cobains lyrics are meaningful... 'I miss the comfort in being sad' 'This legendary divorce is such a bore' 'Serve the servants' 'Frances Farmer will have her revenge on Seattle'..! 'All in all, we all are'<BR>'What else can I say...Everyone is gay' Brilliance really.<BR>In Utero varies a bit... 'Pennyroyal Tea', and 'Heart Shaped Box', to... 'Tourettes' and 'Scentless Apprentice'. I'm not saying their bad, their actually all great. Kurt Cobain has such a fantastic voice, he could scream loud as, whisper softly... Sometimes in the same song... I cannot recommend any best songs on here, their all brilliant. I read a Rolling Stone magazine, it gave In Utero 4 stars, and said Kurt Cobain was no more than an average rock star, or loathing grunge... person. I completely disagree, Cobain has had a bad life, and he still made millions smile with his musical talent, even at his own expense.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The first X-Men movie was not what many fans had expected it to be, simply because the first X-Men movie was simply introducing the characters to the audience. The thing that X-Men fans do not understand about these movies is that these movies are not meant specifically for just X-Men fans; because it is a massive production, it will reach a much broader audience that know nothing of what the X-Men are. Story has to be changed a little, but the layers of stories and characters will remain. Many of the aspects from the original X-Men story may be changed or added, but this was done with careful consideration to fans.<br />X-Men 2 picks up off where X-Men 1 left you, with the introduction of the main X-Men characters, Wolverine without remembrance of his origin, the love triangle between Wolverine, Jean Grey, and Cyclops, the differences between Magneto and Professor Xavier. Wolverine discovers his origin, as well as meeting his enemy and maker. The enemy in this story is not mutant threat as the first one, but rather the human side to evil, which is a nice touch. The school is attacked, and there is a threat to mutant kind. It shows new characters, new relationships and new alliances forming. Jean Grey is also evolving, which gives more insight into the next film. A new character is introduced, Nightcrawler, who is a much layered character and plays a significant part in the movie.<br />One of the major aspects of characters in this movie, as a sequel especially, the same actors/actresses return to play their characters. New characters are introduced as well, many subtle and only known to those X-Men fans out there. Each character is based off the comics, layered and each with their own personal stories, powers, and struggles. Though the number of characters to remember may be boggling to some, the movie clearly shows who is who, and what those individuals are. This movie simply shows glimpses of new characters: Colossus, Hank McCoy (Beast), Shadowcat, who will no doubt appear in the next X-Men film.<br />Action sequences are just awesome; they did not hesitate with special effects and stunts. It is constant set-up fight scenes, it leaves you just amazed and wondering on how they did certain effects. This movie does not leave you bored, and you have to see the movie to know what I am talking about. Let me just tell you that these action sequences are not to be missed. Some of the best so far that I have seen, even when compared to the Matrix trilogy. Wolverine actually kills people in this movie, something most people have been waiting for Wolverine to do.<br />Besides being such an awesome, character-filled movie, with great storyline, and awesome action and effects, it is very well thought-out, touching on the issue that X-Men 1 touched on: acceptance. This goes further into that area and whole idea of being different, and being hated for that reason. One must watch this movie to fully understand.<br />This DVD is a must for people who like this movie, or still haven't seen. It gives you the most incredible insight to the behind the movie, the thinking behind it, the ideas. It goes through action sequences, interviews with cast, and hours of other extras. Let me tell you that watching the movie, then the behind-the-scenes look really shows what kind of brilliant gem this movie is. It shows the origin of X-Men, comic books to movie screen, the story behind Nightcrawler, behind the effects of fight scenes, and more possible story lines for future X-Men movies. It also has commentaries from Bryan Singer, the director, and Newton Sigel, cinematographer, and writers and producer commentaries. The most significant feature is the ultimate making-of documentry.<br />The movie is awesome for X-Men fans, awesome for movie fans who want to see some action and excitement, a thoroughly good movie. This movie does what a good movie does for everyone: leaves you with questions of what's going to happen, leaves you wanting to watch the nextmovie. It just leaves you saying, &quot;Cool&quot;.<br />I truly give this movie 5 stars: 1 star for avoiding the lable of a typical bad sequel, 1 star for continuing use of same actors/actresses and new characters, 1 star for awesome action sequences and effects, 1 star for the story continuing from the first movie and blending it still with the original comic book stories while keeping character and conflict interest, and the last star for just pulling it all off so well and being such an awesome, well-thought, well-coordinated film.<br />A movie that everyone, regardless a X-Men fan or movie fan, should watch at least once. Because if you like it the first time, it's guaranteed to watch it at least one more time.
B00005B36H|5.0|&quot;Swirling round with this familiar parable. <BR>Spinning, weaving round each new experience.<BR>Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this<BR>chance to be alive and breathing&quot;<br />Music is probably the most purist form of art, it reflects thoughts and perspectives in an unique manner that can neither be explained or duplicated.  True music, that is music in the form of art reflects and elevates the human emotion.  This is Lateralus.  This is why so many listeners of Tool are in fact obsessive fans,  Sure Maynard James Keenan's lyrics and vocals are intellegent and compelling, meaningful.  Sure with Adam Jones at guitar, Justin Chancellor on bass, and Danny Carey on drums, Tool forms a profound and unique sound that no other band can replicate.  But more than that, more than anything, it's the feeling and emotion that tool brings that makes their music so beautiful, so powerful.  Opiate gave Tool their beginning, Undertow gave us their intensity, Aemina brought us their overpowering perpective, but it's Lateralus that further elevates our awareness of our emotions.<br />I do consider myself a music fan.  The one aspect that draws me to the music I listen to is emotion.  It's this sensation, whether it be Bjork, Miles Davis, Outkast, or Radiohead that concerns my mind.  Someone who can make me feel music instead of hear it.  And Lateralus is without a doubt my favorate album in my collection.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Already director Gasper Noe has established himself as one of the more brutal and shocking directors in the film spotlight, similiar in many ways to japenese director Takashi Miike (Audition).  Unlike Takashi, who's horror is more percise and articulate to give you a creepy feeling, Noe comes brutal, raw, not holding anything back.  The type of visual effect that leaves you putting your hand over your mouth in shock.  This is truely a violent and disturbing film.  <br />Irreversible is more than just a shocking film with violent imagery.  The film is played backwards similiar to Christopher Nolan's Memento, though it's stylishly different then it.  The latter part of the film still stays very interesting even after the climax of the film which is near the beginning.  This was my major concern regarding the film before I watched it, but my worry was replaced with an intriguing storyline that kept my attention.  The technical part of the film was very refreshing, the shots were unique and lively.  The writing was sharp and the acting was very realistic.  The one aspect that Gasper Noe maintains throughout the film is it's human perspective.  No matter how sensative, violent, or burtal, the film never loses it's human beauty.  Even though human ugliness is not a new concept in cinema (even the greats like Kurosawa and Bergman dealt with this theme in really all their films), Noe shows us this light in a fresh and innovative view.  Almost too real of a view.<br />If you do enjoy this film, be sure to watch Gasper Noe's previous work, &quot;I Stand Alone.&quot;
1577311760|5.0|My sister handed me a box of tapes called the Power of Now by some guy whose name I couldn't pronounce... I thought, Oh, yeah, another self help guru... but as I drove home, I popped in a tape and immediately connected to his words... took me a little while to get used to his accent, but once I did, his voice soothed me... I am familiar with the concepts he speaks of, as I was raised Catholic, then as a teen learned TM, then the Berkeley Psychic Institute, which led me into bodywork, healing, physical therapy... then Course In Miracles spoke to me... and the Power of Now incorporates all these and more... so it speaks to all of us, it doesn't exclude anyone and it's refreshing how Eckhart Tolle (TOLE-ay) doesn't draw attention to himself, but rather his message.  PON has helped me stay centered and elevated during difficult moments and I'm very grateful for this work... I've given several friends these tapes, some are mildly affected, while others are transformed!  I, for one, have been changed for the better... enjoy! breathe! Love! This is IT!  Kerrie

B00006FDCD|3.0|Now &quot;IT&quot; is my favorite novel, and when i heard there was a movie out i was really exciting and as i am watching this i realize there are so many key parts that were in the book that got left out of the movie so if you have read the book you probably won't enjoy this maybe you will but thats just my opinion, now if you haven't read the book and just want to watch a good movie this is for you and the one good thing i really liked was how john ritter(R.I.P) played my favorite character Ben and he played him well. So i believe there to be alot of pros about this movie and tons of cons so watch for yourself and you be the judge
0345451325|3.0|I enjoyed the book it feels in the for what is not know in the video  game.  But in the video game if u here hit by plasma form a plasma rifle it would not damage u severly unilke the end of the book when the master chief goes one on one with and elite and a elite would not go down so easily in the game.  In the book the weaponry used such as the MA5B assult rifle would be able to out grunts with one round a peice in the game the amount of amunition that would be used to kill a grunt would be more.  The book also has some false in formation where they say that they made the MJOLNIR capable of deflecting needler rounds even though in the game they are not deflected.  I also find it hard to belive that the spartans whent so long with out their sheild in the game halo that it what u rely on the most is your sheild.  If the armor is armor then why do u take damage from a round even with ou the sheild.  Another part is the book several marines were trying to get to the HQ and trying to out run the covenant at the same time, on the way a banshee sees and begins to engage the marines fleeing in their M 12 LRV or warthog and were following a stream a plasmar ound hit the jeep and the book says that the jeep would have been a gonner if it wasn't for the water that was below them.  All im tryin to say is that the book doesn't keep up with what is the reality of the game.  If that master cheif was so fast and then how do the marines last that long a gainst the covenant and u still struggle and if ur so fast and u piss off marines on the game when they oben fire they still hit u.  The book is good it has plenty of action it fills u in on alot, enjoy it and just dismiss the false reality of the book. AN if ya wanna hit me up u can at spartan130@hotmail.com
6305882592|5.0|One of the questions I always wind up asking people that I like, as I get to know them, is &quot;Have you ever seen Harold and Maude?&quot;  The answer is almost always that they have not seen it, though they may have heard about it, but they're just not sure.  How could such a great movie escape the radars or so many bright and inquisitive people?  I don't know the answer to this.  Maybe you do.  All I know is that whenever someone tells me that they haven't seen it, I drag them home and put in this DVD.  I've introduced a lot of people to this movie, and they all say they love it.  So if you haven't seen it, watch it, and if you have seen it, make everyone you know watch it.
0375703861|5.0|You'll be very sorry and miss out on a great book. There is such an amazing cast of characters in this book that I have begun to think of them as acquaintices rather than characters, and I have to constantly stop myself from referring to &quot;You know, that waiter we met... Oh yeah, you didn't read that book. Never mind.&quot; It is just an incredible web of well fleshed-out characters that are actually connected by a cohesive story.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|Not sure if I am buying this album since I have all of the songs but the new one: &quot;burn you up, burn you down&quot; which I think is from the game &quot;MYST.&quot; The single for that song is $12 and has 2 songs on it. &quot;Hit&quot; is a 2-disc collection of PG's greatest hits is $11. Simple math says - better buy to get HIT. weird.<br />Couldnt be a bigger fan.
0060987464|5.0|Now there are two reasons i picked up this great book A. I am a huge fan of Mr. mansons music B. i wanted to learn more  about the man behind all of the controversy the media consistantly brings up whenever his name is mentioned. From the 1st page on i was engrossed in this brilliant book he hides nothing and tells all, embarresing or not, disturbing or not, trouble with trent reznor( ex good friend and the man behind NIN) the problems he had with his bandmates his childhood, parents,grandparents, everything. You do learn alot and find its not about controversy to him its about being him and it offends you thats your problem he even ha a uote that i love &quot; if you want to be like me then be who you really are.&quot; As you read along you realize he grew up somewhat normal(some what being the key word) was outcasted as a boy loved music was very creative Some parts though are just so out there, that they may have been fabrigated a bit, those parts will shock die hard hristians if they have the decency to put there gos aside and read this book. The reason the haters of manson should read this manly is even if you hate him you can learn why he is and theres reasons why so pick this book up put your weak ehar aside ( if you have one) and enjoy a good autobiography but an intelligent rockstart enjoy and beware once you pick this book up it might be hard to put down.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|I listened to the two towers soundtrack and was a little disappointed because I thought it was just a little weak compared with the first movie. That is definitely not the case here.  Howard Shore does a wonderful job tugging at our heartstrings with tracks like Return of the King, Minas Tirith, and the Grey havens.  In to the West is the definite standout track on the CD.  <BR>I usually just download music instead of buy the CD but this was worth the exception.  I was blown away.  Beautiful. Jeri is the coolest.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|cmon guys. i hear too much talk about metallica in these reviews and not enough dream theater. the difference between metallica and dream theater is that metallica dissapoints. load -sucks, reload - sucks, st. anger - don't get me started. they were good on the black album and the albums before that. but enough about metallica. more DT. DT never, ever dissapoints. this album kicks ass. i thought &quot;images and words&quot; and &quot;scenes from a memory&quot; were their best albums. i was wrong. those are awsome albums but this one fits the bill. pure classic. i thought DT couldn't go too hard without messing up the album. i was wrong again. this album is by far their best. buy it . buy it now. u won't regret it.
B00005KHJM|4.0|Summary:<BR>Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward), a police officer with the force that has responsibility for Summerisle Island, is sent to investigate the alleged disappearance of a girl from the island.  When he arrives, he immediately begins to find that things are a bit strange on the island.  Despite the small number of people, no one claims to recognize the missing girl.  As Sergeant Howie digs deeper into the case, he finds a number of contradictions and ultimately concludes that either the townspeople killed her as a sacrifice or are planning too.  <br />His suspicions are heightened when he meets the leader of the people living on the island, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who confirms for him that the people of the island are no longer Christians.  They have returned to their pagan roots, as they hold more meaning for the islanders and seem to be more effectual for the harvest.  This also helps explain the numerous fertility rites Sergeant Howie has seen around the town, including: naked women jumping over a fire and young boys running around the May Pole.<br />Eventually, Howie's investigation gets the better of him when he knocks out a member of the town in order to wear his costume in the May Day celebration where the townspeople are to present their 'ultimate sacrifice'.  In so doing, Howie walks directly into the town's trap and sets himself up to meet 'The Wicker Man'.<br />My Comments:<BR>This is not a traditional horror movie in any sense.  As a matter of fact, I thought it was just a fun commentary pointing out the problems with Christianity (it's not effectual and doesn't do a good job of explaining things for the lay person), until the last 10 minutes or so of the movie.  It is only in the last 10 minutes that the underlying plot is revealed and you realize just what has happened.  And when you do realize it, it's quite shocking.<br />As far as the story goes, of course some liberties have been taken in order to create the horror aspect.  However, the liberties aren't so extreme that the movie isn't convincing.  Of course it is highly unlikely that something like this would happen today in the British Isles, but the idea is definitely a good one.  I couldn't really see any problems with the story, though there are a few erotic scenes that made me wonder if they were essential to the story.  In all likelihood, they probably were not essential, but they were adequately connected to the rest of the story to justify their inclusion.<br />The acting is about what you would expect from the early 1970s.  What does that mean?  It's not superbly refined. I believe the 70s (and late 60s for that matter) are really when the old school of acting of the 40s and 50s was meeting the newer acting styles of the 80s and 90s.  So you have something of a mixture between the two.  Edward Woodward seems to be more representative of the dashing hero from the pre-1970s school, while Christopher Lee does a good job developing the bailiwick of the post-1970s school.  Many of the more peripheral characters were actually townsfolk from the island, so to criticize their portrayal of themselves would be kind of silly.  The main female actresses, Ingrid Pitt, Diane Cilento, and Irene Sunters, weren't superb, but neither were they so bad that it took away from the movie.<br />Overall, I believe this is, sadly, a little known work of art.  Even though the erotic elements will likely be too much for many people, the unique approach at telling a horror story (within the religious beliefs of pre-Christian pagans) without the cheap thrills and scares, is a must see for all horror fans.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in pagan religions (though it does take a certain amount of liberty here), anyone that enjoys horror films, or erotica - as this film combines them all into an engaging story.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I don't have this CD, nor will I buy anything by Britney.  I have unfortunately seen her lip sync during music shows and have heard quite a few of her new songs.<br />Britney is a marketing strategy. Her mother and management team have used Britney to make millions.  I guess it worked.  Well, at least Madonna can sing live.  Britney sounds like Minnie Mouse with a cold.<br />Somebody give her a box of Kleenex.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I was reading an interview with Seinfeld creators and they confirmed that the DVD's for at least the first and second seasons should be done no later than Thanksgiving/Christmas time 2004. Personally I am very psyched, I can proudly say I have seen every episode of seinfeld, and I am a huge fan.
B00005JM02|5.0|A great movie to watch with your kids or by yourself.  This movie is too cute and has parts that will appeal to adults as well as children.  The special effects are extreamely well done and the scenery created is wonderful. The characters have great and distinct personalities.  Right from the start you will be drawn into the movie. A wonderful film.
0375404783|5.0|I had read the book but listening to it on tape was vg fun.  Each time I read it, listen to it, or watch it I can't wait to see what happens next, as if it would magically change.  So funny!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie contains more, and in my opinion needed, information to complete the story told.  There is about another 45 minutes that what was in the original version.  I am not a Tolkien fan really, but so far these movies have just been wonderful.  The acting and story lines are just excellent.  <BR>For the extra few dollars,compared to the original, this DVD is definetly worth the money you will spend on it.  Take my advice, if you are thinking of buying this DVD or the original Twin Tower movie, get this one, you won't regret it.

B0000542DJ|5.0|Wow. It amazes me that after 40 years, there are stil idiots out there that even ponder the thought of Oswald as a lone nut. How many times do all the &quot;coincidences&quot; and &quot;special circumstances&quot; need to be rehashed for us to realize something is fishy and it sure ain't the perch cooking on the stove! One of the reviewers in this section cites the half-baked, wholly inaccurate &quot;Case Closed&quot; by gerald Posner as 90% correct! Uh, excuse me? What version were you reading? His booked has been ripped apart by experts like Cyril Wecht, yet the media continues to have Posner as their &quot;go-to-guy&quot;.Does it strike anyone funny that Posner is practically the only &quot;JFK author&quot; who gets prime time every November? Posner was on the radio a few days ago, (imagine that!) and made this statement (paraphrase:) &quot;All of the documents in the JFK killing have been released. I have read them all.&quot; Uh, excuse me again, what about the thousands of documents still classified as &quot;National Security&quot; risks? Sir, you are a liar. That's not the only lie this man tells, and his demeanor and approach strike me as that of a charlatan or snake oil salesman. Even Posner himself now tries to play the fence by criticisizing the Warren report! Why? because he knows that Barr McClellan's book on JFK and LBJ is about to prove Stone's movie is closer to the truth than you would believe! JFK is a film that presents many theories, some untrue and/or disproven, but the film's central thesis is correct: a conspiracy killed JFK. Common sense tells us that bullets cannot be magical, a fat balding man in Mexico cannot be Lee Oswald, a Civil Air Patrol picture of David Ferrie and Lee Oswald is widely available proving they knew each other, and a man who defected to Russia cannot avoid facing any charges and simply waltz back into the USA and pull off this well executed murder. One needs only fast forward to the &quot;coincidental&quot; killings of RFK and MLK to see a pattern. If you can't see that pattern, you're as mixed up as the Warren Commission report. Common sense ladies and gents. You don't have to believe weird theories to see the truth. All you have to do is watch the bullet slamming into the front of JFK's head in the Zapruder film. Back, and to the left. Back, and to the left. Stone's JFK hit the heart of the conspiracy debate, because for once, the truth was told and those in power got real, real nervous. Good. I can't wait for JFK2.K and MLK to see a pattern. If you can't see that pattern, you're as mixed up as the Warren Commission report. Common sense ladies and gents. You don't have to believe weird theories to see the truth. All you have to do is watch the bullet slamming into the front of JFK's head in the Zapruder film. Back, and to the left. Back, and to the left. Stone's JFK hit the heart of the conspiracy debate, because for once, the truth was told and those in power got real, real nervous. Good. I can't wait for JFK2.
B000002JS6|5.0|From the eerie Hell's Bells to the love anthem You Shook Me All Night Long to the screw all you critics power ballad simply put as Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, AC/DC once again flexes there heavy metal muscles in Back in Black, a silent tribute to the ex-lead singer of the group, Bon Scott who died ealier that year. Even so, with Brian Johnson making his dibute with the group in this album, Back in Black hardly lacks anything the ones before it had. With not one slow ballad, today Back in Black remains as one of AC/DC's greatest albums, obviously understood if purchased. Even the less popular singles on the album, like What Do You Do For Money Honey? and Shoot to Thrill still carry a heavy head banging atmosphere, one every AC/DC fan would enjoy over and over again. At the time, with a newly refreshed line up, AC/DC had prooved they are the ultimate heavy metal band without a doubt in this single album. Bon Scott would've turned in his grave to see how great this one is.
6303471714|5.0|I had this videotape back in 1992, and I loved it soooo much that I am now buying another one! I have been doing Billy Blanks Taboe and I still think Cindy's is better. The atmosphere is constantly changing in her video which makes it more interesting to look at and not get bored so fast. The workout is TOUGH! If you are a beginner than this may not be for you...depending on your motivation. She is even sweating, taking water breaks and whining to her instructor at times. This workout uses light handweights, a chair for props, and other interesting ways to work out. I only WISH it was on DVD! It's terrific and perfect to start doing before the summer!
B0000C1733|3.0|There are good songs on this album but there definatly should be way more songs , would I buy it definatly but im still a little disappointed
B000001EL7|4.0|Love Gun contains one of the best lead guitar solos ever recorded on Ace's \\"Shock Me\\" and two great songs from Gene, \\"Plaster Caster\\" & \\"Christine Sixteen\\". Unfortunately this is the last album by Kiss that be considered a true group effort. I would actually rate it 4 1/2 or 5 stars if it was not for the sappy, Phil Spector-ish \\"Then She Kissed Me\\".<BR>This album hold up & invites multiple listens even after 25 years. A must have for any hard rock fan.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'll keep this brief: FIRST - this film is a wonderful ADAPTATION (for all you whining purist freaks out there) of a great literary creation. The changes are compelling and add to the story. If you don't like a decision Peter Jackson made merely because it is different then what Tolkien wrote (regardless of whether it makes sense, or adds tension, or character development etc.) then you are a fool. The LOTR is a story, a piece of art, a hobby, or even a passion; but NOT A RELIGION. Wake up.  <br />SECOND - to the reviewer (oceanaut1) who mentioned that Jackson made a mistake because Frodo showed the Ring to the Nazgul - you are wrong and an idiot. The Nazgul are basically blind - they could only pinpoint the ring if Frodo wore it; which is why Sam stopped him. At least do your research before complaining.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Excellent film. Really stands out to the other 2 films in the trilogy. It includes the final fight between Neo and Agent Smith, the final fight between the machines and the humans, it has the upmost greatest special effects and ending to the entire trilogy. <br />I was greatly looking foward and anticipating to the 3rd and final peice in the matrix trilogy, and I can honestly say I didn't walk out disappointed or unforfilled. I went back and saw the film for the 2nd time in the theaters, it was just as enjoyable. <br />During the entire film all I had in my mind was that final fight between Agent Smith and Neo. It was great, the usal expectancy would be that Neo would win because he is the \\"good guy\\" but the ending was amazing. Agent Smith was a big bad ass! He also got the same powers as Neo, so he could fly in the final fight. I pitty anyone who had the ending blown for them before seeing the movie. Thats why I went on the 2nd day of its release. The only thing I had blown for me was that Agent Smith could fly in the 3rd installment, I wasn't pissed off at the time but intriged, still I would have liked it better if it was a suprise.<br /> yeah, I cant wait for its DVD release, I want to add it to my collection of The matrix, The matrix reloaded, The matrix revisited and The animatrix.<br />Get the DVD!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I wanted to catch Neil on tour this summer.  It was just before the release of this CD and the entire show was devoted to Greendale.  The characters acted out the story on stage while Crazy Horse delivered the music.  It was different, but great.  Neil is a character and has a relevant point of view on today's world.  I am fairly certain I would have liked the record if I hadn't attended the show, but now I love it.  I haven't watched the DVD yet, but I am sure it is great and makes the package worth buying.  The music on this one is really the key.  It is true to form Crazy Horse and must for any fan.  I will be listening to Greendale for years to come.
B00008EY9G|5.0|If you don't want to ruin anything, then stop reading, close this page and simply buy this DVD, or just watch it somewhere ! The fact that you don't know anything will make this movie an outstanding piece of entertainment. No reviews, no plots, no introductions ! JUST WATCH IT !!! ...period.
B00008LDPU|3.0|A logical progression, for the interim between the first and second movies, to collect a group of short films by some of the worlds most talented animators based on the world of the Matrix movies. Doing an animated film based on the world of the Matrix is like a cinematic blank check. The results range from overly-ambitious to interesting, but not fulfilling.<br />First the good: Animation and visuals are stunning. Each story delivers the goods with brilliant colors, design and animation. In particular, the CGI movie &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; is impressive and could easily fool some people into believe it's live-action, if it weren't on an animated compilation. Each movie has its own unique feel, the characters look alive and full of personality. <br />The Bad: Aren't so much bad as they are, disconcerting...in a way. I feel it's misleading that the first two(or three) movies deal directly with events and themes of the first Matrix movie. &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; is a short interim piece that ties the first movie to the second (Osiris is mentioned in M:Reloaded&quot;) and tells the story of the ship that discovered the machines' plans to drill into Zion. &quot;The Second Renaissance (pts. 1&amp;2) tells the story of how the Matrix came into being. Both of these movies are very well done, &quot;Second Renaissance&quot; is a nice background story. <BR>From there, though, the films split off into their own direction. Most of them deal with those living in the Matrix and the haunting sense that their world is not real. Most of the films have a dark undertone to them. The exception being &quot;Beyond&quot;, a relatively light-hearted story about kids playing around with a glitch in the Matrix. Some of the stories: &quot;Matriculated&quot; and &quot;A Detective's Story&quot; have potential, but fall short, either because of needless eye candy (the former) or not taking the story far enough (the latter). At times, the fact that the Matrix world is so flexible works against the coherence of the compilation. &quot;Program&quot; is basically using the Matrix as an excuse to have a big samurai battle. Once again, it's very well-executed, but you can't help but think at times &quot;What's the point?&quot; &quot;World Record&quot; is an interesting story, but it feels like it skips over its own point in a way (in addition, the dubbing seems kind of shaky on &quot;World Record&quot; and the animation of the coach[during his conversation with the runner]is so incredibly jerky its almost comical). &quot;A Kid's Story&quot; I liked, though it had a very natural, organic feel, which sort of clashed with the other stories &quot;bio-technical&quot; style. <br />Overall, the Animatrix is a great collection of innovative, very well done, and visually-stunning films. However, the films lack cohesion and, at times, relevance to the Matrix world. It would have been nice of the stories were deeper, or tied themselves in more with the movies, but it would be difficult to things like that given that most of the films fall within 10 minutes.<br />Aside: It would have been nice if they let Dan Hertzfeldt do a film for them.
B00008IAMD|5.0|Will make you cry. Probably the best album ever released by Johnny Cash.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|True movie making innovation is achieved in a film called Memento. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to review this movie without giving away some key points. The film does not tell the story in the usual chronological order, but rather alternates scenes from the beginning and from the end of the story, one after another, until the movie ends at the middle of the story. Confused yet? Let me explain.<br />The movie begins in color with the first scene showing a developed Polaroid picture. Someone's hand shakes the Polaroid, but each time it shakes the picture is fading out. We soon see that the scene is literally going backwards. The next scene is in black and white and a man is in a hotel room. If you are closely paying attention, you realize that the black and white scenes are moving forward in time, while the color scenes are moving from the future, backwards, at the same time. The movie's conclusion has the black and white and the color scenes meeting up at the same point in time, so the movie ends at the middle of the story.<br />The crazy scene sequence tells an interesting, edge-of-your-seat story. We meet a man, Leonard Shelby, who cannot make new memories because of injuries suffered when he and his wife were attacked. His wife died in the attack, and Shelby has set out to find his wife's killer. Because he cannot make new memories, Shelby takes Polaroid pictures of almost everything to remind himself of the people he meets and the hotel where he stays. He also tattoos various messages to himself all over his body. The most important of these refers to finding his wife's killer.<br />Memento is groundbreaking in terms of its innovative, unusual screenplay, which earned an Oscar nomination for best screenplay. The actors do a magnificent job of telling the story and making it very realistic.<br />If you are a moviegoer who needs the story to be spelled out logically from beginning to end, then you may not enjoy Memento. While the storyline is excellent and the acting is great, the style of scene sequence could leave you frustrated and confused. However, if you can pay attention to detail and like a challenge, don't wait any longer. Buy this movie now!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This CD is crap. Britney doesn't sing, because she can't. All she does is whisper, moan, and do those orgasmic sounds she's really good at. They try to drown out her voice with all these loud, generic beats and do computer effects to her voice. The production is horrible. Britney is just copying other people because she has no talent of her own. I swear this CD sounds exactly like her last one, and the one before that. She is not a real singer. Mandy Moore is so much better. Everyone, go get 'Coverage'. That's real music. Let Britney lipsync and strip all she wants, that's all she's good at. Don't buy this crap CD.
0385504209|3.0|To start with, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a thriller through and through. The writing is as formulaic and hackneyed as your average thriller, though clearly no one cares about this. Characters are one-dimensional, the plot is too convenient, the chapter set-up is annoying at best - what I'm getting at is simple. The book should not be read if you are looking for a literary novel about the early Catholic Church and the Holy Grail. Nor should it be read if you are looking for an intelligent read. I say go in looking for ideas to research later.<br />The meat of the book is the controversy surrounding Brown's view of the Holy Grail. His theory, one certainly not new, concerns the possibly marriage between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, their offspring, the early Catholic Church's persecution of Mary and the centuries' long fight to preserve the bloodline of Jesus and Mary.  Valid ideas? Eh. They are supported by a variety of sources (not given) and symbols<br />Supposedly the Gnostic Gospels and Dead Sea Scrolls support this claim, with some loose interprations and evidence contrary to the printed Gospels. Also, the (somewhat) recently discovered history of the Priory of Sion (an old French secret society), its ties to the Knights Templar (and Masons) and the hidden imagery in select Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings are supposed to shed more light on an otherwise murky subject. Brown uses a bevy of symbology to link everything together, and while for the layman this is dangerous, he has no regard for the layman.<br />Your average person doesn't know much about ancient symbology and if you read this book and fall into that category, you'll probably be swayed to believe all he says is true. That's where the danger lies in symbology, especially ancient symbology. One of the central keys to said field is the iconic image, like the cross, the smiley face, even Superman's 'S'. Brown uses old icons - these images that are meant to have broad meanings; the smiley face is the best example of an icon anyone relate to because of its simplicity - to bolster his new claim. An upward wedge (^) is masculine, and is historically so (check a book of symbology) and a downward wedge (v) is feminine, again something we know as fact. Ancient societies used these two symbols for male and female and Brown would have us believe they are the only ancient male and female symbols, but that is beside the point (obelisks and lone pillars, people!). Combined they make the Star of David, and you probably wonder why I am mentioning all of this but there is a point - the Star of David is the combination of two triangles, one reaching to God, one to Earth. That is its historical significance. Brown's modern interpretation (a supposed revelation) based on the aforementioned ancient symbols (^ and v) is bad history; when you know why an icon or symbol was created, you don't then force other history onto them.<br />Unfortunately, he doesn't give this interpretation of the Star of David, only his own, supported by no texts, which leads me to what for the sake of length, I'll make my last criticism. I feel Brown should've written a critical analysis of the Holy Grail, Jesus, the Priory of Sion and Mary Magdalene, not a muder myster/thriller. Even still, he should've inculded a bibliography (annoted would help also) so we can leave the book and check his sources. As it stands, he gives us supposed facts and expects us to swallow them whole, which the layman reader will. To me, his book rests on the shoulders of the work of dozens of others, and while there is an acknowledgement, there is no list of sources.<br />All right I lied. One more thing - I found the book engaging and it forced me to remember old things learned in history classes and read. I'd previously paroused the Gnostic Gospels, and from what I found they enhance the published Christian writings, perhaps amend or alter a few things, but past that are merely the extended teachings of Jesus. I didn't see them as he did - damning to Christianity (or our perception of it). Anyway, what I mean to say is the Dan Brown is not a reliable author (I apologize for my tangents). The man has a passion for what he is writing about, but he also has a deep seated hatred for the Catholic Church and while I don't agree with them all the time, it's my opinion that they are generally trying to do good. Even in the beginning; but Brown cannot accept that and (together with Angels and Demons) villifies the church and the greater Christian religion with little evidence. That's not good writing. One of the basic questions a writer has to ask himself at the end of a book is, &quot;Is this responsible?&quot; (or perhaps, am I responsible for it/in writing it?) I do not believe he even stopped to consider, instead barreling ahead because, like he says about the Catholic Church, he has an agenda.<br />I do not see why this is a bestseller, from a logical standpoint. Poor writing + religious controversy shouldn't equal a best selling novel, but.... People can look past the writing to the ideas, and that is what this book is about. But should you pay attention to and then accept them when the author writes in such an irresponsible manner? That is for you to decide. But please, for me, if you are engaged as I was and don't know anything about what you've read, go to your library or bookstore or here and find other books on the topic from authors on both sides of the idea. Don't let this mediocre fiction sell you ill-conceived fact.see them as he did - damning to Christianity (or our perception of it).

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Do you idiots not see through the publicity and lies? Britney is not a singer. I can count on one hand the number of times she has performed live, sounding as constipated and in pain. The rest of the time, she takes her clothes off and moves her lips while dancing Janet Jackson copied choreography. This CD is utter garbage. You can't even hear a thing she's saying. The lyrics are worthless. The vocals sound like a 10 yr old. The only thing this CD is good for is the naked pictures of Britney.

0345440900|5.0|I loved this book! It was the best parenting book that I read when I had my first child.    We were getting little sleep, having way too many fussy spells, and pretty much getting stressed out when I read this book. Within a couple of weeks we were a totally different pair. My baby was sleeping for long stretches, she was happier, and we had a predictable schedule to plan our days by. E.A.S.Y. was so easy to impliment and it was extreamly helpful.    I didn't read it until we were having problems. I would suggest new moms start to read it before the baby comes and then you will have the basics to go by. I have gotten it for a few of my friends who are new moms and they have all thanked me.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney is the most untalented singer out there.  I can't believe people listen to her music and most of all her ANNOYING voice!  Wow, how can people even compare her to other artists like Christina Aguilera who have TRUE talent!  Christina is soooo much better!  She is the greatest singer and her songs are meaningful!  Also, John Mayer is awesome and so are people like Mandy Moore, Jason Marz, Nelly Furtado, Alicia Keys, and Luther Vandross.  Why do people want to listen to this crap?  Britney SUCKS!!!  Do NOT buy this cd!
B00005JMFR|5.0|The movie was absolutly fantastic.  I loved it.  The animation, acting, music, plot, etc. was unbelivably well crafted!  I've seen the other two and loved then as well, but this one even gave me chills!  I think this movie has something for everone; it has romance, action, adventure, tradgedy, humor, fantasy, etc.  I highly recomend this movie!
6304711905|3.0|I think that the effect of this movie was really hurt by 2 versions of the Earp brothers and the gun fight at the Okay Corral coming out within about 6 months of each other.  The other movie being &quot;Wyatt Earp.&quot;<br />The gun fight was more accurate than previous movies about Wyatt Earp and his quest for revenge/justice, but it wasn't as accurate (according to court documents) as &quot;Wyatt Earp.&quot;
0060977493|5.0|I read \\"The God of Small Things\\" a while back, and must add it is one of the most powerful novels I have ever set my eyes on. The plot was difficult to catch on to at first, but by the end the stray bits and pieces fit together perfectly. With Roy's writing style one is able to view the world through the eyes of Estha and Rahel -- twins lost in a world of adult justice. The coming together of the novel as a whole at the end is truly beautiful. If you really care for a truly rewarding reading experience, if you like to ponder over what you read, if you are ready to know the unknown, if you are an unprejudiced reader who does not try to 'judge' an author without first sampling his or her writing, if you need to understand how myth, history and life are intertwined in the Indian consciousness, just try reading \\"The God of Small Things.\\"
B00005RHF8|4.0|I was surprised that this movie was pretty close to the book.  With most books that become movies, they are NOTHING like what the author had in mind, but this one is.<br />Another reviewer commented on the quality of the DVD: I have had no problems with mine.
B00005QW4K|4.0|There are two types of B movies.<BR>One that is so bad, it is actually unwatchable,and closer to X Y Z than B.<BR>The other type, is a film that does not take itself too seriously,made by talented filmmakers,and closer to A than B: Army Of Darkness,the third installment in the Evil Dead trilogy falls squarely in the latter type.<BR>To describe the film as horror however is a bit far fetched. Army of Darkness is essentially a comedy, absurd, over the top,and chaotic, but a comedy nonetheless.Even the blood and gore and those evil skeletons chasing our hero Ash (an excellent Bruce Campbell) have a comic feel to them, and this is exactly why the film works so well.The horror/comedy genre is a very grey area, and many a director has failed to get the right balance between the two,and as a result his/her film would be lost in predictable suspense and cheesy one-liners added for humour.However Sam Raimi,(like Spielberg and Tarantino,a director who has started his career early, driven by his passion for cinema),succeeds in sticking to absurd comedy,all dressed up nicely in the tension of the 'horror' atmosphere.<BR>This edition is the best to own, because it includes Raimi's original movie, butchered at the time of its release by the studio.This saddens me to no end, to see executives who have no artistic or creative bone in them, deciding what the audience would like or not, and tampering with the director's own vision,(sometimes relying on a 'test audience'-but they are to creativity what a mosquito is to a good night sleep, a bloody nuisance).A very recent example of this,on the set of Exorcist 4 :The Beginning,is replacing  one of the best director/auteur in American cinema,Paul Schrader with Renny Harlin, because the studio and its test audience thought Schrader's copy was too psychological and did not have enough 'pea soups'!! what a scandal!  <BR>Anyway, back to Army of Darkness,<BR>the studio version, which is 15 minutes less than the original film, has a sentimental happy ending, while Raimi's cut is more 'Planet of the Apes' apocalyptic, which gives an appreciative depth to the film.A lot footage was cut also from the battle scene, which although is not Lord of the Rings, it is quite well made for its budget.<BR>So, Army of Darkness is a very good and hilarious B movie that you will immensly enjoy.Buy it and B entertained!
6303269826|5.0|I had to watch this movie for a class I'm taking on media.  We had to compare it with other movies that covered the gun fight at the Okay Corral.  This one, according to court documents from witnesses is the most accurate.<br />I think that the effect of this movie was really hurt by 2 versions of the Earp brothers and the gun fight at the Okay Corral coming out within about 6 months of each other.  The other movie being &quot;Tombstone.&quot;<br />It was pretty gory compared to other movies about Wyatt Earp and is battle for revenge/justice.
B00005Y7PS|4.0|More melodic and diverse than \\"Headless Cross\\", but no less heavy, TYR reveals a more suitable musical setting for Tony Martin's strong melodic vocals and is a refreshing diversion from the \\"Satan\\" overkill of it's predecessor.<BR>The musical tapestries here are more dense, more textured, and more varied--with one extreme being the doomy metallic bludgeon of 'Sabbath Stones' and the beautiful, melancholy acoustic guitar/vocal interlude of \\"Odin's Court\\" being the other.<BR>And, again unlike TYR's predecessor, the phantom of commerciality rears its head on the bouncy-yet-heavy tracks 'The Lawmaker' and the irritatingly catchy 'Jerusalem', although the balladish 'Feels Good to Me' actually won the coin toss for airplay. But even with these uptempo sing-along tunes present, TYR never sinks to the level of gratuitous pop, a credit to Tony Iommi's compositional skills. On the contrary, even the catchiest numbers are quite heavy and worthy of the Black Sabbath name. <BR>The lyrical topics span the globe on TYR, yet the album's centerpiece is the trilogy: 'The Battle of Tyr/Odin's Court/Valhalla', which draw inspiration from Norse mythology--a very suitable subject for heavy metal. Perhaps this album gave birth to the current \\"Viking Metal\\" genre. <BR>Cozy Powell still pounds the skins in his own mammoth style here, yet the primary focus on this album seems to be the vocals. Tony Martin really shines throughout as his clean voice is more appropriately placed in the melodic environment which permeates TYR, especially on the aforementioned \\"Odin's Court\\".<BR>I'd officially give this 3.75 stars, but round up for Tony Martin actually sounding like he belongs on a Sabbath record.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|As a casual Springsteen fan at best since Born in the USA's seven singles over-saturated the airwaves in 1984-85, I find this to be an excellent collection. I could complain about a couple of omissions, but Springsteen himself notes in the liner notes that &quot;one man's coffee is another man's tea...&quot;<br />All the albums in the Springsteen catalog seem to be evenly represented, and the songs are presented in chronological order. I think this approach to best-of compilations works best, as it enables the listener to hear the artist's musical development.<br />The addition of the bonus disc is a nice touch for longtime fans. I'm particularly happy to have the &quot;Hungry heart&quot; b-side &quot;Held up without a gun&quot; on CD, not to mention Springsteen's own version of &quot;From small things (big things one day come)&quot; and his cover of &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;.<br />Unfortunately, the glitch that marred &quot;Hungry heart&quot; (at 2:10 into the song) on the Greatest Hits collection a few years back is also present on this collection. Had to take one star off for ths one.<br />For three discs, it's hard to beat the price on this collection.
B00001ZT6Z|4.0|After the miscarriage of &quot;Seventh Star&quot; and the utter confusion on &quot;Eternal Idol&quot;, Tony Iommi decided to go back to what people wanted to hear from his band: purely evil Heavy F'n Metal! <BR>The music is dark and powerful, and the lyrics are equally demonic, though occasionaly border on self-parody with the &quot;Satan&quot; overkill. But who cares? At least it's Tony Iommi composing in his most preferred style.<BR>A big kick in the pants to these songs is the drumming of new Sabbath recruit (but hard rock drum legend) Cozy Powell, who was probably the best drummer ever for Sabbath with his powerful cannon volleys yet tasteful style.<BR>Also on deck is Queen guitarist and close friend of Tony Iommi Brian May, who performs the guitar solo on &quot;When Death Calls&quot;, not &quot;Nightwing&quot; as an ignorant reviewer suggests. <BR>Vocalist Tony Martin, though able to carry a tune, is not quite the optimal singer for songs of this nature. His voice is too clean for lyrics like these, sapping them of any creepiness they could have had. Without the maniacal edge of Ozzy's early voice, or the gruff edge of Dio's voice, the songs suffer from campiness when sung by a guy who'd be better off singing pop songs.<BR>Produced by Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell, the sonic effect of the album is adequate, with its huge guitars and drums, but is a little washed out with reverb it seems. Yet that's a minor complaint when compared to how good it is to have them back playing some decent music which can definitely, finally, be classified as HEAVY METAL.
0385504209|4.0|i never read anything by Brown before.  the book was loaned to me by a co-worker.  it was difficult to put down.  i kept wanting to know what was going to happen next.  it was exciting and captured me right away.  i enjoyed the book so much that i'm buying another book of Dan Brown's.  i like his style.  i liked the way he developed the characters and gave you just a little along the way.  just as the two main characters were discovering why the murder happened we discover more about them.  i hope to see those two cahracters again in a story.
0060555661|5.0|Graham is without doubt an intelligent man whose insights into investing are worth reading. This book, while dated in its examples, is not dated where it counts - intelligent investing philosiphies. The essay written by Mr. Buffet at the end of the book is also very informative and also enjoyable to read.<br />However, as always with such books there comes a caveat. Mr. Zweig's commentary through the book is not of the continuously high standard with which Graham writes. It disrupts the flow of the book and detracts from the overall experience of reading Graham's fine work. My suggestion is to ignore Zweig's commentary and footnotes until you find there is something that you don't understand or want further thoughts on. Zweig provides a few cutting insights, but only a few.<br />Dispite this the books value is not diminished - it's well worth your time and your money.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|&quot;One Upon A Time In The West&quot; is Sergio Leone's epic spaghetti western that pits Charles Bronson - playing sort of the good guy - against evil incarnate, Henry Fonda - as the psychotic Frank.  The murder of Claudia Cardinale's entire family at the beginning sets off this power keg of action, coupled with stunning cinematography and a methodical pacing, that only a director like Sergio Leone carry off without coming off as slow or contrived. This is the spaghetti western sublime.<BR>TRANSFER: INCREDIBLE!!! Paramount Home Video gives us a gorgeous looking DVD. The anamorphic transfer is stunning! Colors are sumptuously rendered with the entire landscape a viceral sea of rich golds, burnt browns, deep blacks and wonderful sky blues. Contrast and black levels are bang on. There is no shimmering of fine details, pixelization or aliasing for a thoroughly smooth looking mastering effort.  An extremely subtle hint of edge enhancement crops up now and then, but it is so incredibly minute that to even mention its presence seems grossly unfair. The audio is equally impressive. The 5.1 remastering effort brings forth a robust sound in all 5 channels, with a strong base and incredibly integrated sound field.  Yes, dialogue is slightly forward sounding but hey, are you really going to complain about that?  I wouldn't.  Especially since the audio has been restored with zero hiss and the utmost clarity throughout.<BR>EXTRAS: Here too, Paramount impresses.  Three documentaries cover the film's development and release from all angles.  There's also an audio commentary, the theatrical trailer and some other quickie stuff to maul over.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: This is an absolute must for anyone who loves westerns, movies in general, or has forgotten why it is that North Americans have embraced the medium as their ever-lasting and totally unique art form. YES, can't say it enough, YES! YES! YES! YES!
B000127LW2|5.0|Just Kidding. No, really, I'm writing a review for Star Trek: Voyager (ST-V). I had never been interested in Sci-Fi untill my bro-inlaw introduced me to Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was cool and all, but I have never had a TV Show hit me harder than ST-V. It has it all: suspence, drama, sexuality (BIG PLUS, especialy 7 o' 9), special effects, action, things that blow up, and suprises that will blow you away. I highly recomend ST-V, But it doesn't really get that good untill season 4. Then again, thats when 7 o' 9 came on the show (5 stars on her, too).
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd is so... original. There just isn't anything that sounds like this wonderful CD. Breathe sounds surreal, Time and Money are absolute masterpieces, Us and Them... just wow. Pick this up. Now.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I have enjoyed some of the pop offerings from Britney's first albums...songs like \\"Baby, One More Time\\" and \\"Oops..\\".  \\"Slave 4 U\\" was different from those two, but it still had something sexy and intriguing about it.  This new album, unfortunatley, has nothing inspiring about it.  Good, well-constructed pop music can make up for an artist's vocal limitations.  Madonna is certainly an example of that. Britney, however, does not have a backup plan.  For what she likes vocally, there is nothing mysterious, inventive or pioneering about her or her new album to make up for what she is lacking. Her breathy vocals only serve her well on one song \\"Breathe On Me\\", which sounds good, but it is by no means great.  Where Madonna, until recently, was able to tap into key elements of culture, religion, politics and fashion, Britney comes across as unsophisticated and naive. She appears to be like everyone's kid sister trying on makeup for the first time. It is amusing at first, but it seems odd and out-of-place on someone so immature.  She seems to be trapped in a world of 'safe' choices that center only around her external sexuality.  Mind you, she is beautiful, but it is her lack of personality and depth that really limits her growth.  I'm sure she has opinions and views, but I feel that she never truly reveals herself.  She will have to share much more of who she is(and I don't mean stripping) as a pop star to maintain the interest and the buying power of music lovers.  Granted, many people may not like Christina Aguilera or her clothing, but there is absolutely no doubt that she CAN sing.  The only time I have heard Britney sing live was at the Grammys 3 years ago and it was very poor.  Since then, I have never seen an actual 'LIVE' performance, and no one has to guess as to why.  Kelly Clarkson as a counterpoint is an example of someone who has a voice, but not any type of style.  Britney needs to challenge us and get out of her SAFETY ZONE.  Her career will depend on it. Until then, I'll be waiting for her next album in 2005...
B000006TRV|3.0|Pink Floyd is one of my favorite bands, but I can't say I like The Wall that much... Roger took too much of it into his own hands. The tracks Gilmour collaborated on are the true greats. If you get this, get it for Young Lust, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, etc... the rest is just dismal filler however.
B000005H4K|5.0|I won't go into depth on this amazing record--'cuz I ain't that deep! An amazing album, the one that really got me into jazz. I originally had it on vinyl, and the record has an unbelievable sense of drama and pace as it goes from song to song. This older, original CD release always annoyed me because the tracks are in the order they were recorded at the sessions, in order to preserve the &quot;historical value&quot;.  Well, that is really dumb. That is like putting out a version of a movie in the order they shot it day by day, rather than the final assembled version that hits the screen. On Money Jungle version 1, each song is great, but the old CD lost the power of the sequencing. I used to reprogram the order on my CD player to get it right--but what a pain! They should have released it in the proper, final sequence, then told you what order to program it in if (for some bizarre reason) you wanted to hear it in the &quot;historical&quot; sequencing. Isn't it just as &quot;historical&quot; to release it in the order that Messrs. Ellington et. al. thought it should go in? I've just never seen a packaging move that was so stupid--especially coming from a label like Blue Note, one of the great prestige labels.Fortunately, I just noticed there is a newer REMASTERED version that is in the proper order and with some xtra cuts. So it is off to one-click that baby and trade the old one in! Seriously folks, a truly amazing, far-out, gorgeous album by three serious cats. Get it, daddy-o!
B00006F7S4|5.0|Wow, I thought I would be a voice in the minority with this one. I find this excellent work to be beautiful, internally-focused, thought-provoking and moving; an expression of many of the emotions of the times in which we live. I thought that most people attracted by Beck's more outgoing, fun and wacky side would be turned off by this. Finding the opposite to be true was a revelation. Beck seems to have changed course and discovered an uncharted, flowing sea of widely-shared thoughts and emotions.
B00004YA66|5.0|What a great film!  I really enjoyed pretty much everything about this movie.  Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat (which rarely ever happens to me anymore with movies) but the father/son relationship is one of the best I have ever seen in a film and I have seen quite a few that deal with this theme.  Surprisingly due to the sincerity of the performances and the realistic and exciting direction that never seems to let up the time travel angle really works.  Within the context of this world/story it is completely plausible and not in a goofy way like say Back To The Future.  In this story it serves a deeply rooted purpose.  This is a very suspenseful movie and I warn you it can even get a bit scary at times.  Job well done by all that were involved in the making of this movie.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I loved it. If you love the movie your sure to love this soundtrack. Trust me, it's a great cd. You feel like your back in the movies watching it again. It's an amazing cd.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A great album! I haven listen to it almost as often as to my favorite album which is autorama of the two Swiss Tristan Feldbauer&amp; Alan Mueller. Beautiful music for special moments *
0316096199|3.0|&quot;Lucky&quot; is Alice Sebold's memoir of her psychosexual development, centering on her rape as a college freshman.  Intelligent and keenly observed, it recounts the rape itself, the rapist's trial, and the aftermath during the remaining years of Sebold's college career; it also delves into Sebold's childhood and her adult attempts to heal.<br />There is much that is good about this book.  Like its teller, the story is smart and strong.  The voice is wry and sympathetic.  Sebold's extensive recounting of the long-term aftereffects of the rape is valuable, since all too often a victim's trauma is seen as ending after several months or a year. <br />But &quot;Lucky&quot; is not, ultimately, a really good book.  Something is missing, an emotional connection between the narrator and the reader, or the narrator and the other characters, that is not made.  The ending seems not to resonate.  Perhaps this is because, in writing her story as a memoir, Sebold has chosen a form that does not allow for evolution in the narrator or for extensive authorial knowledge of the other characters.  Ultimately, she is unable to rise out of this form: &quot;Lucky&quot; is the skilled telling of a story, nothing less and nothing more.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a must-read; anyone interested in mythology, history, and art, as well as thriller novels will not be disappointed. But I'm not going to rant about how wonderful it was, since you can read what others have written around this to get that---just bear in mind the writing isn't anything original, as far as format and style goes-it's very predictable and cookie-cutter.
0393307050|1.0|O'Brian's literary attempt fails to deliver readable prose. Syntax and vocabulary are convoluted and contrived. Graphic descriptions lose their purpose in paragraph long sentences. High noble speeches are artlessly artificial. Dialogs are devoid of life and human interaction. Introspective narratives fail to capture the essence of characters who are boringly flat. Scenes are disjointed and lack continuity. O'Brian's writing is rankly amateurish and hollow compared with actual writings from the age of naval exploration and battles. This could have been an exciting book with profound depth and complexity. Instead readers are given a boring, long-winded, incoherent yarn that fails to engage the reader. The author provides tedious details that do not move his story forward. Diligent readers deserve far better. If O'Brian was trying to capture existential meaninglessness in a cold universe, he is wildly successful although Sartre's Nausea and Camus' The Plague and The Stranger are more cogent.<br />Recommendation: Pass by this book; see the movie instead. If you want to read a series about naval life and battles, try C. S. Forester's Hornblower series. If you are looking for great literature with war themes, T. E. Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom or Homer's Iliad are unbeatable. James Fenimore Cooper is probably best known for his epic Leatherstocking series. Less well known are his series of sea adventures: The Pilot (1824), The Red Rover (1827), The Wing-and-Wing (1842), The Two Admirals (1842), Afloat and Ashore (1844), Miles Wallingford (1844), and The Sea Lions (1849).<br />After reading the book, I am left asking, \\"So what? Why should I care?\\"
B00006CXSS|5.0|I had a friend who told me that after watching &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, no other war movie can compare, and I thought to myself that it couldn't be that good, right?  Wrong!  This series was done beautifully, depicting the lives of real soldiers who volunteered for the new Paratroopers unit merely because it paid an extra $50.  But in addition to the extra cash, they built a brotherhood that was stronger than any connection any Army unit had ever known.  As they trained and fought together, it was this brotherhood that pulled them through the toughest times because they knew they couldn't make it through without each other.  It was no longer what was best for one person, they began to make choices that were best for the group.  <BR>I watched the DVD set halfway through, then decided to stop watching the film so that I could read the book.  I have to say that they did a great job making the movie stick to the facts that were in the book, and the movie and the book complimented each other.  <BR>The greatest thing about this movie is how they have the real soldiers from Easy company sharing their stories on camera.  Those men are absolutely amazing!  They did a great job incorporating the interviews with the movie.<BR>The bonus disc and special features are fantastic!  The documentary of the making of the movie, plus many other goodies, makes the set well worth purchasing for your DVD library.
B00000K2UX|5.0|Not only did the anthem win a grammy, many thanks to Steve STevens(probably the best underrated guitarist). but the soundtrack has all the essentials. its a great cd to have and you can sing along to all the songs

B0000CD5I6|5.0|With the same excellent personnel since &quot;j-tull dot com&quot;, Ian Anderson made a fantastic album. But who is the designer of the beautifull cover ( i think since &quot;broadsword&quot; or &quot;stormwatch&quot;) ? It will be great if this album will be available on vinyl or even in mini-sleeve jp form...
B000002UA7|5.0|This is an essential CD for any human that thinks. Kate Bush is a rarity in so many aspects of her art. If you can only afford one Kate Bush CD, I would recommend this one...although I think that THE KICK INSIDE is essential as well. She exudes talent, brilliance and her entire body moves with the same unique quality of her voice.<br />  BTW, I am often asked why Kate Bush fans dislike Tori Amos. We don't dislike Tori Amos, we're just tired of hearing her compared to Kate Bush---there is NO comparison---Kate is the &quot;real thing&quot;. Buy this CD and &quot;exchange the experience&quot;--KB<br />In a Good Space,<br /> ari, Queen of Fatigue
B0000CDLA7|5.0|f..k Metallica, they are not even close to the talent of DT i <BR>do not understand why do you bring up Metallica to your Dream Theater reviews, any way,  DT has always try to put a singular flavor to each and one of their albums, remember whe they came with the images and words, or with the falling into in.., or scenes from a memory, and once again they did it with these one, GREAT ALBUM, GREAT GROUP and GREAT SONGS
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I don't know what should I say? <BR>I mean I don't think there is any worse than this album or not?<BR>I don't know when there are good singers like Shakira, Christina Aguilera, etc... WHY should we listen to a crow voice?<BR>Britney becomes worse and worse every day and in every album . I suggest her please stay at your home and learn something like baking cookie.<BR>I have tried to rate very fairly. Unfotunately these are truth.
B00005221L|5.0|This is the best movie Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever done. the special effects are amazing its a thrill ride you will never get tired of watching this movie. Some commandos go to rescue a government official and finds out that some creature is following them and trying to kill each one of them one by one. as you keep watching the movie you will wonder will they escape or will they all die. you'll never know (unless you seen the movie). this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made and like i said the special effects are awesome and its a movie that will keep you guessing and guessing.you will always love this movie no matter what. the action will blow you away!!!!
B00005O3VC|5.0|After making a film version of their best Flying Circus bits (And Now For Something Completely Different), the Pythons wanted to make an original movie. They realized that the quest for the Holy Grail would lend itself nicely to a series of sketches focusing on each knight. For a climax, they planned on sending the knights into Herrods department store to buy the grail (because, after all, Herrods sells everything).<br />But somewhere along the way, this collection of medieval skits became one of the best comedies ever made. You could credit the use of authentic sets and costumes. For some reason, making the movie historically accurate makes it funnier. Or you could credit the way they used their painfully low budget --- like using different sides of a castle to represent multiple castles in the story. If you notice it, you get an extra laugh. Or you could credit the use of two directors, forcing everyone to get it right the first time to avoid two sets of solutions to every problem.<br />Whatever the reason, Monty Python and the Holy Grail holds up as one of the best comedies ever filmed. It still looks cheesy, but in a good way. The plot is full of nice big holes, too. Every time you see it, you notice something new and miss something you've memorized. The jokes don't wait for a laugh track. It's just one strange punchline after another.<br />For the special edition of the DVD, the five living Pythons put together a handful of extra bits. The best extras are the audio tracks. You hear the directors talk about set design, John Cleese complains about being wet and cold, and Michael Palin explains why everything is funny. The documentary in which the two Terrys (the directors) visit the old filming locations is fun, too. They still have their sense of humor about it all. If you like to laugh, you should buy this DVD and watch it over and over until you've memorized every line. If you don't like to laugh, you are a very strange person.
B0000DIXN7|4.0|This CD is sick! Very soulful, and she looks good too!<BR>Pick it up!
B00008PX8P|5.0|It's hard to imagine a better live DVD of Led Zeppelin than this. The music spans a decade of performances, from the early years playing blues-influenced rock to the wilder, keyboard-assisted songs of their final album. You can see the band in each stage of their brief career. Some of these songs are definitive live versions. Others are alternate takes. The multiple versions show the band exploring slightly different tempos and lengths for songs like Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotta Love.<br />But the high point is the relentless focus on the band itself. Because this footage was shot in the 1970s --- before the annoying jump-cut technique was established by MTV videos --- the camera tends to linger on each band member for a while. You get to see Robert Plant sing a whole verse before cutting to Jimmy Page. It's a minor difference technically, but after hours of watching the band perform, it has a deeper effect. You feel like you're watching a rock band, not an advertisement for the band's latest album.<br />Although the wait for this DVD was long, it was worth it. The footage has a perfect balance between grainy, you-are-there bootleg video and professional camera work. The songs are arranged on the menu with the main course up front and the long list of extras below. You can sit back and see the big concerts, then select the TV show appearances and interview outtakes if you want a little more. If you are a Led Zeppelin fan, you'll love this. If not, you should watch it and see what this band could do on stage.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I have loved Johnny Cash and his music all my life. My first record was a Johnny Cash LP on the Sun Label. I will miss him terribly in the years to come, as nobody can approach the artistic void he left.<br />This CD has several standout tracks, and to me the best of the bunch are &quot;Hurt&quot;, &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;, and &quot;Tear Stained Letter&quot;. The emotional wallop that these songs pack is rarely (if ever) found in contemporary music. Johnny's trademark, cracking baritone took me close to tears numerous times throughout the CD, and the bonus DVD of the &quot;Hurt&quot; video is physically hard for me to watch it is so powerful. (The DVD alone is worth the asking price of the CD.) These three songs and the DVD guaranteed a five star rating by themselves.<br />Although I gave the CD five stars, I didn't like the cantankerous, mean spirited, &quot;Sam Hall&quot;, and thought it would have been best omitted from the CD. I also would have preferred more Cash originals, and cover versions in his typical genre (like &quot;One&quot; or &quot;Hurt&quot;, for instance, where he excels) rather than the use of his beautiful voice on such Top 40 fodder as &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;. He did an excellent job with &quot;Desperado&quot;, but, again, that is more his genre.<br />All in all, `American IV' is a strong showing, and one that will stand the test of time. I feel privileged to have seen Johnny Cash in concert twice. Those concerts were amazing musical events, and much of the raw emotion that he poured out in live shows is captured on this CD.<br />Johnny, your loss has left us Hurt.
0385504209|2.0|Although fast-moving and often exciting, this novel ultimately becomes another formulaic disappointment. It is overall a reasonably good murder mystery with multiple synchronous plots and is set mostly in Paris, providing a nice European flavor. The excessive number of twists and \\"surprise\\" turns, however, is exceeded only by an overworked deus ex machina.<br />I found Brown's subplot involving the church's response to the recent challenges to the New Testament canon a bit tiresome and overdone. The actual very interesting history of the Nag Hammadi and Gnostic Gospels is much better presented in Elaine Pagel's recent work \\"Beyond Belief\\". The author is also inaccurate in indicting the \\"Roman\\" Catholic church as the body which supressed the \\"heretical\\" gospels, when if fact, this occurred centuries before the great schism -- a minor point, of course.<br />The complete absence of steamy and graphic sex (or any sex at all, save a chaste kiss at the end) must be unique in the modern novel. (Brown does vaguely describe one unusual sex scene which happened in the remote past.)<br />My summary:  Some good fun if you don't think about it too much while you are reading it. If you found Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" too challenging, this is the book for you.
B00007LTIL|5.0|The Dead sound has never been captured in a studio but American Beauty was undoubtedly their best studio album if not the best country/folk/rock album ever released. The remastering of this beautiful collection of songs is well worth owning and the sound quality is wonderful.This was the Dead at the absolutely peak of their creative powers both in terms of the compositions and the musicianship. The influence of Crosby Stills Nash and Young is evident in the harmonizations but the Dead were certainly more on the edge. The lryical tunes that make up this recording are some of my alltime favorite Dead songs. Ripple, Box of Rain, Sugar Magnolia.<br />&quot;If you go , no one may follow. That path is for your steps alone&quot;
B00005JMFO|4.0|\\"Love Actually\\" was good, yet confusing at times. I still can't tell you any of their names! It has nudity and some language, which is why it's rated R. I thought there would be more of Hugh Grant shown, since he's in all the previews, but he's actually in as much of the movie as everyone else. Alan Rickman (Galaxy Quest, Harry Potter) is in this movie. He's a great actor! <br />The movie follows at least six couples who are in love, have problems in their marraige, or eventually fall in love. Hugh Grant is the prime minister who falls in love with an employee. Alan Rickman is a guy who cheats on his wife. And there are many other couples as well. <br />Overall, it's a good movie, but I wouldn't take an immature child to see it. This is a movie worth seeing.
B00005JM02|5.0|Filled with colorful, realistic undersea settings and quirky characters, Finding Nemo made me laugh and made me cry. The 'lost and found' story is well-written and the animation is absolutely stunning! The documentary included on making the movie is not to be missed.<br /><br />My favorite characters are the scatter-brained, but tries-her-hardest Dory (voiced by Ellen Degeneres) and the sea turtles that seemed based on the title characters Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure. Whoa! The ending was cute when the captive fish finally escaped from the dentist's tank, only to fall into Sydney Harbor still in their plastic bags. Bummer
0142000663|5.0|great book about a family's tough journey..you won't be able to put it down.  5 stars!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I first knew of George Harrison when I was seven years old.  My older brothers were thrilled that a British band called the &quot;Beatles&quot; (in my mind, the name still was an insect reference; I recall thinking how strange!) was to appear on the Ed Sullivan show.  I quickly picked my Beatle (something of the rage in those days), and it was George.  Don't know exactly what the attraction was, but something about this guy who played in the shadows of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, that black as night Gretsch, caught my eye.  He will always be imprinted on my life as my first admiration.<BR>     This concert is fitting to the man.  His life is represented in all of its complexity and harmony. Ravi Shankar (a name that came familiar to us all because of George) offers a marvelous elegy to George in &quot;Arpan,&quot; the piece that begins the concert--a tribute to his spirituality.  Then comes Monty Python, augmented by Tom Hanks, and the outrageous humor of the &quot;Lumberjack Song.&quot;  An elegy to the humor of the man.  And then there are the many songs of his, sung with love and quite a bit of admiration by those who loved the man: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Joe Brown.  All through the concert is Dhani Harrison, George's son, looking every bit like his father in youth.  To Dhani--what a joyous occasion, to see you among so many of your father's friends.<BR>     Credit must be given to Eric Clapton, the musical director, for making the most important side, the music, work.  There are so many who played with George, and there are so many of them up on stage, it could have been a cacophony of drums and guitars if it weren't for his guidance, all for the love of the music.<BR>     Notice that I refer to the first name &quot;George.&quot;  It is only fitting.  There are few musicians who have struck any of us so deeply that we can only know them by their given name.  George, wherever you may be, God speed!
0790729709|3.0|You're going to see &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; spoofed a lot. Just two days ago I saw an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with Homer saving Mark Hamill from a horde of geeks. As the song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; swelled in the background, the image of Homer carrying an animated Mark in his arms filled the screen.<br />Of course, the film itself isn't a good movie. &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; is, in fact, a very bad movie. But I like it, in an odd sort of way. It's one of those likable but stupid movies that make the time fly by on a Friday night -- unless, of course, you have something better to do than waste your time watching Kevin Costner attempt to act and Whitney Houston attempt to love him.<br />The movie stars Kevin Costner as Frank Farmer, a bodyguard who blames himself for events from the past that come back to haunt him. Whitney Houston basically plays Whitney Houston (though the character's name is different in the film), a famous singer like herself who falls in love with her newly-aquired bodyguard and sparks an interracial romance that threatens her career almost as much as the death threats she has been receiving in the mail.<br />Frank's mission is to protect her at all costs from the assassinator, who is not a metallic cyborg and who does not bear an uncanny resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger (though it would have helped market the film). The surprise at the end is that the killer is not who we think it is throughout -- so don't think at all! Just watch. I hope I didn't ruin any part of the movie for you. But don't tempt me -- I'm about to give away the rabid fan's identity to you.<br />&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; is a big, mushy mess, filled with bad acting and bad scriptwriting. The entire movie is bad. It's way too long for its own good -- especially when it is broadcast on network television and stretched to a near three-hour showing. (Do they really provide fifty minutes of commercials these days on CBS?) I've seen the movie numeroustimes, on network television and unedited, and it always seems too long. But, despite its (extremely) bad traits, the movie is a lot of fun to watch.<br />I don't like Kevin Costner. I think he is, what I call, a *blah* actor. He talks with such a lightweight mumble that it often induces sleep. If Costner wants to make money after his film career is depleted (that's happening, folks), he should market Costner Sleep Cassettes. Insert a cassette tape/CD of Kevin Costner reading your least favorite book, and you're guaranteed to fall asleep in less than five minutes -- or your money back!<br />I found one great role that Kevin Costner has played over the years, and it was the role he played in &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; opposite Robert De Niro's Al Capone. Brian DePalma directed that movie, and it worked because the role for Costner fit his dull acting talent. Watching him attempt to *really* act is quite sad. Remember his interpretation of Robin Hood? Some people liked it, but I thought it was a disgrace to Robin Hood.<br />For what it's worth, Costner is good here, mainly because he acts like a dull bodyguard who is required to show absolutely no feelings whatsoever. His character basically walks around with a single expression on his face throughout the film, including while he's on a date with Whitney and the night after (if you know what I mean).<br />The movie sparked a lot of controversy because the couple embrace in a passionate kiss at the end of the film. If you don't mind sitting through bad acting, bad directing, bad scriptwriting, all stretched out to two and a half hours...then this is the movie for you. I, personally, sorta like it. But I don't respect it.
B0000009RX|4.0|This I give four stars only because it's impossible to get anyone else to listen to it. Most people are immediately put off by the Chipmunk vocals. In college, my roommate banned me from playing this, saying, &quot;I've tried to get into this, but it's just noise.&quot; I've often wondered what it would be like to have this on vinyl and be able to play songs like &quot;Concentration Moon,&quot; &quot;Flower Punk&quot; and &quot;Lonely Little Girl&quot; at slower speeds. I know high-pictched vocals were a norm for Zappa, but just think how good those songs would sound sung more, dare I say, conventionally. <BR>They ought to make a stage opera out of this album, a la Tommy. The plot could involve the government rounding up hippies into concentration camps in the 1960s. Wouldn't that be cool? Are you listening Moon?
B00004STUL|2.0|\\"We're your new neighbors.\\"<BR>\\"Don't be alarmed, we're negros!\\"<br />I got that quote from the IMDb entry for \\"Bad Boys.\\" I read some others, and what struck me as funny is that out of all the quotes from the movie that those perusing IMDb have submitted, none have any lines about the plot. All the quotes available are jokes and punchlines that occur in the film between shoot-outs. Nothing else.<br />But I suppose that fits the film just right. It's not a film for those who have any interest in plot, character development, or comedy - things a film such as \\"Lethal Weapon\\" had. No, \\"Bad Boys\\" is content with being a bad movie. It's for those with low attention spans. It's for those who like non-stop violence and language. But then, anyone interested in \\"Bad Boys\\" by now must be warned that the action scenes provide hardly anything new - some shoot-ups, some shoot-outs, some shoot-downs, etc. I am content with recommending action movies (trust me). But sometimes I expect a bit more than just bad jokes and bad action scenes - if it's going to be an action movie, at least make the fight scenes offer something fresh.<br />There's a buddy side to the film that never provides the type of humor that it should. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, family man and playboy respectively. They're both undercover in Narcotics division, but yet they find time to stumble upon and into things that have nothing to do with drugs whatsoever. Never mind this. <br />The film opens with an explosive prelude that signals we are in for a Bruckheimer production. It's loud, noisy, and the best part of the film. The rest is all downhill.<br />A stash of drugs has been stolen from a vault in some sort of super-top-secret Government facility thingy somewhere. This happens directly after the opening sequence and goes by pretty quick so that the audience can get back to the action. Marcus and Mike are called onto the scene by their Grouchy Boss (Joe Pantoliano), wholikes to spew spit and bite their heads off for everything. <br />Pantoliano's character is the exclamation mark to the rest of the recycled characters and plots. Get this: two mismatched cop/partners who like to throw insults at each other (\\"Lethal Weapon\\") are called onto a case involving a foreign drug dealer (\\"Red Heat\\") who has left behind uncountable traces for the good guys to follow (though it sure does take them a while). Their boss delivers long, shouting speeches at them (\\"Last Action Hero\\" spoofed this finely), and they have to protect a sexy witness (Tea Leoni). Finally they go for a big shoot-'em-up at the end (this is in any action/cop-buddy movie available to the public).<br />\\"Bad Boys\\" is just one long shoot-'em-up flick, with a bunch of recycled action set pieces, recycled plot fragments, and when all that calms down, we are exposed to bad jokes and excessive, \\"pervasive strong language\\" as the MPAA called it. I enjoyed bits of this movie, I grinned a few times, but I laughed only once - at a joke that should have been more than a laugh. It should have had me bent over in hysterics. <br />Here it is, listen up: Marcus has to pose as Mike every time he is around the witness, Tea Leoni (long story). He takes her to the real Mike's apartment. She wonders why he has pictures of another black man all over the place - and keep in mind she thinks that Marcus is Mike. The pictures happen to be of Mike, since it is his apartment, so Marcus, posing as Mike, tells her it's his partner, and that they're close. The way this scene is delivered is more of a sit-com-type comedy moment - not surprising, since both lead actors got their starts on television sitcoms. But it could have been truly hilarious - it just made me laugh. I also wondered what the real Mike is doing with pictures all over his apartment of himself. And I'm not the only person to wonder this - Roger Ebert asked the same question.<br />I will not discredit Martin Lawrence and Will Smith - the two have chemistry. Unfortunately, they also need a good script that can provide their characters with good interaction and funny moments. There aren't many here. We are supposed to trust their life-long friendship yet they don't display any signs of connection like Gibson and Glover did in the \\"Lethal\\" movies. Their chemistry alone lifted the last two in the series from being just decent movies. <br />\\"Bad Boys\\" is a movie that has a few funny moments, but none of them are hysterical. We are basically treated to long action sequences that have been done for twenty years, excessive language to guarantee an R-rating and make the movie look tougher, and bad dialogue. The only thing this movie is missing is graphic sexuality - something I heard the new - and supposedly horrible - sequel sports plenty of.<br />Even the biggest of action buffs won't find anything here. I love the cop-buddy genre, but it's getting to be a real bore. Ever since \\"Lethal Weapon,\\" \\"48 Hrs.\\" and \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\" came out it's all been retreads of the same old material. Of course, if you like cop-buddy films very much, you may like this film. Especially if you haven't seen very many.
0872860175|5.0|This book changed my life.<br />In my sophmore year of high school, my English teacher read &quot;America,&quot; a vicious commentary on tha views of the majority in this country contained in this book, to my class.  <br />I didn't think about this peom again until senior year (though it had stunned my fellow classmates and I).  Picking this great pocket edition up at my local bookstore, I had no way of realizing what kind of effect it would have on me.<br />This book is full of some of Ginsberg's most classic works.  His unorthodox style bleeds through the poems whether they are shorter, narrative odes to important figures in his life or sprawling, staggering, frenetic pieces which pull the extremes of life itself into the lines.<br />Because of this book I am now persuing poetry in college.<br />This should be required reading for Life in general.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is Britney's worst CD by far. Most of the songs are slower than her other CD's, and that means she has to SING, or whatever it is that she does. It's not a secret that Britney's voice sucks, but it really shows on this CD. Good thing I didnt' buy this CD or I would be really pissed off.
B00006AUIG|5.0|This is a very very good movie!!! It's creepy and entertaining throughout. It's a mystery, thriller, and a horror movie all rolled into one. <br />The story revolves around a 5 member cleaning crew (headed by David Caruso and Peter Mullan) who are hired to work at an abandoned insane asylum by the new owners of the property. Tensions build as the men are forced to face an enemy that is all around them creating a feeling of strong paranoia. The asylum is like a living entity all of its own adding to the already horrific circumstances. The place just keeps getting creepier and creepier.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a change in the horror genre. It is well acted and cleverly written. This was a very pleasant surprise!!!
B00008977N|3.0|I agree that this is a great concert, and a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone who enjoys collecting concerts, but the quality of the video is just plain terrible, period.  And yes, I have a high-def 57&quot; television, so it's not because I'm viewing it on a small tv.  Grainy doesn't begin to describe it.  So when I watch it, I pretend that I'm there and viewing the show through a thick smoke :)
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Wow! This is the heaviest album since &quot;AWAKE&quot;. I was surprized when I hear this first (it always happen in the case of DT.), but after 2nd, 3rd... listening, it already becomes the best DT's album. You know why? Cause DT is alwasy progressing. They never ever made the similar album before. This is why they NEVER make me bored, and why we love them! (Jame's rap is owesome!).
B000069AUI|5.0|No string of words can express or reveal the emotional energy contained within the songs on this album. Simply put, the best album of 2003. Regardless of what genre(s) of music you enjoy the most, Coldplay has the uncanny ability to transcend those lines, hitting you deep inside, where it counts most. Mister Oat says, do yourself a favor and purchase this album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I think 13th step is a fantastic kick-ass album. I can truly say that APC is the only band whose album I listen to front to back w/o skiping any songs. I fell in love with every single song from Mer de Noms. When it was announced that APC was coming out with 13th step I couldn't wait for the release date. Billy's songs come alive with Maynard's vocals. I cannot say I have a favorite song, they are all amazing to the fullest extent of the word. I mean, you have your hard-toned like The Package, the Outsider, and Pet. Then you have a more melancholic APC with The Noose, Vanishing, and Gravity. Like I mentioned, 13 STEP is a MUST HAVE. If you get the chance, go see APC live. I did this month and I must say it was a hell of a kick-ass show!! APC rocks!! Finally the rock scene has a band worth listening to!!(^_^)
B0000DD7LB|4.0|With 'In The Zone', Britney Spears continues to grow and venture off the teenybopper path she set out on. Eight of the new songs were co-written by Spears herself. With her debut and sophmore efforts, Spears stuck close to home by maintaining that very catchy bubblegum beat. On her third album, Britney, she sampled some new genres but still held pop as her number one priority. But her most recent release finds a still very young superstar delving deeper into unfamiliar territory. The album's first single, &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;, features Madonna, a collaboration fans have thirsted for since Britney's first steps on the music scene. It is very club-ready as are most of the other tracks on the album. But the fact of the matter is she could have done without the hip hop/R&amp;B songs. As with Christina Aguilera's 'Stripped', the album would have been stronger had she forgone these tunes. Their presence makes the listener wonder which direction she will go in when choosing the next singles from the album and what genre will most of her future albums consist of. Britney will have much more potential if she makes the right choices. &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; is soft and seductive, a track you might find on a Kylie Minogue album. &quot;Toxic&quot; is pumping with a twisted string part to compliment the interesting vocals. &quot;Touch Of My Hand,&quot; regardless of its true meaning, is a pretty, trance-like song where one might find themselves excersing the touch of their own hand in the whirlwind of the moment as represented in the track. The final three tracks, excluding the &quot;MATM&quot; remix, are the strongest. &quot;Shadow&quot; is a very radio-friendly song, being a pop/rock ballad reminiscent of Avril Lavinge's &quot;I'm With You&quot; with classic Britney flavor. You may find yourself getting goosebumps up and down your arms because the song does exactly what we all want it to do after the bridge. &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; is a bouncy, computerized track that hits close to Britney's bubblegum roots; a fun and energized single. The final original track is &quot;Everytime,&quot; a quiet ballad that expresses true angst over a lost love. If it were any other artist, we would expect the song to sport a powerful finale, springboarding off of the bridge into a vocal masterpiece. But with Britney, she silently hits the high notes in her falsetto and dies off into the piano. This may sound disappointing at first, but the feelings are genuine, for she wrote the track about her 3+ year relationship with Justin Timberlake. When the song finally concludes, your heart will be gasping for breath, if you truly understand the hurt one feels after losing a longtime lover. It's classic teenage heartache at its finest, if there ever was such a thing. In all, 'In The Zone' is possibly her greatest accomplishment. She has finally learned to let go of the studio's requests and has learned to trust her gut intstincts. And she has become a more powerful artist for it.
B0000C1733|4.0|Does it have every single song on it that I love from RHCP?  No.  Does it have a song or two on there that I don't think should be on there?  Of course.  A greatest hits album never satisfies all fans of any band, but this one does have all their great songs, and most of their really good ones.  Hey, if it was a true greatest hits they would have to make a double-cd, but they didn't.  This is an excellent album, just not perfect......4 stars.  In short, yes you should buy it.
B00005B36H|5.0|Since its 2001 release, many rabid Tool fans have claimed this to be the best album of all time.  This is not without cause.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; is easily Tool's most diverse, intelligent, beautiful and creative album to date, and that IS saying a lot.  There is a vast array of time signatures, song themes, and moods throughout the album.  &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; is an angry track in 7/8 that lasts nearly 8 minutes, while &quot;Mantra&quot; is a single minute of low, mumbling noise.  The whole album is obviously meant to listened to together, as many tracks are interludes or introductions to each other.  My favorite track is &quot;The Patient&quot;, a song that goes from quiet singing and peaceful electronic noise to a heavy, majestic climax with multiple vocal tracks and unconventional chords, all in 7 minutes.  Also worth mention is the 2-song set of &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot;.  &quot;Parabol&quot; is the quiet, acoustic intro to &quot;Parabola&quot; and both discuss enjoying life and not letting it go to waste.  The lyrics in general are great and very well thought out, as Maynard has a way of taking a simple idea and making it very complex.  &quot;Schism&quot; shows this.  The song is about a simple relationship, but he makes it seem so much more with his masterful language.  &quot;Disposition&quot;, &quot;Reflection&quot; and &quot;Triad&quot; are a trilogy, and are 22 minutes plus when combined.  &quot;Reflection&quot; is the best of the three, and it takes nearly 5 minutes to begin.  The band shows a lot of restraint on this album, and many build-ups and mellow sections are present. This is one album for which I can honestly say that if you think is garbage, you do not understand music.  I don't enjoy it as much &quot;AEnima&quot;, but it is an amazing piece of work and less angry and haphazard than the aforementioned release.  This is as close to perfect as anyone has come with prog rock.  Buy this if you have a brain.<br />&quot;Swing on the spiral of our divinity, yet still be a human&quot; -Maynard James Keenan, &quot;Lateralus&quot;.wing on the spiral of our divinity, yet still be a human&quot; -Maynard James Keenan, &quot;Lateralus&quot;.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I had very high expectations for this DVD, and they are fulfilled by all means. The extra scenes are great additions, but I feel they were sometimes tedious. If the disk only came with the extra  Gollum and Faramir scenes, it would have been more than enough- I could see why the others were cut. The Faramir scenes in particular explain much about why Faramir is portrayed as a hindrance rather than a helper in the theatrical version- more on this is said in the appendices of the DVDs.<br />After seeing the Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition's extras,(herein abreviated as FOTR) I was wondering if there was anything left to say, since so much was covered. Of course, there was much, much more to be said. There are literally thousands of production pictures and concept art, besides the 3hr documentaries on each disk- which are of course phenomenal. Whereas the original DVD focused on previz and the cast's experiences, this focuses more on other concepts and the experiences of the concept team and writer/director stuff. One truly understands that these people put their hearts and souls into this film, and even moreso. I'd go so far as to say this is probably the single largest motion-picture endevour ever, PERIOD.<br />So why not five stars? Not because of the changes from the book- by all means they were neccesary to keep the movie from boring the viewer. This movie sometimes got too tedious for my liking- even more tedious than the first half hour of FOTR. It is still a great film and the extra scenes still add much needed depth- it'll probably grow on my as I keep watching(three different commentaries!!!) No DVD aficionado should be without it.
B00005JM02|5.0|No matter how difficult things may seem at times, or how impossible and big a problem is, one should never give up, always follow their heart and keep on going. That's the message I got out of this movie. I saw this movie in the theater last summer when it came out and I loved it then and was actually surprised by how often I caught myself laughing at it. (I'm not one who is usually that impressed with animated pictures, I appreciate them but I don't have an affinity for them). I watched it again on DVD tonight and was more moved by it this time than my first viewing. This movie has it all, comedy, drama and even a little bit of action. This is one movie that will not disappoint, everyone should see it at least once!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|at first i did not like this cd, but it just grew on me. it is currently one of my favorite cd's along w/ songs about jane (maroon 5) let's face it (mighty mighty bosstones) and before these crowded streets (dmb)
B000008LNS|4.0|A lot can be said about the least known TOTO's 1992 album. First of all, it is the most rockin' TOTO album ever. While Isolation is Survivor/Journey like mid-80's melodic pop rock, Kingdom of Desire is more blues flavored good ol' hard rock.<br />Steve Lukather at that time leads both the band and vocal so it reflects more taste from Lukather music. It also became the last grace for Jeff Porcaro who would be killed by pesticide poisoning right after the album release. Heavier sound direction might have derived from the music scene of early 90s. Supergroup made up of 80s rockers such as Damm Yankees and Bad English might have influenced a lot. Also both Steve Lukather and Jeff Porcaro were involved in rockier sound. Lukather made a first solo in 1990. Jeff and Steve Porcaro were deeply involved in Tommy Denander's grand rock project Radioactive in 1991.<br />GYPSY TRAIN starts off with vigorous and heavy direction that might surprise ordinary TOTO fans. On the other hand power ballads like 2 HEARTS and ONLY YOU will make the fan a bit relieved. Jeff Porcaro gives magic touch in drums in such tracks as NEVER ENOUGH, KICK DOWN THE WALLS, and JACK TO THE BONE.<br />Overall the song quality is a bit sacrificed because of Lukather leading vocals and their heavy-riffed approach. But TOTO fans must have this! Bad English, Damn Yankees and Hardline fans might enjoy this TOTO album most.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Arguably better than the first installment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, The Two Towers is a more than seamless continuation of the first film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to destroy the ring, and are now guided by the deceitful Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join the fight to defend the city of Rohan as Saruman (Christopher Lee) and his dark lord Sauron proceed with their plan of the eradication of mankind. More violent, fast paced, and with a more epic feel; The Two Towers is, as of this typing, the best action/fantasy adaptation yet; and while it may not take place exactly as Tolkien himself had written it, he himself would nod his head in approval of the fantastic job done by director Peter Jackson. Most of the cast from Fellowship of the Ring has returned: including Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Hugo Weaving, and Andy Serkis providing his movements and voice as Gollum, who is a fantastic pinnacle of how far computer animation has come today. The battle scenes are more than epic; including the climatic slickly put together battle of Helm's Deep. All this however is only a taste of what is to come with the third and final film in the trilogy: the eagerly anticipated The Return of the King.  This Extended Edition DVD is undoubtadly the best version of the film, featuring hordes more of extras and extra footage including never before seen scenes of Boromir (Sean Bean) and a more in depth characterization of his brother Faramir.
0142004235|5.0|While reading this book, I often wished I could call up Mr. Steinbeck and discuss it with him.  He writes so candidly and sagaciously on human emotion, struggle, and inner purpose.  John Steinbeck believed that knowing a man makes it impossible to hate him; this book shows that.
0553573403|5.0|This is a great book, one of the best fantasy books ever. The author is an amazing writer. He writes with such literary grace that I can't believe this is mainstream fantasy. The book also has very little magic in it. This story isn't about magic, it is about people, and the world they live in. Great book. Buy it but it buy it! Good book. Seriously.<br />By the way, if you don't like realistic stuff don't buy it. Don't buy it if you expect a flowery world where the good guy always wins.
B000066C87|1.0|I don't care how stylish the sets-how great the acting-to see this film again in order to &quot;understand&quot; it would be a waste of my time. It stunk. The plot is lame and predictable, there is not one character worth caring about and the most likable actor was the dog. This was an exercise in self-massaging of Altman's ego-he has been known to have done that before. Next time I suggest he think twice before sending one of his &quot;ideas&quot; (see the creative credits at the start of the film) to the screen. How do you spell pew as in stinky? Also, I don't think subtitles would have helped me to understand this piece of drivel-lame lame lame.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I'm bleary-eyed but exhilarated after watching over 50 hours of the stupendous ALIEN QUADRILOGY (Fox). A steal at even the suggested retail price, this extraordinary 9 disc set is a crowning achievement in the art of DVD authoring, assembly and presentation.<br />Encountering Swiss artist Giger's \\"mechorganic\\" demon in dark, labyrinthine, quarters far, far from home or help can still jolt our deepest fears of the unknown.<br />All four titles in the series are presented in both theatrical and or extended versions.  Besides commentaries, there's a huge treasure trove preproduction, production and postproduction extras.<br />Although the sequels don't have the freshness Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN that began the series, Weaver delivers increasingly nuanced and intense performances as the storyline evolves.<br />I especially enjoyed the much longer (over 40 minutes) restored work print of ALIEN 3.  Space does not allow for even the most simplistic listing of all the extras. You'll be astounded, it's graduate level film school in a box.  Highest recommendation.
B000066C87|1.0|That is my only question about this waste of money.
B00005JM0B|3.0|Ten years have passed, can a now inferior Terminator still save John Connor and prevent the apocalypse?<br />Governor Schwarzenegger's unstoppable cyborg in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (Warner) worked the box office like his political campaign: despite criticism, a big unexpected win.<br />The digital version of the once bad but now good robot from the future has lots of extras including a sometimes eyebrow raising commentary from Arnold.<br />The dangerous action sequences are big and loud and beautifully staged (the budget was reputed to be north of $170 million) and the story satisfies (unlike the two dreadful Matrix sequels).<br />A fun, fast ride.  So rare that a sequel delivers with fresh material that satisfies.
B00005U122|5.0|OK, I was skeptical reading all the other 5-star reviews here, and I decided to take the plunge. I liked Pink Floyd, but this concert makes me LOVE them now. Everything about it is perfection: musicianship, camerawork, song selection, moods, lighting, singing, EVERYTHING.  Oh, I forgot to mention the audio....absolutely the best I have heard on DVD. I will be buying several more of this DVD to give to others for X-mas.<BR>Is it as good as everyone else has been saying here on Amazon?<BR>Yup. It is.  It isn't just a concert, it's a MAJOR experience.
0385491026|1.0|Material which is fresh and immediate in The Edible Woman loses its edge in this rehash of scenes from the Toronto of yesteryear. Retrospective wisdom and insight which might compensate for the loss of intensity is in depressingly short supply.  A lazy and derivative book.
B000009ED0|5.0|I love Kid Rock's Devil Without A Cause.I rated it 5 because I love it so much!I think that Kid's voice is beautiful, hard or soft. This is not trash.Just think of how much trouble that Kid went through just to please us.You wouldn't like it if you worked so hard then someone call it trash.
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you saw Shania's tv Chicago special this dvd will provide you with the entire concert. It features 6 songs that did not air on tv. If you have never seen Shania perform this concert will open your eyes to how much charisma and stage presents she has. Shania seems more comfortable on stage then any performer i've ever seen. After seeing &quot;When You Kiss Me.&quot; sung live the song is distinctly romantic and will definitely be a huge success. The most adorable part is when Shania brings 3 little girls on stage to introduce &quot;I'm Gonna Getcha Good.&quot; Shania doesn't only enjoy singing on stage it very clear she also enjoys the camaraderie that she has with her band. The audience also seems to provide Shania with an energy that appears to be endless. Shania is a better entertainer then most. Shania knows what her fans want and she delivers it to them!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|this CD is so wonderful!! I loved it!! My favorite song was &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot;. I love that song and it's been stuck in my head ever since I seen the movie; and that's a good thing!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have been not been to any Shania concerts yet but the Chicago concert makes me wish i could have attended this one. Shania is SO full of energy, constantly moving, interacting with the crowd...it is fantasic to watch ! And the audience! Wow are they hyper or what?! Everyone on the dvd is extremely excited to see Shania's first concert in the U.S. since 1999! The band is fabulous too! This concert just had so much energy and anyone that passes up this DVD doesn't know what they're missing!! And yes, there are extra songs that Shania performed at Chicago that were not shown on the TV special 6 of them! So you're in for a real treat! I'm telling you, anyone would love this for a present and if there's no one to buy it for, then buy it for yourself because this is one awesome energy filled concert!Shania definitely rocks this country as will this dvd!!
0446530891|2.0|David Baldacci often writes thriller fiction well worth reading. He is a crafty plotter of imaginative, engrossing tales and his dialog is often credible and sensitive to his characters' very distinct personalities. ABSOLUTE POWER was an absolutely fantastic read, even if Clint Eastwood's film version hardly measured up. Even TOTAL CONTROL and SAVING FAITH turned on intriguing plot points, strong characterization and Baldacci's talent for evocative and meaningful (mostly) East Coast locales (an important feature most writers and film/TV directors take too much for granted, if at all). While SPLIT SECOND contains some of these positive elements, it is a huge letdown. The story takes a while to get going. It's highly unbelievable; but willful suspension of disbelief is a good thing when reading any sort of fiction. However, when the two main protagonists/good guys finally hook up, the book does become quite compelling. And then...there's the revelation about what the whole thing's about. It's unbelievable, absurd and makes the reader - who, at this point, has endured some 350 pages of knowing nonsense - cringe with disbelief and anger. It's a cheat and as phony and unnecessarily silly as most of Baldacci's previous book, THE CHRISTMAS TRAIN. The denouement here is most ridiculous - even his characters in the book seem to infer this. There's nothing wrong with fun reading like this. But SPLIT SECOND - whose title is about as generic and without personality as it gets - suggests that Baldacci built another potentially fascinating maze and used a cheap axe to chop his way out.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This dvd will show you why Shania rules! Shania is a commanding performer. Whether she's along side her band or down in the crowd. Shania is always captivating. This dvd will demonstrate why she is a wonderful entertainer and one of the best songwriters out there!
B000002H72|5.0|EDITED ON 01/19/05:<br />What can I say about the pixies that i haven't said about 100,000,000 times. Doolitte is a rare album, because its PERFECT! There are very few perfect albums in the world, probly about 10 and i couldn't even name 4 if i had too. But DooLittle is PERFECT! Art in every single way. If this was a perfect world, Frank Black would be every bit as acclaimed as Kurt Cobain. Listen to tracks like Debaser, Tame and Wave Of Mutilation and tell me Nirvana didn't want to be these guys.<br />Doolittle is the best pixies album if you ask me. Its the best representation of their sound. Raw punk shrieks, and beautiful surf tones. I wasn't musicly concious when this first came out but when i discovered it back in 1999 I changed my musicual direction forever. The Pixies quickly became my favorite band over the last couple of years and when they played in NYC on their reunion tour i made sure to catch them for half the shows. If you are new to the pixies, I would recomend you start here. Or if you want to save the best for last... either way, Doolittle will be the best $12.99 you'll ever spend
B0000TB03W|5.0|From the moment I turn on the dvd player I was in Shania Heaven. She starts off with Man I. Feel Like A. Woman! And your heart just skips a beat. The way Shania moves around stage and down into the crowd you know she's a woman who knows how to put on a show. No doubt in my mind once this dvd starts you will not be picking up that remote until the end of the show.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|This band wouldn't know origonality if it bit them in the arse. I'm sorry but it's not the 70's anymore! I'm not saying that bands like Linkin Park, and Limp Bizkit are good or anything but unfortuntly thats what this generation will be known for. This band is just recycling bands like AC/DC The Who, Iggy and The Stooges and The MC-5. And if you like that stuff stick with it because that IS good music!! and this is boring rehashed crap.
B0000TB03W|5.0|With the video clarity and the 5.1 digital surround sound it all makes for a fantastic concert. Every single song is my favorite they all absolutely rocked. There are quick camera changes and lots of audience shots I loved this DVD. Shania is always on the go.
B00004Z459|1.0|When this album first came out, i bought it. I still don't know why. I listend it for 2 weeks, lied to myself and said it was good. I was WRONG!! This is one of the bands thats contributing to the down fall of good music!!! The orignality train missed these guys! Its basicly  Limp Bizkit, and The Beastie Boys, mixed with N'sync and Staind. I hope they go far far FAR away!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Chills will run down your back when you hear Shania sing especially on songs like &quot;It Only Hurts When I Breathe&quot;. Shania moves around the stage so much. The obvious joy the band has for the music they're playing will leave you wishing you loved your job nearly as much. The best part by far is Shania's interaction with the crowd who sing along to every tune. This dvd offers 105 minutes of sheer pleasure from start to finish.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|this is an amazing album. i like it even more than is this it. i recently saw the strokes live and they are awesome in concert. BUY THIS ALBUM. people who rate this album badly dont know what good music is.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's energy is relentless! Her band plays magnificently. A guy proposes Shania sings When You Kiss Me right after certainly setting the mood. The audience goes wild with every note Shania sings! Shania even brings up three fans to help her sing I'm Gonna Getcha Good! Boy does she! Positively the way to bring in the holiday season. A little eggnog and Shania dvd to warm your heart!
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween singlehadedly set the bar for all other slasher flicks and still to this day continues to be viewed as one of the scariest movies of all time. With his creepy music and terrifying mask, he reeks havoc on all who oppose him. It scared me the first time I saw it and still scares me today. Don't watch it alone.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I couldn't be at the show in person but the dvd is the next best thing. Shania shows real feeling and passion when she sings all her songs but especially on She's Not Just a Pretty Face. When she goes down in the crowd to sing with those girls oh your heart will skip with the excitement they undoubtedly feel. With the close-ups on Forever and For Always you'll feel like Shania's singing directly to you. The perfect gift for any Shania fan!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This new Album, really shows a much more mature Britney<BR>This Cd is a mixture of new sounds, I really liked most of the songs, Im sure its going to be a blast, and I cant wait for the videos, <BR>Breath on me and the touch of my hand are my favorite songs, britney`s voice is combined with outstanding beats, really different from what we`ve heard before..... this is truly her best Cd and I really recomend It
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's sultry voice is enough reason to buy this dvd. The other reasons Shania's never ending energy. The way Shania interacts with her band and brings the crowd into each song she sings. One of the best moments is when for Thank You Baby! Shania brings in an orchestra to back her up. Just as Shania fans will say Shaniariffic!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I loved this cd very eclectic not the same ol stale stuff some other artists do and redo- she is ever changing...lots of different beats and styles from all over the world...also if you get a chance to hear ......Don't Hang Up only on Aussie Import...check it out I can't get the tune out of my head! Sean (Puffy) Combs collaborated on that song.......Why Oh Why wasn't it on the US CD....
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania delivers moves that puts other artist to shame. For over 105 minutes she is nonstop energy and her band keeps up. The audience just beams with love of the music as well as the entertainer. From start to finish you'll be tapping your toes and dancing in your home. Definitely add this to your collection.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|I liked this movie mostly because it was about the Italian job and the job that followed afterwards.  The love sequences are pretty low so if that is what you are looking for, don't look for it here (but in my book, that almost guarantees a high rating).<br />I like a smart movie.  This wasn't as smart as Sneakers (one of my favorites) and it certainly wasn't as funny (I only laughed out loud once and had a chuckle or two throughout).<br />I also like how well it sticked to the story.  One simple plot, no sophisticated love story.  A quick, dirty, simple story.  More movies should have been modeled this way.<br />I also liked the pace of the movie.  It was really fast.  It started off fast with the original Italian Job and then slowed down so we could catch our breaths.  Afterwards it slowly built up to the second heist and then we had a rip-rouring fun last half an hour to enjoy.<br />Greatly recommended!
B0000TB03W|5.0|All I can say is WOW! I've never seen her perform live except during specials, such as the Super Bowl or her spring breaks a few years ago, but after watching the Up! in Chicago special, all I can say is this lady knows how to perform. Shania is the best and I believe this DVD proves that true
0679731369|5.0|I picked up this book at a friend's recommendation. It is the first (but certainly won't be the last) book I've read by Barnes. Although the story putatively deals with an aging scholar's research into (and physical search for) Loulou, a parrot mentioned in Flaubert's &quot;Un coeur simple,&quot; it covers much larger issues--the relationship of art and life, the dubious nature of literary legacies, the value and role of medicine, the status of women, the importance (or lack of: discuss) marital fidelity. Barnes certainly has a great love and deep knowledge of French literature, but the writing style he adopted for this novel reminds me more of James Joyce's Ulysses with each chapter employing a different literary genre while cleverly linking across chapters to other key thoughts and themes. Its comparative brevity (just over 200 pages), however, makes it easier for the (committed) reader to master and enjoy than Joyce's masterpiece. There's a lot here to explore and think about, and the more effort readers put into it the more they'll get out of it. On my first read through, I mostly enjoyed the Flaubert trivia; upon rereading I plan to pay closer attention to the doctor/scholar-narrator in order to discover more clues about his burdens, motives, and obsessions.<br />Although it probably helps to have read a lot of Flaubert before diving into this novel, I think the only book the reader really needs to be familiar with is &quot;Madame Bovary.&quot;
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you have never seen shania twain live GET THIS DVD!!! Shania is one of the most amazing performers because she involves the audidence so much its like you are performing with her. Shania is such a caring and unique performer. It is unbelievable. Also if you saw the concert on TV you didn't see everything. You don't want to miss this! So buy the dvd!
B00005QCVY|5.0|Despite James Stewart's \\"Gee Whillikers\\" and \\"Gosh Golly\\"isms, this movie always leaves me spellbound, and I walk away from it with a glow (somewhat like the one imparted by a VERY GOOD Holiday Hot Buttered Rum) in my heart.<br />I'm caught up in the family -- the father, the dear mother, the devoted children of all ages, the comings and goings in that bustling house, the rowdy happy group of friends (it REALLY was like that back in those days), the trademark \\"Hee Haw\\" that lasted thru time and trauma, and the close-knit group of citizens who took their civic duties and neighborliness seriously.<br />The plots and subplots are dexterously woven into one another, running seamlessly from very funny Damsel-in-Distress-Caught-in-the-Bushes followed immediately by the very serious and heartbreaking family trauma and seriously sick father - yet nothing is sacrificed by this transition of plots, neither human dignity nor plotline.<br />This movie held me spellbound -- boy did I \\"freeze\\" when I looked down into that ice-bound dark and freezing river. How my heart sank when I saw the once happy home turned into a dark dilapidated abandoned hulk, in the living \\"dream\\".<br />But then ... a heart chastened, an angel about to get his wings, a \\"Hee Haw\\" -- and the world turns right side up, once again letting in the warmth of Christmas Cheer and the true meaning of FRIENDSHIP, DEVOTION and FAMILY.<br />No matter that the movies back in those days were made in black and white.....the cast of characters in \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" truly provided the color and warmth to this one.
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you saw the tv special you will find that the extra 6 songs on the dvd rock! Is there any other band that makes you wish you could do for a living what they do? Shania's band always amazing. As always Shania knows just how to rev up the crowd. From top charting classic hits like You're Still the One and Honey I'm Home to new and sure to be classics songs UP! and In My Car Shania has everyone on there feet start to finish.
B00000K3CK|5.0|Absolutely LOVED and identified with this movie!<br />I was \\"there\\" -- on many a Thanksgiving Day, on 6th Avenue watching the Macy*s parade, just a few years after this eternally delightful movie was filmed. And when I was little, everything, especially Santa, was breathtakingly real. No matter that I froze my little tail off standing on 34th Street and 6th Avenue for hours (starting at 7 am, so we could get a good view of the parade!) -- on each and every Thanksgiving Day, my heart was warmed by the floats, the merriment, and....especially, Santa.<br />So naturally, while watching this movie, I almost felt like I could look into the crowd and see....me!!! I can really relate to this movie!!<br />The casting was perfection! From the unbelieving shop owner and his reindeer props, to the innocent little boy on the witness stand, from the bustling crowds in the street, to the interior of the typical (for that era) NY apartment building, the cast of characters and the sets were totally realistic.<br />And I loved the little girl played by cute little Natalie Wood -- hey back then, when I was 5 years old, I even WORE outfits just like hers!!!<br />What's NOT to love in this movie!!???<br />Although I never chanced on this movie until the 1970's (which left me and my \\"little\\" sister awestruck), I have watched it faithfully every year since then. Each time I see it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time over and over again -- this movie still speaks volumes to me.<br />The funniest part of the movie (to me and Sis, anyway!) is when the Macy*s executive's wife (who is totally snockered) answers the (old, heavy, cast iron, just like my grandma's) phone.<br />And the most breathtaking part of the movie-- well...is that really Kris Kringle's cane there, over in the corner?<br />This movie should be \\"required viewing\\" in every grade school.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The best thing about watching this disc is being at the concert without having to stand for 16 hours<BR>Throughout the concert, it is evident that Shania enjoys not only singing live but also the camaraderie of her band as well as feeding off of the energy from her fans. There are 22 songs including &quot;You're Still The One,&quot; &quot;Nah&quot; and the concert favorite, &quot;Rock This Country!&quot; When the DVD is over, anyone who may have thought of Shania as a studio creation most surely will understand that this Canadian woman is not only a good singer but an even better entertainer. She knows what her fans want and she delivers it to them.
B00005JMFI|5.0|Thsi movie is just excellent for kids of all ages. It's very funny and entertaining. The movie would definetly win an oscar if nominated. This is the number one Holiday Movie of 2003!!! Not Love actually, not the cat in the hat but this one. Dont waste your time seeing other films.If you are looking for some christmas spirit i suggest The Elf
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania and her bandmates look and sound fantastic! They make such an excellent ensemble and their performance in this concert is worth every penny. What a performer! What a dvd! Shania moves around a lot So there is a lot of action to see From moving around on stage with the band to making her way down into the audience. Shania knows how to pull a crowd into the show So even if you weren't there you'll definitely get the full concert experience.
B000089RVX|5.0|I would rate this album 10 stars if I could but oh well. THis is the best band I've heard in FOREVER! Amy Lee has an amazing voice and the guitars and drums are great. This is a fantastic cd, and there is MUCH more to Evanescence than Bring Me To Life. Buy this cd. You wont regret it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|A stunning performance of Man! I Feel Like A Woman! Throughout the show Shania moves around perfectly interacting with her band and working the crowd. If you attended the Chicago show you may just see yourself on the dvd as there are plenty of shots of the audience. The show contains a mix of 22 songs classic and new material. What an evening!
B0000E1WNV|4.0|O.K., I admit it when I'm wrong. My earlier review really slammed the sound. Well, dummy me had the audio set to Dolby 5.1 Surround (which I don't have). It sounds pretty decent on PCM Stereo. The vocals are a little buried and have a little too much reverb when compared to the Live in NYC DVD (otherwise, it would have been a 5 star). The Boss is at his absolute best and funniest on Ramrod. I regret writing a bad and inacurate review the first time. This is definitly a gotta have...
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania knows just how to rev up the crowd. From top charting classic hits like You're Still the One and Honey I'm Home to new and sure to be classics songs UP! and In My Car Shania has everyone on there feet start to finish. If you saw the TV special you will find that the extra 6 songs on the dvd rock! There's a total of 22 songs in all. Shania's band always amazing.<BR>The crowd obviously love every second!
B00002MZ4W|4.0|If you've ever been in love, then you'll be able to feel these words from under your skin, from the song \\"Paper Bag\\", which I think, is THE song about what it feels to be in love for all time. Set against an easygoing melody,with jazzy piano chords backing up in the accompaniment, the song has a serene, and almost happy surface.Only after repeated listenings does the song reveal its sadness and weariness. Fiona's delivery is so In the song, and so impassioned, that, you feel the song even more. That's not all there is though. Every track is a standout in its own right. This chick makes damn perfect music, I swear. The opening track draws you in instantly with its fierce piano playing,swirling beat,agorgeous melody, and larger than life chorus. She comes into the song full of authority and leaves the song hanging on shades of regret and desperation.A line I love from this song (It's true I do imbue my blue unto myself I make it bitter, baby, lay your head on my lap one more time, tell me you belong to me). One can feel the overwhelming outpouring of emotion that goes into this song.To Your Love is killer-sexy and sad at the same time.The bridge is incredible, with Fiona yelling out, almost savagely, Limp is another great song, that keeps shifting tempos, alternating between the quiet verses, and the fierce chorus. There's a great drum solo in this song that really pumps things up. On track four, Fiona cools down with a lovely piano ballad.Graceful, acomplished, simple, and beautifully written+performed with an understated edge.A Mistake is dead-sexy.Smoky,devilish, and you can't help but sing along to it.Fast As You Can-a tricky beat, quickly sung verses,funky chorus, and a beautiful bridge(and I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift). Interesting song. The Way Things Are-the hardest sounding song on the cd, also comes off as the least expressive.It's still pretty good though, the guitar riffs work well, and the song flows together easily. Get Gone-Totally awesome.Starts out quiet, and then explodes into the chorus, which is angry, and pained,and yet, in which Fiona still comes off as truly vulnerable. The closing song is just beautiful.Gorgeously hopeful lyrics, beautiful singing+melody. Fiona Apple isn't that great of a singer technically. But she sure knows how to use what she's got. Her singing is incredibly emotive,nuanced, intelligent, soulful, smooth-perfect.Her piano playing interweaves with the music perfectly, and she's just an incredible songwriter-her lyrics are mindblowing, and her melodies just the same.All in all, treat yourself to a great record. I think that people of all musical tastes would be able to find a spot in their record collection for this gem. It's wonderfully executed,beautifull written and performed, and perfectly produced.She's great, and no, she doesn't sound like Tori Amos, and whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you.<br />However, as much as I like this album, I feel that its inferior to her debut.Perhaps its all a matter of taste, but her debut just seemed to me a lot more organic,a lot more rough around the edges. This album sounds a lot more accomplished, but it also sounds more polished and \\"professional\\". I like this record a lot, but its just lacks the grit, and imperfection that made her debut such a treat.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I saw more life and action in Shania than I have seen before. There was more depth to her singing. Shania has such joy of being in front of the people. Shania loves to entertain and make people happy with her music. Shania has found a new level of depth in her songs off of UP! Which next to her classic songs you will clearly hear. She has proven over and over she is a true super star before but now no one can disagree that she is the new Queen of country music. Her songs can only be done by her and they inspire everyone who hears them. Live in Chicago is a mile stone.
B00005JMFO|1.0|Nude simulated sex scenes; a 10 year old child cursing using the name of Jesus on Christmas; a widowed father telling his 10 year stepson that if a certain woman shows up at their home he will kick the child out so the father and the woman can have sex in every room, including the child's room; an aging rock star taking off all his clothes on television on Christmas with the backdrop of a 10 year old boy pursuing the  \\"love of his life\\" who is another young child. Well, if that is your cup of tea then you might like this film.<br />Personally, I found the film to be deeply disturbing.<br />It is now the norm in films to sexualize children, to include pornographic scenes, to promote aneroxic females as the ideal of beauty, and to describe women with normal womenly bodies as \\"fat.\\" This film fits in with the mold of the new Hollywood, a place that sees nothing as sacred, including the innocence of the child.<br />What kind of people produce and promote these kinds of films? Give that some thought and come up with your own conclusions.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania fans are going to enjoy this DVD! She sings all of her hits and some new songs from the UP album that she performs live in this Chicago concert. The pyro technics are a site to see. She is so interactive with her audience that she even invite a few fans to sing and dance on stage with her. A must have for any Shania fan!

B0000TB050|4.0|What an amazing homecoming! As good as the ELEVATION DVD from Boston was, this is even better! The band is adrenalin pumped as they take the stage and while the set list is pretty much the same as the Boston show, there is the entire dynamic of thE triumphant return here for this band from North Dublin. If you were to own only one U2 DVD, it's this one. <BR>More than likely because they are playing to people who actually know them beyond their rock status, there is less playing to the gallery than there was in the Boston show and much more intenseley and passionately delivered music. Bono tones down his Vegas proclivities,  postures a whole lot less and gets back to the business of singing his soul out. The music is absolutely razor sharp start to finish. And the sea of people! It is quite impressive to see however many thousands of people are on hand with Slane Castle in the background.<BR>Most particularly because they are home and the tragedy of Omagh is still fresh in everyone's mind, Bono addresses Northern Ireland's absurd obsession with brutality and blood letting in SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY  more forcefully than he ever has. His vitriolic admonition that \\"Compromise is not a dirty word,\\" hopefully resounded in what is largely a Republic, tri-colour- waving crowd long after the concert ended.<BR>I would encourage you to get the expanded version for the additional documentary about making the UNFORGETTABLE FIRE CD at Slane all those years ago. It shows the band on the cusp of greatness. When you realize that, apart from some misguided excursions into techno, just how consistently great they have been, you can nearly identify the anticipation of such accomplishments in their nascent state with the Eno driven project.<BR>If you are a fan of the band, you don't need me to tell you to get this. If you're wondering what the fuss is about, absorb this disc in every detail. Indicates just what a gap there is between them and everyone else except a quartet from Liverpoolall those years ago.
B000084T18|1.0|Without any reservation, I will say that 50 has nothing to contribute to the legacy of Hip Hop but hype.  Nothing at all, comparable to the legends like RunDMC, Furious Five, LL Cool J, Kool Moe D, Pac, Big, Nas,and/or Rule(just to name a few) because those are the rappers with a vision to build a hip hop legacy to instruct,inspiration, and direct the youth amidst the negativity to create an image that has a lasting presense.  All this artist seems to want to bring to the table is violence, hatred and a ego that makes his head the size of a watermelon.  Sit down and Shut up 50 because your message &amp; motive is greedy,selfish, needy and hostile.<BR>From a Old Skool Head.
B000127LW2|5.0|I was there ten years ago on January 16th 1995 as Star Trek Voyager premiered on the new UPN network to alot of press and hype.At The time, Trek was at it's height.TNG first movie Generations was a box office hit,and DS9  was into it's transitional third season.Voyager was important in the fact that it was to launch the UPN network,and most importantly the first Trek series to feature a female captain,Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew).   The premise of the show was Voyager originally pursuing a ship of Federation freedom fighting outlaws called the Maquis, only for both ships to be swept 70,000 light years away from Federation space.Both crews merged to work together to find a way home which would take seventy-five at maximum warp.   The crew included Chakotay (Robert Beltran) the Native American Maquis commander who now serves as Voyager's XO,Tuvok (Tim Russ)the Vulcan chief of security,Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) a former convict now serving as Voyager's pilot,B'Ellana Torres (Roxanne Dawson)half Klingon former Maquis now Chief Engineer,Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) recent Starfleet graduate Ops officer, and\\"The Doctor\\" (Robert Picardo)an emergency medical hologram now the CMO.Also along for the journey are two new members indiginous to the distant Delta Quadrant,Neelix (Ethan Phillips) who serves as ship's cook and guide,and his lover,Kes (Jennifer Lien)an Ocampa who's lifespan is only nine years.   After airing probably the best ever Trek pilot \\"Caretaker\\",the show was an immediate hit,and the rest of the season contained some of the best ever episodes of the entire series,including The Phage(the debut of the organ harvesting Vidiians),Eye Of The Needle (Voyager making contact with a Romulan in the Alpha Quadrent),Prime Factors (the crew being on the opposoing end of the Prime Directive),Heroes and Demons (The Doctor rescues crew members trapped in a holodeck program of Beowulf),and Faces (Torres Klingon side is split from her human half).    The most interestingepisode is The Cloud.A humorous,delightful episode in which every crew member shines. Space anomoly aside,this episode showed more depth to the crew in one episode than the entire seven years.   Originally,twenty episodes were filmed,but four were held for the second season.Although Voyager's quality was random in the later seasons,season one reminded us why we stayed with the show through thick and thin.
B0000T6JH4|3.0|Let me start by echoing others in saying that the title of this album is ridiculous and that the album cover is probably the Beatles' worst ever (not counting 70's compilations like 'Rock &amp; Roll Music'). And I, too, would have liked to see the release of the original Glyn Johns-produced 'Get Back' album, complete with the EMI House cover photo that was later used on the Red and Blue Albums.<br />It's pretty difficult to evaluate this album on its own merits since I'm so familiar with the 1970 version. The track listing is pretty close to the original, with the removal of &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and the addition of &quot;Don't Let Me Down.&quot; That's fine. But as I understand it this was always supposed to be a sort of &quot;live&quot; album and, as such, the studio banter is greatly missed. As others have pointed out, &quot;Get Back&quot; seems to stop short. This is because it lacks the extended outro of the single version and John's rooftop quips from the LP.<br />&quot;Dig a Pony&quot; appears to be identical to the original version, as do &quot;Two of Us,&quot; &quot;For You Blue,&quot; &quot;One After 909,&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine.&quot; Any differences are minor--slightly different balances in the mixing, etc.<br />&quot;I've Got a Feeling,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; &quot;Let it Be,&quot; &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; are the most changed. Of these four, &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; is closest to the version we're familiar with, but it falls short, in my opinion. In addition to apparently being a different take, the guitars are mixed too softly and the electric piano is too loud. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; pales in comparison to the original single version. Again, the guitars are mixed too softly, and the part at the end where John's lead vocal is only audible through what I assume are instrument mics is missing completely.<br />&quot;Across the Universe&quot; has had all overdubs stripped from it, and is perhaps the most improved. Phil Spector really did do a number on this one.<br />The version of &quot;Let it Be&quot; that appears here is inferior both to the original album and original single versions. Here was a case where Phil Spector vastly improved the basic track, by adding echo and especially a new guitar solo to replace George's rather lame Leslie noodlings.<br />Spector's treatment of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; always seems to be held up as the canonical example of what was wrong with the album. Hearing this version is no revelation, since something similar was available on 'Anthology 3,' but I can understand Paul's desire to finally restore his untouched performance to the album. Yet we are left with something that almost sounds like a demo. In fact, the rest of the band almost seems superfluous on this one. Perhaps it would have been better with just Paul and a piano. I think Spector sensed it was missing something and simply went overboard. There is no question that without him this never would have been a hit single, however.<br />The 'Fly on the Wall' disc is interesting. The highlight for me is the 10-second snippet of John, Paul, and George singing &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot; That would have made a stellar Beatles track--what a shame.<br />To conclude, if you're a new or a casual Beatles fan, skip this and get the original album. If you're a more serious fan or a collector, it's probably worth having, if only for the second disc, which contains pieces of what appear to be two previously unheard Lennon-McCartney tracks.<br />However, this release falls short of what I think it could have been. Perhaps in some time we will see the release of Glyn Johns' 'Get Back,' or even a box set on the model of the Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds Sessions.' I am sure I would give those much higher recommendations.verdubs stripped from it, and is perhaps the most improved.

B000002UAR|5.0|That is not to say it is their best work, it is just the one Beatles album I play most often.  There's not much point to me doing a song-by-song analysis, but I'll tell you why I like Revolver.  <br />It's pop music that's cynical.<br />&quot;Now my advice for those who die<BR>Declare the pennies on your eyes<BR>'cause I'm the Taxman, yeah, I'm the Taxman<BR>And you're working for no one but me&quot; (Taxman)<br />&quot;You want her, you need her<BR>And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead<BR>You think she needs you&quot; (For No One)<br />&quot;There's people standing round<BR>Who screw you in the ground<BR>They'll fill your head with all the things you see&quot; (Love You To)<br />&quot;Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name<BR>Nobody came<BR>Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave<BR>No one was saved&quot; (Eleanor Rigby)<br />&quot;Sometimes I wish I knew you well,<BR>Then I could speak my mind and tell you<BR>Maybe you'd understand&quot; (I Want To Tell You)<br />The Beatles had started to write this way on Rubber Soul; however, I think they nailed it on Revolver.  It's also the point where the Beatles were in a transition from hit making machine to psychedelic experimenters.  It's amazing the development of styles on Revolver - from the naive pop of &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; to the studio experimentation of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.  There's been a lot of junk written about the Beatles, and some people feel they possess a master's degree in Beatles-ology.  Forget all the nonsense and just enjoy (or don't enjoy) their music for what it is.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Equal parts Beethoven's Fidelio as well as Wagner's Ring cycle, the latest Howard Shore evocation of the drama in LOTR's RETURN OF THE KING offers hope that Jackson did not get bogged down in the geek-obsessed ambition to create the greatest battle movie ever. Particularly as the score moves toward the Grey Havens, there is reason to believe that Jackson may have returned to the essential point of the story. Let's hope so.<BR>As for the score itself, it really is a tremendous accomplishment. The drama is intense and unrelenting, themes heralded in the first two films are reworked, recast and subtleties of tragedy and heroism run through the charts. THe strings in these soundtracks are as commanding and deeply resonating as those of John Barry. The vocalists this time around include Renee Fleming, who is just an aural wonder, Billy Boyd, who conveys just that right threshold where knowledge infuses innocence with a commission from which it can not retreat. Viggo Mortensen chants in elvish, without sounding totally absurd. And Annie Lennox delivers the closing theme with an utter devastation that may be one of her best performances ever. Regardless of what Jackson may have made of the most important of the three books, &quot;Into The West&quot; redeems any liberties he may have taken or integral philosophical points he may have sacrificed for special effects. But, we'll all find out soon enough.<BR>The stake for Jackson is that if he soft balls or misses the ontological, metaphorical and ethical conclusions of Tolkien's story, the entire series will be one more missed opportunity to get it right. The world is not looking for a better Star Wars. As for Howard Shore, he has delivered for each film a commanding score that musically understands that the sublime message here had nothing to do with geeky gimmicks, and everything to do with creation, an explication for evil and horror, the impact of knowledge on innocense. This third score is a fitting conclusion to a greatand classic composition. Let's hope the film is this good.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|so, i knew little about gavin degraw, until i bought my tickets solely for the maroon 5 concert in portland, where gavin just about upstaged maroon 5 at its own concert. before the concert, he was at music millenium, playing this small live show, where he was just incredible. not only does his music finds its way into the audience's hearts, but his personable character and quirky smile make you fall in love with him instantly. one thing that i love about him, is that he is his own person, and doesn't care about becoming popular for the wrong reasons. he is immeasurably better live, which is a rareity these days among musicians, so i highly recommend you go see him in concert, otherwise the cd is just as amazing, with high musicality and knowledge about what he's doing. this is just the perfect cd, that i never get tired of. as a pianist, i highly respect his pianistic abilities...he is just a solid musician that deserves the best. wow..he's just unbelievable with amazing talent. i just hope that he doesn't go mainstream and lose his individuality that makes his music simply unforgettable.

Don't get me wrong I love both Britney and Christina but never brought their albums. I got to say that this album shows her maturity and I am really feeling it. My favorite songs are of course the one with Madonna, Got that boom with the Ying Yang Twins, Breathe on me-gotta striptease on this song, Toxic, Outrageous with infamous R. Kelly and Touch of my hand. People need to realize that Britney is growing up. Get over it. This album is really good.
B000021XS0|5.0|Fans of DT have long awaited the band to do a concept album. Something on the likes of Op:Mindcrime which fans of Ryche cherish above all things. While DT lured us fans with quasi-concept albums such as some part in Awake (A Mind Beside Itself), A Change of Seasons, still a complete record was missing. Then comes the draconian times the band faced post-Falling Into Infinity. Many complained the album was a sell out blah blah blah which made this majestic band realize that they dont need a outside creative input (Read Desmond Child), the fact was that Electra wanted DT to make a killer commercial album and the band almost got torn apart as a result. One more example to show the cruelty of record labels and how they just dont understand.<br />Metropolic I, which is one of the best DT songs ever recorded is a microcosm of its part II, Scenes. Building on the thin line of concept from the parent song, Scenes has come out as a monster album even better than the parent song. While the concept is not very easy to understand at first go, you ought to spend time going through the lyrics and other hints interspersed in the moody music. As I am a DT fanatic, I might tend to lose objectivity in the review but Scenes is perhaps one of the greatest concepts ever constructed in music. No drawing parallels here as this is one of its kind concept based more on psychology, reincarnations and the like. Usually concepts tend to be either political or very vague but this one is none of that. Its a complicated storytelling of vengence by one brother over the betrayal by another and his wife (girlfriend?). In fact Scenes from a memory is a line taken out of Metropolic I. While it was always expected that a sequel was in the making it was never thought that it would be a full blown metal classic like this one.<br />Begining with Regression which bring back through some musical analogies to part I and Overture 1928, the story begins when we start understanding about the miracle and the sleeper. The reborn (murdered in last life) guy get a strange deja vu and we get another awesome number. So on the concept progresses unleasing one story after another. This is just pure musical brilliance no one but DT is capable of. The Dance of eternity a great instumental is one of the best the band ever did. Special mention to JR, the incumbent keyboardist, the man capable of keeping pace with the mighty JP on guitars. Vocals are excellent, as JL sings with all he has and then some. MP and JM keep the pace going with their contributions. <br />All in all, this is one of the best releases in rock/metal genres. Even if you are not into DT, this is an album worth having, the price is nothing compared to the music that you get. In words it cannot be said how nice this album is, in Images it cannot be seen how great this band is, but in your heart, you have to feel the brilliance of this &quot;majesty&quot;ic band.

B000003TAL|5.0|This album is phenomenal!  From the very beginning of \\"Teen Age Riot\\" I knew this record was going to be super. It opened my mind up to a whole new world of music composing, especially guitar playing.  Thurston Moore and Lee Renaldo have totally revolutionized the way the electric guitar is played, much the same way Jimi Hendrix did.  Their unorthodox guitar tunings have made their albums so different from any other guitar oriented albums of any other genre.  While \\"Silver Rocket\\" has a punkish but not unpleasant feel to it, the rest of the album is pretty much uncategorizable.  While there might be a hint of psychedelia here and some grungy riffing there, the album is otherwise impossible to pigeonhole.  Every track is has its own gift; even noisefests like \\"Eric's Trip\\" and \\"Rain King\\" resonate with the beautiful (if not obscure) melodies that is essential to all good music.  My personal favorite is \\"'Cross the Breeze\\" which often times sounds like a racing heartbeat that all of a sudden decides to slam dance.  You will probably find that every single song except for \\"Kissability\\" deserves to be played over and over.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|don't let slagging and embittered no-brains push you away from this new one from miss spears. I've reviewed rock, pop blues, jazz and classical albums for many years and have always believed  spears was little more than a pre-teenie prefab joke. similarily, many reviewers will approach this new one from the maturing songstress with similar mindset, slagging her off in the easiest way. but this one deserves more than that. do yourself a favour - give the songs a listen. no mean feat, but spears has outdone not only herself but many of her contemporaries in all categories. the reason? in the zone holds many of the most catchy, interesting and varied tunes on offer in a good long while. everything is in the pot here - from rap-enthused big beats to fiddle samples and thumping humping beacons for procreative recreation. unlike past efforts, this is no cheezy corporate menu for musical fast-food. it's a bonafide entry in spears' lengthy output and as it stands, is her best to date.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let me start by saying that I think it was a really good idea for EMI or Apple or who ever to release this album.  The music on it is pure and great just like anything on any other Beatles album.  However, I think some of the guitar playing was downsized in the mixing process, therefore songs like &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot; which had a really loud guitar on the original album, now seems weak on this mix, and as for the solo on &quot;Let it Be&quot; I 've always thought the one on the original was one of the best George ever played on a Bealtes song and I was kinda dissapointed when I heard this new version with a drastically weaker solo on the radio,  but it was so cool to hear a Beatles song being played on a pop top 40 type station.  Apart from the weaker guitars on some songs, this album is really crisp and sterling, and i really like the untampered version of &quot;Long and Winding Road.  Billy Prestons organ playing is really soulfull.  However, I do have some misgivings about how the whole problems about song selection and so on.  First of all everyone knows that this is supposedly how the band wanted this album to sound, initially it was an attempt by the band to leave all the pretentious psychedelic production of Sgt Pepper and some of the White album and &quot;get back&quot; to the basics.  They recorded real after real of takes in search of the best on, since it was a supposed to be a &quot;live&quot; album. But the tapes got mixed up in the animosity that surrounded the Beatles in 1969 and were dumped off with Phil Spector in early 1970. In spring 1969 a version of Let it Be was gonna be released, and it's my opinion that this is the definitive &quot;band cut&quot; without any wall of sound and with an extended format with many of the rocking covers they wanted to put on the album.  The track list went as follows:<BR>1. One After 909<BR>2. Rocker<BR>3. Save the Last Dance for Me<BR>4. Dont Let me down<BR>5. Dig A Pony<BR>6. I've Got a Feeling<BR>7. Get Back<BR>8. For you blue<BR>9. Teddy Boy<BR>10. Two of Us<BR>11. Maggie May<BR>12. Dit it<BR>13. Let it Be<BR>14 The Long and Winding Road<BR>15. Get Back (reprise)<br />It would have been cool to hear this format, produced by original engineer Glyns Johns, who went on to work with the Who.  Also on this new album, I disagree with the ditting out of the studio chatter and the two little jams, &quot;Maggie&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; those made the album much more intimate, which is what i thought the people at EMI or whatever were trying to do with this one, by taking out all the fluff.  I love the Bealtes and everything they did and will do, but this album is not really all it could have been.  But buy it anyway, just cuz it's cool to have another Beatles album to buy.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|Okay, lets face it.  Had Dream Theater not already thrown albums like &quot;Images and Words&quot;, &quot;Awake&quot;, &quot;Metropolis Pt. II&quot;, and &quot;6 Degrees&quot;, at us, &quot;Train of Thought&quot; would be the greatest metal album of this decade.  Sadly, for the more close minded fans, they have built up a reputation of untouchable, amazing music.  In my opinion, this is a great album, with some moments that sound VERY much like DT and not the one dimentional metal bands the rest of you have been flinging around.  If you are already a die-hard fan of the band (not someone who just likes Images &amp; Words) then you should definitely own this album.  If you are new to the world of Dream Theater, I would suggest this route.<BR>&quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; - &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2&quot; - &quot;Awake&quot; - &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; - &quot;6 Degrees&quot; - &quot;Train of Thought&quot;.   <br />-Only buy the album &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; if you are open minded and don't mind change.  (I absolutely love it as much as all the others, though many people don't respect the more laid back aspects of it)  <br />-Only buy &quot;When Day and Dream Unite&quot; after you buy the rest, as it was their first disk and has a different singer and entirely different feel than any of their other material.
B000003TA4|5.0|On April 8, 1994 Pearl Jam played a concert in Fairfax, Virginia. Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam's lead singer, addressed the crowd with the following words before Pearl Jam began their set. <br />\\"We are elevated a little more than usual, either that or I've gotten taller. I don't think it's a very good thing to elevate yourself. I think it would be a very dangerous thing... sometimes, whether you like it or not people elevate you...whether you like it or not, and it's very easy to fall. So..uh..I don't want to be the messenger, somebody who delivers bad news, you know. Kill the messenger, but I don't think any of us would be in this room if it weren't for Kurt Cobain.\\" <br />enough said, pearl jam was a very good band and Nirvana did not &quot;inspire&quot; them, or even amke them possible. They did, however make things a little easier for bands like Pearl Jam to become popular.
B00008BXJG|5.0|AC/DC, the greatest hard rock band of all time, does not get due credit for this great album. Back in Black got the most glory and while Back in Black does contain six really, really good songs, not every song is great. This is not the same with Highway to Hell which contains greatness from the opening power crunching chords of Highway to Hell, to the fading alien jargon at the end of Night Prowler. Angus Young's guitar work is, as usual, highly impressive, and Bon Scott's last album is Rock 'till the end. So I'm not saying Back in Black sucked, far from it. But the Highway to Hell is just as good.

Besides, my Mom, a former prison psychiatrist, wanted to see it.<br />Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey, a shrink on the staff of a women's penitentiary that has all the ambience of a Transylvanian castle. Driving home on a dark and stormy night - hey, is there any other kind in this genre? - Miranda swerves into a ditch to miss a young woman standing in the road. Upon asking the near-victim if she's OK, Miranda observes that she's been physically abused. Then, the woman undergoes spontaneous combustion. Miranda next wakes up to find herself an inmate on her own psycho ward, under arrest for chopping her husband (Charles Dutton) up into little pieces, and in the care of a former colleague (Robert Downey, Jr.).<br />Berry's performance makes the film great fun to watch despite a preposterous storyline that, at the end, had me saying &quot;Yeah, but ...&quot; about too much of what I'd seen. And the set designers weren't at all subtle in their use of flickering lights, shadows, and general gloominess. I had to check to see if I'd inadvertently left my sunglasses on for the show. Perhaps the prison was economizing on the use of electricity after being forced into the California Plan. Really scary stuff is sometimes more effective in full daylight because it's less expected.<br />Penelope Cruz, another hottie in my book, appears as Chloe Sava, an inmate accused of cutting her stepfather's throat, and who claims to being repeatedly raped by the devil in her prison cell. While this is a clue to the endgame, it added nothing to the plot's credibility. In retrospect, it was just another &quot;Huh?&quot; that defies understanding if you think about it too much.<br />Downey's performance was unremarkable, and his Dr. Graham character serves only as straight man to Miranda's more frenetic moments.<br />GOTHIKA is a chilling ride on which Halle Berry is pretty much the only driver. Keep the DVD release in mind next Halloween as something to watch while waiting for those pesky trick-or-treaters.driver.

B000053VAF|2.0|I went into Dogma with relatively high hopes.  After all, the team of Affleck and Damon seemed relatively intelligent, relatively imaginative, and successful enough to push something original past the studio types.  I was wrong.  Dogma is a cynical, self-important little film that takes on big topics.  But unlike inspired, creative films that often hold up well in such fights, Dogma is like a frail, blind tabby in a cat fight.  It's so busy tripping over topics and ideas that can't get its paws on, that you want to turn your eyes away in embarassment.<br />The worst part of Dogma is the odd preachiness of it, as if some half-baked philosophy major is trying to explain the Truth to you after a half-dozen Amaretto sours at the college pub.  You can almost imagine the sophmoric sessions where such &quot;great&quot; ideas surfaced, including the &quot;inspired&quot; decision to to cast George Carlin as a Cardinal.  (&quot;He's Catholic, man!  Do you get it?  You should hear his early albums where he talks about Catholic school!  How cool is that!  Wouldn't it be awesome if ...&quot;)  That's one of the problems with Hollywood.  Filmmakers are a bright, iconoclastic lot in general, but they usually are neither well-read nor particularly insightful.  And maybe that is appealling to the large group of 18 to 35 year olds who wouldn't know Erasmus if he hit them over the head with a lectern.  But for anyone looking for a genuine, intelligent satire about organized religion, skip this and get The Meaning of Life.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Incredible! Those who haven't picked it up...RUN. It's crisp, very close-up we see shots never seen before it delivers tons of energy.<BR>The tv special could not show all the energy and fun with all the commercial breaks the special on tv was great it doesn't compare to the dvd. <BR>If you've been to a Shania concert you know the woman doesn't stop the energy and vivaciousness for anything. This DVD captures Shania's breath-taking beauty and spirit and boundless energy.
B0000DIXRU|3.0|Let me begin by saying that this is by no means a bad album. Let me continue by adding that it's not exactly memorable either. Anathema have released one of the most beautiful rock albums in the last 5 years in &quot;Jusgement&quot;, and unfortunately for them that album has been registered as a cue for their seriously big potential.<BR>   However the 2 albums that followed (including this new one) have not been able to fulfil the expectations.<BR>   &quot;Natural Disaster&quot; is full of hints of above mentioned potential but the problem is just that: they remain at the hint level.<BR>    The guitars are good but overall flat. The singing is better but not as good as in the past. The songs in general are the type of songs you'd hear without complaining in a bar but also without necessarily asking &quot;who is this playing&quot;. <BR>    I would disagree with reviewers debating whether Anathema are still metal or not. They were not &quot;metal&quot; with Judgement either and that was a masterpiece of an album. And this is not the point anyway because being metal (or not) doesnt add points (or subtract) from your performance.<BR>    The point is that this is a band that can deliver very unique and superbly rich in feeling albums and this is not the case here. I would think that they will not prove to be an one-trick horse. This is not a prediction though.<BR>   We will have to wait and see if their bag of magic has anything still hidden in it.
B00005QK3W|5.0|'Driving Rain' is my favorite solo album by Paul McCartney.  I am a huge fan of his work, (with the Beatles, Wings and solo) and if I had to pick only one album to bring with me to a desert island, this would definitely be the one.<br />I bought 'Driving Rain' the day it was released.  This was back in November 2001, and as history shows, it wasn't the greatest of times due to what happened here in the USA, two months prior.  I was eagerly anticipating Paul's new album, not only because &quot;Freedom&quot; was an added bonus track, but because I needed some of his creative energy to help put me in a better state of mind.  The first time I heard it, I thought it was &quot;pretty good.&quot;  Then on repeated listenings, I found the music really growing on me.  Before long, I knew the words to every song, inside and out.  It also became a permanent fixture in my car, where a copy remains to this day.  <br />'Driving Rain' is Paul McCartney bouncing back with renewed spirit and hope.  It's a process that continues where his excellent 1999 'Run Devil Run' left off.  These songs have the power to &quot;chase my blues away&quot; anytime I feel down.  It's music that makes you feel good to be alive!<br />Upon closer inspection, it's interesting to note the nature motif popping up in quite a few tracks. The lyrics frequently mention the sun/sunshine, rain/raindrops, the moon, hurricanes, gardens, outer space and clear, blue skies.  Paul has hit a poetic high point on 'Driving Rain,' with songs like &quot;Heather,&quot; &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot; and &quot;Magic.&quot;<br />The standout tracks for me are &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; and the title track.  &quot;Raindrops&quot; is a 10 minute plus rollercoaster ride (one of his longest since &quot;Secret Friend&quot; from the McCartney II sessions in 1979-80). The title track is a joyous, carefree number that rocked when Paul and his band performed it live on his Driving USA tour.<br />I can't recommend 'Driving Rain' enough to any Beatles or McCartney fan.  It does take some time to grow on you, but once it does, it's like a rocket to the stars &quot;and back again.&quot;
B00005JKN9|4.0|Any new film by Mr Scorsese is cause for celebration and Gangs of New York is no exception.  True - Ms Diaz and Mr DiCaprio are well and truly out of their depth and cast for their &quot;star' quality on the likely insistence of producers - but they are a minor distraction.  The cinematic wealth in this film is considerable, not least the mis en scene, writing, direction, costumes  and editing. But the exceptional cast of actors is quite special including the wonderful Mr John C. Reilly, Mr Broadbent and many many &quot;minor&quot; roles which add up to a delicious mixture of society as viewed through the prism of Mr Cocks et al.  The film is, at the very least,  a potent social portrait of mid-19th century New York.  The praise for Mr Day-Lewis is well earned as he gives a rivetting,  sustained and memorable portrait of Bill Cutting.  The extras especially those involving Mr Scorsese are excellent.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania always manages to come alive on stage like no other performer. Her interaction with the band is incredible. The way she brings the audience right into every single song. From the sound to the crystal clear pictures this is a must see dvd.
B000127LW2|1.0|Voyager was an awesome series, no doubt.  Good story arc, and a great cast.  I can't think of one complaint.  I really want season one on DVD along with the entire series.  I just want to know what is up with the $100+ price tag on the Trek seasons.  Typically, the TV season box sets average around $50 give or take a few dollars until you get to the Trek section.  I like most of the Trek stuff, but the cost is outrageous.  Given the cost, I am more inclined to start my SG-1 collection.  I am currently buying the Buffy and Highlander disk sets for $45 and $59 respectively, and I keep passing up the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine sets because of the cost.  It is kinda ridiculous, and for the most part, only the die hard Trek fans are going to buy them.  I enjoy the show, but not enough to drop $700+ on the series
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I was a bit ambivalent about 'Say You Will' the first time I heard it.  \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" seemed too odd, especially as the second track on the lineup.  And by the time I finished the album, a lot of the songs left me cold.  Yes, I was disappointed, but then I realized just how long it had been since I really listened to a Fleetwood Mac album.  I figured it was time to re-aquaint myself with the band, so I put 'Say You Will' to the side and dug up copies of 'Mirage,' 'Tusk,' Lindsey's 'Go Insane,' and Stevie's 'Rock A Little.'  After getting into to those four albums again and remembering just why I was such a fan of their music (both Mac and solo), I gave 'Say You Will' another spin.  And it felt very good.<br />There is a LOT of material on this album, most of which demands repeated listenings to be fully appreciated.  Still, if you count the years since 'Tango In The Night,' it's rather generous of them to deliver 18 new tracks (20 if you buy the bonus edition).  Some tracks (\\"Say You Will,\\" \\"Thrown Down,\\" \\"What's The World Coming To\\") sound like classic Fleetwood Mac, while others (\\"Red Rover,\\" \\"Running Through the Garden\\"), feel more like they belong on solo albums.  <br />The main appeal of 'Say You Will' for me is hearing Lindsey and Stevie singing together on almost every song.  Stevie's presence adds a unique dimension to Lindsey's \\"Miranda\\" and \\"Peacekeeper.\\"  Likewise, Lindsey's appearance on Stevie's \\"Smile At You\\" and \\"Everybody Finds Out,\\" takes those tracks to a whole new level.  <br />Give 'Say You Will' a chance.  I almost liken it to a buffet with a lot of food... you have to keep going back to appreciate everything.
0425170349|3.0|Though not a Clancy fan, it's definitely one of his best for action. I found howeverm the action sequences a bit repetitive. An Internationally sanctioned hit squad that is transported to terrorist situations where hostages lives are in the balance. This International S.W.A.T. Team, made up of the best of U.S., U.K. German, and a few other countries, goes in, and kills the perpetrators of these crimes. Not a bad idea, so far as I'm concerned. <BR> Only two things making this international hit squad a total fantasy; with the &quot;Liberal&quot; politicians feeling sorry for the criminals these days, it would take days, if not weeks for them to agree to kill off their criminally bent friends, unless, of course, one of their own family members was being held hostage. <BR> The second is; most major cities around the world already have militarily trained Swat teams to deal with this sort of problem. <BR> Still, all in all, I'd have to say one of his more interesting, and exciting books to read. <BR> My favorite Clancy Novel to this day, is still &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; which he wrote with Larry Bond, whom I consider a far better writer of war, and anti-terrorist novels than Clancy is.
B0000TB03W|5.0|For that hard to buy person. You can give them this dvd to show them what they're missing. Such as fantastic music an energizing performer, a charismatic band. What more could they ask for in a dvd! The interaction with the crowd will leave them breathless!

B00005JMFR|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed all 3 of these films.  I have found them to be intriguing, original and just well done.  Obviously, no one could ever recreate and capture the mind-blowing originality of the first film.  However, this was a very well conceived story.  Just to show you how we can become so accustomed to the typical storyline I honestly went into this film with the expectations for a conclusion that was in no way even close to how the series finally ended.  Looking back on it; I realize that the series ended the only way it could end.  It ended the way all stories about \\"messiahs\\" and \\"saviors\\" must end.  Unlike some of the other reviewers here I will not give away specifics, although, if you have even the slightest literary background you will have guessed at what happens.<br />The film is a feast for the fans of martial arts, CGI graphics epic battles and contests between good and evil, (superheroes), fought between titans possessing almost godlike powers.  It would be best to not make the mistake of assuming that Smith has anything to do with the goals of the machine society any longer.  You will not leave this film having had every question in your mind answered.  You will have closure to a great story worthy of the playwrites of ancient Greece and some great conversations with friends and family about what everyone thinks was going on and what perhaps will happen.  The last scene with Neo in it I believed was representative of Mallory's La Morte D'Arthur, (King Arthur).  Contrary to what some have wrote here I found this to be a well done, well told series and each film left me wanting more.  If I have any criticism at all it is the same as most; I have never been overly impressed with Mr. Reeves range as a dramatic actor.  While I have come to accept him as the \\"one\\" in these films I will always wonder whether someone else might not have been a better choice.<br />While I am interested in philosophy, unlike some, I have never attached more meaning to these films other than being smart well crafted entertainment.  However, with that said I did truly appreciate the idea that more often than not it is harder to do what is right.  It is more difficult, and sometimes even painful to make the right choices.  Perhaps that is part of the reason why these films have resonated with the public so well; like the message from God you have \\"choices\\" and that is what makes life interesting, a challenge and very often difficult and painful.<br />In the lingo of the Merovingian, \\"tres bien\\".
0321146530|4.0|If you've never done or are curious about TDD, this is a great book to carefully walk you through learning how and why to do it. After following its practices a bit, I've also found it an indispensible way to write new projects, modules, and code. However, the book doesn't address what happens when:<br />- The code base is old, and doesn't have any tests or isn't designed testable. It makes it hard to do anything other than introduce integration-level tests and tweak to success.<br />- You're writing UI code for a serious application. It's straightforward to solve for a dialog framework, but when you're integrating with a major windowing framework that embeds serious functionality (Avalon, in my case), there are a whole set of issues he doesn't talk about.<br />- Design is part of your deliverable. I don't disagree that you can get pretty reasonble designs out of TDD &amp; refactor. But I *do* disagree that, in practice, you get designs intended to version well, that your company is willing to support for the next decade or more. I've seen the code produced, and it just doesn't happen.<br />A good introduction, nonetheless. But watch out before you put on the preacher-hat after reading it and doing the exercises -- at least try to do it in part of one large, real-world product.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Pick this dvd UP and drop it in someone you love's stocking <BR>With 5.1 surround sound this is amazing! Even better if you listen to it with head phones on. Shania leaves you wanting more. She moves around stage so much you'll wonder where she gets the energy. Then when you think she can't deliver anymore Shania makes her way into the all ready excited crowd. Positively a must have!
B000002BYD|5.0|This is when Pearl Jam went through the grunge scene into making the amazing &amp; spiritually deep experimental rock n roll theyre best known for today... when all the other seattle bands died, Pearl Jam, just like since 92, was still the most important band in the world even in 98... getting new competition in terms of popularity by now from the likes of Radiohead &amp; Tool, but just like their other &quot;peers&quot; (nirvana &amp; stone temple pilots), Pearl Jam is still much more legendary, better, &amp; has a fanbase like no other
B0000CDLA7|3.0|This release by Dream Theater (my favorite band) is a little bit of a let down.  I think that Images and Words, Awake, Change of Seasons and Scenes are their greatest works, and the others are just below them, but Train of Thought hits bottom.  There are some cool riffs and driving drums, but the emotion and passion behind the music of Dream Theater is not there.  I can listen to any of my favorite Dream Theater albums and still be fresh, just like the first time I heard them.  I have listened to Train of Thought about 20 times and I'm bored.  I call it another above average metal album, not the surreal Dream Theater that myself and many other fans have come to know and love.
0201485672|5.0|Great advice on when, how, and where to refactor. It also surprised me by having a bit more relevant stuff for big projects than the usual software principles and practices books do -- I'm used to having to extrapolate for myself. In addition to the great text, there's also a wonderful encyclopedic list of transforms. They're understandable enough to read and perform as a human, but also semantically well-defined enough to make tools almost directly on top of.<br />The last few chapters unfortunately felt 'stapled' onto the end. They all had a very different feel from the rest of the book and, while they were interesting viewpoints, they made it lack some consistency. It would've been good to have either Fowler-ized them or just left 'em out. I'm not clear how much value they added, other than saying, &quot;Tools are good to do refactorings. Without them, people aren't too religious about it. But don't trust the tools too much; baby-steps and test verifiction is still crucial.&quot;
B0000TB03W|5.0|Overall, I really enjoyed the DVD. Shania sounded great and was very entertaining.. Thank goodness for Shania and the band's excellent performance. The audience was a pleasure. The music is a mixed collection of old favorites with new soon to be favorites. A sheer joy to watch!
B00008H2LB|2.0|I promise you, I am being VERY generous with the rating...All I have to say is: What happened to the band who had so much success with Hybrid Theory and Reanimation? This piece of crap, lame excuse for a CD is NOTHING like their older CDs were...those older CDs were actually good, I won't say they were #1, top of the world quality, I was waiting to name their next CD the undisputed top-of-the charts winner, but obviously that won't be the case.
B00009TB5G|3.0|Movie is great. But my zenith dvd play can't play disk 3&amp;4 (appendixes).  They will play on my computer.  Returned the set but the second set does the same.

B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head is my favorite CD, BY FAR.  It's almost undescribable how good Coldplay's music is.  If you have Parachutes, you'll also be pleasantly suprised at how much better this CD is than that one.  Parachutes was good, but this album is, in a word, great.  The piano in a lot of the songs is very soothing, and the songs are more catchy than those from Parachutes.<br />I listen to this CD all the time because it has a great song for everything that I feel.  I listen to The Scientist and it emits more emotion from me as a song that I have ever felt before.  Green Eyes reminds me of a person I love with all my heart.  Warning Sign is an absolutely beautiful song.  Clocks and In My Place are too, really great works of music.<br />Nearly everyone I know likes Coldplay: people who also like rap, people who also love Counting Crows, and also those of the older generation who I recommend Coldplay too &quot;if they liked Dylan.&quot;<br />This album is Coldplay's masterpiece.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The show opens with a stunning performance of Man! I Feel Like A. Woman! Throughout the show Shania moves around the stage perfectly interacting with her band and working the crowd. If you attended the Chicago show you may just see yourself on the dvd. The show contains a mix of 22 songs classic and new material. What an evening! At the end a Fourth of July style fireworks. Just Marvelous!
B000089RVX|5.0|OK, let me start out by saying that yes, I absolutely love Evanescence. I am NOT dissing them by saying this, but I honestly don't think that they are goth or any stuff like that. They are just a very good band(yes, I said BAND, there is more than just Amy to Evanescence, Ben and the others play instruments) that appeals to many different people. I admnire Amy for her ability to be different in the entertainment industry that is focussed on sex appeal and becoming practically naked and 'selling' their body for CD sales. Amy refuses to do that. She is the #1 singer in the music industry, in my opinion, and many others can agree with me.
B0000TB03W|5.0|She has come from the deepest parts of unhappyness to the top of the Country singing world and she reflects that in her music. She can sing a fun yet meaningfull song like Don't Be Stupid and she can sing a ballot like Your Still The One and everything in between and she shows this on this DVD. Her talent is like none other and to see this DVD is a walk through her history and ability.
B00005KHJR|5.0|movie )<br />OK I'm sure many people bought this expecting it to be a horror movie because it was made in the 70s and Christopher Lee starred in the movie. This couldn't be further from the truth. It was intelligently written and while it showed it's fair share of nudity - it was enjoyable and had a sense of pastoral quietness that I hadn't seen in movies before. It was funny hearing these pagans breaking into dirty little songs about sex or something related to it. <br />The one problem with reviewing this film today is that people may presume that the policeman is the guy we should be booing. But I would disagree - I think at the time when this film was released people could relate to the policeman because he was a Christian and I think at the time ( although it's this I'm a little unsure of ) people had a lot more respect for people. To watch something like this was of course a little terrifying for them. <br />It does bring up what happens when some people's minds are closed when it comes to different religions. It's something that still happens today so the film is far from dated. We see today in the news about Israel and Palestine and The divide in the North of Ireland with the Unionists and Nationalists. It's not something you'll actually get from watching the movie but you'll notice it after you watch the news <br />As for the movie - enjoy it - have a laugh with the songs and well it's just....just something that seemed out of place in the horror genre<br />Now a 1, and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 - Corn rigs and barley, corn rigs and barrrrlllleeeeeeeeeey
B0000TB03W|5.0|There is only one word to describe Shania Twain on stage Charismatic. She has the most incredibly energy and stage presents. Watching the band perform Don't Be Stupid well lets just say the violins and steel guitar steal the show at least on this song. The audience reaction to the songs and Shania tell it all! Pure fun, joy and love for Shania and her music.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|These songs sound so vital, and they are performed with such love and care. The musicians obviously want George's music to sound great and every song does.<br />Crank this up in DTS or Dolby Digital for one of the best concert DVDS ever.<br />Here is what I want to know.  Why is George's back catalog so messed up?  Some of his better stuff isn't even in print. We need all his original albums reissued, remastered with bonus tracks and we need it now!  Are you listening, Apple and WB? Get together on this and do George's memory right!  <br />This concert really made me realize how great George was. There are about 20 Harrison songs played in this concert, and they could have added so many more - \\"What is Life?\\", \\"Dark Horse\\", \\"Blow Away\\", \\"Life Itself\\", \\"Any Road\\", etc<br />This guy wrote a lot of great songs, and it's a shame that people can't even buy some of his best stuff.<br />Well it looks like someone was reading my mind.  This is from thebeatles.com<br />George's Dark Horse albums, Thirty Three And 1/3, George Harrison, Somewhere In England, Gone Troppo, Cloud Nine, along with Live In Japan will be reissued early next year. Live In Japan will be released as a double SACD set, while the rest will be released on CD with bonus tracks on February 23, 2004.<br />A box-set, The Dark Horse Catalogue, containing the five CD albums and the SACD set, plus a bonus DVD, will be released on March 15.<br />Thank you!

B00005Y6YB|1.0|I cannot tell you how disapointed I was after watching my recently purchased DVD.  I expected this version to be complete and without edit.  What I got was an extremely shortened version of perhaps my all time favorite western.  The editing to me seemed to make the story choppy and without the flow of a story well told. I came away feeling I had been cheated of the true telling of the original story. I mean complete scenes had been left out.  It was a complete failure in my eyes.
B0000025DV|5.0|If I could choose any 10 albums that I would be forced to listen to for the rest of my life, this one would be near or at the top. I first bought it on vinyl in the 70's and snatched up the CD as soon as I saw it available. Most groups will only dream of turning out a song or two with the complexity and sheer artwork of any track from this CD. Every song is a major production. Just listen closely to each track, and revel in the blend of instruments and voices. I could only estimate how many times I have listened to this album, and it just keeps getting better!

She stood on stage and just sang her way into the hearts of all that were there, all that saw it on T.V. and all that will see the DVD. She is so talented and her voice is so smooth and has such range that she can sing her way into each and every heart. Shania has all the talent to take a city like Chicago and gain control of it. It is a wonder the Mayor did not give her a key to the city. Shania will once again put Chicago on the map. This is a must buy video for all music fans,
B00009UW0N|1.0|I always loved the Halloween movies. The problem with the 25th anniversary DVD is, it doesn't have any of the original edited seens. There is about 10 minutes that has been cut from the movie.(very important parts). All of my other DVD's have the outtakes from the original movies. I don't understand why they didn't include these in the 25th anniversary edition. Without them, there is no understanding the movie at all. It's just another slasher movie with no plot. I was very disappointed. It's not worth the money that they are selling it for.

B0000TB03W|5.0|As I watched the T.V. show, which I understand is not the whole show, I was totally moved by the way Shania reacted with the fans. She looked like she nearly fell on her head as she was getting off the stage to get closer to the fans. She spent time with them and touched hands etc with them. Her voice is as stronge as ever and she can still make you a part of her song.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack does a wonderful job of magnifying the great elements of the previous two soundtracks.  The songs represent all of the cultures of Middle Earth...both good and evil.  Howard Shore does a really great job of building and releasing tension through the music.  It almost makes you feel like you are right in the movie theater as the armies fight the Battle of the Pelennor (sp?) Fields or going up Mt. Doom to destroy the ring.  I am really sad to see the soundtrack series ending.  I really hope that Shore is right: that maybe he will get to participate in making a soundtrack to the Hobbit if Peter Jackson decides to take that project on.  The Annie Lennox song is really nice...her voice is subtle but powerful...very symbolic of the struggle which takes place in the movie.  Enya's song &quot;May It Be&quot; is the strongest of the three theme songs throughout the soundtracks, but Lennox is a close second.  For the die-hard LOTR fans, go out and get this one....you will be totally prepared when you visit the theater in a couple weeks.  The music is a big part of these movies.  I know I can't wait to hear this beautiful music again alongside Frodo, Gandalf, Merry, Pippin, and the rest!!!
B0000CO0VR|4.0|Note that this is not a CD, it is instead a proprietary CD-like product.  It may or may not work on your system.  This is a shame as Enigma is one of my favourite bands and while this album is not their best, it would have been well worth buying if they had released it in CD format.  Overall, I found this album was slightly below-average for Enigma but still worth four out of five.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville has been dubbed as being a show for 25 and younger crowd, but I'm a 30 year old doctor and make time in my busy schedule to never miss it.  I recently watched all 21 first episodes again and it was like watching them for the first time. I agree with one of the reviewers that there are a lot of cliches, but that is part of the fun of the DC Comic world. Remember that this is the pre-Metropolis Clark Kent trying to lay low, but being forced into situation after situation.  The fact that people develope bizzare powers is just part of the reality of Smallville and its high concentration of meteorites; I think its a neat twist to the Superman universe and will continue to watch and buy the DVD's even if it runs for 20 seasons.  The music is great and the characters are better; their one dimensionalism is on purpose, but just wait until later seasons when they are placed into diversity and those personalities will flourish.  This show couldn't be written any better; it's just enough to entertain and tease.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania,<BR>Shania has returned with a powerful new DVD that has all of what made Shania &quot;Shania&quot;. The DVD was so fun to watch. It made you feel like you wanted to jump in and be a part of the video. The band was excellent as well. The star that was shining so very bright was that of Shania. It is really cool that she wrote or co-wrote the songs. Shania can sing most anything she puts her mind to sing and it will come out beautiful but when she sings the songs that are made for and by her the sweetness of her voice and the greatness of her talent come shining through.
B00009TB5G|5.0|In my experience, reading the book is always better than watching a movie derived from a book.  This one is very nearly an exception to that rule.  I fell in love with Tolkien's writing as a kid, and I know The Lord of the Rings series very well.  I was disappointed when I watched The Two Towers in the theater, though, because some of my favorite scenes from the book were left out and ignored.  The Extendeded Edition didn't let me down, though!  This is a wonderful companion to the book (which is still better in my opinion), and any high fantasy fan should include this DVD in their collection along with The Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This is one album that stands out from a market of mediocre Christmas album releases. <br />While decent vocalist like Christina Aguilera, Mariah, Celine ,Ashanti and Toni have faltered with theirs', being unable to make Christmas standards any more palatable, Whitney proven once more why she is Queen .<br />When you listen to this album, you are listening to the best singer in the world !  The best voice in the imusic industry. <br />Her voice, at once caressing, dynamic, thick and lush, emotive... stylistically astounding. <br />If her 'The Bodyguard ' album didn't announce to the world that she has the biggest voice in the business and 'My Love Is Your Love ' didn't show her dexterity , 'One Wish' surely silences all critics for good. <br />All the tracks are truly wonderful  My personal favourites would be ' One wish for christmas' and rendition for ' Little Drummer Boy ' . <BR>Actually if you try this album for youself, you'll be very hard-pressed to pick your favourite track. <br />It's THAT good. It gets you in the mood. <br />Suffice to say, if 'Just Whitney' was bad, this time, Whitney's BACK. The big-voiced but classy one.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Lovely CD!  I am impressed with Josh's vocals and the way he interprets his songs.  I love all the tracks and I recommend this CD to others who like his kind of music.  For those reviewers who lambasted him, let me just say that as Americans, you have a lot of grammatical lapses.  I recommend you to take the TOEFL exam just to refresh yourselves with what good English really is.  I can't believe some people are so incapable of writing!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is likely to shoot of the even newer hights with the release of Up and the DVD Up Live in Chicago. Her new songs are truely great. Forever and always shows you love and Up shows you the joy of living. You need to see the DVD not just the T.V. show to see and capture the complete Shania in this life of music.
B00005JL78|1.0|It only gets worse. The film is barely watchable since everything is in a cheap bluish hue. It's the future man, get it? Crime is bad so we can predict when it will happen and bust yo tail down! Get it?? Tom Cruise has a baby (and loses him) by natural means. Get IT??? Robo-spiders examine your eyeballs to see if you are an outlaw! Get IT???? Me neither.
B00006879E|5.0|SAJ by Maroon5 is an AMAZING CD! Its COMPLETELY different from any other album! The soulfull voice of Adam mixes perfectly with the rock beat provided by Ryan and Mickey. Jesse is AMAZING on the keyboard and Jimmy V. is one of the best guitar players! Go pick up Songs About Jane if you haven't already!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania takes Chicago when she blew in set up a stage and took to the stage preforming some of her best with some new songs. She made the idea of attending one of her concerts even more desirable. I have not yet but soon I will have this DVD to watch several times. Her talent is truely show cased on this DVD. She moves, talks and sings her way into the the heart of all Chicago thereby taking over the City as only the best have been able to do.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|In the age of processed pop on the radio, thank God we still have Sarah. Her true talents as songwriter and singer really stand out in a world of American Idol losers, Justin Timberwoman and Pink. &quot;Fallen&quot; is an instant classic &amp; this album was well worth the wait.
0156027321|4.0|When I first started reading this book, it was really a struggle.  The first 50 or so pages were really slow moving.  Once the story started flowing, it moved along at a reasonable pace, and it turned into one of those books that I couldn't put down, because I needed to find out how everything would turn out.  As it turns out, the more I think about this book, the better it becomes.  It certainly makes you think what the underlying message is in this story, and it's great for discussion.
B00003CX9Q|1.0|Family tripe at its worst! So overrated and a complete bore. E.T. phone home! E.T. friend! E.T. want Reese's Pieces! E.T. a Christ-like figure persecuted for being different! E.T. hurt cut finger. That about sums up the whole overblown experience.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar does it again! This movie was great in every way, picture, plot!<br />My kids loved it, it's a great film for children as well as adults.
B00003CXAT|1.0|Better watch out! Big dinosaurs gonna eat you up! More childish slapdash from the master of schlock. Ohhhh cool effects dude! The only saving grace I give this entire movie is the scene where fat Newman (Seinfeld) gets sparyed with dino-snot by the lil veloscoraptors (sp?)
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Special Extended DVD Edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers&quot; proves to be even better than the original! The film, now 43 minutes longer, feels less rushed in the editing than the theatrical version. The new scenes make the film flow more smoothly. This finally shows that this film is a step up from &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot; And with a ton of extras, this promises to be one of the greatest DVD releases for years to come!<br />Movie Grade: A+<br />DVD Grade: A+
B00009Y3L4|5.0|\\"Cabaret\\" is one of the best releases of 1972, living up to \\"The Godfather\\".  It won eight Oscars, including Best Director.  Its combination of glitz, glamour, sex, ulginess, and turmoil wonderfully express themselves in the movie.  It offers a unique musical taste not often seen.  The plot was written wonderfully.  They always offer surprise interest scenes when the audience least expects it.  The glamour in the Kit Kat Klub switching to the Nazi troop march symbolize such surprise.  Such hardtimes are expressed accurately as it happened when Hitler began taking over Germany.  Daring sex scenes and sex talk offer further respect to the crew.  This places them ahead of their time.  Some may say \\"Cabaret\\" is also ahead of modern day time.  The costume designs were craften beautifully.  The drag queens resemble real-life women, a difficult task to master.  Every piece of clothing accurately desplicts 1930's german styles, in and out of the cabaret.  All the songs were written brilliantly.  Liza Minelli deserved her Oscar win for Best Actress for her role as a greedy cabaret performer Sally Bowles.  Her singing is unforgettable.  Amazingly, she was only 24.  Michael York's role as a man who converts to heterosexuality with a relationship with Bowles is also wonderful.  He was wrongfully dissed for the Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  All other performances are also brilliant, major or minor.  \\"Cabaret\\" is a great musical for those looking for something unique.  It still contains the attraction spark enflamed 31 years ago.  This will leave many audiences entertained for many more years.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|That's all I have to say. The original sound and talent are back!
0201626632|5.0|You'll find a lot of valuable advice in this book even if you think you already know all these things.  I was at first skeptical that something new for me would emerge from this tiny book (especially after having attended many seminars on topics discussed in the book), yet in many cases I felt that what I read did strengthen my understanding of the processes and tradeoffs involved in selecting an advisor/mentor, making a career choice (industry vs. academia), writing a grant proposal, etc.<BR>If you are on the verge of such an important step in your professional life and decide to save yourself the $10 or so that the book costs, you are truly shortchanging yourself.<BR>If nothing else, read the book at the library -- it would take you 2-3 hours, but the results will be a lifetime's worth!
B000099T2L|2.0|I mean seriously i love beyonce, when people say shes fat and stuff im like \\"no shes not shes beautiful\\". But seriously this album stinks, do not waste your money. The only people that will like it would be little teeny bopper girls.<br />The songs you should download are:<br />1. Crazy in love - if you dont have it already<br />2. Baby boy - if you dont have it already<br />3. Be with you<br />4. Thats how you like it - can get annoying but her verses are good, and the rap just finsihes it off, if you can crop the song from the beginning and end and make it like 2 minutes long, its pretty good.<br />5. Bonnie and Clyde - again if you dont have it already<br />6. Me Myself and I
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is by far, my most favorite band! I'm their biggest fan! This is an excellent album! I would reccomend anyone to get it. It's very haunting and has very good sound. I've played this cd so much my parents are getting sick of it. I honestly think everyone would love it.
B0000CC5CS|5.0|As a fan of this series, the people who cirtized this movie are far being way too judgemental. I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot, James Cameron was not directing (the creator and writer for the first 2), Linda Hamilton was gone and there was a whole new cast with the exception of Arnold. Let alone if Cameron had left the real ending of T2 in and didn't cut it we wouldn't even have a T3. (The scene where an old Sarah Conner is refelecting in the future how Judgement day never happened).  <BR>I was real surprised with the result, there was no stop action as like the first 2 movies and storyline flowed well.  The acting was great and Kristina Loken was just as cold faced as Robert Patrick was. The fufillment of the prophecy was the only way to go for this movie and Mostow did well in telling how the Machines would finally become self awared. I would have loved to see Linda Hamilton back in this one and she was sorly missed, but other than that this movie doesn't miss on anything else at all.  The Graphics was great and the fight scene between Loken and Arnold while the machines were taking over was something to see. I recommend seeing this the way it should be on a large screen with plenty of surround sound, it will blow you away.
B00004VXF2|5.0|This music is inspirational.  I would play it at parties to set the tone.  Listen to it and you'll find zen inner peace.
B000002C1V|5.0|This record is the peak for Pink Floyd. In fact, this is no big surprise because since \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\" every record is better than its previous:<BR>- \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\" is better than \\"Obscured By Clouds\\";<BR>- \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is better than \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\";<BR>- \\"Animals\\" is better than \\"Wish You Were Here\\";<BR>- \\"The Wall\\" is better than \\"Animals\\";<BR>- \\"The Final Cut\\" is better than \\"The Wall\\".<br />This album is usually considered a Roger Waters album instead of a true Pink Floyd album. That's right, because 11 of the 12 songs are entirely credited to Waters. But it is also true that in his following solo carreer he never achieved such consistent quality.<br />What really strikes me about \\"The Final Cut\\" is the unity of the album, without being a real \\"opera rock album\\". There's only one song that hardly seems to fit in the context: \\"Not Now John\\" (a kind of a hard rock song with the word \\"f***\\" in it as if Pink Floyd were trying to sound actual for the kids of the eighties). The rest is an intimate album - what is hard to find amongst other concept albums, because they tend to be very solemn, like \\"The Wall\\" was to a certain extent.<br />Some of the best Pink Floyd songs are here:<BR>- The Gunner's Dream;<BR>- The Fletcher Memorial Home;<BR>- The Final Cut;<BR>- Two Suns In The Sunset.<br />The melodies, specially the vocal melodies, are very unusual and beautiful - a great record to sing to. The classical chords add a very dramatic mood to the sound (i think it is the London Symphony Orchestra playing and the chords were arranged by Michael Kamen).<br />Pink Floyd are such a great band that they have fans for lots of different reasons. One of the most common reasons for liking Pink Floyd is the David Gilmour guitar solos. For this kind of fans, i'm afraid this record will be a kind of a disillusion, because the solos are few and discreet although, in my opinion, quite good, without overshadowing the rest of the song.<br />For those fans who like the Roger Waters' lyrics this will be a sure bet. The songs are around the subject of war and the traumas (for Roger) provoked by the death of both his father and his grandfather during the Second World War and the First World War, respectively. So, it's like a detailed picture of one of Roger Waters' brick in the wall.<br />It is also a very political album, with lots of evil references to Margaret Thatcher induced by the war against Argentina in the Falkland Islands (started in late 1982).<br />I can't describe better the album because there's no other to compare to. Some people say that it is similar to \\"The Pros And Cons Of Hitch Hiking\\" but I think \\"The Final Cut\\" is a lot better and substantially different. Finally, I recommend this record to all Pink Floyd lovers, except for those who are obssessed by David's guitar solos.
0385504209|4.0|If someone commissioned James Patterson to write (invent) a religious thriller, we just might get a book like this.  The furious pace of the short chapters and murderous action galore were entertaining until the last few chapters when everybody including the author just seemed to run out of steam.  Actually, the principal characters were just a little unbelievable on several occasions, and some of their riddle solving was really not all that impressive.<br />Obviously what created all the buzz about this book is its alleged revelation of facts about Christ and the Catholic religion (infamous for its dogma).  The claim that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, the latter who supposedly makes a surprise appearance at the right of Christ in the Last Supper by Da Vinci, along with other stuff which generated the book's title, did hook us for a while.  We even surfed the net to read the &quot;Gospel of Philip&quot; and other writings from the Nag Hammadi Library, some 13 texts from the early Christian era (~300-400 AD) discovered in Egypt in 1945.  We see other reviewers similarly researched the secret societies and other &quot;facts&quot; proposed within the novel.  Indeed, the author's clever interlacing of fiction and non-fiction does add to the book's appeal.<br />In the end though, it is equally clear that much of what is passed along as fact is little better than supposition.  We are personally constantly amazed and confounded that while thousands of relics and possessions of famous Egyptians from 5000 years ago are extant and well preserved, that not one shard of the personal property of Jesus survives to this day.  One would think that anything remotely connected to him would have been considered so sacred and so valuable that hundreds of artifacts would have been salvaged and serve as &quot;proof&quot; of the many facts circulated about his life and deeds.  Alas, such is not the case.<br />We think most readers will enjoy this novel.  Its subject matter is just unusual enough to give us more than a few pauses about what we &quot;believe&quot; or thought we knew about Christianity. The mystery storyline and race/chase after the Holy Grail were probably not that well crafted, and left us feeling a little less satisfied with the book when we had finished than when we were reading.  Maybe the inconclusive ending is what shortchanged our senses.  In sum, &quot;Code&quot; is a good book, worth our while, even if one not destined for ultimate greatness.unusual enough to give us more than a few pauses about what we &quot;believe&quot; or thought we knew about Christianity.

B000002H33|5.0|When I was all of 11 I listened to this album for the first time. As I feverishly opened the jewel case and put it in and listened to &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; over and over again. I was under the impression well it couldn't possibly get any better than this. Then one day I forgot to put the replay button on. I was converted. I have never been the same since. It opend me to a whole new style of music that I didn't even know existed. I just wish more people would see how great this album is. Metallica are guarenteed a spot in the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame with this.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|After an extremely crappy year for music, David Bowie's Reality is like a breath of fresh air. It has been a year of: corporate punk (What an oxymoron! I'm sorry but if you are corporate you are not punk! Those 2 things do not go together, and never will!), awful '80s New Wave rehashes (The '80s ended 13 years ago. Get over it!), bad dance music (if I hear one more No Wave/ Punk-Funk rip off band, I think I'm going to scream!), and way too many indie rock bands with whiny singers (No one cares that your girlfriend dumped you, so shut the f**k up!). And even artists who I view as dependable, ended up putting out bad albums this year. For example, I think Elvis Costello's When I Was Cruel was the best album of 2002, but his 2003 album North, was extremely monotonous and boring. Not to mention that the lyric's sounded like they could have been written by a second grader. On the flip side of that, I thought that David Bowie's 2002 album Heathen was monotonous and boring, but that his 2003 release, Reality, is one of the best things that he has done in years. <br />Reality takes elements of some of Bowie's finest songwriting achievements, and expands on them. Other reviewers have mentioned that this album is influenced by Scary Monsters (among other earlier works) and I agree. In fact, the first track, New Killer Star, almost sounds like it could have been an outtake from that album. And since I love Scary Monsters, this makes for a very pleasurable listening experience. But even though it almost sounds like it is from that era, it is not a rehash of what he has previously done. <br />Like I said before, he is taking elements from his past and expanding on them, and he does that on New Killer Star. One thing that makes it clear that this song is not from 1980 is the lyrics. They are written by a man who has gained wisdom through age. A recurring theme on this album is Bowie's own reflection on his past, not just musicially, but lyrically as well. It seems as if through letting the music of his past influence him, he has also been able to reflect on past mistakes he made. On more than one of the songs on this album, he presents himself as a troubled soul. Perhaps he has been able to find some sort of catharsis through writing these songs.  <br />I definitely would consider New Killer Star one of the best tracks on the album. 2 of the other best tracks are Never Grow Old and Reality. And not surprisingly, both of these songs sound like they are influenced by his '70s material. Never Grow Old reminds me of Golden Years, but it doesn't sound exactly like it. The similarity is more so in the mood of the song, than it is in it's musical content. And I could hear quite a bit of Rebel Rebel within the song Reality. But as with New Killer Star, the lyrics of these songs are very different than the kind of lyrics he wrote during the early to mid '70s. You could even say that through it's reflective lyrics, Reality is a critique of the person he was when he wrote Rebel Rebel. <br />Overall, the songwriting on this album is very solid (Even the unpopular Bring Me The Disco King has good things about it), and Bowie's voice is full of energy and emotion (the reviewer who said that Bowie has lost his voice has no clue what they are talking about). <br />I wish that all those '80s New Wave wannabe bands would take Bowie's cue, and use the music of the past to influence them in to creating something that is new and different, instead of just blatantly ripping off music from the '80s. If something has been done before, what is the point of doing it again? <br />With this album, it may appear on the surface that Bowie is repeating himself. And with '80s nostalgia running rampant, some people might think that he is trying to cash in on that. But people should keep in mind that nostalgia is generally an unrealistic look at the past. When we get nostalgic, we remember things as better than they really were. Bowie is definitely not doing that. He is looking at things in the harsh light of Reality, and there is nothing nostalgic about that.
B000002BMV|5.0|This is one of the best music masterpieces produced in the past twenty years. There are at least five great songs on it, and when I say great I mean some of the best I've ever heard. Steve Perry's voice is amazing, you don't here many voices like that, not to mention the lyrics to the songs and the music, now that's music we don't come across anymore. Journey never really made it big in most of Europe, and I'll never figure out why, ever since my husband has heard this I can't get it back from him, he just thinks it's brilliant.

Older efforts have more liveliness.  <br />I can't get over the feeling that Shania wishes she was somewhere else instead of onstage.  <br />Of course the sound and picture quality are absolute glossy and perfect, but have you ever seen someone with such stature seem so bored with her robitic renditions?  How about some real passion instead of ultra-marketable bland!

B000005RNQ|3.0|I've been a Saxon fan for well over 20 years, and I've seen all the debate over their lack of major, worldwide success that bands such as Maiden or Priest enjoyed. 'Denim &amp; Leather' holds some of the answers to that burning question of why Saxon never garnered the attention of the bigger bands of the time.<br />When I speak of Saxon's lineup, I'm talking about the band from 1979-1985. I don't consider anything after 1985's 'Innoncence is No Excuse' to be true Saxon ('Innocence' doesn't have much to do with true Saxon music, though it had a few bright spots). Musicianship was never a question. Graham Oliver &amp; Paul Quinn were the most underrated guitar duo of the New Wave metal bands, Steve Dawson always gave a workman-like (if unspectacular) bass performance, and Pete Gill/Nigel Glockler could thunder with the best. When we get to Biff Byford, however, the problems begin. Byford's voice is best described as a third-rate Ian Gillian knockoff, and he showed weak range &amp; power in his vocals. Trying to carry subject matter &amp; lyrics that were often trite with a weak voice was a drag on the band. You'd never mistake Biff for Rob Halford, Graham Bonnet, or Bruce Dickinson. Biff's best vocal work showed up on 'Power &amp; the Glory'. On to 'Denim &amp; Leather' now.<br />First, the good stuff. 'D &amp; L' opens with an absolute classic Saxon killer, 'Princess of the Night'. The main riff hits you right in the gut, and after Graham Oliver's ripping solo slaps you upside the head, you're ready to replay the song about 15 times. A Saxon Top 5, hands down. 'Never Surrender' is an angst-ridden trip back to the band's youth that was a hit in the U.K., and a cool song to boot. 'And the Bands Played On' is Saxon's very own 'Smoke on the Water', a tune about their gig at Donnington's Monster's of Rock the previous year. It's a short, rocking song with a catchy main hook riff. 'Fire in the Sky' is a fast-paced, hard-hitting nuclear holocaust tune, comparable to 'Motorcycle Man' in terms of structure. Finally, the title track is a classic Saxon anthem about the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (&quot;where were you in '79/when the dam began to burst/&quot;) featuring more piercing solo work by Oliver.<br />Sadly, this album also began a bad trend for the band. 'Denim &amp; Leather' seemed to start the band's penchant for radio-friendly filler junk songs. 'Rough &amp; Ready' is utter filler garbage that should've stayed on the cutting floor. 'Play it Loud' is a silly attempt at an airplay-friendly anthem, with a laughable main riff. To a lesser extent, 'Out of Control' seems to be the most polished &amp; commercialized track on the album. It's a decent song, but a little weak in the knees (much better than the two mentioned before). Funny how 'Never Surrender' was a hit, when it's glaringly clear that 'Out of Control' was aimed at radio. 'Midnight Rider' isn't bad, but once again comes up a little weak. Think of it as a tamer version of Motley Crue's drivel-anthem 'Girls Girls Girls'. Biff croons about riding a tour bus across the U.S.A., without the raunch of Crue's stupid song. Okay, but nothing that sticks like 'Princess'. 'D &amp; L' is a good album, but it isn't the watershed point that many claim it to be. 'Wheels of Steel' &amp; 'Strong Arm of the Law' were much stronger efforts.<br />This penchant for including too much filler material became a staple in the band's future releases (with the exception of 'Power &amp; the Glory', which I believe to be the band's finest hour). Too many forgettable songs delivered by a lead vocalist with a forgettable voice were vital components to Saxon's downfall. In the end, the key to their failure was the unwise decision to abandon their strong cult following by shifting gears and penning the radio-friendly, commercial tripe that showed up on 'Crusader' and the next few albums. The title track to 'Crusader' was Saxon's last great anthem. Such a shame for so promising a band. There was a reason Steve Dawson quit after 'Innocence' flopped and created backlash by fans. I guess Byford's proclamations that 'Crusader' &amp; 'Innocence' were indeed sellout attempts at commercial success didn't sit well with Dawson, much like it didn't sit well with fans who stuck by this band. A stronger follow-up to 'Power &amp; the Glory' could've vaulted Saxon to elite status. Well, we'll never know.
B00005R1N3|4.0|In the summer of 1981 (at the frightfull age of 8), the Luxurama theatre in Wittebome, Cape Town ran a double feature. The films screened were The Cannonball Run (with Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore)and Black Christmas. The latter played first, and I was scared sh*tless from the start. Having seen When a Stranger calls the previous year, I could almost marry the 2 films together. The legacy about 70's horrors was it's haunting film scores. Lalo Schifrin did a brilliant job on Amityville Horror, as did John Carpenter with the Halloween movies. My memories of the film brings me back to the girl with the clingwrap plastic over her face in the rocking chair - also the hook coming through the attic door and pulling the victim up at the throat (The only scene to top this one was in Friday the 13th part 2 when, the guy does a handstand up the staircase and ol' Jason axes him between the nuts!!!!!). The attic door in our house was in the bathroom - damn I was scared to splash with the door locked. I'm hoping to get my hands on a DVD copy soon. But first, The Wild Geese and the Kentucky Fried movie must fall on my lap!!!!!!
B00005ASHM|1.0|I am very disapointed! After looking for this album for 10 years, at least I bought it and ... masterpiece?<br />C'mon people! I have around 2000 Rock albums in my collection and I would never placed this not even between the top 100.<br />How could anyone say that Rubber Soul or Revolver are under Pet Sounds? Any 60's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better. And something else, if this is the sound that shape the American pop music, I might be wrong, but ... where is Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis, etc? Those are really masters of American music, not The Beach Boys.<br />I can't give to this album more than half star.
B00005U2JL|4.0|This dvd is an excellent document of Marilyn Manson's world tour. I'd just wish the live footage to be from a single concert. But anyway, it's very, very good
B00005CDNK|5.0|As most would agree, ABBA's final released album of original material in 1981 was greeted with mixed response, let alone this 8 year old at the time!  Many years later, and with more adult insight I fully appreciate the sombre and autobiographical brilliance of this oeuvre.  Increasingly autobiographical and documenting a widening rift between the band through rhyme (the album cover alone indicates their division and the bleakness of the recording), yet this CD stands victorious trial against music critics and fans alike, containing soaring and brilliant melodies (listen to the grumbling choris of the title track and the snappy Soldiers chorus), awesome harmonies (Agnetha's falsettoes in I Let The Music Speak and the 2-part chorus harmony to Two For The Price of One).  Lyrically this is an introspective album covering healing from separation (One of Us, When All Is Said ''here's to us, one more toast''), the torments of mental anguish (The Visitors), war (Soldiers), growing children (the gorgeous Slipping Through My Fingers), and so on and so forth.  Frida and Agnetha are also given individual vocal reigns on each song (no songs have them singing verses in harmony) and most importantly, Frida is able to shine as perhaps the most accomplished of the two vocalists.  I find it hard to summarise the cd...there's so much complexity to the lyrics, the musical structures (listen for example to Two for the Price moving from simple male lead verse to twin part backing harmonies and army-band type ending).  Despite criticism for being overtly commerical this Opus indicates ABBA as accomplished and mature artistes who are capable of writing deeper lyrics and musical structure while maintaining a commercial appeal.  Haunting, tragic and brilliant.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'll keep this short but sweet... I've never been a Christina fan but after seeing her in concert with JT and listening to her new CD... I'm sold. Her new look I believe is classless and unappropriate but I understand the point she is trying to make about being feminine and being beautiful. The vocals, lyrics, and beats on this CD are amazing..... even my 49 year old mother listens to it and it also hits a variety of topics from family to boys..... You'll love it!
B00005CDNI|5.0|Riding high on the wave of disco in 79, this release from ABBA saw the group unleash to the world a multitude of hit singles (5 UK Top 5) all of which show the group at their most audibly accessible and brilliant.  Production-wise the sounds are uplifting without being cheesy, and the songs brilliantly formulaic - and they work - most of which are now regarded as ABBA classix.  Top marks go to the infuratingly catchy title track (still gets people going in a disco 20 odd years later!) and to the first single featuring a male vocal (Does Your Mother Know).  Summer NIght City is another song with male lead vocals and you feel the heat and mystery of the song through the deeper registers of the vocals. Klassik.  Add to that the wonderful If ItWasn't For The Nights,  fantastic uptemp sing which shows the power of the girls' voices when they sing in Unison.  The now timeless ballads Chiquitita and I Have A Dream will forever be ABBA faves (altho not personal faves).  Of the bonus trax in this cd edition Gimme Gimme is still a timeless campy pop song (originally featured on ABBA's GH Vol.2) and Lovelight, a pure pop sing which still uplifts.  Seriously, not one bad tack here (altho King Has Lost His Crown sounds dated now), vocally astounding, musically consistent, and indicative of ABBA's brilliance as pop performers and timeless contribution to the library of popular music.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well,my review is simple.Britney truly changed the mood of her music from bubblegum pop to dirty dancey pop.Still, the essential pop elements are found throughout the tracks.Amazingly different in a way and she grew with the music.But?,there's a but all right.The album didn't show much of her voice...her beautiful voice? and this is dissapointing.Anyway,this album surely guarantees pure dance and vibe .It's great for party people,clubbing and of course to shake some booty.I myself a techno and dance fan is grateful for her style of music .My fave&quot; on this album &quot;TOXIC&quot;,EVERYTIME and The hook up!

1400034779|5.0|I came to this book after having had many, many people recommend it to me. When I get that kind of Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers thumbs-up, I tend to get stubborn, suspecting a mass-marketing push of some sort. The more fool me. In this case, the price for my stubbornness definitely came off my own hide.<br /><br />Fortunately, my niece's plane was late to land a couple of weeks ago, so I picked this up at the airport bookstore and started to read it. I was immediately hooked.<br /><br />As you can read above, this amazing volume follows the exploits of Mma Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's first female detective. We watch her set up her office, solve her first few cases, and eventually unlock a mystery that peers into the dark (and banal) heart of human evil. But to call this a detective novel is almost a disservice to Mr. Smith's wonderful book. Mysteries, in general, fall into a very few, well-established sub-genres: the Cozy, the Hardboiled Detective, the Police Procedural, the Thriller. Every one of these types has a very clear set of standard gimmicks--tropes--that let you know what's going on. Even books that mix genres (like Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden novels which mix fantasy with hardboiled, or Laura Joh Rowland's Sano Ichiro series and Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books, both of  which tend to shift from procedural to thriller) tend to show great respect for the genre. But this book seems to ignore the traditional forms of the detective novel altogether. It is, first and formost, a novel, a work of literary fiction. Its main subject is the soul of the people of Botswana, as viewed through the lens of Mma Ramotswe herself. Yes, she solves mysteries. But it is more in the fashion of Solomon or Judge Ooka than Sherlock Holmes or Sam Spade. She is a master of the human soul. She understands people, and why they do the silly things they do, and so she inevitably manages to uncover the answers to questions that others can't seem to solve.<br /><br />Part of the beauty of the book is that Smith's deceptively simple storytelling style all but forces the reader to fall in love with Precious. She is so admirable, so endearing that you have no choice. You know she's going to solve the case, and that, as long as she is working on the problem, everything's going to be all right. By way of example--and I'm not going to give away too much here--about half way through the book, an incident occurs that is, on many levels, quite horrific. Smith handles the scene beautifully, simply and terrifyingly. It is the sort of scene that has broken my suspension of disbelief in several previous thrillers. Yet, because of Smith's style and Mma Ramotswe's charm and perseverance, I felt enough trust to continue on. That trust was rewarded. The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency solved the case in most satisfactory fashion.<br /><br />For me, knowing of southern Africa mostly through novels and horrific news reports, it was a joy to get to know Botswana on so personal and believable a level.the book is that Smith's deceptively simple storytelling style all but forces the reader to fall in love with Precious.

0385504209|5.0|This book was amazing!!!  I finished it in 2 days.  You won't want to put it down.  It's an excellent book to read for book groups.  You'll find so many things to discuss!!  I highly recommend it!!!!!
B00006AW2G|4.0|this new version of the Rolling Stones back catalog is a great improvement in terms of sound quality, but nohting more thatn that. In the booklet, there arent any notes, not even band line-up, no lyrics, nothing. Its a shame.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I own!!!  Every song is excellent.. I'm a die-hard Nickelback fan and I just love every song they do.  Definitely a great cd to have in your collection.
B000002BQK|5.0|wow! this CD from Mariah is awesome! almost every song is worth the listen and enjoyable. There are some really touching songs on here such as &quot;On The Outside,&quot; &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; and &quot;Cry In My Sleep&quot; and then you have the fun, up-tempo songs like &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot; (Butterfly Remix/Reprise). I first got this during when it was released and haven't stopped listening to it ever since. Mariah's voice can captivate anyone and take anyone's breath away with her sound. This is a must have for any music lover or true fan of Mariah Carey. Some of the songs on here are some personal ones, especially &quot;On The Outside,&quot; which is very heart touching. This is a great addition to anyone's music collection. Everyone should already own this CD by now!
B0000AQZYM|5.0|This has to be one of the sweetest movies I have seen in quite awhile. I generally do not like Disney movies - they make little girls think their lives cannot be happy unless they marry a prince. Finding Nemo just makes me happy to be a parent .. and I held my daughter even tighter.
B000083E79|5.0|No matter how you slice it, Cher is one of the best female artists in the world. Every song on this CD rocks; Cher has a very powerful voice that makes whatever she sings become original. If you're a Cher fan, from the most hard core to the person that just loves a couple of songs, this is THE album to have. All the number one hits are on this CD (my personal favorite is 'Just Like Jesse James') and I guarantee that you'll find something that you'll listen to over and over and over again.<br />My final opinion: Get this. Trust me: you won't be sorry.
B000084T18|5.0|This is possibly the greatest rap CD ever made...every single song on the CD is awesome, with the possible exception of 21 Questions, which most people love anyway! There is no reason to skip ANY of the songs, there are no stupid, waste of space, interludes or skits. The beats are incredible and 50's lyrics are awesome. Buy this CD, and it will not leave your CD player for months.
B000066NW0|5.0|Every song in this CD will be listened to multiple times; it's all THAT GOOD.<br />Just in case you've been hiding out in a cave for the past couple of years, Avril Lavigne is a young teenage artist from Canada that took the US on storm last year with the song 'Complicated', then 'Sk8r Boi'. Even though the other songs haven't been publicised nearly as much, they're all made in the same style, and I guarantee that you'll find one song to identify with, at least.<br />Get this, and you won't be sorry!
B00000DFSK|5.0|When they first appeared on the international scene in the 80's, U2 became the biggest band in the world, a title many believe they still hold. Along with bands like The Police and The Cure, U2 delivered songs that could serve as radio friendly jams but also as deep, sometimes thought-provoking compositions. Their stuff still holds up precisely because it has what all great songs have, passion and spirit. &quot;The Best Of 1980-1990&quot; covers the band's first decade and is filled with classic cuts, wonderful moments and evocative music. Of course this is isn't ALL of the best the band produced in the 80's (&quot;Bullet The Blue Sky&quot; is missing) but it's a great refresher course. &quot;Pride (In The Name Of Love)&quot; is a deceptive love song, it may sound like a romantic tune, but when it talks about &quot;Love&quot; it's referring to things deeper than puppy love. &quot;New Year's Day&quot; is an evocative moment with a memorable piano section and a complete emotional feel. The driving &quot;I Will Follow&quot; is an example of the band's early days when they were heavily influenced by Punk artists such as Patti Smith and The Ramones but with a more glossy production. The more political anthems like &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; are here with their epic sweeps. And yet, the band could still churn out a good old fashioned love song like &quot;With Or Without You&quot; with it's beautiful melodies. U2 also has a wonderful taste for blues which is evident in rousing numbers like &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;When Love Comes To Town&quot; featuring a roaring appearance by B.B. King. There is a new mix of &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; which feels now more focused and polished. Though U2 would go on to still make great albums in the 90's and into the 21st century and re-arrange their image once or twice, &quot;The Best Of 1980-1990&quot; is a great look at the band at their rawest most effective.
6304401132|5.0|This movie is probably my favorite old Disney movie, and it's digitally remastered, which makes it especially great. The colors are spectacular, and the story makes you fall in love with animation all over again.<br />Sleeping Beauty (in case you didn't know) is a story about Aurora, a princess, who, on the day she was to be given special gifts by her fairy godparents, she was cursed by an especially evil fairy. The curse was that on her 16th birthday, she would prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die. So, she gets taken away by her fairy godmothers and hidden in a small cottage in the forest, not told of her royal heritage. Everything is all fine and dandy until the day of her sixteenth birthday, when she meets a boy in the woods (who just happens to be her betrothed, though she doesn't know it) and her fairy godmothers give her a magical (which they REALLY weren't supposed to do) dress and cake. A spy for the evil fairy sees the magic, then the princess, and tells her, so Aurora actually ends up pricking her finger.<br />But, everything turns out fine and dandy, and everyone lives happily ever after.<br />Recommmended for: EVERYONE. Everyone loves this movie (for the most part), even if they won't admit it.
0780628551|4.0|Whoa, lots of negativity floating around about this film.  Watching the film for the first time, totally unaware even of the genre of movie I was watching, I was totally dragged along by it.  The appeal to me was seeing a sci-fi feature unravel with minimal effects.  I also thought that it was an incredible role for Depp.  This was the film that made me a Depp fan.  His character was disarming and terrifying.  The cinematography was spare and relevant to the story, and the direction was superb.  Cases in point, the scene near the end with Depp descending the stairs dragging his wedding band on the rail...the brief glimps of Depp &quot;whispering&quot; to Jillian's sister.  And it's got Charlize Theron in it!  Okay, okay, there WAS the recurring in utero scene, but you just have to roll your eyes and move on -- they didn't invest heavily on effects.  If you're looking for a sci-fi-horror film with drooling scaly things that spit acid and laser beams (and that have ONLY ONE WEAKNESS!!!), this is not the film for you.  If you don't like to use your imagination after you are done watching the movie, this is not the film for you.  If you simply want to be entertained, well, this movie totally freaked me out and haunted me for days.
B0000E1ALR|3.0|First of all lets clear something out of the way.  Bruce Springsteen's music is loved by millions world wide.  People seem to expect that he will refuse to accept the financial benefits of this success.  Would you?  No I didn't think so.<BR>That having been said I've often used the brother analogy when debating Springsteen with &quot;non-believers&quot;. This is basically the notion that I can say something critical about my brother but let someone else say something critical and I'll pounce.  I'm only willing to hear true insightful critique when it comes to Bruce and there is some to be heard.  As for the review by the police officer from San Fran. It should be swiped off the site.  The section for reviews should be reserved for insightful comments.  The ignorance of &quot;zero talent musically or vocally..&quot; well, maybe learn something about music and then judge.  <BR>As for the collection.  I would really have preferred that he re-release all the albums individually remastered and add some bonus tracks.  ( I know there were plenty that weren't on Tracks)<BR>If I think about what songs should be on an essential Springsteen collection it would really be pointless because its all essential if you're a die-hard like myself.  Even if a certain track isn't your favourite its essential that you're aware of it and have heard it at some point.  There's really no need for me to go through the tracks here but I do want to comment on the one critique of &quot;Counting On A Miracle&quot; and its sound.  I also believe that this was an attempt that didn't quite come through in the wash but for a different reason. I think the artist was going for a old style delta blues sound, but theres a better way to capture that than with a super 8 camera.  Furthermore, &quot;Countin..&quot; is just too involved to work well as a delta blues.  Maybe something like &quot;Valentine&quot; off Tunnel of Love or something.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh Groban has incredible talent and a mature understanding of musical selections.  His first album may be my favorite album ever from any artist, so it would be difficult to improve upon this on his second try. 'Closer' is a terrific album but it does not have the same impact as Groban's first. The classical songs are excellent but the choice of popular songs is not quite as strong. I still highly reccommend this album and eagerly await his next effort.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|Wow, it looks like all of Whitney's cousins submitted these reviews.  Apparently Ms. Houston-Brown just released the album of a lifetime.  Well, I'm here to say that this is a HORRIBLE album that never should have been recorded.  Whitney should have retired while she was ahead.  Now she's just a parody of herself.  Poor thing.
6304082428|5.0|It is always a joy to find a classic book marvelously acted out true to the book. Pride and Prejudice is a family favorite that even (amazingly) my dad enjoys! From hilarious Mrs. Bennett and her &quot;poor nerves&quot; to Darcy and his &quot;cold manner&quot;, this movie is a wonderful production. Starring beautiful Jennifer Ehle and handsome Colin Firth, it is a must see for everyone! Very good.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Amazing talent. May he have a long career. Thank you, David Foster, for finding and developing talent and putting something in the record store that will stand up over time.
B0000TB03W|5.0|this live DVD is the next best thing to being there. It will impress you much.
B00000J8EK|5.0|Chemical Brothers never was a great band to me. Almost until I heard this masterpiece. Surrender is one of the best techno-oriented albums of all time. For sure, a lot of Chemical fans disagree with me, but this album is a sort of exception in the Chemical sound. And this exception is the best thing that they could do.
B0000TB03W|5.0|She is an amazing singer (if you remember so much so, people questioned if it was really her singing long ago), an amazing preformer, has an amazing repoire with her fans and musicians, and is amazingly beautiful. You will be amazed by this DVD.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|THIS COLLECTION IS EXCELLENT BUT ONE ESSENTIAL SONG THAT IS MISSING IS &quot;OUT IN THE STREET&quot;. IT IS MUCH MORE ESSENTIAL THAN &quot;MARY'S PLACE&quot;. THE KEY WORD IS &quot;ESSENTIAL&quot;!!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|this is a must have dvd. I can't stop watching it. My kids even love it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have all of Britney's albums, but I was never completely satisfied with them. Her style has become more mature and I can tell that she isn't trying to impress the mainstream media. I am actually satisfied with this album! Although some the songs remind of Kylie Minogue, I think it fits Britney well. I gave 4 stars because it coulda been better, but it's still really good! It's great that she's not all teeny-bopper-bubblegum-pop anymore!<br />1. Me Against the Music - very catchy, great to dance to.<BR>2. I Got That (Boom Boom) - the collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins is, well, intersting. I like it! <BR>3. Showdown - the beginnig of the song reminds me of Nip/Tuck for some reason, but anywho...not the best song the album but good.<BR>4. Breath on Me - this is very different from her old stuff. I like it. Her voice sounds nice in this song. I guess it's cuz she's not tryin' so hard to be bubblegum-ish, she's just being her!<BR>5. Early Mornin' - right when I heard this song I could tell that Moby had something to do with it! Of course he produced and did a great job. <BR>6. Toxic - My favorite song on the album! It's very dance-ish, very catchy, and fun.<BR>7. Outrageous - Ok song, but R. Kelly needs to experiment with new sounds! It's getting annoying hearing the same stuff from that man!<BR>8. Touch My Hand - My other favorite song on the album. Great song! No wonder this was the first song she cut for the album!<BR>9. The Hook Up - Not so great, but tolerable. I think this is the worse song on the album. Christina would of tore this song up though.<BR>10. Shadow - eh! not much to say about this song, just alright.<BR>11. Brave New Girl - very catchy and...well...girly. It's a fun song.<BR>12. Everytime - It's an OK song.<BR>13. Me Against the Music (remix) - good remix.

B000002J2B|4.0|This is Phil Collins'second time up as Genesis' lead vocalist and the group's farewell to the prog rock scene.  \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" is about a father telling a bedtime story to his child.  \\"One For The Vine\\" is a tale of religious disillusion and restoration.  Tony Banks does an excellent job with his keyboard and synth arsenal.  As disjointed as this song is to most fans, it really does have some beautiful chord progressions in it.  \\"Your Own Special Way\\" is a too-often-knocked ballad.  \\"Wot Gorilla\\" sounds as if it could have been done by Weather Report.  \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" is the album's most amusing number.  \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" is about those who get lost in the \\"boob tube (TV)\\".  \\"Unquiet Slumbers\\"...\\"For The Sleepers...\\" \\"In That Quiet Earth\\" all bleed together seamlessly with \\"Afterglow\\", which has faint traces (in mood)of 1973's \\"After The Ordeal\\". So the play ends, and the curtain falls.

B0000CDLA7|3.0|After Scenes from a Memory and 6 Degrees (especially disc 2) my anticipation of their next recording as futher exploritory in the progressive sense led me to much disappointment. Furthering my own personal growth as a progression listener I find groups such as Spock's Beard,Neal Morse,The Flower Kings and Enchant more interesting. I agree with other listeners, this recent release does not help separate DT with the likes of Metallica but instead makes them sound identical to them if you take away the lyrics. Dream Theater needs to make this distinction; do they want to be a mainstream metal band or a constantly exploring progressive rock band with a metal edge? Please decide soon or I'll just lose interest!

B00008BXJG|5.0|This 1979 release marked the end of the career of Bon Scott, who tragically died after a night on the town about six months later. This collection certainly was a way to end it.<br />After I purchased this album, I could not leave it alone for weeks. I still listen to it non-stop, and I NEVER get tired of Bon Scott's lyrics and the sounds of Angus, Malcolm, and Cliff on guitar and bass, and Phils drum. The title track is a very well-written song which is very expressional of the band themselves. In other words, it's about rocking and partying. John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange works to bring out the background voices of Cliff and Malcolm and the beats of Phill Rudd on drums. <br />This is definately one of their best collections out there, and when you have seventeen albums, that's saying something.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD proves that Shania Twain is the best female country singer at this time. She can sing, dance a little and reach out to the fans to make them feel a part of the show to. She loves her music and the talent and ability she put into this DVD is more than excellent but I cannot think of the word that would really fit the beauty of this DVD. When Shania sings the songs on this DVD you can see, feel, hear and know that she really loves what she is doing.
B00005AQE8|5.0|2 Pac is hip hop and you gotta respect that and this cd is probably the best cd in hip hop known to men. No other cd in the world will ever even come close to what he created. Even after 7 years they come out with a movie &quot;TUPAC RESSURECTION&quot; that's in theatres. DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU ANYTHING. THIS MAN IS HIP HOP PERIOD IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT! YOU CAN'T GIVE THIS CD OR ANY OTHER 4 STARS OR LESS. this man is a GENIUSSSSSS

B000002UJQ|5.0|I must say I can't understand why anyone would spend time trying to figure out whether Radiohead's ultimate masterpiece, OK Computer, can stack up to that of their most frequently mentioned influence, Pink Floyd. Dark Side Of The Moon was their masterpiece, dark and chilling in its own way and at the same time a deep and introspective journey through the human psyche. OK Computer is, in my opinion, the pinnicale of Radiohead's long and often tempestuous career, with Creep being their biggest and yet most hated single, and the resulting The Bends a testament to the most emotional work any band has ever produced. OK Computer, however, eclipses anything Radiohead had accomplished, just as DSOTM eclipsed pink floyd's syd barret days. To me, the epic CD is more a marathon of emotion than an excercise in patience. Thom's vocals are swelling, his lyrics emotional ed's guitar work on tracks like Electioneering and Paranoid Android is incomparable and only accentuates the mood of quiet desperation that runs throughout the album. It provokes some of that same imagery in your mind... I felt the same shiver in my spine after hearing the multi-tracked backup vocals at the end of Karma Police that I felt after hearing the insane laugh at the end of Brain Damage for the first time. Lyrically, Waters vs. Yorke should be no contest... they should both be individually recognized as two of the greatest literary composers in the world to grace rock music. But then, as far as greenwood vs. Gilmour... sorry guys, dave's got you licked on that one.

B00005JMF6|3.0|Gothika was a decent movie until the end--an absolute train wreck.  What happened??  What were they thinking?  <br />Otherwise, the movie had chills and thrills and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I don't know if Castle would have been proud, but overall, it wasn't too shabby.  It was much better than last springs disappointing \\"Identity.\\"  The only REALLY annoying thing in the movie (other than the ending) was Halle Berry's screaming.  She really got on my nerves with that constant shrilling scream.  And another thing, why put a bunch of scary music around everything that occurs in a movie?  This seems to be a new annoying Hollywood habit.  If someone is just going to the bathroom, we don't need the DA NUH DA NUH DA NUH--for goodness sakes, don't be sooo cheap!<br />Go see Gothika.  It's worth the price of admission.

6300184269|4.0|Well, if I were that little maniac, what I'd like to do would be unprintable here.  But seriously, what if you could program a computer to come up with the ideal woman?  Sizzling good looks, turbo-bodied, intelligent as Einstein, kissable lips, long legged, self-assured, and with a cool, smooth, velvety English accent?  Well, that's what Gary and Wyatt do and lo and behold, when the steam clears, out pops out that woman, whose first words to them are \\"So what would you little maniacs like to do first?\\"  And what would be the effect on a couple of unpopular, unhip, nerdy guys like our two heroes, who have a nasty trick played on them while fantasizing about the girls' gymnastic team in the opening scene?  Rather like me drinking a double mocha after spending a lifetime eating sand.  I should know, I was one of the unpopular, unhip nerds at high school.<br />Well, they name the girl Lisa, after a girl who kicked Gary in the happy sacks after he asked her name.  And they find out she is magical, like something out of a dream.  Well face it, this is a comedy-fantasy after all.  But she has a snazzy pink convertible, the ability to give them fake IDs, and is more a morale coach for them, and an unconventional one at that, as some of her schemes involve some tweaking of the rules, such as going to a blues bar, a funny scene if you can handle Gary's high-pitched drunken jive black ramble, and of course, the party!  she tries to boost their egos into giving them self-respect and self-confidence, and most of all, trying to get accepted for the way they are, rather than what they can do, because yes, having the trappings of popularity is all very well, but if people use them only for that, what's the point?<br />Both Gary and Wyatt are uptight due to the strict morality imposed by their parents.  In fact Gary tells Wyatt that his middle name is Tense.  There is a funny scene involving Gary's parents and Lisa, hair all teased out like an 80's video vixen.  However, Wyatt has a brute of an older brother Chet, a Marines-type with crewcut who takes sadistic pleasure in not only verbal and physically abuse, but extorting money, as he does when he sees Wyatt wearing Lisa's undies.  In this movie, I don't think Chet's comeuppance was good enough--I'd have done a lot more.<br />LeBrock clearly sizzles in this movie, more so than she did in The Woman In Red, and like Jayne Mansfield in The Girl Can't Help It, she's got it.  While the interraction between Anthony Michael Hall (Gary) and Ilan Mitchell Smith (Wyatt) provide for good laughs, she's definitely the catalyst behind the two's transformation.  Despite their creating her, the fact remains that without her, they might as well be stuck in Nerd Quicksand.  In fact LeBrock's presence masks some of the weaker and contrived plot elements and resolutions.<br />And it's interesting to see a very young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian, one of Gary and Wyatt's tormentors.  He would later be reunited with Anthony Michael Hall in Johnny Be Good.  Also, Michael Berryman, the tall bald guy in The Hills Are Alive and the school principle in Motley Crue's \\"Smoking In The Boys' Room\\", makes a small but unconventional appearance.<br />The variation of the Frankenstein monster was never this silly or sexy, although the jejune comedy does appeal to those who were teens during the 80's.  Who knows what kind of woman I'd create if I had a computer with that kind of power, but if I did, the world had better watch out--there'll be a brand new me emerging.brute of an older brother Chet, a Marines-type with crewcut who takes sadistic pleasure in not only verbal and physically abuse, but extorting money, as he does when he sees Wyatt wearing Lisa's undies.

6302994063|5.0|OK, there's been the athletic drama genre done before, right?  The one with the championship finals being the climactic scene?  American Anthem for gymnastics, American Flyers for cycling, and Cutting Edge for skating, to name a few.  Well, right on the one, down on the two, left on the three, up on the four, for Strictly Ballroom takes on the ballroom dancing, as popular in Australia as kangaroos and shrimps on the barbie.<br />Much admired by his peers, family, and members of the ballroom dancing establishment, Scott Hastings is seen as the next big champion of the prestigious Pan Pacific Championship.  His form is superlative, but he's driven by the need to do some crowd-pleasing steps that don't conform to the samba, rhumba, or whatever dance.  As Barry Fife, president of the Australian Dance Federation says, &quot;you can dance anything you like.  That doesn't mean you win.&quot;  Which Scott doesn't, to the fury of his partner, Liz Holt, who ends their partnership.  Scott though, is &quot;sick of doing somebody else's steps all the time.&quot;<br />His dance coach, Les Kendall, owner of the dance academy, his overcontrolling mother, and Barry Fife, i.e. the establishment, want him to toe the line.  His bespectacled and thin father, Doug, isn't that assertive about it, seeming inconspicuous and insignificant, but there are some things about him that don't meet the eye.<br />Fran, a not-too-pretty beginner in the dance class, boldly asks Scott to be his partner for the Pan Pacifics and to dance his way, gutsy as no beginner has the right to approach an open amateur like that.  Fran persists, and as she and Scott practice together, the time lapse shows Fran blossoming, wearing her hair down, her hair turning a lovely dark brown, and we learn she is Portuguese.  The lovely cover of Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Time After Time&quot; in these sequences is sung by Mark Williams and Tara Morice, who plays Fran.  This song really takes a nice romantic edge with its softer production.  The pair later get dancing instructions from Fran's father, who at first looks intimidating, but takes to Scott.<br />However, look at the title, strictly ballroom.  This means rigid conformity with the steps associated with the dance, no fancy steps, which can add life to any old dance.  And there's the cheesy glitz associated, as the corrupt president wants to fix Scott up with Tina Sparkle, a sizzling shallow blonde with a nice fruit costume motif.  After all, &quot;a Pan Pacific champion becomes a hero, a guiding light to all dancers, someone who'll set the right example.&quot;  Translation:  a conformist.<br />Some of the characters who are louder and more garish are annoying, such as Scott's shrewish mother and Liz.  It's characters like Scott, Fran, and Doug who are winning characters, as is Les, who sees potential in Scott:  &quot;You've got a light in you boy.  Let it shine.&quot;<br />When I first saw this in 1994, I had no idea it was directed by Baz Luhrman, known for the notoriously splashy and overdone Moulin Rouge.  As it is, Strictly Ballroom is glitzy but not overdone, with the dancing sequences and costumes topnotch.<br />It may take two to tango, but the tango isn't the only dance, people.  And if you don't want to tango, do the paso doble instead.uction.

0452283760|5.0|If there is any piece of literature that accurately reflects the best in humankind it is this one, and this is done using only one character. It might perhaps be difficult at first to accept that the incredible achievements of the human species could be exemplified in only person, but the author succeeds in doing so in this book, giving the reader a character that is both likeable and very human. Howard Roark stands in clear contrast to the other three in the book, who represent the temporary flaws in human conduct. The character and actions of these other three reflect what is most rare in human experience. Their outlooks and goals are shown in the story to lead to physical or emotional disintegration, a consequence of their sustained efforts to follow paths that deviate from those that are most resonant with the human psyche. The author's message is clear: sustained behavior such as that practiced by these individuals leads to severe dysfunction.<br /> The sly manipulations of Ellsworth Toohey leads to his disgrace; the parasitism of Peter Keating results in his mental breakdown; and the power cravings of Gail Wynand make him powerless. Toohey fails because he overestimates his abilities to charm and mesmerize, and underestimates the power of a mind that cannot be bought, that cannot be corrupted, that is creatively rich and dogmatically rational. Keating fails because he cannot comprehend, and has no understanding, of what it truly takes to achieve greatness. Seduced by fame and recognition, his mind polluted by the pettiness of social climbing and the hitchhiking of another's ideas, he cannot sustain, tragically, any measure of human dignity and self-esteem. Wynand fails because he is seduced by the quantity of his readers and is ultimately fooled by their independence. He gives in to the crippling monster of cynicism, wiping out forever any chance at obtaining the real power of personal integrity and focused intelligence.<br /> Roark succeeds because of his deep awareness and understanding of the essential needs of human experience. Creative accomplishment, originality of ideas and goals, and sustained concentration are the proper tools of the human mind, and like food and water, these cannot be ignored. Roark has penetrating insight into what it means to be really human. He is comfortable with himself and with others who believe the same. He knows that conflict will arise when interacting with those that don't, but he knows that such conflicts are temporary. A mediocre mind cannot compete with a competent one. Deception cannot compete with truth.<br /> Roark stands on his building at the end of the story, and this ending is appropriate. He symbolizes the many in human history who have stood on the  buildings of art, literature, science, philosophy, technology, and music. The names of these individuals don't always get put in the history books, but the impact of their genius is overwhelming. Although they may be unknown, they are not rare, and it is these individuals who move the world.eep awareness and understanding of the essential needs of human experience.

B000065V41|3.0|'The Muppet Christmas Carol' is my favourite of the Muppet movies so you can understand how upset I was to find the DVD version had been edited. What has been taken out I hear you ask? The Song 'When Love is gone.'This song, apart from being a beautifully stunning song, completely makes the scene (Belle tells Ebeneezer that he has made the choice to put his work above her and one day he will regret that decision).I cry almost every time.Granted, the song is played over the credits but that is little comfort. There is still the reprise of the song later in the movie which now doesn't make sense. I was really upset about the lack of one of my favourite songs and I don't think the gag reel special feature quite makes up for it. (Although it is VERY funny.)
0679311718|5.0|Dallaire's book serves to repeatedly illustrate the absolute, complete and utter failure of wealthy Western nations to extend their awareness and interest to the troubles of a tiny nation in the heart of Africa. The result was one of the fastest, most brutal, and shockingly horrific slaughters of human beings in recent memory.<br />While the Rwandan genocide has had much written about it since 1994, this book is particularly meaningful as it comes from the man the United Nations gave the impossible task of trying to stabilize a situation that the international community repeatedly showed it cared little about--especially if it might entail the possibility of peacekeepers losing their lives. Dallaire's tale points out over and over again the fact that the Rwandan tragedy was avoidable, and that nations like the United States and France  had the means and ability to prevent the slaughter of more than 800,000 Rwandans, yet failed to act decisively until after the worst of the slaughter was over.<br />Dallaire's book repeatedly demonstrates that all human beings are not created equal in the minds of the wealthy nations who control the UN Security Council, and that while they may be quick to react when their own economic or political interests are at stake, they are quite willing to turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the plight of millions of impoverished people throughout the Third World should their own equations of &quot;humanitarian&quot; assistance not be satisfied. Dallaire provides as evidence a conversation he'd had with a US military officer who indicated that at least 85,000 Rwandans would have to die before the US could justify losing just one of its soldiers to the job of restoring peace and order. I cannot believe that anyone who claims membership in the human race could not be sickened by such a cruel and racist mathematics.

B0000X61UU|5.0|Finally my very favorite workout has been released on DVD!! It's about time!   In this Cindy  workout follow up, Cindy has left her Hollywood glam behind and is showing us the real deal. She has very little makeup and her hair is pulled back plainly and she looks like the rest of us during a workout.  I like that.  The non -nonsense, straight shooting workout will leave you sore and breathless.  Her trainer Radu is the mastermind behind all the exercises and coaches her as she does them.  My videotape copy finally broke from too much play!  I used it right after I had my twins, and it was the only one I could stick with.  Interesting sets, music and writing. There's a comprehensive, well-paced selection of weight training, conditioning, aerobics and stretching.  It will take you about an hour and a half to do the whole thing. I can't recommend it highly enough. Thanks for bringing it out on DVD.   I have pre-ordered it and have sent the link to all my friends who are still using the video.
B0000026DJ|4.0|Like many people in France and worldwide, I discovered Midnight Oil through this FM-band killer released in 1987.<BR>\\"Beds are burning\\" and \\"The Dead Heart\\" became instant classics, the other highlights including the catchies \\"Dreamworld\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" as well as the atmospheric \\"Put down that weapon\\" (my personal favorite!).<BR>You can still hear some of these tunes on the radio today...<br />     With its fine instrumental arrangements (electric & acoustic guitars, harmonicas...), intelligent and committed lyrics, \\"Diesel and Dust\\" established the Oil's as one of the most popular band of that time, although it sold few copies compared to its Aussies counterparts AC/DC and INXS...<br />     Yet it revealed a talented and charismatic frontman: Peter Garrett. With an incredible presence and his cutting voice, this last brings an awesome punk/heavy-metal touch to the songwriting!<br />     Included in the great Oil's period (1982-90), this album is on my mind one of their best release at that day!

B000088E6M|1.0|Ugh man this album is horrible. I heard his mix tapes and cds and loved it so when i heard he was coming out on The Legendary Dr.Dre &amp; Legendary Eminem's new record label i was excited but its stupid i never expected it to turn out like this i wonder if EM &amp; Dre plained it to be this bad or did he use all his good lyrics and punchlines on the mix tapes. the only tight cuts are #2, which is so short,# 3 only because EM and # 4 he was at least tryin to be deep and serious. the rest was commerial bubble gum hip-pop or just ok which is not acceptable  for the guy they said was the next B.I.G or 2PAC.
B000056K04|2.0|I tried to like this album.  I really did.  But it just never got there.  No matter how much I listened to it, the music couldn't live up to what I know DMB can do.  It's not even good pop.  It's just not.  I own plenty of DMB.  If you want a good album, buy Busted Stuff.  If you want some great insight, try Some Devil and the special CD available wtih it (some of Dave Matthews' best yet), but don't waste your money on this one.  If this album is your intro to DMB, you will never buy anything else, and that would be a shame.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|Matrix (the original) had a good ending. The Wachowski brothers should've kept it that way. Matrix Reloaded (and Revolutions) is nothing but a vain attempt to squeeze the last dollar out of the glory and goodname of the original.<br />The Matrix (Episode I) was a watershed in the film industry. It had everything going for it: great direction, strong characters, great Kung-fu sequences unbelievably believable special effects, stimulating music, great (albeit scientifically inacurate) story line. And the concept of the Matrix, in itself was thought provoking.<br />In stark contrast, Reloaded has nothing going for it. The plot is stale, the freeze-frame action sequences are not so much fun the second time around, and most disapointingy, there are no strong characters in this film.<br />This is the same Neo, the same Morpheus and the very same Trinity who act in this film, but all three characters, together with the whole cast somehow seem artificial; much like the romance between Neo and Trinity.<br />If you are a Matrix believer, but have never watched Reloaded, then DON'T. For you will surely lose faith.
B000031WD9|4.0|When American Pie came out, many saw it due to its explicit focus on sex.  It was a coming of age movie, but its focus certainly was on a recent new phenomena that has grown: many young boys have been willing to focus on having sex and accomplish it in any possible way.  The tale of four boys who make a \\"deal\\" to get laid sounds a bit strange considering that 1) there is no way to authenticate that such an event has transpired; 2) typically, sex is a private matter, and why would you want anyone else to know what you've been doing?<br />Of course men and women have spoken about sex to their peers since human civilization began.  What changes this is that instead of talking about what is occuring presently, this film focuses on future sexual behavior.  There's a deal to make it happen, which is a bit odd.  I think the problem with the film is that by focusing on sex to the exclusion of anything else, it showcases how superficial our generation has become.<br />Although I did like the film, and thought many parts of it were funny, I couldn't help but feel a bit creepy about the idea of telling a friends that I would be making this deal to make sure that I would have sex before the end of the summer.  Sex is an emotional connection with someone else, and to rush it simply to keep a deal going is a bit bizarre.<br />Perhaps the most interesting character in the film is Jim's dad, who just happens to enter into each scene at the worst possible moment.  He enters the scene usually when sex is about to happen, thus complicating Jim's life.  Ha--isn't that how it happens in real life, too?<br />Michael Gordon<br />Los Angeles
B0000TB014|1.0|Yes! The songs are great; but if you are one of the 46 million people who purchased Thriller and the millions of other people who bought MJs other discs then this is really not for you. When a superstar puts out a no-frills CD; something is wrong. MJ could have mixed this togeter in his basement one night in twenty minutes.
B00003CXMG|4.0|A tale of a young boy, William Miller, who lies about his age and finds a way to interview rockstars for Rolling Stones magazine.  Along the way he finds himself immersed (&quot;imbedded&quot;?) into the counterculture of rock n' roll.  No longer a journalist, he now is one of the band--sort of.  While he does not play with the band, you get a sense that little Miller is overwhelmed with joy at the prospect at following the band into their VIP hideaways--including hotels, houses, bars--everywhere.<br />The movie also provides an aspiring message to those who aspire to reach the heights of their career--whatever it may be: if you truly have the talent, it really has nothing to do with age or experience.  In America, the story tells us, merit is what is important.  Who cares if the boy is 15?  He's able to carry out the duties of someone twice his age.  Yet in our society we typically would choose the more experienced or older person.  That is the wrong approach . . . instead, choose the best person for the job.  An aspiring movie.<br />Michael Gordon<br />Los Angeles
B000002GXJ|5.0|If only for Meisner's incredible self-induced harmonic at the very end of &quot;Take it to the Limit&quot; this is a real gem.  Yes, some of the songs seem uninspired but most are truly terrific.  This has my favorite recording of &quot;Life in the fast lane&quot; and &quot;Saturday night.&quot;  And the audience's reaction to hearing &quot;Wasted time&quot; for the first time is genuine and moving.  Few &quot;live&quot; recordings are this great.
B00008N6N5|3.0|There certainly is a political bias in the film.  Yes, the film does appear to actively celebrate pornography within our society by honoring Larry Flyntt as a \\"hero\\" of the First Amendment.  However, the film is actually done in a fairly entertaining way, showcasing who Larry Flyntt is -- without any attempt to cover up his most well-known distusting publications, including the woman being pushed into the meat grinder.  The story focuses on Larry Flyntt's case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hustler v. Falwell, which dealt with the First Amendment case related to whether Larry Flyntt had the right to publish a pictorial representation of religious icon Jerry Falwell having sexual relations with his mother, in an outhouse (of all places!) with the description, \\"Falwell's first time.\\"  The issue in the case is whether one is able to defame Falwell, a public figure, if people clearly would understand that the ad is false.<br />Clearly, Falwell would never have enganged in such behavior.  The U.S. Supreme Court said that Flyntt could publish such material because no one would believe that Falwell would do that, and thus, he received no harm.<br />The irony is that the movie, while called The People v. Larry Flyntt, is simply not true, because the dispute between Falwell and Flyntt was a civil, not criminal, issue.  Now Flyntt has been subject to obscenity prosecutions, too, but that is not the subject of this movie.  Overall, the movie is well done and and quite entertaining, too.<br />Michael Gordon<br />Los Angeles
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Whatever happened to the bubblegum pop? And why does everyone hate it so much? Why does everyone use this review column to write hate messages about britney? I bet most of them wouldn't have listened to a minute of her album. It's good but not the best. I'd stick to her old albums which are great. And why does everyone have to hate to admit they're britney fans?<BR>But it's a good CD overall, not britney style. If you're an old fan who's not 'growing up with her' you'll find it a disappointment like I did.<BR>But I suggest you to buy the CD because overall it is good and great dance CD.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD has it all...sentimental, edgy, popular, traditional.  Whenever I go back to his CD after listening to any other male singer, I am continually blown away by the strength of his voice, but also the restraint and different places he has taken his voice.  I think at least half of these songs deserve to be top 10's.  I'm only sorry for the people who do not buy the Internet version with all 17 songs.  The 4 add-ons area incredible and a new direction for Josh.  WOW!

I love every song but like 2 on it- that is pretty good I really like Toxic, and Early Mornin'- it is just pumpy - it is not like any of her other cds which I enjoyed - I would really buy this- With Britney you have a lot of haters that haven't really listened to the CD- so believe me I am sooo glad I bought this one!!!!!!
6304698798|5.0|While I still find Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in The West to be his best and most morally complex western  (it's also the only spaghetti western that had footage shot in the United States in Monument Valley a classic John Ford setting), The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is certainly one of his most entertaining and interesting westerns.<br />I'm not going to recap the plot beyond saying that the trio of main characters featured here (well played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach)form an unholy alliance to recover confederate gold. All three manage to cross and double cross each other and while Eastwood's Man With No Name character may be the \\"good\\" of the title, he's by no means the type of hero you would find in a John Ford or Howard Hawks western.<br />The picture looks very nice on this DVD single disc release but (I may have a disc that is flawed) the deleted scenes have no audio. It says it features the original Italian audio but, in fact, the sequences are silent (which would explain why Eastwood and Wallach went back to redub the restored version released this year). When you do hit the audio button on your DVD remote it does say the soundtrack is the Italian version but, again, there's nothing to hear. The sound is so-so and that's not a surprise given that the original soundtrack was in mono and it would be very difficult to locate the original source audio for a digital remix for true 5.1.<br />If you're a fan of the film and can find this at a bargain, by all means pick it up. If not, wait until the restored version that Scorese worked on is released on DVD. Since that will include the 16 minutes of footage missing from the film with redubbed dialog by Eastwood and Wallach, that version would be the must have for fans of the film. I'm hoping that MGM is planning on releasing this fairly soon (much like they did with the restored Escape from New York which which is being released in December of 2003)as a two disc set with all the extras the film deserves.<br />One of the criticisms about the film is that it doesn't capture the true flavor of the old west (don't recall who wrote the review). That's not a surprise given that the film was made by an Italian film director with a love of American westerns. Leone's films are self reflective--by that I mean they are films about other films [...] You only have to watch this film and Once Upon a Time in The West to get this sense; there's references to a number of classic westerns in either film including The [...]other major and minor classic films.<br />Leone was interested in using the American archetypes created by [...] and other American film directors and bringing a sense of irony and cynicism. The films exhibit a European flavor and that's to be expected. Most importantly, Leone helped spark the interest in reviving westerns by American film directors. The western had largely fallen out of favor. Without Leone's trilogy there would have been no High Plains Drifted, The Outlaw Josey Wales or any number of mid-60's westerns.<br />Eastwood later refined Leone's vision with a uniquely American perspective in the classic films High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Unforgiven. This cross pollenation of European art western and American pulp western gave new life to a genre that had played itself out by the early 60's. Every so often a film director comes along to breath new life into a dying genre.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Once Upon a Time in the West is a classic epic western that can be watched repeatedly and still the viewer finds something new everytime.  The movie tells the story of the railroad as it moves farther west.  A widow, Jill McBain, owns much of the land where the train will go through, but she is being pursued by a ruthless railroad official and his sadistic gunman to give up the land.  At the same time, a mysterious gunman shows up seeking revenge, but we don't know why until the very end.  This classic spaghetti western blends familiar storylines from past westerns but gives it a new spin.  Director Sergio Leone uses his usual extreme close-ups and wide shots perfectly throughout.  The opening sequence with three gunmen, Woody Strode, Jack Elam, and Al Mulock, waiting for Bronson to arrive is classic cinema.  For almost ten minutes there is no dialogue, but there is so much there with the natural sounds of the scene.  This is a great movie, not just a great western, that gets better with every viewing.<br />  Claudia Cardinale gets top billng as the widow Jill McBain, a rarity in spaghetti westerns.  Besides being incredibly beautiful with her big brown eyes, Cardinale can act and is very good here.  Henry Fonda gives one of his most startling performances as the sadistic gunman, Frank, who is trying to drive Jill off her land.  His introduction is one of the most surprising scenes in movie history.  Charles Bronson gives one of his best performances as Harmonica, the gunman seeking revenge for unknown reasons.  Jason Robards is equally good as the outlaw, Cheyenne, who joins up with Harmonica to save Jill.  The movie also stars Gabrielle Ferzetti, Frank Wolff, Keenan Wynn, Lionel Stander, Woody Strode, Jack Elam, and Al Mulock.  The two disc DVD is truly great.  It offers a cleaned up widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, three documentaries about the making of the movie, a featurette about the railroad, a then and now gallery of movie locations, and a stillgallery of on production photos.  MGM did a great job in releasing this fantastic DVD.  Once Upon a Time in the West is a great movie that fully deserves this great DVD release.  If you haven't seen it, I fully recommend buying it.  Check out Once Upon a Time in the West!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Firstly let me say I loved the first 2 movies and the special effects are wonderful. The problem is the plot seems to be to take T2 make the bad terminator a she instead of a he. Throw in a few good special effects, and some very very bad jokes, which should of  been cut on final editing and call yourself T3. It never seems to reach the drama of T2, the jokes are old and the plot recycled. I gave it 4 stars because of the special effects and that I love the other movies in the series.

B000002UB3|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan for a while now, and the interesting thing with their music is the fact that as many times as you hear it, you never get sick of it. I used to listen to other bands (Metalica, Floyd, Chili Peppers) but only for a month or so, and then this empty feeling would take over and that's when I would switch to another band. But not with the Beatles, every song takes you on a journy of emotions, feelings, moods, joys and happiness. Abbey Road exemplifies this. If amplifies the warmest feelings one could have and channels it through your entire body. The sad thing is, after hearing the album, you get depressed until you listen to it again, wanting that tingling feeling to come back. And it does... every time!
B00000DHR0|5.0|Known for her chest-thumping excess, Celine Dion was a Vegas act waiting to happen.  I always thought:  If she could reign it in, if she could be more adult and sophisticated and less little-girl, she could make a masterpiece.  It never happened.  Her string of best-selling albums is marred by schmaltz and distracting vocal pyrotechnics.<br />Her &quot;At Last&quot; lacks soul.  Her &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; tries too hard to impress.  But here's her masterpiece:  a freakin' Christmas album!  The newly penned songs, by heavyweights like Diane Warren and David Foster, stand up to the more traditional material better than expected.<br />As for her takes on well-worn traditional favorites:  &quot;O Holy Night&quot; is dazzling.  A carol which calls for feathery lushness in its verses and belt-out power in its chorus plays to Celine's strengths.  Dion's version of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; might have had Elvis churning in his grave, but she gives a restrained jazz-smoke performance.  &quot;God Bless Us Everyone&quot; is majestic without becoming excessive.  And her rendition of Gounod's haunting &quot;Ave Maria&quot; is staggeringly beautiful; it makes me wonder if an album of classical or sacred music wouldn't be a fine idea for the Canook soprano.<br />All in all, a classic for the holidays or anytime.  Up there with the Carpenters' and Streisand's classic holiday albums, yes.  But don't pigeonhole too much; pull it out in July as well to hear Celine Dion blow her other albums away.
B00008DYQA|5.0|What a masterpiece!  I think my jaw was open through the whole film.  Maggie and James gave compelling and believable performances.

So, keep your mind open and enjoy!

B00005JKZU|3.0|If movies like Gladiator, Braveheart and maybe Star Wars are among your very favorites, you can put The Two Towers (as well as the Fellowship of the Ring)  right up there with the best big budget, action-adventure epics. If, on the other hand, like me, you are more of a fanatic for the Tolkien books, you may not be quite as thrilled with the films. The Two Towers is unsurpassed for special effects, action (especially battle scenes), costumes and scenery. The acting is fine and it follows the book fairly well. As far as being true to the spirit and atmosphere of the book, however, it falls short. As I see it, The Lord of the Rings is a fantasy adventure that is really about Middle Earth, a world where magic is real. Although the War for the Ring is the central plot feature, it is actually secondary to the overall feeling Tolkien evokes from his vivid descriptions of Middle Earth and its diverse inhabitants. The film, meanwhile, is primarily about the war, and the magic and colorful creatures are reduced to the essential (but ultimately expendable) roles they have to play, such as heroes and villains. As for the War itself, I think that Tolkien had a sense of historical events such as wars similar to Tolstoy, as expressed in War and Peace. This is a sense that it's not necessarily the great and mighty who determine the course of events, but sometimes the seemingly less important folk, as well as random chance. Proof of this is that the most important characters, in terms of the final outcome, are the hobbits and Gollum (who, btw, is brilliantly portrayed in the films). Yet, the Two Towers, which focuses on battle scenes more than anything else, approaches the war in the traditional, Hollywood, gung-ho spirit, with Aragorn and Gandalf (and sometimes even the Hobbits), often rallying the troops to bravery and heroism. Not that the book does not contain bravery and heroism, but it's more subtle and nuanced than in the film. There are a couple of sequences that stand out for me as significant, if relatively minor, departures from the novel. One is where Faramir, the brother of the slain Boromir, is tempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. In the book, Faramir is a wise man who is never really tempted to take the ring, but in the film, it is the hobbits who must teach Faramir a lesson. Along similar lines, the Ents in the film, while beautifully rendered, come across as somehow less wise than in the book. Tolkien portrays the Ents, along with Tom Bombadil (who is entirely left out of the films) as the oldest and wisest creatures of Middle Earth. In the film, they are seen as a bit comical and seemingly in need of instruction from the Hobbits. This indicates the need of mainstream filmmakers to always make the central characters the wisest and bravest, while Tolkien himself had a more complex outlook. I am not stressing these points because I didn't enjoy the film --it is undeniably very entertaining. It does not quite, however, capture the uniqueness of Middle Earth as seen by Tolkien.for me as significant, if relatively minor, departures from the novel.

0688163173|4.0|This whole story deserves a five star rating but for the ending. I guess in some peoples' opinions that is where the real brilliance lies, but to  people like myself I don't like untidy endings. I could not put the book down, no doubt about it. I was consumed by it, just like all his novels. When I reached the last page I had to reread it because I could not believe it. I felt cheated somehow because I could not understand it. Who am I fooling? I was just plain angry. I wanted a different ending. Now, looking back, I realize that perhaps I was wrong. I am still thinking about this book that I read almost 4 months ago! How many books stay with us like that? It may be a little like the \\"Twilight Zone\\" but this book makes an impression, and is not that a sign of a great novel?
1551114763|5.0|I am not going to review the Charles Dickens novel 'A Christmas Carol' in this review. I did that already (see my other reviews to read that), and, of course, I gave it 5 stars.<br />What I'd like to comment on is the extra's this version brings. For instance, the original art work from the first edition by artist John Leech are here, placed where they were originally. There are also the actual 1843 and 1844 critics reviews in this book so one can see what was originally thought about this classic at the time of its release.<br />Author Richard Kelly gives his perspective on the reasoning behind Dickens writing this ghostly Christmas story - the why's and wherefore's of the characters and scenes, which, for me, gave a little more of an understanding of what may have been going through Mr. Dickens mind at the time.<br />Mr. Kelly also writes a bit on child labor, education, and the workhouse, which, again, opens the mind a bit more in reading this story.<br />There is also a chapter that has many writings by Dickens contemporaries, such as Washington Irving, and their own descriptions of Christmas in their time.<br />Believe it or not, there is quite a bit more in this book than what I've told you, including, of course, &quot;Carol&quot; itself. It makes a very interesting read and can help one to understand the purpose behind Dickens original classic, as well as of the times in which he wrote.<br />A lot to read at a very good price. There are many many versions of 'A Christmas Carol' available, but this one takes it a bit further than most.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I was already in love with the original version of &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; but now, this extended version has insured that I will never go back to the original ever again.  The additional 40 minutes really brings more out of the movie and transforms it into something magnificent.  &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Special Extended Edition)&quot; is a must-have for anyone who was a big fan of the original version but wanted a little more.<br />Once again, I was amazed with the added footage.  Even the smallest differences are able to bring out the most from the film.  One of the great things about this edition is that we get to see more of the Hobbits (which the story is supposed to be centered around in the first place).  Seeing more of Frodo and Sam, and Merry and Pippin' was a great way to balance the film with action and drama (I'm always more interested in seeing what's going on with the Hobbits, anyway).  The smallest differences are very noticeable and tie up some of the loose ends that were presented in the original.<br />What really stands out to me the most in this film are not the epic battle scenes (although they are extremely fantastic and perfectly executed).  No, what stands out to me the most in this movie is the relationship between Frodo and Sam.  &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is a much darker film than the first one, and the cinematography does an exceptional job of establishing this.  We really begin to see Frodo lose himself more and more to the Ring.  We fear it because we know what is has done to Gollum.  In fact, one of the most touching scenes (even though this wasn't an additional scene; it appears in the original) is when Frodo tells Sam that he wants to help him.  When Sam asks why, Frodo somberly replies, &quot;Because I have to believe that he can come back.&quot;  This is a crucial moment in the story, because Frodo is slowly beginning to realize what the Ring is doing to him, and if he isn't careful, he will end up exactly like Gollum.  Also, if Gollum can't come back, then Frodo knows there's no way he can ever help himself out of the darkness as well.  Seeing more of Frodo and Sam really does make the film that much better, or at least that's the way I see it.<br />The four-disk set is loaded with extras, featuring a number of documentaries.  One in particular stands out (I believe it is the second one on the third disk) because it features the director and writers going into great detail to explain why things were changed, moved around, or removed altogether.  And I have to admit, a lot of it made sense.  There were just some things in the books that would not have translated as well onto film.  So, I highly recommend that fans of the books or films check out that particular documentary.  Commentaries are also featured as well as a very neat &quot;Easter Egg&quot; on the first disk (hint: look deeper into the &quot;scene selection&quot; page).

B000002JEV|4.0|This cd is an example of Led Zeppelin's deeply rooted blues origins. The first cd contains 3 very different versions of Communication Breakdown, the 1st is a little more bluesy and it slows down in the middle w/ Plant wailing out &quot;Squeze My Lemon&quot;, the 2nd has a very good guitar solo, the 3rd has an even better guitar solo and more improvosation. The cd also has 2 versions of I can't quit you baby,in the 1st Page is in top form which works hand in hand w/ Plant's new lyrics it's a very cool song, the opening of version #2 is in stark contrast to the first w/ a longer guitar solo and John Bonham's mastery of the drums is very apparent here. The 2 very different versions of You Shook Me are awesome. But Dazed and Confused falls a little short despite new lyrics(very good drums though). The 3 new songs are very cool, displaying Led's versatility that made Their live performances so good. The new Whole Lotta Love is much better than the original. Now the 2nd cd was abit of a disapointment compared to How The West Was Won,but Going To California and That's the Way were superb. As was the longer version of Whole Lotta Love Which was better than How The West Was Won's version. This is one of the best Led Zeppelin albums I have.
B000003489|5.0|I'm a simple man, I never took music classes or learned to read music or play an instrument, nor am I a pseudo-intellectual latte swigging baboon.  With that said, I can't dazzle you all with fancy  talk of time signatures and pentatonic scales.  But I certainly know good music when I hear it, and John Coltrane is good, folks.  If you're reading this, I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you didn't already know, because Coltrane is required reading for any jazz fan.  I just needed to put my praise in with everyone else though.  Less than one minute after popping this cd in for the first time, I nearly puked in my pants(and that's a good thing for me)!  I really love the sound of the saxophone, and Coltrane milks the sax for all it's worth.....and then some.  I know the sax is fingernails on a chalkboard for some people, so I wouldn't recommend this to you if you're one of those folks.  But if you like the squealing sax or just good uppity jazz music in general, this is the way to go.  I know I'm a bit crude, and heavy on the comma, but I'm not gonna steer y'all wrong.  Could so many positive reviewers be wrong?

B00004Z459|2.0|This album shows what can happen when several radio stations and mtv gets a hold of your music.  This was just an ok cd a while back.  This cd is a poor bland of music.  The whining screams and rapping do not go well together.  On top of that, three of their songs were played almost nonstop on the radio.  Yes, it does get very annoying.  And that is what happened to this cd.  This band most reminds me of Limb Bizkit.  The new style of music attracts listeners and then they get overplayed and eventually just turn to rap.  Or are never even thought of in 10 years.  If you are a big fan of rap/ nu metal you might like this cd.

B00008DDXC|5.0|As far as sequels go this is excellent, I hope any subsequent Harry Potter movies will remain as good. And it's certainly deserving of 5 stars! Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart, who is incredibly self-absorbed. A celebrity among magic folk, as the author of many books about his adventures. And he was also nominated the man with the most charming smile, five times. The kids are visibly growing up, especially the boys, they're taller and their voices are deeper. The script and acting is wonderful. And the film is as touching as the first one. With some scary moments, involving giant spiders and a huge serpent. And many funny bits too, Kenneth Branagh has a knack for comedy.<br /> Before Harry can go to Hogwarts for his second year, a house elf shows up in his room and warns him not to go. He tries his best to sabotage Harry's return but, Harry does make it back thanks to Ron and the Weasleys. He stays with them at their cozy house. It doesn't take long for trouble to start, back at school. There are a series of attacks, accompanied by graffitie talking about how The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Professor McGonegall relates the story behind the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden chamber somewhere at the school, built by one of the founders of the school, Salazar Slytherin, founder of the Slytherin house. He was a diapprover of mixed blood students learning the magic arts, so called \\"mud bloods\\" who have muggle parents. Hermione's parents are both muggles, and Draco Malfoy has a particular contempt for her. His father, Lucius, who is even nastier is introduced. The chamber supposedly harbours a monster, and now the monster is on the prowl. It attacks by petrifying it's victims, the first one being Mrs Norris, Mr. Glich's cat. The cure for petrification is a potion made of Mandrake root, and Mrs Sprout's, the Herbs teacher's batch of Mandrake hasn't matured yet. Harry must save the school, before the teachers declare it unsafe and send all the students home. And for Harry Hogwarts, is home.
038572179X|4.0|I have heard the endless buzz about this book, so I finally decided to find out if what most people were saying was true. In truth this book does start off slow, but the imagery Mr. McEwan uses makes up for any parts that tend to drag, he writes with such beautiful language that it is hard to not get caught up in Brionys fantasys and the pure panic from Robbie. McEwan uses a technique, that I find sometimes fails in novels such as these,he uses different voices for each charachter and it is one of the many great things about his wonderful novel. But because of the use of different voices, it is hard to stay sympathetic to one character the whole time. This novel is extremely well written and you will probably want to read it agai, but if you find it a tedious read you probably wont finish it or never read it agian. The novel has a strong plot that is easy to follow, and if you enjoy this novel check out Ian McEwan's other books.
B000002NHN|5.0|There was one track of hers on the Celtic Chillout collection. It was \\"The Mummers' Dance\\", an extraordinary track. I have just purchased a pre-release promotional CD of The Book Of Secrets, from which the aforementioned track comes from. The whole album is extraordinary.<br />There is so much to write about this album that if I tried to express everything I wanted to say, I would lose myself in an ever-decreasing spiral. Let's just say that Ms McKennitt has a very beautiful and original voice, the subjects of her compositions are varied to say the least; there are lots of influences which show themselves in the lyrics and the melodies; the musicianship is truly masterful and she has produced a near-perfect album.This is an exemplary album and a good way to get into Ms McKennitts brand of Celtic music - as I have. One can only wonder why it has taken me so long to find out about her.

Spirited Away is the tale of a pre-teen girl searching for her own identity and finds herself through her adventures in an abandoned theme park transformed into a land of spirits and gods.  It is magical, insightful and humorous, all at once!  The art, the music, the dialogue are all memorable.  A fantastic film for ages 8-88.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|&quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; Darren Aronofsky's film version of Hubert Selby's 1978 novel of the same name, will definitely attain cult status in coming years. Selby's story about a quartet of drug addicts employs a highly unorthodox literary style of slang, omitted punctuation, and run-on sentences that stretch for miles. Director Aronofsky echoed the novel with a host of unusual techniques for the movie version: fast editing, bizarre camera angles, and nightmarish effects created a riveting and nervous film that is grimly effective in conveying the horrors of addiction. Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connolly, Marlon Wayans, and Jared Leto; &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; will leave a lasting impression on anyone who takes the time to view it. As much as I enjoyed the film, I read the book before I saw the film and it is my opinion that the book does a much better job of delving into the personal torments of each of the major characters. The reason is simple: no film trumps a good book. Some pictures come close, but no movie ever made can compete with the power of your imagination. Still, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; comes amazingly close to fully realizing Selby's bleak visions.<br />&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; tracks the rise and eventual fall of Harry Goldfarb, his mother Sara, his girlfriend Marion, and friend Tyrone as all four individuals indulge in addictive substances and behaviors. For Harry, Marion, and Tyrone the problem is heroin. For Sara Goldfarb, her initial drug of choice is television followed by a particularly nasty encounter with diet pills. Throughout the first part of the film, all four see their lives radically improved by drugs. Harry and Marion meet and build a relationship through drug use and make tentative plans to run their own small business. Moreover, Harry can forget about the pain of his father's death. His friend Tyrone discovers the same sort of benefit as he tries to forget about his deceased mother. Things really take off for the trio when Harry and Tyrone buy a large quantity of heroin and make a bundle of money selling the stuff to local junkies. Sara Goldfarb's addictions are more insidious and ultimately more devastating. Shattered by the death of her husband, she spends her days ensconced in her apartment watching smarmy infomercial programs and eating sweets. When Sara receives a phone call offering her a chance to appear on one of these television programs, her elation knows no bounds. Recognizing her burgeoning weight presents a potential problem, Goldfarb visits a quack to obtain diet pills. Within a few days, things couldn't be better as her hunger pangs disappear and she loses enough weight to almost fit into her old red dress. Any day now that application for her television appearance will arrive in the mail and Sara will be the toast of her apartment building.<br />All good things must come to an end, and in the world of drug addiction that end is often a fate worse than death. What started out as a recreational activity for Harry, Marion, and Tyrone soon turns into a hardcore addiction. Waking up in the morning with the shakes is the first sign of real trouble, but the trio continually reassures themselves that they are merely experiencing a small bump on the road to their dreams. Soon, serious fractures appear between the three when the heroin supply on the streets of New York mysteriously dries up. Withdrawal effects and the high price of existing supplies of heroin soon force painful decisions. Harry allows Marion to pay a &quot;special&quot; visit to her former psychologist in order to obtain a few hundred dollars. Meanwhile, Harry and Tyrone spend their time roaming the blasted landscapes of New York City in search of supply, and since it is the middle of winter the two often endure frigid conditions with little hope of success. When Harry gets the brilliant idea to take their meager funds and drive to Florida in search of heroin and Marion sells her mind and her body for drugs, you know the end is near. Sara Goldfarb's descent into madness begins when the diet pills no longer quash her desire for food. Even worse, the application she filled out is in limbo. As the hope of appearing on television fades with each passing day, Sara doubles her daily dose of the pills in a last ditch effort to lose those last few pounds. All of the characters' agonies are brilliantly executed onscreen, but Sara's is absolutely soul shattering in its intensity.<br />The performances elevate &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; above the usual &quot;drug&quot; message film. Especially noteworthy is Ellen Burstyn in the role of Sara Goldfarb. Talk about disappearing in a role! This fine actress should have won an Oscar for her metamorphosis from a rather harmless soul into a quaking, sweating wreck lurching through the streets of New York in her tattered red dress. Her monologue to Harry about why she takes the pills to lose weight brought tears to my eyes. Just when you think Sara Goldfarb cannot possibly sink further into the depths of despair, Aronofsky piles on even more indignities.<br />&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is not a film for the faint of heart, but if you really want to view it in all of its splendor the director's cut DVD is the version to get. Included on the disc are plenty of extras: a commentary from Aronofsky, deleted scenes, an interview of Hubert Selby conducted by Ellen Burstyn, production notes, and a behind the scenes documentary. A powerful film not easily banished from the mind, I certainly hope that those who watch this picture follow through and read the book. Selby's novel, which does a few things the movie does not, is even more harrowing in its subject matter.nd her body for drugs, you know the end is near.

B0000DJZA5|1.0|Well, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this &quot;new&quot; Beatles album and I was supremely disappointed. At a mere 35 minutes, Sir Paul must be laughing his arse off at us poor saps who shelled out our money for this light-weight version of the previous Let It Be album.<br />When compared to the aforementioned disc, this one pales. The Phil Spector version turned a mess into a nice-sounding, solid record. This one simply sounds like unfinished demos. <br />Save your money. If you don't have Let It Be, buy it. If you do, don't waste your money on this useless (yet another) Sir Paul ego trip.<br />Roberta
B000053VAZ|5.0|A  mechanic, Benny(Aiden Quinn) who has a mentally disabled sister, Joon(Mary Stuart Masterson) is a fed up with her unpredictable behavior, she's always causing trouble and making the house-sitters quit, he's been taking care of her needs so long, he's forgotten his own needs and loss touch with the world a little. Finally when Sam(Johnny Depp) is put in the pot at a poker game, and Joon loses, he has to keep him over for his friend at his house for the indefinitely. Sam is an eccentric guy who is a crazy clownish man who cannot read or write well, and seems completely incapable of living in reality.<br /><br /> Somehow, while fairly unrealistic, this premise works, it's script is consistently funny and while the premise itself seems unrealistic, the characters are always rooted in reality, and each actors performance roots the characters firmly in the real world.  The choices the characters make seem real given their circumstances, and nobody in the script has the moral high ground the entire film, it seems to shift and change constantly.<br /><br />  Mary Stuart Masterson gives a truly Oscar worthy performance, it is a role that so easily could have been overdone, but having seen what mental illness does to people, the way she acts and reacts is 100% real, he performance is not histrionic, it is very much rooted in reality, if it was not, this would just be another mediocre early 1990's effort on mental illness.  Aiden Quinn and Julianne Moore are the most normal characters in the movie, but each of them have to make considerably difficult choices, and their characters are handled very admirably.  Watching Johnny Depp here is astounding, he says more with his eyes than with his words in most shots, he doesn't need to speak at all, and his character is fairly quiet compared to everyone else, but when he does open his mouth to speak the dialogue is often either hilarious or heartbreaking.  He also should have been nominated for an Oscar for this role, it has not diminished at allover time,  the physical comedy which is modeled after Buster Keaton is just as hilarious and entertaining as it was 20 plus years ago (it is now 2016).<br /><br />Some people may complain about what big explanation as to why Joon is the way she is, there are hints here and there, but there is no easy answer, nor does it spell out what he illness is, which in to turn makes this film applicable and relateable to anyone with a mental illness.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amytime,  the physical comedy which is modeled after Buster Keaton is just as hilarious and entertaining as it was 20 plus years ago (it is now 2016).

0385504209|1.0|I couldn't make it past chapter three.This has to be the worst written book i've ever read.The dialogue is especially awful.Dan Brown has absolutely no idea how people really talk.How this book got to be such a big seller is beyond me.Go read some Alan Furst or Robert Wilson instead.
B00000AFHM|3.0|I can't count how many times I have listened to &quot;If you're feeling sinister&quot;. If you are a Belle and Sebastian fan, you know that most of their songs are written and sung by Stuart Murdoch. Arab Strap is a compilation of songs from all the band members, and in my opinion, it takes away from their sound. While the other bandmembers are all fantastic, they are part of a band, and Murdoch is the songwriter. A failed experimentation, but definetly worth buying.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney Spears' &quot;In The Zone&quot; was one album I was truly looking forward to this year.  Being a fan of hers for years, I purchased &quot;In The Zone&quot; looking for a &quot;Britney.&quot;  What I found was completely different than anything I've ever heard her release.  The only mature aspect of the album are the lyrics.  I really resent the fact that people rag on Brit's voice.  Yes, she doesn't have the greatest voice, but there are a lot of singers that don't either (Madonna, Jason Mraz, etc.).  I believe she is a studio singer, not a live singer.  Some of the album's best tracks include: Toxic (I swear this song has to have a sample in it), Everytime (a beautiful ballad that is highly underrated), Shadow, Breathe On Me (reminicent of Kylie Minogue), and Showdown.  The other songs are catchy, but lyrically, pretty shallow (Outrageous is one of R. Kelly's weakest efforts; Brave New Girl sounds as though it belongs on the Legally Blonde soundtrack; Boom Boom I would love without the Ying Yang Twins).  I'm not sure why there is a remix of Me Against the Music, it is really not necessary.  Overall, the album is a catchy dance album, but without much substance.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I was totally bored by this movie.  I left in the middle of it, and I usually really like musicals.  I don't get what the big deal is, and why everybody loves it.  Lord of the Rings should've gotten most of the awards Chicago did.  It's not worth your time.
B000059HB7|5.0|Great action. Great laughs. Great singing.  Watch this movie and you will know why they are stars.
B00006JLX4|4.0|Hard to believe how I completely missed this album a decade ago; I was a big Smashing Pumpkins fan, for what it's worth.  So, I won't gush about how this band &quot;changed my life&quot;, &quot;redefined Indie Rock&quot;, blah blah blah.<br />As a new listener, yes, this is good lo-fi rock, and I can see how it has influenced later bands, though it doesn't approach the lo-fi pure pop joy of GBV's &quot;Bee Thousand&quot;, in my opinion.   I give four stars mainly for the value-- 2 long cds and a large cd book filled with memorabilia, there's a lot of entertaining stuff here.<br />I actually like the second disc better; the ep and the live concert are superior material, as good as the original album, and concerts are usually the better way to judge bands like Pavement.  The first disc does suffer from poor arrangement-- three versions of &quot;Here&quot; is too much, great song though it is.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney Houston uses her rock-solid gospel foundation as a basis for her stunning readings of many of the Christmas classics.  Houston's sacred influence can best be heard on the mesmerizing \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel\\" and spellbinding \\"Joy To The World.\\"  <br />Whitney's amazing vocal dexterity allows her to glide into other genres of music including jazz and blues.  On the breathtaking \\"O Holy Night,\\" Whitney and producer Mervyn Warren wisely borrow from jazz great Ella Fitzgerald in this haunting interpretation.  Whitney's diction is letter perfect as she enunciates every syllable of every word and her vocal power is earthquaking. With the assistance of only a electronic keyboard and some inspired vocal runs, \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" is transformed into a bluesy cry for a place on earth where peace and tranquility reside.   <br />On Torme's \\"The Christmas Song,\\" Houston takes the her captivated audience on a soaring ride as we all wonder if reindeer really know how to flyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.  Of all the singers who've covered this standard, only Nat King Cole can claim a superior version.<br />\\"One Wish: The Holiday Album\\" is the brightest collection from Whitney Houston since \\"The Preacher's Wife.\\"  I only hope she continues to navigate her career into unexpected territory, for it supplants her as the quintessential VOICE of her generation capable of doing anything she chooses.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I like Linkin Park. I am often shunned by &quot;real&quot; lovers of rock for saying that, but I honestly like them. So what if they are ultra produced and catering to the MTV crowd,I honestly thought they had something somewhat original going with hybrid theory and reanimition IMO was incredible for its NINesqe sounds and looser song structures. Needless to say, i was excited for the release of &quot;meteora&quot; and bought it the morning it came out. After listening to the CD for about a month...I realized that although I didn't dislike one song, no song jumped out at me with the incredible emotion and power of &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;, &quot;In the End&quot;, or the &quot;Crawling&quot; remix. None had the insanely addictive anger of &quot;One step Closer&quot; and none quite had the creepy grooves of &quot;With you&quot; or the &quot;Forgotten&quot; remix. Furthermore, no new ground was broken with Meteora. For a band that had relatively radical sounds on their first two CDS, I expected a little more deviation with Meteora. Sadly, with a  few exceptions, each song on Meteora can be compared to a song on HT. This either shows that the band was lazy, or that they didn't want to take a risk when they already had success. I feel that if they had taken more risks and not made such formulamatic music, then they would've had even more success and garnered a little respect from the underground rock lovers that love to hate LP. Hopefully with their next release LP will be confident enough with themselves to push the boundaries more and renovate their sound so that it won't sound like another remix album. If you love accesible music and just want superficial ear candy, as I do sometimes, buy this cd, but if you are one of the elitists who only listen to music that grows better after time, which I am sometimes, than at all costs stay away from LP (as if you need to be told)
B0000C6E4D|1.0|You would think that after 6 years of not releasing any albums, she could have released more than a mean 10 song- 40 minute set.<br /> This woman has always been very cheap and tight-fisted. That's one thing I can say for her, she keeps true to her faith with her typical half-hour set.  As for the content of the album, I just wished that I had reviewed this set in the store before taking it home. I was so disappointed in this cd. <br />There are 2 good songs on this cd , Fallen and answer. and the rest is just filler. There are no new sounds, nothing fresh, nothing new, Is this the best offering she could release after 6 years. And to top it off, Miss Queen of cheap, I hereby stingily give you 1 star, you tight-fisted cheap-skate.

0805066691|5.0|As a student and fan of history I have read probably thousands of fiction, non-fiction and 'semi-fiction' books, but this could be the most powerful and affecting of them all.<BR>Although this book only covers a thirty-year portion of the early history between European settlers and the native peoples of the United States, the repetitive nature of the encounters depicted fully displays the shameful truths that school textbooks and most Western movies hid, ignored, misrepresented or lied about. In EACH case, the settlers - and later, the U.S. government itself - deceived, cheated, manipulated and brutalized the indigenous people. It began before the 1860s and - take it from a person on the scene - it continues to this very day, only by more subtle and low-profile methods.<BR>My respect for the author is immense because the history is well-researched and documented and is presented in an even tone that makes the emotional impact of the tragic and infuriating proceedings even more powerful.<br />This book caused me to see the stereotypical depictions from my youth of Indians as cruel and vicious savages in a much different light, because it brought me to ask myself if I and my fellow Caucasian Americans would act any differently when responding to an outside, invading force assaulting our country and trying to take possession of this country we consider our homeland.<BR>I highly recommend this book to anyone, novice or 'expert', who is interested in American history and/or Native American people.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's &quot;Chariot&quot; is easily my favorite debut album from recent memory. I've been impressed by both John Mayer and Jason Mraz in the not-too-distant past, but DeGraw really blew me away. I can't remember the last time I became so addicted to a CD. I listen to it close to once a day.<br />Highlights include the perfect and infectious radio single &quot;Follow Through&quot; (you've heard it and you liked it, even if you don't realize it) and &quot;I Don't Want To Be&quot; (the theme song of The WB's new show, One Tree Hill). &quot;Just Friends&quot; is a heartbreaking and amazing song that really delves into human weakness; Gavin's love cheats on him and yet he's still willing to forgive her, under a single, sad condition. The true standout (and my personal favorite) is &quot;Belief,&quot; an awesome showcase of Gavin's talent -- soulful vocals, powerful lyrics, and a beautiful and dramatic arrangement that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. Every song on the album is relatable to real life. This is one of those &quot;soundtrack of your life&quot; discs.<br />DeGraw will be something huge, and rightfully so. I predict a lot of Grammy buzz, and perhaps a win for Best New Artist next year. He's much more talented and original than the great Norah Jones. Buy this disc now and tell your friends - become a Gavin groupie before you're just another fan on the bandwagon.
0385504209|4.0|Although it reads like a suspense novel, it's underlying message is that of the secrets of the church.  No big surprise there.  Anyone that has read anything by Elaine Pagels or read the Nag Hammadi will see the connection.  Anybody who is a true seeker, already knows the answers from within.  No religion has it right when it comes to the feminine and how important it is to the whole picture.  The suggestion that Jesus was mortal and married is not something new. He was a great master and teacher but people still do not hear his true message and that we are ALL from God.  If all things were revealed to the world by the right scources, there would be still be millions of people who would not be able to take the truth.  Besides that, who would support the church if their &quot;flock&quot; should ever know the real story of creation and the nature of our God?  Women would no longer be second class citizens in a man's world which was created by man and still controlled by man.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Boy did THIS film get the short end of the stick by critics.<BR>This is a great film. It's NOT really a comic book film, although the delightful editing techniques certainly refer to the source material's heritage.<BR>This is a horror movie more than anything else. It's like Frankenstein meets Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde, albeit with a dollop of serious familial psychodrama mixed in for some texture.<BR>It's always visually and aurally interesting, and the special effects are astonishing.  (Reference made only for comic geeks)<BR>The Hulk character looks terrific, I thought. While it's not the character that Gollum was, remember, he has no lines. He roars and tosses tanks like a Olympian hammer throw athlete. There are plenty of glorious action scenes for those of you who care, yet there most definitely is a dense and detailed plot to back it up. After all, this IS Ang Lee we're talking about.<BR>I loved the sly references to classic horror films, like King Kong and Frankenstein.<BR>The cast is uniformly impressive; again, this IS Ang Lee. Bana, Connelly, Elliott, Nolte...yeah sure sometime they go a little &quot;over the top&quot;, but it all services the story.<BR>The visual &quot;look&quot; to the film is highly original as well. Maybe not &quot;original&quot; in that dictionary sense...it borrows a lot from comic book story-telling techniques...but I don't think you will have seen a film that LOOKS like this one does. Inventive color schemes, camera angles, music cue choices and the marvelous editing design all combine most effectively.<BR>I found myself more impressed with the film after I viewed the supplementary material. I found I wanted to tell people about this film...to give it a chance. Non-&quot;comic&quot; people may actually get more out of the film than we comic fans, but only the latter group will smile when he whips that tank over his head.<BR>That looked perfect, didn't it?
0385504209|5.0|When I saw the back cover blurb by one of my favorite authors, Nelson DeMille, I had hoped I was in for a good read.  I wasn't  let down, this read kept me up late turning page after page, waiting for  conclusions to problems and answers to secrets.  It takes a huge amount of skill, research and patience to make a book of this scope come together, to be concluded well and not leave stings untied.  This is indeed a mystery/thriller that is highly recommended and I must mention I had my doubts when I saw that it was selling so well.<br />The controversial portions of this book are good reading too, and shouldn't be taken necessarily as fact, or even supposed fact, this isn't a scholarly thesis, it's a work of fiction.  Before the book starts, Brown notes that \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\"  This is good to know and makes the reading honest, however it is important to note he doesn't make the claim that all hypothesis and conclusions are fact, that would have been presumptuous on his part and he doesn't go that far.  It is also fair to say that the fictional characters actually believe what they say they believe, and this can only be controversial if we suppose that some of the fictional statements are meant to be put forward as fact, especially conclusions that suppose the New Testament is itself mostly fictional.<br />To what degree Brown believes or doesn't believe some of the conclusions reached by the characters about the nature of Christ and what secrets the Church has hidden over the years does not detract from the brilliance of this work, and I wouldn't recommend passing this over merely because of some of the controversy, however, be forewarned, some of the statements and conclusions drawn by the characters are indeed inflammatory and quite possibly offensive to some.<br />I am not offended reading challenges to my belief's and  I love mysteries, history, hidden meanings, and especially I love women so I found this work highly enjoyable and again recommend it  highly to any that love well written mysteries especially  those that have an historical backdrop.love women so I found this work highly enjoyable and again recommend it  highly to any that love well written mysteries especially  those that have an historical backdrop.
0375701427|4.0|American Pastoral is a beautifully-written epic of the American family.  The protagonist is Swede Levov, an ex-high school athlete, and the plot revolves around his dealing with a tragedy.  That tragedy is his daughter's bombing of a general store in their rural town.  The novel begins when Swede is 70 and gradually works its way back to the time of the bombing, and then forward to 5 years after the bombing.  This narrative form allows the reader to experience all of Swede's emotions.  The novel deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize, it is a winning depiction of American home life, and realistically relationships between fathers and daughters.  Roth's characters are very true to life.  Definitely recommended.
B000062YAZ|5.0|The Slayer delivered upon in the year Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Six this ugly, bloody, vile work of hideous art that every Slayer fan holds dear. When &quot;Angel Of Death&quot; roars into fifth gear right out of the box, you KNOW this is Slayer's time. Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits were great, Seasons and South Of Heaven were incedible, but this is IT. &quot;Piece By Piece&quot; is a sickening groove-killer that still pummells every other metal act. &quot;Necrophobic&quot; is a minute and a half sledgehammer. The purely evil &quot;Altar Of Sacrifice&quot; sounds like the evil demonic band that is featured in movies. &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;. A classic. Intelligent, sly, slow, fast, excellent. &quot;Criminally Insane&quot; may as well be a drum solo from the infamous Lombardo. &quot;Reborn&quot; and &quot;Epidemic&quot; the solid crusher duo that no other band has yet been able to counter. Ahh, &quot;Postmortem&quot;. Slayer's answer to Metallica's &quot;Creeping Death&quot;. This harmonic-minor beast kills all metal in its wake. <BR>     And then track 10. Slayer's finest hour. A masterpiece that beats out even &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; and &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot; for title of greatest Slayer song. The dramatic rain and drum buildup. That INFAMOUS riff. The explosion into mad riffery. The insane D# part after the first verse. The slow groove part. The orgasmic guitar duel. And finally, the bark and fall of rain. Quite simply, Reign In Blood is a fantastic album, but &quot;Raining Blood&quot; is almost as good as the previous nine tracks combined. Immortal.
B0000009S3|5.0|Frank Zappa already made his mark with his biting social commentary (particularly about hippies), eccentric sound collages and his quirky sense of lyricism on such albums as Freak Out and We're Only In It For the Money. Hot Rats, released in 1969, was Zappa's chance to devote an album entirely to brilliant instrumentals and jams, mostly jazz-rock and fusion influenced. <br />There is only one track (out of six) that contains vocals (by Zappa's friend Captain Beefheart), &quot;Willie the Pimp,&quot; which tells the story about a pimp who exploits women and gets rich while doing it. The lyrics subliminally denounce the art of being a pimp, but Zappa does it with his humorous style. After the lyrics, it goes off into a hard-rock/jazz frenzy for about 9 minutes. Other songs include &quot;Peaches en Regalia,&quot; one of his most enduring and classic songs, &quot;Son of Mr. Green Genes,&quot; and &quot;Little Umbrellas.&quot; If you enjoy great instrumentals and even better musicianship, but really are not into Zappa's silly lyrics, Hot Rats is the Frank Zappa album you must listen to.

0142002038|5.0|I have been a James Bond movie fan for years. I never read the Ian Fleming novels because I never could have imagined an improvement on the big screen edition. Boy was I wrong. The novel is a vast improvement over the movie bevause it can pack more details and adventures into the story. It sees James Bond barely escape the clutches of a giant squid, safely cross through a cage full of hairy tarantualas, and endure the burning of a red hot ventilating system that is only a few inches larger than he is. None of this is in the movie. <br />Also, the story reads almost like a different yarn than the movie:<BR>- In the book, Dr. No is killed by a pile of bird dung that is dropped from a crane manned by 007. In the movie, he dies during the breakdown of his palace.<BR>- In the book, Quarrel (Bond's partner) picks 007 up at the airport when he first comes to Jamaica. In the movie, a Dr. No employee picks him up and is killed minutes later by his own hand.<BR>- In the book, 007 sees a giant centipede crawl up his body when he's in bed. In the movie, it's a tarantula.<BR>- In the book, Honey Rider first appears naked. In the movie, she's wearing a bikini.<BR>- But most of all, the novel's primary focus seems to show that Dr. No is a seller of bird dung that wishes to keep people away. In the movie, he wants to keep people out, but we are deprived of the bird slant that is really quite important to the story as a whole. The book &quot;Dr. No &quot; reads almost as a totally different story than the movie, and it includes more adventures. I recommend this highly.
0790729725|5.0|This movie pars with Mean Streets as the best gangster movie of all time. GoodFellas is more detailed while Mean Streets is more simplistic. The movie is basically the life of Henry Hill, a gangster who was in the mafia from 1955 to 1980. The movie shows you how gang life changed over the course of 2 and a half hours. At first, no one got killed unless it was absolutly necessary. Then, killings became a habit. Robert DeNiro is perfect as a nervous wreck of a man, and Joe Pesci is always crazy, but in this movie, he perfects the Italian stereotype. Ray Liotta is also exceptionally good, and the movie flows very nicely. THe music is AWESOME. Check out the part where DeNiro's in a bar smoking and Cream comes on. Best movie music ever. Anyway, this movie is really good, has really good violence, and has no epic feel despite the length. Highly reccomended.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This CD is really good, and please don't listen to those who say this CD is bad.  I would know, because I own almost all of her CDs, and I know good music.  It is definitely one of Whitney's better CDs, and I dare say it rivals &quot;The Preacher's Wife&quot; Soundtrack (speaking of that CD, there are some songs from that CD on the new one).  <br />     Mervyn Warren, the main producer/arranger on this CD and producer/arranger for many other of my favorite CDs including &quot;'Sister Act 2' Soundtrack,&quot; &quot;Handel's Messiah: A Soulful Celebration,&quot; and &quot;'The Preacher's Wife' Soundtrack&quot; really brings Whitney's melodious yet powerful voice come out full force on this CD.  <br />     My personal favorite is &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; where we get to hear her daughter Bobbi sing with her.  It is such a great arrangement in addition to the fact that Whitney has a great voice, and so does Bobbi.  I expect her to be famous one day just like Whitney.  I also like her new song, &quot;One Wish.&quot; <BR> <BR>     If you haven't already purchased Whitney's Houston new Christmas CD, &quot;One Wish: The Holiday Album,&quot; I implore you to get it NOW!
0553573403|5.0|I love this book! Writing is superb, and the characters are even more than that. This book, in my opinion, is better than Tolkiens Lord of the Rings. Everything is just perfect here.<br />There isn't too much descriptions or conversations, the story is very dynamic, things happen very quickly, but it's not hard to understand it, actually it's very easy. There is a lot of treachery, so you never know are the good characters good, and are the bad ones really bad.<br />Oh, and you won't find chapters is this book. Since there are a lot of characters here (most of them die but new ones just keep coming), a different writing was required. When you start reading it you will feel that you're looking a movie, because the story every once in a while concentrates on a one character, for example you'll have ten to twenty pages about Ned, then ten to twenty pages of Daenerys, so you'll find about ten \\"chapters\\" for every character.<br />Since there is a lot of killing and blood in this book I wouldn't recommend it to the youngest ones, but to anyone else it would be shame not to read it.
B00008EY9G|3.0|One can see why this ensemble cast of talent was drawn to this project. It is your classic \\"Who dun it?\\" with all the hallmarks of the great crime stories over the last century. If this film had a narrator, the picture would begin with, \\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\" ~Identity~ is so rife with literary devices and tired old clich&eacute;s that it was difficult to settle in at first. However the film is well directed and the performances are not played over the top, thus one can sit back and enjoy the familiar ride. Like all great crime mysteries, the fun is gathering the clues and deducing the perpetrator - Was it the butler in the study? The maid in the kitchen?\\" Or was it Colonel Mustered in the drawing room? This film could almost be classified as a parody but its creators seemed to have taken it very seriously. Once we think we know what's really going on, and those involved are headed towards living `happily ever after', the story takes another unexpected twist. This is standard practice for the genre - one can only be sure that the film has really ended when the credits begin the roll. Before the film's release, seeing its trailers, my expectations, in hindsight, were a little too high. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this film. That said, taken for what it is, ~Identity~ is fun viewing and worth the price of admission.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Maybe I'm biased (I've been a Dream Theater fanatic since &quot;Images And Words&quot;), but this is their best album yet. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves progressive metal. It has all the elements - crunchy guitar riffs and blistering solos from Petrucci, excellent keyboard and bass work from Rudess and Myung, awesome drum patterns and fills from Portnoy, and great vocals from LaBrie. It's heavy (very heavy), melodic, and progressive. What more could you ask for if you're a prog metal fan? If I had to compare it to other DT releases, I would have to say that it is more along the lines of &quot;Awake&quot; than anything else, which, in my opinion, is a good thing. If you like straight-ahead rock that you hear on the radio, you probably won't like this album. But if radio rock bores you (like it does me)and you like ten minute songs that are all over the place with with a strong emphasis on musical virtuosity, then you should love &quot;Train Of Thought&quot;. I can't get enough of it.
038572179X|3.0|Atonement is the story of the Tallis family and their housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner. It all starts in 1935 when young Briony Tallis witnesses events involving her sister Cecilia and Robbie, events she can't fully understand or accept. This leads Briony to give false testimony, accusing Robbie of a crime he did not commit. <br />The first part of the novel revolves around the presentation of the cast of characters and the dinner that would change their lives. Part two centres mostly on Robbie, a few years after that night and the retreat from Dunkirk during the war. The last section brings us to 1999 at a family reunion where the whole truth is finally revealed.<br />Although this story is in general very good and the writing excellent, there are many pages I spent reading wondering if the author would get to the point, or at least get somewhere. This was for me especially true during the long description of the retreat. Another problem was the extremely predictable episode where Robbie writes two notes of apology to Cecilia, one with obvious sexual comments, the other very polite. The reader can see what will happen many pages before the author gets to the expected conclusion.<br />Although I loved the characters and the prose of this novel, I would not recommend it as a \\"must read\\" to anyone. However, if you are looking for a slow-paced, well-written novel, you will probably enjoy this book.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh brings the listener closer to his heart with with tracks When You Say You Love Me, and with the one he co-wrote, Remember When It Rained.  His voice has matured in the two years since his debut album and can more powerfully evoke tears from the listener.  Inspired collaborations with artists like Deep Forest, give a new spin to the 'popera' Josh's voice produces.  <br />I would however eliminate the track Caruso; it sounds more like a speech in Italian set to background music.  Despite the flub of including this one and his try Broken Vow, the album is fabulous.
B000005JA8|4.0|This album is truly awesome. It's definitely the strangest cd i have in my collection, but then again i have an appreciation for the eccentric. The music is unconventional, yet primative in nature. It's rock. It has a Garage rock, almost proto-punk sound. You could say it's psychadelic blues rock. Ah don't try to classify it, you have to apreciate it for what it truly is. The lyrics are definitely strange. It's basically acid influenced freeform poetry. The music may sound like noise, but music is basically noise anyway. And you do get used after a few listens. every now and then one of the guitar riffs keeps playing over and over in my head. His voice is like Howlin Wolf if he was stoned. The only reason this album is unlistenable is because it's too long. If it had been rereleased in it's original double album format, it might have been more palatable. you can't listen to it all in one sitting.you should take long breaks between listening to a few songs. I only listened to it once in it's entirety. once every couple of months i listen to various tracks. I want to purchase a copy of this album in it's original vinyl LP format, so i can listen to it one side at a time.
038572179X|1.0|I have three words for this one: plodding, plodding and plodding. It's a big seller at the bookstores, and I've *heard* it's great. I asked around and was told to hang tight and just try to keep going. But I kept getting Very Very Sleepy... <br />Three more words: Avoid this book.
B0000E64TQ|5.0|Since I purchased a Super Audio CD player (SACD) about six months ago, I've been disappointed by most of the surround sound mixes I've heard.  It's true that remixing a recording that was originally prepared for two-channel stereo into 5.1 surround does create a different performance.  So?  The original stereo mix is still available (and with the two-layer \\"hybrid\\" format used here, it's readily accessible).  As a result, most multi-channel mixes are fairly timid, placing the voice in the center speaker and perhaps daintily tossing a few stray ambient sounds into the rear speakers.  When I buy a SACD, I want to hear something daring, something adventurous, in other words... something I haven't heard before.<br /><br />On this new mix of \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\",  the producer has pulled out all the stops and created a powerful, knock-your-socks-off reinterpretation that really deserves to be called \\"surround sound.\\"  Bold, vibrant music surges into all five speakers from the opening organ notes of \\"Funeral For A Friend\\", and the action never lets up until the last note of \\"Harmony.\\"<br /><br />This demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of surround sound re-mixes.  On the plus side, you hear details that were buried before; backing vocals, guitar parts, and other dynamics leap out at you.  This was always a lush recording, but you can now appreciate some of the ingredients more fully.<br /><br />The downside, of course, is that some passages sound quite different from what you're used to.  The opening of \\"I've Seen That Movie, Too,\\" for example, is almost unrecognizable, as the guitars are much more prominent and even threaten to drown out Elton's piano.  Perhaps the producer went a bit too far... but the original stereo mix is right there (and plays on SACD or ordinary audio CD players).  \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" has been released several times on CD but it's never sounded this good.  (We're back, however, to the two-disc format of the first CD issue.)<br /><br />If you have a surround sound system, don't even think about it.  Buy this disc.  If you have a regular stereo CD and just need a copy of this record, this is the edition to get.<br /><br />The DVD contains a 50 minute \\"making of\\" program that's fascinating and adds to the value of the package which is admittedly steep.  Take note, however, that a more complete version of this video, running to 90 minutes, has been previously released separately on DVD, and the additional 40 minutes are well worth seeing.  (I never realized that Nigel Olsson, Davy Johnstone, and Dee Murray did most of the backing vocals; their three-part harmonies rival anything by CSN.)<br /><br />Note:  This release is now available on DVD-Audio.  This contains the same surround-sound mix as the SACD.  DVD-Audio, with its greater storage capacity, is a single-disc release.  The SACD, by contrast, is a two-disc set; however, unlike DVD-Audio, SACD can be copied onto ordinary CDs for car or portable stereo.

B00005LAIB|5.0|Tool have proven themselves once again that they are far and away the best musicians out there today. &quot;Lateralus&quot; combines everything that makes this band great, including ultra-heavy guitar, thunderous bass, and of course, the impeccable drum beats laid down by Danny Carey. Maynard rounds out this group with his haunting lyrics and voice that ranges from creepy to full of rage and acidic hatred. &quot;Lateralus&quot; is the smoothest album I have heard in years, maybe ever heard. It is equal on a conceptual basis with Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; and anything that Rush ever put out. Each and every song here is an epic unto itself, most of the tracks spiralling over seven or eight minutes, something that music today really lacks. Each song can keep you entranced until the very end, even throught the odd musical journeys that are the bridges and breakdowns. Everything about this album is perfect, there is nothing more to say than that. This is a must-have for anybody who likes metal, or any other type of music that wishes to push borders and tingle the senses. <br />Best tracks: &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Lateralus&quot;, &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;, &quot;Parabola&quot;, &quot;Schism&quot;
B0000025T6|5.0|An amazing piece of work... springsteen is simply stunning.  I urge any true music fan to purchase this record.
B00000DLVA|5.0|The first time I listened to &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;, I could not believe that this was the same group that brought us &quot;Lovefool&quot;. After that first listen, I knew that I was a fan of the band. The lyrics here are great, the music is buzzing with electronic influences, and each song is irresistably catchy, you may just find yourself becoming a fan as well. The best songs here are &quot;My Favorit Game&quot;, &quot;Erase and Rewind&quot;, &quot;Starter&quot; and &quot;Marvel Hill&quot;. This is an impressive album from beginning to end, a good alternative to pop-rock fans who are sick and tired of Matchbox 20 and the Goo Goo Dolls releasing virtually the same song over and over again. &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; is more than worth the price to check out, because it has the potential to really surprise people and get in their heads.
B0000027RL|5.0|it was Nirvana who copied Pearl Jam. and even though i like both bands, i still think that p.jam are well better
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Okay, to clear up a few points -- first, the title is awful; second, I never thought the original was bad to begin with (even Long and Winding Road); third, there are other \\"stripped\\" versions of these songs available on Anthology and Past Masters; fourth, the bonus disc is only worth listening to once or twice;....however, please, please, open your ears everyone to the extraordinary clarity of the sound emanating from your speakers.  The new running order provides a very cohesive and \\"organic\\" listen, one idea running nicely into the next, and when added to the remastered sound, this is a great release.  With the recent Dylan and Stones SACD remasters, one can only hope that the lovely sound on this CD will spur Paul and Ringo to sign off on SACD remastering of the whole catalog, including the original Let It Be, which I'll be happy to buy again.  Why moan about the fairly superfluous bonus disc when the CD only cost 12 bucks?    As far as the music, this release is full of various awesome Beatles' trademarks.  Listen to the great time change on \\"I Me Mine\\".  And though it seems de riguer to trash Long and Winding Road, listen to the way the tune modulates into the middle eight section, ...\\"Many times I've been alone...\\"  They were master tunesmiths.   And in my opinion, in this form, or the original, it's a great album.
B00005JMF6|2.0|I don't watch many horror movies but I do know which aspects make them palpably frightening.  A prime example is \\"The Sixth Sense\\", a film which focused upon the interest, fear and even skepticism that we the American populace generally have of the supernatural, particularly ghosts.  Enthralling throughout, \\"The Sixth Sense\\" didn't rely upon a violin-laden, fright-inducing score to make the audience's skin crawl; it was largely dependent upon and owes its ominous success to a credible story/screenplay, strategic lighting, make-up and most importantly, the performances of the actors.<br />\\"Gothika\\", through its many recent TV spots, purports itself to be a supernatural thriller in the league of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" but fails to make the cut, its efforts to induce terror painfully obvious and its plot eventually falling into a pattern of predictability (but two tweens who sat in my row at the theater would beg to differ, promptly SCREAMING at every cue of suspenseful music).<br />The story carves its flimsy foundation with Dr. Miranda Grey (Berry) making her rounds at an asylum of which her husband Doug (Dutton) is the chief administrator.  Driving through a heavy downpour after a late night at the office, a giant sinkhole surrounded by a police barricade forces Miranda to take an alternate route home and she nearly mows down a young girl standing in the middle of the road.  When she leaps out of her SUV in a panic to check on the girl, the drenched and whimpering lass promptly bursts into flames with a heinous shriek and Miranda blacks out.<br />When Miranda regains consciousness she finds herself back in the asylum, only this time she's a patient locked in a cell in the solitary ward.  Visited by fellow psychiatrist and former co-worker Pete Graham (Downey), she learns that Doug has been brutally murdered and that she is the culprit, having repressed the memory of the crime for three years.  On top of the shock of losing her husband, Miranda is haunted by the disgruntled spirit of Rachel Parsons (Mackey), the very specter who appeared on the road that fateful night.  Distraught over Pete no longer taking her seriously (\\"You can't trust somebody when they think you're crazy\\") and Rachel's violent visitations, Miranda comes closer to discovering a horrible truth and even her expertise in neuropsychiatry won't prepare her for what she finds out.<br />Berry, now an Oscar alum, disappoints not because of her performance but because of her invested time in a high-expectations/low-payoff film (the same can be said for Robert Downey Jr., now making a comeback after a long struggle with drug addiction).  A-list thespian Bernard Hill (Titanic, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) wastes his time as well and Penelope Cruz is a bore as disheveled mental patient Chloe.<br />Matthieu Kassovitz, having played the field as a screenwriter and an actor, has now done what most accomplished people in the entertainment industry (particularly actors) set their sights on - directing.  Although he has manned a few productions already (almost all of them in French), \\"Gothika\\" marks his place in America as a director and he brings with him a screenplay from Sebastian Gutierrez, a man who like himself has a couple of slashes in his job title (actor/director/screewriter).<br />Bottom line, \\"Gothika\\" may scare a younger crowd that's not keen on horror movies but for more mature audiences, it will dash hopes on many levels.  If you haven't already, grab \\"The Sixth Sense\\" at your local video store or pick up \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Alien\\" and/or Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" (all three titles are on imdb.com's \\"Top 50 Horror Films\\" list) and kill the lights - you're in for a frighteningly good time.untled spirit of Rachel Parsons (Mackey), the very specter who appeared on the road that fateful night.

B0000CAQ27|4.0|Wow, im not a rock fan, but Pink is smashing. I saw her on the AMA's performing live to give us a glimpse of the new CD, and is it me-or is she the only artist who is not lip synching and singing IN TUNE? I have a newfound respect for her. I bought it, loved it, and have a lil' crush for rock.
B000002MP2|5.0|This album is one of the greatest albums of all time and the greatest Punk album so far to be released. Every single song is awesome, I would give each song a 9 or 10 out of 10. Dookie should be in every single rock CD collection and is a classic album of the 90s. It has some of the greatest Punk songs to ever be released and Green Day's best songs including 5 hits. If I could only live with 5 CDs this would be one of them.
B000002UAU|5.0|This may just be the best Beatles album ever! Its been called by many as 'rocks first masterpeace' and that just maybe true! John, George, Paul, and Ringo really came together for Srg. Pepper. The guitar is great and the songwriting is the best the Beatles wrote up till this point!<br />  Every song on Srg. Pepper is a classic and all are psycaldellic and fun. Many call this the greatest album of all time, I wouldnt got that far but this is pretty damn good! weather its 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' or the greatest Beatles song ever recorded 'A Day In The Life' you are sure to win.<br />  This was the album that tought Goerge to really write, Paul to use his imagination, It gave Ringo his voice, and opened up a part of John Lennons mind we never knew he had. This is truly a landmark acheive ment in the music world. They sure dont make music like they did in the late 1960's anymore, thats for sure!
B000020617|5.0|This Album is different and not as good as &quot;The Colour And The Shape&quot; because it's more slow and acoustic but it's still an awesome CD and the most mellow Foo Fighters album. 7 out of the 11 songs are a perfect 10 out of 10. The First 5 tracks rock. Tracks 6-11 are more relaxing and calm, they're tracks to rest too unlike the first 5 tracks where you could probably mosh too except the Grammy and VMA award winning &quot;Learn To Fly,&quot; you could do both. This album is the last great album of the 20th century and has some the greatest Foo Fighters songs of all time such as &quot;Stacked Actors,&quot; &quot;Breakout,&quot; &quot;Learn To Fly,&quot; and &quot;Next Year.&quot;
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones *****<br /><br />Exit Brian Jones, enter Mick Taylor. With the death of Brian Jones The Rolling Stones recruted virtuoso guitarist Mick Taylor who was previously known for his work with John Mayall. Let It Be was the first true introduction of Mick Taylor, though he only played on one track he made his mark. Sticky Fingers was Mick Taylors album. Of all the albums to feature the guitarist he had the most input during this album. Sticky Fingers is concidered one of the \\"classic four\\" in The Rolling Stones cannon. Many people concider this to be the essential Stones album, and for good reason it's amazing! For me personaly it comes down to this and Exile On Maint Street, with Exile just slightly above this album, but one thing is for sure they are both amazing. During the recording of Sticky Fingers the band was at their creative peak in my opinion. The lyrics are some of the best that Mick and Keith ever wrote. the musicianship especially the guitar playing is amazing here. Charlie Watts as always is the heart of the band and Bill Wyman's rumbling bass is more prominant then ever, and comes through when needed showing his versitility. The songs are amazing and many of which went on to become radio staples, classics, and really rock and roll standards.<br /><br />'Brown Sugar' which starts off the album set a new standard for the way rock and roll should and could be played.. Being concidred by many to be the very best Rolling Stones song ever. The song sure starts off the album the right way. Next is 'Sway' with more of a laid back feel but still intence. Almost country but not. The song comes across as almost a gosphal song from the south with the lyrics being about evil forces keeping you in their sway. Clearly a song influenced by the late great Robert Johnson who sang the delta blues. Not to mention the song contains one of Mick Taylors all time greatest guitar solos, not to mention one of the best of all time. A perfect way to end the song. 'Wild Horses' the first of two songs on the album that were influenced and written by Marian Faithfull. A beautiful country ballad about Faithfulls overdose/coma and when she came out of she said \\"I am back and wild horses couldnt drag me away.\\" One of the bands most legendary songs. Next is the amazing samba/rocker 'Cant You Hear Me Knockin' which starts out with one of the most amazing guitar riffs in the world. The song starts out as a bluesy rocker with some of Mick Jaggers all time best vocal performances, then it seagues into a samba jam session which adds a nice touch to the album. 'You Gotta Move' is a slower blues cover which the band does wonderfully. While I like the way the band did it I loke the version Aerosmith did on their Honkin' On Bobo album better, more energy. Anyways, next is the awesome rocker, 'Bitch' which is one of the bands all time best songs as well as one of my all time favorites. Amazing lyrics, killer guitar and a smokin horn section makes this song sound like it could have been done by The Temptations in the late 1960's or early 1970's. Next is the beautifuly sentamental 'Ive Got The Blues' which is a nice slow song and you can feel the longing in Micks voice. Easily one of the very best songs on this album. People either think 'Sister Morphine' is a bad song or they absolutly love it, well I can't get enough of it, it is one of my all time favorite Rolling Stones songs. This is the second song inspired by Faithfull, this song was written about the overdose she had as well. The lyrics are amazing, one of Mick Jagger's crowning achievments. It's one of the most overlooked songs in the bands catologue. More country fueled rock coming your way but done right. 'Dead Flowers' is such and awesome song. Mick does the best fake country voice by a Brit ever! Mick Taylor's slide guitar solo is one of the all time greats. The album closes ever so perfectly with 'Moonlight Mile' which always reminds me of The Doors' 'Moonlight Drive' because of the titles. The title is where the similarites end because they songs are totaly different. The song is slower and more mellow thne the rest of the album and is the perfect way to end the album.<br /><br />Originaly containing a zipper on the cover which was designed by Andy Warhol. This album is opne that should be owned by all rock, country, blues, R & B fans. With Sticky Fingers The Rolling Stones showed the world that there was no one like them and that there never would be. With two legendary albums already under their belt The Rolling Stons set 'in stone' their place in rock and roll history as one of the most exciting bands ever. Highly recomended to all!t Drive' because of the titles. The title is where the similarites end because they songs are totaly different.

B000001IPL|5.0|Every song on this album is tremendously sweet. You don't have to skip any tracks because each song is great and different. This is the 2nd greatest Punk album released so far (the only one better is Green Day's Dookie) and probably the Offspring's greatest album ever. If you want a punk album that's catchy, hard to get sick of, has sweet lyrics, and awesome guitar and drum rifts, this is it.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I never really listen to this heavy of metal but I loved 'Cemetary Gates' and I love Dimebag as a guitar player, so I thought Why not give it a chance. Well I did and this is one of the better albums I have bought in a while. The lead singer  is just powerful and amazing! His voice is awsome. Dimebag Deral is someone I always knew could play but I didnt realize he was this amazing! 'Cemetary Gates' has the greatest heavy metal riff I have ever heard! 'Cowboys From Hell' is just down right heavy and hard and and well anything else you could call it! 'The Sleep' blew me away I just cant get enough of that song! As for the rest of the album, be prepared to hear some beyond heavvvvy metal with killer guitar, rumbling bass, and awsome vocals. This is a killer album, after buying this I bought Vulger Display Of Power and Reinventing The Steel, and the albums only seem to get better and better!
6304712499|4.0|It's a good film but not as good as the comics or animated series. Nothing too spectacular. Possibly a renter. Slightly recommended.
B000002UUH|5.0|This is a great collection it gives you all you'll ever need to 'START' your John Lennon collection (key word being start*). This will get you on your way to deciding what Lennon you like, the popish more accesable John Lennon or the song writer and brilliant mucisan John Lennon. I bought this after Imagine and decided that I liked his songwriting more then his commercial stuff so I got into all of his more personal music like the Plastic Ono Band which is by the way one of the greatest albums ever made! If you wanted to get into John Lennon in anyway I would start here, its a great place to start!
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Buy it now, because this is one of the best films ever made. Extremely recommended.
B0000028M7|5.0|. I personally would buy this CD just for the song &quot;Down in a Hole.&quot; It is just so beautiful and perfectly executed. I can't listen to it just once without having to listen to it at least one more time. It is maybe my favorite song. &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; and &quot;Rooster&quot; are two very strong power ballads from this album. Although Alice in Chains was not a power ballad band per se, they did a few of them and generally pulled them off very well. Though Layne Staley's voice sounded great no matter what he was singing, it is songs like &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; on which he shines the brightest, rolling perfectly over all the rises and falls with a smoothness that is still somehow unnerving. The AIC classic &quot;Would?,&quot; &quot;Rain When I Die,&quot; and &quot;Angry Chair&quot; are standout midtempo songs, with the opening bass line and drums from &quot;Angry Chair&quot; marking one of the best songs openers of the genre. And of course there are the raging headbangers; &quot;Them Bones,&quot; &quot;God Smack,&quot; and &quot;Dam That River&quot; showcase the skills of Jerry Cantrell on lead guitar very well. &quot;God Smack&quot; took me a while to get used to; I think it was Layne's weird vocals on the verses, but I like it a lot now, and &quot;Dam That River&quot; packs a heavy punch with its raw aggression bursting with energy. There are some songs (&quot;Junkhead,&quot; &quot;Sickman,&quot; &quot;Hate to Feel&quot; for example) that never really caught on with me, mostly because they were pretty weird and hard to follow. <BR>Overall, it is a pretty good album musically, with &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; standing as the pinnacle, but not quite a great one. Layne Staley is one of my favorite voices; so full of feeling, so versatile, so unique, so perfectly reflective of what he was singing. His voice, like his lyrics, sound resigned to the hellish fate looming before him, from his opening yells on &quot;Them Bones&quot; which sound like the screams of the damned to the warbly, liquidly shaking verses of &quot;God Smack.&quot; Jerry Cantrell's guitar work on Dirt, while it lacks some of the beauty of his well-arranged works on Jar of Flies, is still among the best of 90s rock music, certainly the best of the grunge guitarists. On the heavier songs which dominate Dirt, his guitar rips and grinds, it grates and screams, it captures a rough sound many have since tried to duplicate (such as Godsmack) but few have equaled. While Cantrell puts together few great full pieces of music on Dirt, he still leaves you with many great instants that make you want to stop, go back, and listen to it again. He is also the leading creative force behind AIC's music, and most of their best stuff was written by him. Jerry Cantrell and Layne Staley had a great musical chemistry with their vocals and guitar that defines AIC's music. Sean Kinney is a good drummer, directing the music deftly and stepping to the forefront when needed but without taking the song over. Mike Starr is a very good bassist who certainly has his moments, such as the haunting intro to &quot;Angry Chair&quot; (which also features some nice drum beat from Starr). Yet somehow Alice in Chains was too often a band that did not equal the sum of its parts, not quite as good as it should have been. The root of the problem, I believe, is that the rhythms of many songs, while at times fascinating, were ultimately too irregular and flow-killing for success, while the bands most popular songs have been more musically accessible and conventionally flowing (those written mostly by Cantrell). Perhaps if Layne had been able to find control of himself and the band had stayed together, they would have matured to reach their full potential. We will certainly never know what they could have become. But don't let that undermine the fact that they were still a very good band to which current rock music owes a lot. Alice in Chains is in my opinion easily the best of the Seattle-based grunge bands of the era; the only one to be as significant for the music it produced as for the music it influenced.
B000092Q4U|4.0|This is a pretty good album, but Lamb of God changed their style in key parts with it. Barely sounding like their previously release, New American Gospel, this is still good but I wish they kept with their old style. Recommended.
B00000272N|4.0|Alice in Chains released the first CD of the grunge movement perhaps unwittingly. Facelift was marketed originally as a metal CD with a bit of a twist but when Soundgarden, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and others in the Seattle area really got the grunge movement moving in the next couple years, their pull pushed AIC the rest of the way into the grunge genre. But this album really isn't that far from Dirt musically. While it is not as good as Dirt, Facelift is still a great debut and a great taste of things to come. Listening to it leaves you wanting more than just a taste of Alice's music. Facelift is a pretty consistent CD, with most of the songs after the first few pretty good yet not great, contrasting with the mountain peaks and gutter lows of Dirt. <BR>Facelift starts off with a bang with the engaging and mind-blasting opener \\"We Die Young.\\" The rage seethes and the head rings and as soon as the song jolts to an abrupt halt just two and a half minutes long, you are hooked. From there it only gets better with \\"Man In A Box,\\" the defining song of Alice in Chains' career. Who can forget the grating, booming crunch of the opening guitar and Layne's full-throated vocals. You know from the beginning that this is the song to remember. On the chorus, Layne and Jerry make the perfect, if odd, vocal combination with Jerry's mournful answers fitted neatly between Layne's incredible fully exerted cries. And of course, Cantrell doesn't disappoint on the solo either. Hit repeat a couple dozen times and enjoy all of this one. After that, AIC completely jerks you around and completely surprises you with some almost funky keyboard that gives way to the familiar sounds of trademark AIC music. This song is a little softer still with a strangely catchy chorus. Though those three are the highlight, the rest of the CD rarely disappoints. Facelift features arguably Jerry Cantrell's best work, particularly on solos, and Layne's vocals, always bearing new slight variations with each recording,have their most strained, edgy, urgent feel here, fitting the more edgy, urgent sound of Facelift.
B00008S2VG|3.0|This album is far from bad, and although it's not as good as &quot;Music&quot; or &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; it has been unfairly dismissed by many critics. Of course, they have been saying it's all over for her since 1985, so what do they know. There are some great tracks on this album, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; was dismissed as being clinical and boring but its actually a great, lively, techno-styled song. &quot;American Life,&quot; instead of being a 'poor me' song, I think was actually supposed to be ironic - not many people 'got it,' apparently. Ditto &quot;Hollywood&quot; which is a rollicking pop song. The personal musings of &quot;Mother and Father,&quot; &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; show the maturity and honesty of her songwriting. There are a couple of beautiful, stark, and intimate songs on this record.<br />  It's a shame that this album seemed to crash and burn so soon, after a good start. Anyway, I guess sales aren't the most important thing. If you enjoy good music then buy this album. I am also sure that Madonna won't be going anywhere until SHE'S ready.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|She cant sing, she has to have those backup computerized sounds to drown out her voice, the only song on this cd that is halfway decent is Everytime, and Me against the music. Maybe the next one will be better but it seems they have been getting worse since OOPS. OH well.

It's about needing to take a break from Hollywood because of Kim and many other things in his life.<br />Drips 5/10 This is a very disgusting song with Obie Trice. It's about Obie having sex and how the girl says he is the kid's dad because he didn't use birth control. Isn't even in the clean version!<br />Without Me 9/10 Different than most other songs. Has funny music video and is a comical song. Has very good beat like all the songs!<br />Paul Rosenberg (skit) NA Pretty pointless just someone saying don't bring your gun outside.<br />Sing for the Moment 10/10 This is my favorite song ever! Is about him or any troubled teen. It's a very good and true song.<br />Superman 7/10 Okay song, but the CD has many better songs.

Very fast and upbeat.<br />Say What you Say 8/10 With Dr. Dre. Good song. About Dre helping him become awell known rapper then Dre saying how you shouldn't dis him. <br />Till I Collapse 9/10 With Nate Dogg. Very catchy. Nate Dogg's very good but I've never heard of him before. Great song!<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy 9/10 With Hailey a little bit. Pretty comical song in the beginning but then it kinda changes. and its very good.<br />Curtains Close (skit) NA Funny skit with guy singing into the mic.<br />This is a great CD and he explains himself very well. People say he's to mean towards his mom but if you hear these songs you would know that she has obviously done something very wrong to him. Go buy this CD!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this album, its upbeat, fun, and mature.  A great mix of urban, hip hop, and pop.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|my first question is does everybody hate this film? You have to intelligent to watch the matrix reloaded do to it's story line,  if only all you ignorent close minded people could only understand the making of this film. It is not made of mumbo jumbo, is very uniqie story line. All you smart people know what i'm talking about don't you. The first matrix is very unique but with a untold story to be told, so they came with this along with revolutions of coarse. This is more smart way to understand.
B000001AI7|5.0|Michael Jackson's first solo album-pre &quot;Thirller&quot; even.The<BR>hits of course are the immortal tital song,&quot;Rockin' Robin and &quot;I Wanna Be Where You Are&quot;,sung by that precocious Jackson 5 headman of yore.The whole shabang starts with the breathtaking &quot;Ain't No Sunshine&quot;,a dark,mysterious cover with a rapped intro that stomps all over Bill Withers original!Ditto on the original &quot;Maria (You Were The Only One&quot; and the Diana Rossish &quot;in Our Small Way&quot;.A fantastic way to begin a career and<BR>a true question mark as to what the heck happened to this guy in<BR>the next twenty years!This shouldn't be as rare as it it is-it is<BR>at it's very worst a musical historical document worthy of even<BR>the most disriminating ears.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I have great variety in the music I listen to, I was raised on jazz and blues and I also go for alternative and 80's hair band/head banging rock and roll. But since I was a child, I couldn't remember one day I wouldn't go without listening to any Michael Jackon album.<BR>     Most all of them are great, I even personally liked Invincible (which of course tanked) am enjoying Number Ones (which isn't doing so hot either) but Thriller ultimately proclaims MJ's King Of Pop status. With the up-beat Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' to set off the album and give it a not-knowing-what-to-expect-next mood, most could tell with that single song that Thriller would make its place in history.                                                              Then you have the pointless but almost humerous single of the Girl is Mine that also appears on Paul McCartny's album Peace Pipe (obviously, Sir Paul was featured in that song). Next you have the album-titled single itself, one that needs no further explanation except for the fact it's video along with a style no one had ever heard before, including a rap by Vincent Prince, lead Thriller to become at one time and another, the greatest selling album in the world (battingly continuously neck-to-neck with the Eagles first greatest hits package). After, two great songs that I hopefully don't need to go into detail about as they both topped the charts at number 1, which are Beat It and Billie Jean.                                                                  The rest is pure enjoyment, something MJ has been able to lend to us again and again for almost 4 decades now. No matter how bad he is inflicted in the news and media or how horrible his albums do, there can only be one King Of Pop. I don't think we've seen it all yet.<br />and Cranky Reviewer...just to let you know, Jusitfied was 2003. Thriller was 1982. This remastered version was in 2001. Ya know, just a little heads up there.
6305428425|5.0|I got this movie when I was remodeling and frustrated with the progress that was being made.  This movie instantly cheered me up.  Romy and Michele may be the stereotype of dumb blondes, but the movie can sure make you laugh.<br />&quot;I invented Post-Its.&quot;
B000002MUN|4.0|While it would be helpful to like Tom Petty to appreciate &quot;Wildflowers,&quot; I think this is an excellent album regardless, with a good balance of slow and fast, soft and loud songs. It suprised me that just the more mellow songs made it on the Top 40 list, so anyone buying this album might be surprised when they get to some of the heavier songs such as &quot;Honey Bee.&quot;  Overall, this is probably one of Petty's best albums in the last few years better than Echo and what I've heard of &quot;The Last DJ.&quot;  I would recommend the soundtrack to a forgettable movie, &quot;She's the One&quot; because Petty did all the music for it.

B00003CXDD|5.0|First of all, I really like this movie.<BR>I think it has a lot going for it with its story and characters and so on.<BR>I was wondering if George Lucas (along with Director Ron Howard) would ever consider going back to this one and redoing some of the effect shots and trim and add things and create a ``DIRECTOR'S CUT'' of this film, sort of like what Lucas did with his original STAR WARS films where he had new effect shots done and added scenes he originally shot but had to cut out for one reason or another.<BR>With more and more Director's Cuts making it on DVD, I think the time would be right to revisit WILLOW and redo the film adding scenes that were shot but had to be disregarded and expand the movie (without having to worry about time limits).<BR>I have read articles on different websites about a number of scenes which were cut originally from WILLOW and felt a couple of them could help the story.<BR>A couple of things I have read about have included scenes where Willow is about to row to the island of Fin Raziel and a boy comes out of the lake warning him to stay away and dives back into the water. After on the island, Willow and Fin Raziel are coming back to shore and are caught in a big storm (presumely caused by the evil Queen Bavmorda). The boy comes back and transforms into a monsterous fish and attacks the boat. Willow has to use one of his magic acorns to stop the monster. Remember as the movie plays now, we never saw what happened to the last magic acorn as it seems Willow only used his second one against Bavmorda. There was another that got cut in the editing process which could have added drama to the fact he used his last one against the evil queen.<br />Another scene I have read about deals with Sorsha's father, the good king of Tir Asleen. I have read things where Sorsha inherited both good and evil tendancies from her parents. Seeing her father held captive in her mother's spell along with all the other `frozen' people of Tir Asleen helps her turn to the good side. I have also read her father was able to communicate with her asking for help from inside his encased prison which contributed to her change of heart.<br />I read there was more to the fight between Bavmorda and Fin Raziel towards the end of the film.<br />There were a number of other cut scenes I have found listed dealing with Kael, Bavmorda, Sorsha, Madmartigan and others, but I picked a couple I thought could add something to a more detailed cut of the movie. I am sure there are more that can be worked out.<br />As Peter Jackson has found out with his ``Lord of the Rings'' films, there is an audience for more detailed cuts of many films.<br />The DVD format has really embraced the notion of director's cut editions.<br />WILLOW was one of the most requested titled to be put in the DVD format and has sold well over the last two years since its DVD release.<br />I think there would definitely be an audience out there who would embrace an more detailed cut of this movie.<br />In an interview with Lucas on the release of the ``Special Edition Star Wars'' films, Lucas said films are never really complete, they end up escaping. He went back to the STAR WARS films to bring them closer to what he wanted.<br />I think the DVD format would allow Howard and Lucas the chance to take another look at this film, correct any mistakes they feel are evident and recut it adding some scenes which help flesh out the story more and maybe trim some others which slow things down. (Just a suggestion, we don't need so many close up shots of the little girl - it is a little distracting.)<br />New scenes could include new special effects shots as well as dialogue looping if necessary. I think Lucas has the technology to take what they have and, with Howard's help, make this movie a true classic for fantasy fans.<br />Since it is likely a sequel will be more and more unlikely, I think Lucas and Howard should go back and really make this movie the best it can be.<br />It would give fans something to enjoy, Howard and Lucas can bring the movie closer to what they wanted and it would make a studio a nice little profit. (Don't forget, WILLOW was one of the most requested titles for the DVD format. Imagine what a new edition could do for sales.)<br /> The movie is great and I hope many of the cut scenes I have read about will make it into the movie someday in a special `special edition.'
B000002KGT|5.0|Although I am only 18 and was not around when the band hit their heyday, I have to admit that this is a masterpiece of an album if I ever saw one. Every song perfectly reflects the sound the band has come to be known for. From Lindsey Buckingham's energetic &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, to Stevie Nick's haunting &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; to Christine McVie's beautiful ballad &quot;Songbird&quot;, you're sure to find a song that suits you.
B000002KHB|1.0|After hearing this album again 20yrs later, it still doesn't go any where.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|First off,I'd would like to say that I prefer this album to Britney's previous albums, because ,in my opinion , her previous ones had essentially four or five outstading songs and the rest were fillers. This album is a dance-pop album and has only two ballads. In this album , there aren't any fillers to me, since all songs are great. This album is a huge progression from her previous albums. The example of this are the songs : &quot;Showdown&quot;,&quot;Breath on me&quot; and &quot;Touch of my hand&quot;. These are also my favorite songs.Other songs are:&quot;Brave new girl&quot;and &quot;Toxic&quot; ,which are reminescenct of her previous recordings, only with a new make-over.The two only ballads are:&quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;. The former is a beautiful song written by her and THE MATRIX  and the latter is a touching song about her break-up. Note that this songs are much better than the ballads of her previous albums. All of this makes a true fantastic albums and better than her previous ones.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I was so impressed with this effort through the first 10 tracks that I almost did'nt want to hear the last cut...(some ambient, instrumental filler to close things out??) Especially after how &quot;The Piano&quot; delicately, hypnotically christened the CD. But then we get &quot;Following the Sun&quot;. This cut is undeniably great! It should be heard everywhere before the next year comes to an end. Forget about your pre-dispositions and fears that Enigma is broadening their scope and may find an even larger audience. If you are &quot;Elitist&quot; about following Cretu, consider this; &quot;Sadeness&quot;, &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;, and now &quot;Following the Sun&quot; is a CAREER of achievement all by itself. We are always so biased by what we've already heard in music. If those three songs were being heard for the first time today by some unheard-of-talent the interest would be overwhelming! Ruth Ann and Andru are part that talent and they are excellent. Voyaguer is NOT some big departure. It is an embodiment of what has come before and a (less-sampled) vision of the next leap. Normally, an average collection for most artists. In this case... almost perfection. You've caught Enigma in transition and they are really comfortable with it. I hope &quot;Following the Sun&quot; plays loud somewhere. Very loud. It is crafty. It is a new signature that is strategically accessible and wonderful...  1:30- Cretu explodes his vocal on the record and now you listen. Ruth Ann is suddenly a beatiful voice upon her re-intro... 3:20- An ambient Celtic tinge softly dances it's way in... 4:23- A slightly-compressed vocal harmony climaxes the production... we wish this song could &quot;stretch-on&quot; a little longer but it's time for the fade-out. A haunting fade-out that leaves us wanting more. And by design. The truth here, is that Cretu and Co. have evolved and expanded in ways that I guess even some die-hard fans cannot fully appreciate.
B0000TB050|5.0|I have been a loyal fan since 1988. I've seen them live 8 times live (which is not a lot compared to some, but still a good amount) and own pretty much everything you can get your hands on. This show is by far one of the most emotional and powerful shows I have seen them perform. It is also the first time that I was brought to slight tears by watching a rock and roll video (understand that Bono's father passed away the week prior. (&quot;Communication. Talk to each other.&quot;))  Even my friend's wife, who hates all concert videos in general, was drawn into this one (My friend said that he had never seen her do this before with a concert video). I won't go into all the details, you can read some of the prior reviews for that.  I'm just a 15 year fan throwing in my hearty approval.<br />Oh, this DVD is obviously much better than the televised version a year ago. That broadcast only played a few of the songs and interrupted them with endless commericals.<br />Also, for those wondering why &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; is included as a bonus feature...it is because the director felt that it did not fit with emotion of the rest of the concert.  I agree with his decision. You do get to see Bono's daughter come on the stage at the end (Eve) which is fun.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I enjoy this album, especially push. I am a sucker myself for extremely pretty love songs, and that is a really great one. The other songs are also very nice, i also enjoyed answer too. My favorite songs end up being the ones where there is love involved. But, overall, this album is better than surfacing, but not as magnificant as the others. Its definetley worth buying, and I was not dissapointed. Her voice is her voice and i will always be a fan of that.
0792157869|5.0|After having taken a definitively dark turn in 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, director Steven Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas decided that the third installment of the series should be thrilling, lighter in tone and more upbeat and humorous.  In other words, they wanted to recreate the Saturday-matinee serial fun of Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br />Lucas, Menno Meyjes and screenwriter Jeffrey Boam wrote a story that once again sent the archaeologist/adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) on the quest for another legendary artifact -- the Holy Grail.  And to avoid the inevitable \\"ho hum, been there, done that\\" syndrome that sequels often suffer from, they decided to include a father-son dynamic to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade by casting Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones.<br />Although Last Crusade follows the basic structure -- borrowed from the James Bond series -- of the other movies by starting the film with the end of a previous adventure before introducing the main storyline, the film tweaks the formula by showing us Indy's first big adventure...in 1912 Utah, when the future archaeology professor is a Boy Scout (literally) living with his widowed father, Henry Jones.  While on a Boy Scouting sojourn in the mountainous desert, young Indy (River Phoenix) wanders into a cave and sees a group of ruffians pilfering the long-lost Cross of Coronado.  \\"That cross is an important artifact,\\" Indy says to a fellow Boy Scout.  \\"It belongs in a museum.\\"  Indy sends his friend for help, steals the Cross of Coronado from the ruffians, but ends up being chased as he attempts to escape on foot, horseback and even a circus train.  (One of the best scenes in the series: the handsome rogue who was hired to find the Cross by the collector known in the credits as \\"Panama Hat\\" tells Indy, \\"You lost today, kid.  But that doesn't mean you have to like it.\\"  And in a show of admiration for the kid's spunk and courage, takes off his hat and places it on Indy's head.  Spielberg holds the camera on the hat, and in the blink of an eye, we flash forward 26 years and to the conclusion of Indy's search for the Cross of Coronado.)<br />After this exciting prologue, The Last Crusade gets underway when American millionaire Walter Donovan (The Empire Strikes Back's Julian Glover) commissions Indy to find the missing leader (and his important papers) of Donovan's Holy Grail recovery team.  Several clues have been found near Ankara, clues that might lead to the location of the legendary cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper -- a cup that also caught some of His blood at the Crucifixion.  But when Indy temporizes, Donovan tells him the identity of the missing team leader...and our favorite archaeologist/adventurer starts out on yet another globe-trotting trek to chase an ancient treasure.<br />Soon, Indiana Jones, his friend and boss Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott), Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody) -- a young, sexy Austrian archaeologist who works for Donovan -- and Indy's friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) set off on a quest to find the legendary Grail.<br />Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with its crisp script, thrilling music by John Williams, fine directing by Spielberg and a convincing chemistry between Ford and Connery, is one of the best action films made in the 1980s, and its recent release on DVD proves that it, like the other films in the series, has aged well.on Indy's head.

Sonny really has nothing going for him whatsoever, his girlfriend has just left him and now he has to support a hyper, five year old running throughout his apartment. This movie takes on a more happy loving feel than other dumb funny Sandler movies. Renee Zelwegger plays Sonny's new girlfriend who loves Julian, and loves Sonny. This movies happy feeling is sure to have a smile across your face for the majority of it and has a great ending, and will also make you laugh throughout much of it.
B000002LUB|4.0|You gotta love the 'subliminal' message they put in the original version of \\"Time Machine\\" at 1:46--\\"Black Sabbath's great!\\" (in the right channel). Check it out for yourself. That sort of thing just reveals their desperation to make us accept this album. Turns out they didn't need to resort to such questionable, manipulative tactics, because this is one HEAVY record. It's the heaviest Sabbath album up to that point in time, as Iommi gets back to the evil, doomy riffs that he hadn't played since perhaps War Pigs and Geezer Butler absolutely shreds on the bass as never before.<BR>Lyrically it's typical DIO fare, but with a little extra evil and anger thrown in for good measure. \\"Computer God\\" discusses in frightening detail the increasing control that microchips have over us; \\"After All\\" is a doomy tune about death, I guess; \\"TV Crimes\\" is a great anathema toward televangelists, a bit of \\"right back at ya!\\" from RJD; \\"Letters From Earth\\" is a bit cryptic in its message, but the title comes from a similarly named Mark Twain story in which Satan is writing letters to his pals in heaven reporting to them about how ludicrous humanity is; \\"Master of Insanity\\" rocks evilly; \\"Time Machine\\", the tune of subliminal significance, is a little bit on the happier side, yet still heavy--the obvious commercial track on here; \\"Sins of the Father\\", despite the promising title, borders on filler; \\"Too Late\\", a slow, ominous track which bounces from acoustic to ultra-heavy, is about the consequences of selling your soul to the devil--excellent song, maybe the best here; \\"I\\" is classic headbanger promoting that most high of satanic virtues 'selfishness'; and closer \\"Buried Alive\\" is a heavy but bizarre track with some unusual riffing, and more church-scathing lyrics (\\"The choir sings the neverending lie!\\"). Actually, the Wayne's World version of \\"Time Machine\\" closes the album, but it's barely different than the original. At least, it doesn't have obvious subliminal message.<BR>So, except for the occasional acoustic guitar on \\"Too Late\\", this is pretty much a heavy metal-fest all the way through, and one of the band's best. Definitely the best album since \\"Mob Rules\\", and makes the previous releases seem quite pallid and soft.
0788816454|3.0|While funny at times, this movie is only OK at best. Some of the characters are absolutley ridiculous such as Bobby's girlfriend Vicki Valencourt, a car stealing bandit who loves Bobby for what he is and Farmer Fran, the redneck assistant football coach. This movie depicts bumbling, intelligence challenged Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) and his life as waterboy for Louisiana University. But his life is dramatically changed when he is fired by the mean spirited coach for getting in the way. Bobby's understatedly overprotected mom is thrilled and thinks this is the best thing since sliced bread, but Bobby is devestated. He sets out to find a new waterboying job, and is accepted at small bayou school S.C.L.S.U. One day Bobby is made fun of and literally snaps, he runs at the assailant and decks him, this earns him a spot on the team, but he can't tell his mom because she will not allow him to play. As one can easily see, this movie has absolutley no plot or story line and is definitley not Adam Sandler at his best, that is Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore.
B00005Y7NK|4.0|After the miscarriage of &quot;Seventh Star&quot; and the utter confusion on &quot;Eternal Idol&quot;, Tony Iommi decided to go back to what people wanted to hear from his band: purely evil Heavy F'n Metal! <BR>The music is dark and powerful, and the lyrics are equally demonic, though occasionaly border on self-parody with the &quot;Satan&quot; overkill. But who cares? At least it's Tony Iommi composing in his most preferred style.<BR>A big kick in the pants to these songs is the drumming of new Sabbath recruit (but hard rock drum legend) Cozy Powell, who was probably the best drummer ever for Sabbath with his powerful cannon volleys yet tasteful style.<BR>Also on deck is Queen guitarist, and good buddy of Tony Iommi, Brian May, who performs the guitar solo on &quot;When Death Calls&quot;. <BR>Vocalist Tony Martin, though able to carry a tune, is not quite the optimal singer for songs of this nature. His voice is too clean for lyrics like these, sapping them of any aggression they should have had. Without the maniacal edge of Ozzy's early voice, or the aggressive gruffness of Dio's voice, the songs suffer from campiness when sung by a guy who'd be better off singing pop songs.<BR>Produced by Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell, the sonic effect of the album is adequate, with its huge guitars and drums, but is a little washed out with reverb it seems. Yet that's a minor complaint when compared to how good it is to have them back playing some decent music which can definitely, finally, be classified as HEAVY METAL. Without Geezer's bass playing it lacks that final element to make it a Sabbath classic, but it's way better than the previous couple of albums, which didn't even deserve the Sabbath name.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...]  Let it be Naked , from my point of view, is more an album that Let it be the soundtrack. My preference deeping in songs would depend in each song. Is complementary anyhow. And Let it be (both versions) as an album is very strong, I don't know why some consider it a weak album. It contains Get Back, Let it be, Across the Universe, The Long ans winding Road, I've got a feeling and now, Don't  let me down. This are very strong songs.   This era of the Beatles, beside that was not the best in spirit,   musically is absolutetely great (including first solo efforts ).
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was a fan of Britney back when her first and second albums came out. Then, the whole bubble gum pop phase began to wear out for me. I didn't buy the third album by her because I knew some of the songs and I didn't care for the whole poppish vibe. Now, however, her songs are completely different. She seemed to move on from the poppish-bubbly princess songs, and her music is a lot more mature. She's more clubbish/fast paced music that's GREAT for dancing and just keeping a good beat. The album is great In my opinion. My favorite tracks are &quot;Everytime&quot; - which is a beautiful ballad thats hows off how Britney DOES have a voice, and &quot;Toxic&quot; which is a very upbeat song (like most of her album) that demonstrates how fun her music really is.<br />All in all, I rated the album 5/5. HUGE improvement. Good job Britney.

0783114222|5.0|I was born in July of 1968, and my &quot;birthday present&quot; for my first birthday was the landing of Apollo 11.  So by the time of the death of manned space exploration, I was having my First Communion.  Then came along &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, a film that truly had THE RIGHT STUFF and made me hunger for more to learn about the history of space that occured during my lifetime.  Then came &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, showing that people did not give a darn anymore about space, unless it was a matter of life or death, and this gave impetus to the star of the film to take the same quality of &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and do the best possible in showing the entire story of travels &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.  This along with growing up with the PBS series from Carl Sagan, &quot;Cosmos&quot; gave me a great love for aerospace.  I graduated from High School soon after the Challenger exploded, and as a 35 year old retired and disabled adult the Columbia was lost.  But I hope that this is not the death of manned space missions, and the return to manned space exploration will occur hopefully with a permanent return to the Moon, perhaps outposts on Mars, and beyond.
B00005JLH3|5.0|I'm admittedly biased -- I played in the marching band in college, and I am an alumni brother of Kappa Kappa Psi (unlike the non-existent Atlanta A&T, the band fraternity portrayed in the movie is NOT ficticious).  As an \\"old school\\" person who prefers classical, jazz, and classic rock to today's hip hop and pop, I'll admit that I had a few doubts when I rented this movie, but as a former band person (and a KKPsi brother), I felt obligated to watch it.    Wow!  I was (pleasantly) shocked!    Contrary to what one previous reviewer said (trashing the movie and saying \\"there's no plot\\") there in fact IS a plot.  I saw a lot of myself reflected in Devin's (sp?) character -- a cocky freshman with a lot of talent trying to make his mark in a collegiate marching band.  Through the movie, he comes of age and realizes that band is indeed a team sport, collaborating with his rival (the section leader Sean) to write a new show, and helping his fellow drummer (the character played by GQ whose name I don't remember) regain his spot on the line.    There is a great deal of spirit and tension in this movie.  Even in the \\"special features,\\" the director mentioned that \\"this is a sports movie, and the sport is band.\\"  As a fan of sports movies, I'm inclined to agree.    In fact, I was so taken by this movie that here I am writing a review for it -- and adding it to my Amazon wish list!
B0000CC5CS|5.0|A visual stunner to rival any ever produced, &quot;Terminator 3&quot; may also be the best movie of the series so far.  Bigger and badder than the original, and smarter than the first sequel, &quot;T3&quot; ups the ante in every area: action, plotting, and above all, special effects.  There a ton of scenes in this movie that you just have to see to believe, none more so than an early car chase that is easily among the most gripping action sequences ever conceived.  Fistfights and shootouts are just the beginning: everything is more intense here, with even fewer reprieves interspersed to give the viewer some time to breathe.<br />Even the villain is a lot cooler: this time around, Arnold's T-101 has to protect the luckless John Connor from the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), which is an even tougher nut to crack than the T-1000 from &quot;Terminator 2.&quot;  It's made of the same liquid metal, it can control other machines, and its arms form all kinds of destructive weaponry, including a flamethrower, a machine gun, and some other weapon that I can't quite identify but it looks freakin' great.  She slices, she dices, and she even puts her fist through one poor guy's stomach in one of those &quot;I didn't just see that, did I?&quot; scenes.  Plus, I can't help but be amused at the idea of an merciless, futuristic killing machine taking the form of a hot blond chick in a quasi-dominatrix outfit.  &quot;Alien vs. Predator?&quot;  Ha!  The Terminatrix is scarier than both of them, and makes for much better scenery as well.<br />The plot is a bit of a reach, but hey, the plot of every &quot;Terminator&quot; movie could probably make you bang your head against a wall of you thought about it too hard.  The initial judgement day of 1994 has been averted, but those pesky machines aren't giving up so easily, as they send the Terminatrix back after John Connor for yet another shot at the future leader of the human resistance.  Unfortunately, the humans don't have quite the technology that the machines do, so they have to send back another Arnold-resembling T-101 to serve as John's protection.  There's a catch as well, in the form of John's future wife Kate (the ever-cute Claire Danes), who it turns out is as important to the future war effort as John is.  In one of John's rare strokes of luck it turns out they're fated to get together, although Kate has to first endure the sight of what she thinks is her fiance morphing into the Terminatrix before her very eyes in a genuinely creepy moment.<br />However, while the plot of the movie is definitely commendable, it's not exactly integral.  What's more important is that &quot;T3&quot; manages to keep the series fresh with a sense of humor that the first two installments definitely could have used.  Arnold's deadpan expression and wooden line-reading actually turn out to be assets here, imbuing such potentially cringe-inducing lines as &quot;Talk to the hand,&quot; &quot;My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding,&quot; and &quot;I'm back!&quot; (wink wink) with wit and irony.  And there's a throwaway scene involving a pair of sunglasses that's brutally hilarious to anyone who's seen the first two movies.  Another highlight is Earl Boen's return as the hapless Dr. Silberman, in a cameo that pushes the concept of self-referential humor to Simpsonian lengths.<br />While &quot;T3&quot; was almost certainly intended to be a cash cow (which it very much was), it still feels like a logical progression from its predecessors, and not just because it had such a bigger budget.  With its undertones of fate and its foreboding of an apocalyptic war zone of a future, the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise is simultaneously more compelling than the &quot;Alien&quot; series and less hokey than &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  Part of me hopes there are no more sequels, because if &quot;T3&quot; is the end it's a very good one.

B000050FEN|5.0|This is one of the best movies in the serial killer genre who can only be matched by &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; I found myself deeply involved with every aspect of this film from the beginning to the brilliant ending. The more you watch this film the more you grow to appreciate the intellegent writting and directing that makes Se7en what it is.<br />Morgan Freeman is outstanding (as always) playing the embittered Det. Somerset who can't wait to retire and Brad Pitt is his equal playing Det. Mills, a new detective to the area who wants to save the world. Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, and R. Lee Ermey are also great as the supporting cast. <br />The concept is one of the most original that I have seen or read in a long time. Although many were put off by the constant dreary surroundings and the extremely cruel and unusual killings I think this is what makes the movie. I admit that one has to cringe at some of the horrific acts of violence on the part of the serial killer but this is what brings it home to the audience. This film makes you think about human nature in more ways than one which makes the brutality of the killings almost less in comparison to the psychological effects left on all the characters (and audience) involved.<br />Se7en has set the bar for all future films in this genre to look up to. I'm sure if you view this film you will be just as enthralled as I was.<br />The DVD is great in widescreen and has a whole disk full of special features that will keep you watching far after the film is over.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is not scary, for those people that say that 'it's to scary for little kids!' Grow up!  For crying out loud, this movie is pure brilliance.  The humor is great for everyone, and the story, yes, it is, deep.  The characters at delightful (I shall call him squishy!), Dory, Marlin, Gill, Deb (and her sister Flo:-) ) and all of the other &quot;named&quot; characters are a hoot to watch.  Every fish has their own personality.  This movie is all about trust.  And for those over-bearing and protective parents, if the movie does scare your little child, how on earth do you expect them to live in the real world?
B00005LOUP|1.0|As someone who worshiped the original animated version of this film, I can only say that this film has irrevocably soiled the image of Dr. Suess.  In my opinion, this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If I could snap my fingers and make this terrible film go away forever, I would, in a heartbeat. Shame on you Opie!!
0385504209|3.0|Your reaction to this book will completey depend on your expectations. If you consider yourself someone who reads purely for &quot;escape,&quot; has no literally expectations, and can let a controversial subject such as the foundation of Chrisitainity slide off your back, you will enjpy this book. It is fast-paced, and more interesting than your average thriller.<br />However, if you are reading this because the title piqued your interest and you enjoy thoughful, literally fiction or non-fiction on religion (i.e. Eco, Friedman, C. Ginzburg, Willis) you will be utterly disappointed. This text lacks sound research and is anything but literally. Brown's poor use of dialogue will bore you, his lack of depth will leave you shiveringly cold, and his simplisitc didactism, references, and conclusions will infuriate you (I was often reminded of Pirsig's doctrinaire), especially when weighed against such a serious subject.<br />The bottom line of this book is: &quot;take it for what it is worth.&quot;  However, in the final analysis, I find Brown's writing for such a controversial subject irrrepsonsible and its conclusive, matter-of-fact air disturbing. I may sound elitist, but I worry about this becoming the &quot;Love Story&quot; of religious understanding.
B000089RVR|5.0|Some might say that would add a bit of excitement, but serious, I've always wanted to ask that question! I don't understand her name and certainly find it attention grabbing. One word in one country is normal like the name &quot;Randy&quot; in the U.S. is common but it means something totally different in the UK. (grin) Perhaps &quot;Dido&quot; is one of those words? Makes for interesting marketing. Anyway, now that I've finally gotten THAT out of the way!<br />On to the music, it's some of the best haunting music you will listen to, not irritating, a bit like Enya vocally, a bit like a dreamweaver. The only complaint I have is that she sounds a bit too much like Sarah Mclachlan, other than that she's got some good stuff on here. A good cd, a must have, great to have playing while you have dinner guests over or someone special. &quot;White Flag&quot; is one of my favorites, chilling. &quot;There'll be no white flag up on my door, I'm in love and I always will be&quot;.
B0000C1733|4.0|Hoohoohoo! This CD is pretty good to very good.<BR>Let me talk about this good points first. Those songs have shown the really rock style of R.H.C.P. Like &quot;Otherside&quot;&amp;&quot;Give me away&quot;&amp;&quot;Suck me Kiss&quot;. I've never heard them before, but they are exceptional good. The lyrics are perfectly made, as well as the songs are catchy. Yip! Everything seems nice, but I won't give them a 5-stars.... because:<br />1. Although the songs are good, but the songs arrangement can be considered as &quot;POOR&quot;. The connection for each songs are not good at all since they go very hot and rock, and then have a slow decent melody after it.<br />2. The DVD- the little flaw is that there's no really some &quot;takes&quot; on Anthony or John or Flea or other scenes about the related video. They just played the MTV one more time which's very boring and disappointing.  They control of DVD is very complicated and it takes more than time to get from the Main Menu to where you want.<br />Overall Performance? Still Good. I am not really a huge fans of R.H.C.P, but I think both fans of R.H.C.P and not the fans of it would like it since the video is good (You can watch a lot of MTV with great visual Quality) and listen to all the very best. The only thing you should ignore is the linkage of each song.<br />Thanks.

B0000E1WKE|2.0|i've been a huge fan of whitney from the beginning, and i still am.  But her voice HAS changed, and altho i agree with the reviewers who say that it is more mature and emotive, unfortunately it is ALSO more hoarse and scratchy.  I was looking forward so much to putting this album in and pressing play, but i was quite dissapointed with it.  It would have been so much better recorded a few years ago.  And i certainly agree with the reviewer who says that they shouldn't have included those 2 older tracks at the end, as it certainly does illustrate just how much her voice has deteriorated. (although for people who don't have the preachers wife album they're still fantastic songs!)  <br />However....this album does grow on you.  you'll find yourself humming whitney's versions of these classics, and reaching for her album over and over again!<br />it's not the best christmas album out there - not by a long way, but for fans of hers it's definitely worth buying.  I would very much recommend Mariah's &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; and Celine's &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; if you want to hear some fantastic female vocals wrapped round christmas songs.  also, &quot;A Very Ally Christmas&quot; is an absolutely wonderful christmas album, even more so if you've watched every episode a hundred times like me!  <br />Merry Christmas everyone
B00008AWOD|5.0|I just got 'Placebo's' latest album 'Sleeping with Ghosts' about 4 days ago and cannot take it out of my cd player.  I have only removed it to put in my car, personal, or home cd players.  <br />Anyway I am really enjoying listening to the album.<br />The album consists of 12 tracks.  There is one slow ballad with mostly keyboards called 'Centerfolds'.  'Special Needs' is sort of a ballad that kicks into a synth/slightly distorted guitar/slightly electronic effects added song and then kicks into a distorted guitar/synth instrumental and then back into the original form with strong distorted guitar added.  It is a really beautiful song.  'I'll be yours' is sort of a slower/ballad type song with cool almost jungle sounding drums/cool clean electric guitar with some cool hauntingly distorted synths towards the end.    <br />A couple of cool synth/electronica/rock/glam songs like 'English Summer Rain' which has a really cool progression of synths and guitars and nice drumming.  The cool techno effect in the background reminds me of something from 'George Michael's' 'Faith Album'.  'This Picture' really showcases Brian Molko's vocal range with cool synths/bass/and guitar.  'Sleeping with ghosts' has some cool vocal effects, nice acoustic guitar a funky bassline, and sweet synths.  'The Bitter End' has cool synths and clean electric guitar and a sweet bassline and latter kicks into an all out rocker.  It is another song that really showcases Brian's vocals.  My absolute favorite song reminds me of something from 'Depeche Mode's' 'Home' album because of the cool synths and menacing guitar it is called 'Protect Me from what I want'.  <br />Total all out monster stompers like the intro song instrumental 'Bulletproof Cupid'.  'Plasticine' is a cool rock song.  I like the lyrics 'Don't forget to be the way you are'.  Sort of like a 'Suede' monster stomper.  'Second Sight' is a rock song with Brian again singing very strong on the chorus.  There are cool synths as well as guitar in the song.     <BR>      <br />'Something Rotten' is sort of an electronica/synth/eastern sounding song with a sort of haunting melody and Brian almost just speaking the lyrics.  Then it kicks into a full on assault of drums/electronica and then back to the original haunting melody. <br />Basically this album consists of 12 gems of songs.  Each song is beautiful with heartfelt lyrics/ extremely strong vocals/strong (guitar/bass/syths, and drums).  Each song is made very strong and the album seems to very cohesive.  I have to say this is my favorite album right now.<br />I feel the keyboards/synths have added a lot to this album that give it a much better sound then the basic guitar/bass/drum band.<br />BTW, if you buy the limited edition import it has a bonus disk of 10 or so covers done by Placebo of groups like 'The Pixies' and 'Depeche Mode'.<br />Kevin

B00009TB5G|5.0|This DVD, with 43 min of new and extended scenes is awesome! I absolutely love it. The new scenes really make everything flow better, ecspecially if someone has not read the books(you should, they are amazing). This also includes some footage with the actors and stunt people talking which is really interesting and funny. I give this three thumbs up!
B00003CXTG|1.0|two guys fall in love with the same girl, and it strains their friendship. oh and just so you know the Japanese bomb...some ships. this movie was [awful] when it came out, and now after everythings happened, this movie just looks worse and even more pathetic. the only ups are the special effects and...special effects. this movie misses the point by such a margine its offensive.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As all have stated before me, this is an excellent concert, great having two DVDs in the box, fantastic camera work and sound reproduction, but I have one question. Who is the female vocalist on Horse to Water with Jools Holland? She gets no credit anywhere on the box as far as I can see and she has a fabulous voice. WHO IS SHE? I want to buy some CDs by her if I can find out who she is. Other than that, this is a must have release.
B000002UAU|5.0|It is hard now to comprehend how revolutionary this album sounded when it was first released.Few records before or since have had the wide ranging influence of Sgt. Pepper. It is the Beatles masterpiece. Much more than a collection of wonderful songs this ,the original concept album. changed the course of Rock music history. There are milestones in classical music and there are milestone recordings in jazz. This is Rock's essential milestone recording.
B000089RVX|4.0|A friend at work loaned me this CD and by the 6th song, I knew I was going to buy it.  This band is amazing and they are incredible live (I had the pleasure of seeing them in Mesa, AZ earlier in the summer).  The more I hear the songs, the more I like them.  It's positively unfair that anyone as young as Ben Moody and Amy Lee should be such accomplished and imaginative songwriters.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for them and their music.<BR>However, having lavished deserving praise on them, I have three complaints.  One, this album is not in the optimal running order (should be \\"Haunted,\\" \\"Taking Over Me,\\" \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" \\"Going Under,\\" \\"Hello,\\" \\"Everybody's Fool,\\" \\"My Last Breath,\\" \\"Taking Over Me,\\" \\"Tourniquet,\\" \\"Imaginary,\\" \\"Whisper\\" and \\"My Immortal\\").  I hope whoever determined the running order of the songs is overriden next time.  The band opened and (nearly) closed their concert correctly so I assume they know better.  Secondly, too many of the songs are the same moderate tempo and drenched in minor scales.  It wears on you.  True, the songs are in a variety of keys and the melodies and lyrics are distinct but unless you're scrutinizing the album, it mines too much of the same general emotional territory and wears on the listener.  Let's hope for some more variety in the tempo and scale departments next time.  Third, although it makes for potent and melodramatic lyrical imagery, there are only so many ways to explore the themes of death and dying before they, too, become monotonous.<BR>None of these criticisms changes the fact that this was by a mile the best album I heard in 2003.  If the next CD is half as good as this one was, it'll still be a must-buy.  Based on what I saw and heard live, it wouldn't suprise me if they manage to surpass it.  I can only hope!
B000002H72|5.0|Yes, that's right, quite simply the KING of alternative rock, the master of all, the blueprint for 90s rock, and of course one hell of a listen. If Doolittle doesn't convert you to the Pixies, then nothing will, you sad, sad individual. PS - Debaser = best Pixies song ever.
B00008S2VG|2.0|It hurts to read so many reviews that automatically pass this album off as if it were the &quot;Gigli&quot; of the music world in 2003, especially since that is really not true.  Admittingly, it is the worst Madonna record I have heard, but there are definitely a few highlights that save this album from being truely disasterous.<br />&quot;American Life&quot; is a decent upbeat song and fun to listen to, though not really dance-able or anything.  For a title track, it is on the weak side, but still can be enjoyed.  &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is undoubtedly the stand-out track on this record.  The lyrics are touching and the overall message is superb.  A soft ballad of sorts to warm the heart and embrace the positivity of relationships.  <br />Yes, I was and still am disappointed by this album, but that does not mean it is a complete failure.
B000000H4V|5.0|Sepultura emerged from Brazil in the mid80s as a strong death metal group suffering from poorly produced albums. In 1989 they released Beneath the Remains, a very strong thrash album in the vain of a heavier Metallica. On 1991's ARISE they played great thrash but added some sounds from their native Brazil. In 1993 the boys from Brazil released this hard hitting, masterpiece. They finally play to their full potential and emerge as one of the best bands in metal history. This album & ROOTS are 2 of the best ever metal albums and even surpass Metallica & Slayer. The production is perfect & all of the instruments sound great. Max Cavalera has the best voice in metal, period. He growls powerfully with out it sounding cheesy like most other death metal \\"singers\\". His rythmn guitar is also flawless. Plus his lyrics are about injustice, corruption, anger, hate and are much better than the cliche doom and gloom lyrics most Death metal groups bark at you. Igor Cavalera is the best drummer in metal period. NO drummer has his ability to hit so hard and play so fast. On this album he adds lots of little touches instead of the same unrelenting beat his peers are stuck with. Andreas throws in some blistering guitar solos backed up by Paulo's able bass. They begin adding some jungle sounds that will be expanded upon on thier follow up ROOTS.<br />1. Refuse/Resist. 10/10 Starts off fast, pounding and angry.<br />2. Territory. 10/10 My favorite song on the album. Great drum start then the band joins the party. Masterpiece.<br />3. Slave New World. 10/10 Short burst of heavy thrash.<br />4. Amen. 9/10 Not as fast as the others but great mood and still is very heavy.<br />5. Kaiowas. 10/10 Nice quiet break then the band plays acoustic guitars with Brazillian drumming. The drumming is outstanding.<br />6. Propaganda. 9/10 Great song, I love the slow pounding drum solo towards the end.<br />7. Biotech is Godzilla. 8/10 Silly tittle but short fast song about how the powers that be will use biotechnology for their own greedy needs.<br />8. Nomad. 8/10 Good song. Igor sure can pound on those drums.<br />9. We Who Are Not As Others. 8/10 Basically an intrsumental. Tight.<br />10. Manifest. 10/10 Angry song about a brutal prison massacre in Brazil and the cover up by the government.<br />11. The Hunt. 9/10 This is a cover song they make their own. Fast and perfect.<br />12. Clenched Fist. 8/10 Great album closer.<br />Bonus tracks<BR>13. Chaos BC. Remix of Refuse/Resist with mixed results.<BR>14. Kaiowas. Recorded with a Brazilian tribe deep in the Rain Forest. Outstanding.<BR>15. Territory (live). It must have been fun to be in the mosh pit for this.<BR>16. Amen/Innerself (live). Great blend of Amen from this album and Innerself from Beneath the Remains.<br />Sepultura with Max was a great band. They played thrash/death metal better than anyone else while adding great lyrics against the establishment of any government that doesn't take care of its poor citizens. They would only make one more great album before this lineup dissolved. If you are new to Sepultura by all means start here, you can't go wrong. Must have to be a diehard Sepultura fan.
B000127LW2|3.0|This was a decent series, although I am more impressed by Deep Space Nine than any of the recent (Original Series still is untouchable) Star Trek shows.<br />However, regardless of the extremely bright and cheerful packaging scheme, one can purchase these seasons knowing thankfully that Jeri Ryan is only a few box sets away.
B000002LND|5.0|Ok, so Madonna was the thing back in the 80's, and there is no question as to why.  Absolute genius is the only thing you can say about Madonna.  She had uptempo happy songs, huge dance hits, and she could sing a ballad that would make a grown man cry.  The only thing I could say that would have made this album the best greatest hits collection ever, was the addition of &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;.  Someone please tell me how this song was not included on the album, because that song was immaculate in it's own right.  Otherwise, this album is just centimeters behind the Eagles Greatest Hits 1971-1975 album.  Great job!!
B00007ELEL|5.0|The Coen brothers followed their kidnapping blunder movie in Minnesota (Fargo) with this kidnapping blunder movie set in Los Angeles. (Add Raising Arizona and you have a trilogy.) They threw together a dozen different ideas, loosely strung into a needlessly complex plot. The main characters were inspired by real people. Their friend Jeff, who helped promote some of their previous films, was used as the model for Jeff Lebowski. (Like the real Jeff, he called himself The Dude.) Walter is based on John Milius, the screenwriter and director of Conan the Barbarian. Then they threw in nihilists, avant-garde art, a funny Busby Berkley-inspired dream sequence, a TV show writer in an iron lung, Saddam Hussein, a ferret in a bathtub, and lots of bowling. Just when you thought you'd seen enough unconnected characters and scenes, another one comes along. By the end, you aren't sure what happened, but you laughed a lot.<br />What does it all mean? Nothing, really. But the plot isn't the point. This is a &quot;hang out&quot; movie --- you watch so you can vicariously hang out with the Dude and Walter. The Coen brothers succeeded in making a movie as loose as its main character. The Dude doesn't care about the meaning of it all, so why should the Coens? Just keep it funny, strange, and fast. That's good enough for five stars. The extras on this DVD are okay. There's a brief documentary about making the film, including interviews with all the key actors and the directors.
B00005JLSE|2.0|This should have been made in the days when Liza Minnelli was at her peak, can you just see (hear) her as Velma?  They waited too long and as a result they are stuck with 'box-office hits' like Zeta Jones and Gere, both of whom may be good actors in their own right but are AWFUL in this travesty of a musical.  And I'm surprised that Susan Stroman didn't do a better job of choreographing &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;, I was looking forward to that, but it was such a disappointment.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended version of The Two Towers, the documentaries, and the extras offer more than I could have ever hoped for. This wonderfully executed DVD is really a pure classic, there's no other word for it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|well to start off  lets talk about the nerds who put down this cd  they all need to get a brain transplant  this cd from dream theater simply kicks a**  from the opening tune AS I AM to the final tune titled IN THE NAME OF THY FATHER  the music is an instrumental onslaught  james can keep up with mr. Petrucci and mr. portnoy and mr. myungs awesome speed  the cd has not one dull moment  dream theater has taken a new direction with this masterpiece  the addition of jordan rudess has all but completed this band  i cannot wait for there next release  if you are a fan of melodic metal abd just straight out heavy metal  then this cd is for YOU!  rock on dream theater  you never dissappointed me!

B00009ATIX|4.0|Now, I have yet to see another Steven Soderburgh film, but in a day where modern film is relegated to dishing out fast-paced, spelled-out-for-you, rehashed action plots with crazy camera angles, 30-second editing, and pointless &quot;big-star&quot; cameos, it was a refreshment to see such an elegant film as this re-telling of Stanislaw Lem's novel, Solaris. While the pacing of the film seems to be &quot;slow and boring&quot; to many people (due to it's complete lack of car chases, stereotype bashing, and toilet humor), each scene in Solrais seems (in my opinion) to be paced to perfection, setting the stage for character interactions that do exactly what each scene is supposed to do: reveal something about the characters. Each frame of this film seemed like a painting to me, which echoed the importance of the many silent sequences, utilizing a single picture to tell us so much more about the characters than can be said with the forced dialogue and watered-down character motivations that seem to plague the majority of modern American cinema. Each member of the cast gave an exquisite performance, and never before have I seen George Clooney take on such an emotional character.<br />      Solaris represents exactly what science fiction cinema should have graduated to decades ago: not laser guns, killer robots, space invaders, or lots of special effects action, but new ways of thinking. But don't let the &quot;sci-fi&quot; placement of this film fool you. This story isn't about spaceships or aliens or the fate of the universe. It's about what every good story is about: people. For those of you interested in seeing a non-traditional big-budget picture with complex characters and a far from spelled-out plot, give this film a try. For those of you who have nothing but buddy cop films, &quot;special effects extravaganzas&quot;, or cynical comedies that make you feel more intelligent than the rest of the world in your top 10, try the latest Micheal Bay or Kevin Smith films instead.
0553106635|5.0|I find myself waiting with bated breath for each new book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  It's to Martin's credit that he can create such great characters and plotting that we can't wait to see what happens next.  The books themselves are not what I'd call &quot;fantasy&quot; in the truest sense.  There are certainly fantastical elements, but these stories read more like historical fiction with the some magic thrown in. This book is the best so far.  The story throws a few curve balls and characters we've grown to care about are forever changed.  Bravo, Mr. Martin! I eagerly await the next book in the series.
B000003CMB|5.0|I first heard this album in 1971 when the fellow who was teaching me guitar at the time said: &quot;Listen to this, it's pretty hot&quot;.<br />I'm now writing in 2003, and I've lost track of the number of times I've listened to these tracks. And listening to them again today reminded me that the peak of improvisational rock guitar took place between Cream's farewell concert in 1968 and the Allman Bros' appearance at the Fillmore in 1970. <br />Has there been good music since? Of course. Even just looking at the 70s, music has graced us with Little Feat, Steely Dan, Elvis Costello and the Ramones. Not to mention Joni Mitchell at her peak and Weather Report at its most adventurous.<br />But for a moment there the blues-based, jazz-tinged work of artists like Duane Allman brought the guitar as an instrument to a level of development that really hasn't been duplicated. Sure, there are astonishing artists recording today. But their work is different. Every artist, whatever the  medium, reflects his or her time.<br />And for a few years, we were lucky to hear guys like Allman, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Lowell George build from a base that leads back to the delta of Mississippi and the Piedmont of North Carolina. A raw, emotive brand of playing that rewards the listener with a taste of the real.
0553573403|5.0|I had a lot of trouble getting into this book; in fact, I put it down twice before actually readying it through. Once I did, I was hooked.  This series of books, Game of Thrones being the first, is exceptional!  Once I got through the first few chapters, I found myself completely invested in the characters and their stories.  Martin's greatest achievement with this series of books is the characters -- they are three dimensional and highly developed, which is a rarity in fantasy fiction these days.  Some have compared Martin to Robert Jordon and I think that's a good assessment.  Martin shows the kind of character development and plot control of early Jordon books (pre Path of Daggers).  Unlike Jordon, I can only hope he's able to maintain this control.  I also hope that Martin can wrap this series up before it becomes too convoluted like the Wheel of Time series.
0385507755|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining and almost addicting (no pun intended) book. This certainly isn't a book for the children of the family due to the language.<br />   James Frey wrote a tremendously well done book. The writing style is unlike any other, most commonly compared to the author of &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;. The sentences are usually blunt and to the point, yet slide off the tongue easily. The book is a mixture of the reality of being addicted and the hilarity of it.<br />   I recommend this book to anyone. This book will take your breath away.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I watched some part of it but couldn't get all the way through. No doubt that Citizen Kane is not a great movie, it's a boring film. I usually recycle movies I don't like, but this one was tossed into the dumpster. I am just afraid someone else waste their time watching this crap!
B00008EY9G|4.0|If you loved the &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; you will certainly enjoy this<br />movie. Very good from start to finish!  I purchased it on a whim, and so glad I did, and if you are still not convinced, it was given 2 thumbs up!!
B00005JMF6|4.0|After seeing \\"Gothika\\", the above title couldn't be futher from the truth, and is highly likely to be the best horror film of 2003. Dr. Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) is a psychiatrist at a prison for the mentally insane, and has her eye on a patient, who claims to be posessed by demons, or is the devil herself. After taking a much needed rest as a result of being overstressed and overworked, some bizarre incidents occur in Dr. Grey's life. When local law enforcement officials get wind of these occurrences, they suspect Dr. Grey's not just seeing things, and suspect her of murder. One such victim is Dr. Grey's husband, Dr. Scott Grey (Charles S. Dutton), who was working on a related case at the time of his \\"disappearing act\\". Several things happen all at once in \\"Gothika\\", where, even if you pay strictly close attention, you may not be able to tell if \\"The Good Doctor\\" committed these murders, or if she was having nightmarish dreams. The local law enforcement authorities put Miranda to the test, who appear to act as accusers rather than helpers of her situation. With law enforcement officials and various others on her back about the murders, Dr. Grey finds out she is \\"NOT ALONE\\", and desperately tries to escape this vicious cycle of occurrences, whether they're real or imaginary. By letting the viewer decide whether these muders existed or not, the people involved with the making of \\"Gothika\\" were extremely careful not to insult the viewer's intelligence. \\"Gothika\\" contains many theories concerning whether or why Dr. Grey caused these murders to take place, and gets seriously hurt in the process. With so many scary scenes featured here and there, it's hard to prevent a climactic scene grom showing its' fully orchestrated colors. To make certain characters appear samey, it's as if the film's makeup artists were trying to make Halle Berry appear more caucasian, thus, making her to be a mirror image to some of the subjects featured in the storyline, which suggest the characters may be remnants of Miranda's past life, who may be coming back to haunt her. So, the answer to some burning questions, is why are these sprits making Miranda pay, and, if so, what is their motive for doing so? One such question that needs to be answered, is: Was it real, or was it all just a bad dream gone awry? To find the answer, just go and see \\"Gothika\\" for yourself. After you've eaten your holiday turkey (or ham, if you prefer), prepare to get the \\"stuffing\\" scared out of you. It's happening at your local theater today!cters may be remnants of Miranda's past life, who may be coming back to haunt her.

B00004YRQA|5.0|This is an essential part of a playstation 2 system. Without this memory card, you can't save any data, which ruins the whole point of even playing video games.<br />The quality and speed of this memory card are incredible. The loading times are much quicker than they were with the PSone. I have accidentally dropped this card once, and its still functioning flawless. <br />Do NOT be persuaded into buying 3rd party memory cards, no matter how cheap, storage capacity, and how they look. They are all low quality, and most likely will result in loss of data, or damage to your playstation 2. <br />Unlike the PSone, the PS2 memory card uses kilobytes and megabytes, like a computer, instead of blocks. You have 8 megabytes of storage. Games may take up anything from 60 KB all the way up to 900 KB. This memory card can hold, on average, 15-30 game saves, dapending on which title it is.<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Happy gaming :)<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Haven't seen the first X Men yet, but definatly will after watching this one.
B000002USN|4.0|Just loved everything about this CD. With Barbara Striesand, Anita Baker, Julio Eglesias, Tony Bennett and much much more. Just lay back, close your eyes and listen.  Very relaxing!  About time they have real music.
B00005JM02|4.0|This movie has that traditional Disney storyline, a parent dies, someone dear to the main character is lost and a quest is begun, by the end of the movie everything is right in the sea, dont get me wrong there it so much humor and beuty in this movie.  It realy is a masterpeice even if it does have a used story line.  The fish are brimming with personality and flavor so I dont see why anyone should not own this!  Even if you dont have kids!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am very impressed with the majority of the material on this CD. I say that because there are some songs that should have been left out but I want this to be a positive review! Britney's music did mature this time out and I think it is a good thing. She is no longer that little school girl. The beats are great and there are going to be some really cool remixes. Her voice is weak but it is always weak so there is point in going there. The breathy &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; is my favorite song. It is reminescent of Kylie Minoque which makes the song so interesting. The remix of &quot;MATM&quot; at the end is great. And again, everyone should also buy this CD...It is Britney!
B00007GZVS|3.0|This a very mediocre offering given the forces that the filmmakers had at their disposal.  I wished I were watching Elizabeth R (the old BBC series with Glenda Jackson) the whole time.<br />They did not have the courage to think this material would carry the audience's interest by itself.  I'm probably in the minority of people who are intensely interested in the Elizabethan era, but it's annoying to have them tart the thing up like this.<br />They didn't need to put in the unlikely scenes with Elizabeth in bed with Robert Dudley, they didn't need to use modern orchestras for the music, and if they had gone with cheaper costumes and black-and-white film, I wouldn't have cared.  As long as the story line is sensible and the acting is good.<br />The acting is pretty good.  Cate Blanchett is fine.  I didn't like the script.  As a fan of music from that period, I was annoyed to have them drag Elgar into it.<br />Don't bother with this.  Watch Elizabeth R instead.
0743455967|5.0|I could reread this book so many times. It is full of humour, inspiration and great practical advice.<br />The memories of his childhood are fascinating and really show how he became the author that he is. His advice on writing has been immensely helpful to me, but even if you are not a writer, the first half of this book is worth the price.
1558216847|5.0|Whether or not this story is &quot;true&quot; as some readers have claimed it was a fake, in many respects is completely irrelevant to two facts about the book.  First the book reads incredibly well, due to the outstanding writing that encompasses the book.  The second fact is that even if the story is a &quot;fake&quot; it is a story that reminds us of the power of the human spirit.  When truly motivated, we can achieve great things.<br />The narrator of the book/writer of the book develops a true tale in which the reader becomes intimately connected with the perils of crossing the harsh Siberian,Chinese, and Himalayan landscapes.  The tradgedies that besets the party on their travels in many ways beset the read as well.  The triumph and joy that the party experiences is experienced by the reader as well.  As a reader of this book, you find yourself pulling for the success of the party in their ventures.<br />Personally, I believe tha this story is true.  Just because the characters encountered great difficulties in their travels doesn't make it fake.  However, even if you choose to believe it is a falsehood, fiction does provide us with inspiration, which is how anyone should approach this book.
B0000CEB62|5.0|My 101'st review is for 101.  It was great seeing the boys again, transported back in time to perhaps the pinnacle of their bourgeoning careers.  Only recently coming to DVD, 101 follows a group of 8 Depeche Mode fans across the country on bus after they won a promotional contest to participate.  Ostensibly the first reality show, pre-dating MTV's insipid Real World series, we got to know a bit about the busmates against the backdrop of various shots of the band's performances as they made their way to their 101'st show at the Rose Bowl, CA in the summer of 1988.  I graduated HS that year and Depeche Mode had been [and is] my favorite band since their Some Great Reward Album.  It was fun nostalgia to be transported back to those days of halcyon youth. <grin>.  The audio commentary from the band was entertaining, more so than the individual interviews on the second disc.  I had a lot of favorites working in this movie, MftM is my favorite DM album, and we are once again reminded of the talent of Alan Wilder.  It's interesting the little snippets that slip in about Alan [who declined to participate in the interviews or commentary], and about how Dave, who laughing states 'Look at Al, he's too cool for school' misses him.  What would the output have been like beyond SoFAD if Alan had stayed.  Ah well, at least out of the departure Recoil matured and bore fruit.  Anyhow this was a feel good viewing, with lizard-like slicked back Fletch once more egging the fans on with his clapping technique. It gets added to the other DM DVDs in my collection, and I can highly recommend it for fans and newbies.
B0000009RX|5.0|I just felt it was my responsibility as a Zappa fan to rate this with five stars in hopes that it would actually show up as a five-star album. Because it IS a five-star album. This is an incredible piece of music and it deserves the title of one of the greatest albums EVER. This is absolute genius. No track on here should be listened to individually; this is one of those albums that needs to be taken in as a whole. Tracks 6 through 9 are particularly pleasing. I love how each sound just flows right into the next. And who cares if some of the vocals are sped up? It's part of the genius that makes this album what it is. It just wouldn't be the same without it. GET THIS ALBUM!
B00009V7RF|5.0|This is definitely a much needed CD. EVERYONE should own this. The Peas work great together. Their music is fresh and new and they are a breath of fresh air. I must say this though, Fergie definitely makes the group and it just would not be right without her. (And plus I am a HUGE Stacy Ferguson fan, she also made Wild Orchid, they can't do anything now with her!) All of the songs on this CD are great...I can't say there is one bad thing on here. So everyone go out and put this CD in everyone's stocking. It will be one of the best Xmas gifts!
B000089RVX|1.0|This band makes me sick. Every damn time I hear some moron listening to the radio, this ear-aching band is on. What a perfect example of record company executives (more rich than I really care to think of) popping out another hit and miss that you shallow, pathetic, emotionally overemphasized parasites buy. This band and its reputation are an example of what is wrong with this world: that 99% of the population is corporately spoonfed while they are robbed of their human right to give an opinion and choose for themselves. People are buying this crap because it is a staple on the living hell that is MTV. This is tied with linkin park, new punk and all those other rap bullshi**ers dominating the music industry. We need a serious change if this is what millions of people are listening to. Why can't you people wake up. I hate this band, it's music, the money, and the industry that I hope my band has no part of in the future. Music is about the feelings of your mind, heart, and soul...not your wallet.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This album is poor, because she doesn't know how to sing. If she would sing like Shakira or Christina Aguilera this would be perfect. She doesn't sing, she's talking. When she was a little girl, she sang better. I like her second, and third album, but not this one.
0441172717|3.0|It's been a month since I read this book. I'm not sure what that says about the book overall but take it for what it's worth. I debated for a bit about whether I liked it or not. It was a good enough read, which is not exactly a thrilling testimonial. But it didn't make my pulse quicken with excitement.<br />I thought the first third of the book was very good and it had me eager to read the remainder of the book. But after that, it was slow, methodical, and generally boring. I wasn't waking up every day looking forward to reading it. To me, that's the ultimate non-vote of confidence for a book. A book needs to be calling your name for it to be read. This one was not.<br />In the science fiction genre, I think Assimov has a lot more interesting material out there. Even though this is considered a classic, I don't see it as worthy of such a lofty distinction. I think his aims at religion and philosophy were too grand for what he was capable of. <br />I agree with some people who said the buildup to many scenes was anti-climatic. Many words were poured out for events that would go nowhere. And the events that did generate action were often times written as if the main character was taking out the laundry. There was no fire to many of the characters and scenes.<br />I note 2 things about the Amazon listing of this book. The first is that it's been reviewed 814 times. The second is that it has an average rating of 4.5 stars. At the end of the day, my review isn't going to change many people's minds out there. But I feel obligated to write it anyway.<br />Having said that, proceed as you will. This review isn't going to change many opinions and most will think I'm probably out to lunch with this review. Fair enough, I suppose. Maybe I just didn't see the brilliance on the pages. Or maybe my expectations are higher. <br />If you must, you must. But I think there are much better books on the market that you can pass your time reading.
B00005JMFR|2.0|You cannot expect too much after the disastrous Reloaded.  Hell, I'd go further to say that the entire franchise has entered the irrecoverable zone.  In truth, the Matrix series will not be remembered as one of those great trilogies.  Ahem, recent attempts in Star Wars!  It's a quite a shame too, since the first film was such a fiery triumph.  I thought it served as a harbinger of what future movie-making was going to be - bold magic.  However, after the release of Reloaded everything went tomblike and cold.  Now the mere reason to see Revolutions is for the absolute closure towards Neo once and for all.  And believe me that's the best thing that could ever happen.<br />First off the beginning is a big yawn-inducing way to takeoff.  It's practically pointless, really.  I'm perplexed and bewildered as how  the Wachowski brothers could possibly come up with this.  They managed to grip us in the first one and at least Reloaded threw in an interesting catalyst.  Here, we have Neo stuck in a limbo between the Matrix and reality.  It takes place in a deserted train station, governed by the rules of the TRAIN MAN!  It becomes obvious that Neo is stuck within the TRAINMAN'S world when the bum smashes Neo into a wall.  Morpheus, Trinity, and the Oracle's bodyguard spring into prompt action to persuade the FRENCHMAN! to free Neo.  They quickly succeed and we thankfully never see the TRAIN MAIN AND FRENCHMAN again!  Which brings up the question, why were we introduced to them in the first place?  I can't comprehend why, but maybe its because I can't pen up anything as *snicker* good *snicker* as this?<br />Once a captivating plot turns into a mishmash of using the One concept to thwart the nasty baddies.  Like when Neo and Trinity were cruising on their hovercraft and met a fleet of octopi sentinels.  Since we already knew that Neo has the power to destroy them with a wave of a hand (Reloaded), a number of scenes become dryly predictable.  I recall when the Wachowski brothers received an MTV award for the first Matrix film.  They said if we liked the first one then we're going to love the second one.  I`m smirking right now and  I`ll just leave it at that.<br />Dialogue and characters are a movie's backbone.  Mishandle the two and your on a crash collision into a fiasco.  Revolutions falls face-first and hard.  The dialogue lacks appeal and substance.  I was sorely reminded of Episode II and realized both movies have so much in common.  I'm thinking Lucas and the Wachowskis must've gotten together during the development.  It has to be the reason, it just has to be!  Since the dialogue feels so wooly and pokerfaced whereas the first film  had a charismatic Oracle.  Not to mention Agent Smith's chilly viewpoint in how the human race is a virus and the machines are the cure.<br />We don't even sense that the humans are fighting against total extinction.  Why?  Because we don't give a damn what happens to the cast.  All I notice is the dire need to generate excessive amounts of battles that aren't even worth bragging about.  It's a bad thing when the audience, like myself, begin to want to see the destruction of  Zion and have the bad guys triumph.  There are a number of characters onscreen  and like the TRAIN MAN, I question their appearances.  I thought of a sarcastic whoopee when Niobe showcased her talent to maneuver the ship in \\"impossible\\" ways.  Then I laughed at the dialogue of a captain verbalizing how astounded he was.  This has to be a spoof of how Sci-Fi movies aren't supposed to done.  It just has to be!  Which leads me to the question when is the REAL Matrix follow-ups coming?  Face it, if you compared Reloaded and Revolutions to the first one, you'll practically substantiate their apparent discrepancies.<br />Last thing I'll discuss are the major fight scenes.  Are we, the audience, really in need to see visual splendor?  Because that's all I'm sensing from the Matrix and Star Wars.  Style unseating substance.  End this nonsensical trend.  Graphically driving the movie does not spell out memorable scenes.  The standoff against sentinels and human mechs definitely looks more wacky than anything.  Suspense was at a low point during the otherwise climatic fight.  It feels out of place and dull.  Its hard to believe that millions of dollars were blown on the very mediocre battles.  And where did the martial arts run off to?  The excess of clanking robots blasting endless streams of firepower on the sentinels felt like a distraught imagination.  Since the machines drilled a hole to Zion why didn't they lob their explosives like they did in Reloaded?  As for the one-on-one clash with Neo and Smith, it superfluously mirrors something out of the cartoon Dragon Ball Z.  I scoff at this and scoff it some more!<br />Sci-Fi has never felt ridiculously fictitious or futile.  Thanks a lot Revolutions.  I'm a fantasy junkie and you now make me seem like one of those fanboys who root for the impassive Neo and the clich&eacute; of style over substance.  Yet, hope enkindles!  There will be an emotional intimacy that will be in the next Lord of The Rings film!  Luckily everything that has a beginning has an ending, and with it goes the Matrix.ce.

B00005JMFO|5.0|I thought this movie was great!! It was one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. Granted, it did have a lot of nudity and cursing, but all in all, I enjoyed the film. The eight love stories kept the movie running very smoothly. I had no idea I had been sitting for over 2 hours. If you are a romantic who needs a good laugh or a good cry, this movie is for you!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|a lot of people really disliked this but i thought it was pretty good. the fight scenes were cool, the story was better than the first, but a lot of people didn't like it...why? in my opinion the third one was terrible, but then some like it. i think this movie is very ambiguous and its up to particular tastes.
B00005JM02|4.0|A lot of people have said this movie is just for little kids, but I'm in high school and my friends (male and female) and I all loved it, along with my mom and aunt. It's an extremely cute movie with lots of subtle, sweet humor - for kids AND adults. I've seen it four or five times and see myself laughing more every time. Something about it did leave me feeling a little unsettled - just some of the dialogue/plot seemed sort of off. But at any rate, its a really adorable movie, and the DVD version is great fun.
630512762X|2.0|I remember watching this in the cinema in November 1997 with 698 other people (a full house) and only me and my pal hated it. Which is weird because I expected it to be great. The original script for the film had it set in the future but Woo insisted it be written in present day to not distract the audience. But the only thing that distracted me was how dull the film was.<br />Since coming to Hollywood John Woo has done little to impress. He mad a very strong debut with Hard Target but the film was cut to shreds and the impact severely muted. Broken Arrow was thoroughly unexciting and Face/Off is not much better.<br />The bulk of the blame lies not with Woo but with Travolta. As Sean Archer he's fine. But as soon as he becomes Castor Troy he turns the camp all the way up to 11. Face/Off eventually becomes an unashamed pantomime. Cage, as both characters, is very good. But Travolta takes Troy to the same place he took Vic Deakins in Broken Arrow. It's like he assumes that no matter what he does, it's automatically cool because IT'S A JOHN WOO FILM. Sorry, but that logic doesn't work out in real life.<br />The plot, while being crafty, doesn't really do much. Exactly what does Troy plan after becoming Archer? To look like his enemy for the rest of his life? If not it was a bad idea burning down the Plastic Surgery Joint then. Some interesting imagery is used and the subtext gives the movie a sharper edge despite its superficial appearance. All the 'gun ballet' stuff does is glamorise guns. And that's becoming real old hat.<br />Weird tho, when you think that this film is written by the folks that gave us The Mask and Death Wish V: The Face of Death. And John Woo would also dabble in face swapping later on with Mission: Impossible 2.<br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The only extra is a trailer.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|To begin with, the opening track, Get Back, properly lends itself to the rendering of this collection as a &quot;complete album&quot; wherein the &quot;original&quot; Let It Be was more a soundtrack album of a poorly shot and edited documentary film.<br /><br />On the original release, the song Get Back is used as a chronological reference to the fact that the Beatles closed the film with this number on the rooftop of Apple.<br />However, this has NOTHING to do with the concept the Beatles were after in &quot;getting back&quot; to musical basics.<br /><br />In the updated approach, Get Back acts as a carrion cry to the listener as to what is coming. This is The Fabs telling us what their intentions are for the next 30+ minutes. They intend to take us back to a more &quot;naked&quot; and raw approach to the music that they've written after years of studion wizardry and aural masterwork.<br /><br />Track two, Dig A Pony is John's musically logical answer to Paul's Get Back. A galoping riff-heavy blues number, this track starts the record on a flow that harkens back to the classic stage act formula from whence The Beatles originally honed their craft as performers.<br /><br />Track three introduces us to George's sweet voice in this boppy little antidote to the &quot;heaviness&quot; of Dig A Pony. The musical tone of Paul's  tack piano is literally a 180 degree sound when held up to the deep, slow grind of Pony.<br /><br />Leading us into the placid Long And Winding Road. The epic journey wistfully captured in song.<br />A foreshadowing to the impending demise of the group. And the end of the magic that is hinted at in the surrounding numbers.<br /><br />Two Of Us lifts us from the fog that rolls in with Road and brings us a feeling of melocholy scented hope. Reminding the listener that the music will endure as we &quot;have memories longer than the road the stretches out ahead&quot;.  This was 1970 after all, and the &quot;folky&quot; number was king. Two Of Us was a template for Graham Nash, America, Bread and countless others who went on to define the &quot;singer/songwriter era&quot;.<br /><br />At this point I'd like to comment on the snippets of conversation that so many will miss between tracks on the original release. Again, this is seen as more ensurance that this LP would be seen by future generations as a soundtrack to a larger, more important work (ie: the film) which was NOT the intention of the project.<br /><br />While charming and occasionally witty, these soundbites were best left entirely on Spector's work.<br /><br />I've Got a Feeling rounds out the center of the album nicely as it brings John and Paul together as a &quot;duet&quot; at the discs pinacle. Followed appropriately by a &quot;vintage&quot; track, One After 909 was written by John when he was still a teenager. This track is a necesary inclusion as it echos the days from which this project's sound first derived.<br /><br />Don't Let Me Down was always a missing track on Spector's work. One listen to the classic bootleg recording of the Let It Be outtakes, will show the listener just how much attention was paid to this song during these sessions. Also, on a personal note, John's relationship with Yoko had just taken flight and this was the first &quot;mature&quot; piece he had written about his feelings of passionate insecurity in putting himself full-out for all the world to see, asking her to simply not break his heart before the entire world.<br /><br />I Me Mine brings us neatly back to George and also to an autobiographical piece illustrating for music historians the true climate of the Beatle's condition. Things were coming apart at the seams and George had his finger on the pulse as to why. The scorching chorus suggests the bitterness lurking behind all the lilting melody.<br /><br />This being followed by the stripped down, original tempo Across The Universe is poetic in that it works thematically against the hard-cold reality of I Me Mine andrevisits (if only for a moment) the trippy care-free days of Beatle fabness in India and All You Need Is Love.<br /><br />And finally, closing this collection with Let It Be makes nothing but perfect sense.<br />It is their final statement. They are saying one thing: In all our attempts to re-live a past seen as greener pastures, we are best to simply embrace what is to come and simply Let It Be.<br /><br />Compare above to the following &quot;original&quot; album's track listing:<br />Side 1: Two Of Us, Dig A Pony, Across The Universe, I Me Mine, Dig It, Let It Be, Maggie Mae<br />Side 2: I've Got A Feeling, The One After 909, The Long And Winding Road, For You Blue, Get Backtrippy care-free days of Beatle fabness in India and All You Need Is Love.<BR> <BR>And finally, closing this collection with Let It Be makes nothing but perfect sense.<BR>It is their final statement.

B000000OSG|4.0|There are two ways to look at UYI 2. You can look at it as the album that followed Appitite For Destruction, and hatre it, or you can look at it as Guns N Roses. Here's what i think of each of the songs:<br />Civil War- 5/5 stars. No doubt, by far the best song on the CD. There are 4 solos from Slash, plus the sweet outro ad-lib solo. Amazing song. I could even see buying the album for Civil War and only Civil War!<br />14 years- 4/5 stars. I like this song, but the chorus bugs me becuase Axl started out the song with a nice voice, but he just yelps in teh chorus and it got on my nerves. But overall good song.<br />Yesterdays- 4/5 stars. Great song, but i give it 4 becuase the mixing was crap. In the begginning, people miss out on the cool intro riff Slash made, becuase the drums are mixed so loud and the guitar so soft. But great song.<br />Knockin On Heavens Door- 5/5 stars. Beautiful song. It's a Bob Dylan cover with the Guns N Roses spin on it. Great guitar, the only thing is the pointless phone call but whatever. Great song.<br />Get In The Ring- 4/5 stars. I don't know why everyone hates this song, its a good song. The only part i dont like is that deep voice after teh second chorus. And for the record, in Axls 'speech' he's directing that to the tabloids, not the guy he got in a fight with.<br />Shotgun Blues- 3.5/5 stars. Bad intro. But it gets better.<br />Breakdown- 5/5 stars. Sweet song, banjo intro by Slash, what more could you ask for? <br />Pretty Tied Up- 4/5 stars. Cool intro, i just dont like the chorus, it's too predictable and corny. But cool sitar opening!<br />Locomotive- 4/5 stars. Cool song, but they had 9 minutes and tehy could've done something a little cooler with it. <br />So Fine- 4/5 stars. Nice song, but when duff sings, i dojn't really care for his voice. Pretty song though.<br />Estranged- 5/5 stars. Sweet song. Awesome guitar. Kinda random but i have to listen to it a bit more and i'll love it even more.<br />You Could Be Mine- 5/5 stars. Nothing wrong here, just straight forward rock n roll.<br />Don't Cry- 5/5 stars. Beautiful song. I havn't heard the original so i don't know what the previous lyrics were. Nice song, 5 stars.<br />My World- 0/5 stars. What the hell? This song is terrible, if you call it a song. Axl's the only one on the song, and he's rapping. If you buy this CD, program your player to skip over it. BAD SONG!<br />Overall, it's a pretty good album. Besides Civil War, there's not really another 'Paradise City' on it. But still, this is a great CD that any Guns N Roses fan should not be without.
B0000TB014|3.0|okay forget about the full versions! i already OWN all of these films.  what should've been there if i was the one who was directing the production of this dvd, was the live versions of these songs dug up from his past  footage from his best concert performances.  that would have made it alot better!!!  i dont even have to take a survey and i know people would have rather seen that instead of these chopped up master peices.

0060920084|3.0|After reading &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; and &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot;, which were absolutely fantastic, I figured this book was guaranteed to be entertaining. Boy, was I mistaken! Obviously a collection of some earlier work, Bill Bryson shares much more of his personal thoughts and less of the local color that made the other two books such wonderful works. After reading half the book, I put it away. I got the impression that Bryson couldn't accept that the America of his childhood had evolved, and that he refused to find anything worth praising about mid-America today. It's really a shame, because his crankiness is often charming in his other works, but here it just makes me want to tell him to go back to England. If smalltown, USA is your thing, go find a book by Charles Kuralt. He knows how to make the middle states seem appealing.
B00000F169|4.0|As every film buff knows, Dark Star started off as a student film.  The work so impressed producer Jack H. Harris (The Blob) that he gave the 'kids' some extra money to pad it to feature length.  The rest is history, sort of.  Dark Star is a deserved cult classic.  For one, while it is bargain basement filmmaking, nonetheless the movie manages to look fairly good and does not bog down with filler (each scene is fresh and entertaining and adds something to the overall feel).  The alien escaping into the ship and Pinback's giving chase (which alternates easily between hilarious and harrowing) is undoubtedly a highlight (both for being so entertaining and for forshadowing O'Bannon's script/story for Alien).  As is Bomb #20.  The second reason is that many of the crew (Carpenter, O'Bannon, and the effects creators) all went on to successful careers in the film making industry.  If you can get past the tape and cardboard look (and the movie is so inventive and funny that it is easy to do) then Dark Star is a fun ride and an essential addition to any sci-fi film buffs library.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation is incredible from start to end. Every scene in the film seems to be perfect and one cannot help but to fully empathize with both Mr. Murray and Ms. Johansson. Mr. Murray, always wonderful to watch, turns in his best preformence since Groundhog's Day, and Ms. Johansson has signalled her arrival as an incredible actress, even while so young, with her perfect portrayal of lost Charlotte.<BR>I have been watching and studying movies for 40 years, and I can honestly say that this is the best movie I have ever seen.
0061015725|2.0|Unfortunately, this book fails on almost every level. I have enjoyed other Crichton books and the concept behind this one was compelling, so I eagerly sat down to read it. But I was very disappointed. Here are its pitfalls, without giving anything specific away:<br />1. The first 120 pages consist of the main character changing diapers and taking care of his kids. If Crichton had used those pages for strong character development, that would be fine. But his writing is mediocre, and the diaper-changing drags on too long. <br />Several odd aspects of the beginning did pique my curiosity, but Crichton doesn't explain those initial oddities until the last 4 pages, after all the events are over! It's tacked on at the very end. .. &quot;you remember that sorta weird thing that happened when he was changing the diapers? Well, here's the explanation. The end.&quot; Ho hum. By that point, I just didn't care anymore. The ending was so absurd that more explanations didn't matter. <br />2. Crichton did come up with a good, high-concept idea for the book: a swarm of nanoparticles, developed for the military for surveillance purposes, gets out of control and evolves into a predatory being that can chase you into any room... a bee-like swarm of microscopic robots slipping through the cracks. Pretty cool idea. It could have been a scary page-turner as the characters try to escape the unstoppable swarm. But this book only shows a glimmer of its promise. Simply put, Crichton didn't try very hard to make it suspenseful. He phoned this one in.<br />3. It's obvious from the &quot;scientific explanations&quot; that Crichton doesn't really understand the technologies he writes about. Particularly at the end -- the explanations don't even remotely make sense. Some of the swarm behavior is plausible, but the ending is laughable and silly.<br />4. The whole book seemed hastily written. An editor should have read it for plot glitches. (I won't say anything specific, lest you read the book anyway.) In addition, Crichton keeps awkwardly interrupting the dialogue to explain various theories. You're reading along and then -- woah, let's stop the talking for a second -- here we go with another science lesson! Two pages later the dialogue starts again, exactly where it left off. <br />6. The most annoying thing is that Crichton gives you a condescending lecture at the beginning of the book about the arrogance of science. He did this at the beginning of Jurrasic Park, too. It would be one thing if Crichton were an expert on his subject matter and had the legitimacy to warn you, the poor uninformed reader, of the evils going on in labs around the country. But his lack of credibility is embarassing. Crichton comes off as someone who has read a bunch of books and then tries to regurgitate it back to you, but without a true, confident grasp of the material. He has no business lecturing people. He gets too many facts wrong. He should stick to fiction. Good fiction.<br />In sum, I hope another writer creates a good &quot;nanoparticle out-of-control&quot; story... because I still want to read one.
B000089RVX|2.0|You hear one song, and tell yourself --- wow, I've got to hear more. Then you hear the second and you do a double take --- wait, is that the same song?  Bottom line, all songs sound the same!
0385508417|4.0|I bought this when it first came out, after realizing I hadn't actually read a new Christmas story since grade school. I'm not sure what I expected, but the book is entertaining and the characters are fairly amusing. I'm not a fan of Grisham's more well-known works, but if they aren't your preferred reading material, don't compare those with this book. This story will (hopefully) never be a holiday TV cartoon, but it's worth offering to everyone in the family for at least one read-through.
B00009TB5G|4.0|\\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" is definitely a monumental achievement.  Though I would take up issue with the claims that it is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, it certainly renders a wonderful epic better than any film one can imagine.  Any slander that the film receives from those that compare it to the books is merely useless talk: of course these films will not be as good as the books.  How can anyone expect a book that lives in the imagination of reader's minds and dwells there for countless hours of reading can even hope to be rendered in a three hour film?  We're lucky that these films are as long and carefully thought out as they are.  And as an English major and proponent of reading, any film that inspires people to go out and read more books is fine by me.<br />This film aches in parts; I find that the love stories in the film tend to be uninteresting and forced in comparison to the action sequences.  I believe that Jackson is much more comfortable rendering scenes of battle than those of passion.  True to this statement, the battle scenes in \\"The Two Towers\\" are absolutely stunning.  Calling to mind wonderful battle scenes of medieval and ancient times, these battle scenes are reminiscent of the images we receive in \\"The Iliad\\" and other epic battle poems.<br />All in all, I applaud Jackson's efforts to render the trilogy with as much attention to detail as he has given it.  And, of course, I hope the films inspire people to read more than just Tolkien's wonderful works, to include the epic poetry and world that he himself was drawing from.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am a 38 year old who bought this CD because of Madonna being in the first track.    I am very impressed with Britneys &amp;quot;in the zone&amp;quot;. The song Breathe is contagious. I listened to it over and over. The song Everytime, is beautiful. Britney has grown into her own. On this album , she is a cross between Madonna and Kylie Monogue. I love this album. I highly recommend it, but I would shy away from getting it for the youngsters. Pick up Hilary Duff for the kids under 17.   Audrey   Tampa Florida
B000056JYB|4.0|Wedged between Eric Clapton's Cream exploits and solo works is this album, recorded with Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker, and Rick Grech. This was Clapton's first attempt at &quot;mellowing-out&quot;, and trying for a more simplified sound, after the sonic &quot;peak&quot; he reached with Cream. Unfortunately, every time Clapton tries to go somewhere else artistically, the entire &quot;hype&quot; machine has followed him. And especially when you have him together with other well-known artists like Steve Winwood and former Cream bandmate Ginger Baker, there was really a lot of expectations from the public about the music to be made. But this group was no &quot;Cream, part two&quot;, with Steve Winwood and Rick Grech replacing Jack Bruce on vocals and bass, respectively. There were no egos here, no one trying to out-perform the others. No excessive jamming--except maybe for fun, as on the track, &quot;Do What You Like&quot;. Ginger Baker really tried hard to hold back from getting carried away on the drums, just as Clapton tried to restrain himself. Just a closer step toward more simple song structures--which may have been a let down for people who expected more out of them. But that's not to say there isn't great music here. &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful songs ever made. For me, I much prefer &quot;Had To Cry Today&quot; and &quot;Presence of The Lord&quot;. &quot;Had to Cry Today&quot; has one of Clapton's greatest repeating guitar phrases throughout the song, proving he hadn't entirely given up on great riff-mastery (certainly not. He was yet to come out with &quot;Layla&quot; a year later.) &quot;Presence of The Lord&quot; is a very heartfelt, Christian song. With re-makes becoming all the rave in the Christian music world now, I am surprised that no Contemporary Christian artist has tried to cover this one. It beats a lot of what passes for Christian music these days, and has a great guitar solo by Eric Clapton to boot! Is there a possible link between Clapton turning to Christianity at this time and his &quot;shrinking ego&quot; after Cream? It would seem so to me.<BR>He was really trying to run from a spotlight that still chases him to this day. And when the spotlight followed him to Blind Faith, he hitched a ride with their relatively-unknown back-up group, Delaney and Bonnie, becoming a simple, &quot;side-man&quot; for them temporarily. I also think some people mistake Clapton's &quot;humility&quot; for &quot;aloofness&quot; and &quot;snobbery&quot;. But I don't see that in him at all. He has that humble Christian trait about him that I think started around this time. The bible says, &quot;Humble thyself in the side of the Lord, and He will lift you up&quot;, and what the devil supposedly did for Robert Johnson, God did for Eric Clapton. His willingness to take a back seat to others increased his talent, and launched a great solo career. In spite of his restraint, his greatness still shines through on this album, as well as that of the others. Blind Faith only lasted 6 months in 1969, but their music that's preserved here still shines, like a gem buried in the sand.

B00000G3PA|5.0|Bruce Willis soars leap years above his stereotypical action hero image and delivers a blockbuster performance. This move kept me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene!

0783226845|4.0|\\"Scent of a Woman\\" finally won Al Pacino the award for Best Actor-an honor that, in my opinion, escaped him far too long.  His performance is wonderful, supplemented with the interesting dialogue that seems to be almost ad-libbed by Pacino himself.  Perhaps his acting is larger-than-life, but the character demands such a performance.  Frankly, I wouldn't have wanted to see the role fall apart in the hands of someone less experienced.<br />The film does remind one of \\"Dead Poet's Society,\\" but quickly diverges into a rich character exploration while both Lt. Col. Slade and Charlie live it up in New York City.  One question I have for the defense of Charlie: why, in the end, does he want to be associated with the institution that grinds against his principles?  It seems that Slade's advice should be for him to join an institution that he feels proud to be a part of.  Regardless, the ending scenes of the film are wonderful to watch time and time again, particularly if you enjoy moving speeches as much as I do.<br />The film is a bit long; it has several climaxes that confuse the audience as to when the film should end.  But this film is worth watching, if only to hear Pacino speak about women in a way that completely validates his character.
B00005JLK1|4.0|I didn't see &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; in the movie theater; the first time I watched it was at 5:00 AM before I went to work.  I watched it completely through and almost was late; I was so intrigued I bought the DVD on the way home.  I am a fan of the supernatural, as well as history: movies, TV shows, miniseries, books.....and I wasn't disappointed.  The special features made the DVD worth buying (and it confirmed my supsicion that the boat was patterned after the doomed Andrea Doria), as were some of the principal actors. The sets were stunning, and the effect gruesome, though at times a bit over the top.<br />The plot is sometimes predictable, but I liked the villain who manipulates the crew by using their main character flaws against them: greed, lust, and guilt.<br />This movie isn't for everyone; if you're looking for completely orginal work (I will defer to my fellow reviewers since I never saw Event Horizon) or chainsaw-wielding maniacs, this is definitely not your movie. However, if you're looking for an atmospheric thriller, get ready to board &quot;Ghost Ship&quot;.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This is the most awesome political intrigue drama ever. You can read the description in the editor's note, so I won't go into the storyline. I first saw it on the BBC when it was aired in early nineties, but it is mostly unheard of in the US. But when I showed some of my friends, they emmidately baught the whole set, and also as presents for friends, everyone just LOVED it. Though utterly serious, its also hilarious, we'd rewind the movie and then go over again. Especially the functioning of the parliament is a little unknown here, so knowing some minor details will help. Though the sex part was a little obsecure, but one has to admit that \\"the most sexual part of the body is the brain\\". Also everyone will be in love with \\"You can surely think so, but I couldn't possibly comment\\". A must buy.
B0000A118M|5.0|One warms to this album after hearing it for a few times.<BR>In the beginning, it can sound a bit foreign: it is unusual work for any genre of music - but if you can get past your own obstinacy, you begin to hear wonders in the pattern of the music.  These songs do not just rise toward their climactic moments; they unfold.  One reviewer on this site claims that the music will not hold up to repeat listenings, but I disagree: I took this CD with many others on a week-long vacation, and it never left my discman.  And besides, A Love Supreme is cited in hundreds of jazz compendia, and exalted by such well-known critics as Ben Ratliff.  It is one thing for a work to be overhyped by the public, but when experienced - and honest - critics hail it as a hallmark of jazz history, you can take that to be the truth.  Such is the case with this album.  No matter how often you listen, the tracks, given a discerning ear, will constantly reveal new facets of themselves.  <br />Does in swing in a way that any lay listener can enjoy?  No.  Is it slick hard bop, with those all-too-clever chords? No again.  But what it is, is a masterpiece in a genre that Coltrane created.  Not for nothing is this man listed by Miles Davis's side, even though Coltrane's music wasn't so stylistically facile.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson's account of his trip to Australia is fantastic! He travels the country, sharing fascinating tidbits of history in every location he stops in. This book was about 98 percent as entertaining as &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;, although that book is still my favorite travel book of all time. Still, after reading this book, if I had the money and the time, I'd go to Australia tomorrow with this book as my guide!
B00000JLWW|4.0|Right now we're still too close to &quot;Titanic&quot; to say whether or not, flaws and all (especially its screenplay, which wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award), will be considered a classic.<br />&quot;Ben Hur,&quot; the other film that won 11 Oscars, made the American Film Institute's top 100 list, but beyond the great chariot race, few people have great affection for it because of its aloof and emotionally distant tone.<br />But my best guess is in about 20 years, people will come to better appreciate this film as being deserving to be placed in the &quot;classic&quot; category, flaws and all, primarily because of its global impact at the time it was released and its INTENTIONAL use of maudlin themes and a romantic narrative that truly borrows from the glory days of romantic American cinema of the 1930s and 1940s.<br />This is perhaps why Janet Maslin of the New York Times declared that &quot;Titanic&quot; was the first film in decades that earned the right to be debated and compared to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (now let's be honest, that was a corny movie too, wasn't it?).<br />&quot;Titanic&quot; may not be &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; but the comparison is good.  Gable was well known, but who knew Vivien Leigh?  DiCaprio and Winslet, before &quot;Titanic,&quot; were accomplished young film actors, both with previous Oscar nominations, but not in the upper box office tier of stars.  And this is &quot;Titanic's&quot; overriding strength. What if more well-known stars had been cast in the lead roles? It would've cast a completely different light and tone.<br />The fact that &quot;Titanic&quot; became a pop culture phenomenon has diminished it in many ways to elitist critics and others who have parodied everything about it, from its over-played Celine Dion theme song to its stick-figure characters (e.g., it reminds me of what happened to &quot;Rocky&quot; after winning Best Picture in 1976, only to have its accomplishments diluted by its bad sequels).<br />My recollection is that NO ONE, least of all the critics, expected &quot;Titanic&quot; to become a hit.  In fact, there was initial fondness that the film still &quot;held together,&quot; despite well-known and horrific delays associated with bringing this &quot;summer release&quot; to the screen in December 1997.  As the film's gross returns got bigger each week, &quot;Titanic,&quot; despite high production costs, became regarded as the three-hour &quot;underdog&quot; that prevailed.  In my mind, the voices of dissent became noticeably louder only after the film was nominated for a record-tying 14 Academy Awards.<br />Historical inaccuracies abound, but like &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; romantic considerations were paramount to avoid a &quot;flat&quot; telling of what everyone knows will happen to the ship.  Hence upon seeing &quot;Titanic&quot; the first time, I was amazed the story was engaging at all, albeit in an idealized 1940s style, cliches and all.  It's equally amazing that any film can become a box-office champ without a single computer-generated alien, dinosaur or space ship.  The &quot;romance&quot; is what made &quot;Titanic&quot; popular, especially with young people.  It's not the &quot;romance&quot; of great literature, it's the romance of the type we saw in &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot;  It's simple and uncomplicated, and again, it's executed in a style borrowed from the golden age of cinema.<br />In sum, the intellectual snobbery against &quot;Titanic&quot; will never threaten its universal popularity.  The money put into this film is all on the screen, and the lack of an &quot;intelligent&quot; script -- is overwhelmed by the momentum of the film's idealized romance and impending destruction -- lifted even higher by its perfect ending (always the most important factor determining whether a film has a chance of entering the pantheon of greats.)<br />If you take the historian's view, &quot;Titanic's&quot; accomplishments are too large to dismiss.  And if it had been released in 1947 instead of 1997, I'm convinced even MORE people would be in its corner today.  But this will never change the minds of people who hate it.  So just don't listen.oo large to dismiss.  And if it had been released in 1947 instead of 1997, I'm convinced even MORE people would be in its corner today.  But this will never change the minds of people who hate it.  So just don't listen.
B000089RVR|4.0|can 12 million people be wrong? i don't know about that, but this one person is right. i broke down and bought this cd, only due to the fact that it was on sale the day after thanksgiving, and it was well worth the money. it's a great cd to have on in the background while typing at the computer, going on a car ride, or even at a dinner party. great music, &quot;mary's in india&quot; is the strongest track.... all the songs are anthems of codependence and the cd should come with a free date, but all in all, can't go wrong with this cd.
0790749815|5.0|Mr Hitchcock made this film ACCIDENTALLY.  He was supposed to make a film version of The Wreck of the Mary Deare but his writer Ernest Lehman had a form of WRITER's BLOCK but, thankfully,  had some ideas about a &quot;chase movie&quot;.  All is revealed in the excellent additional material and documentary on the making of the film narrated by Ms Saint.  It may be one of those instances of how the artist (Mr Hitchcock) uses the system (Hollywood producers) to get his way, and run way over budget, and still bring home the bacon with a work of cinematic wonder.  A must have DVD.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, but tried this out because I like John Cusack and Ray Liotta. WOW! What a surprise! This movie keeps you enthralled from the opening scene to the shocking revelations near the end. The deleted scenes actually added to the movie. This is the type of movie that justifies owning a DVD player instead of a VHS player. If you liked &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, you will love this movie!
B00006879E|5.0|I just can't say enough good things about Song about Jane. Maroon5 is a breath of fresh air. I was hooked when I firsed heard Harder to breath. Every song on this great. It's worth every penny trust me. Buy it you won't be disapointed.
B000001ESP|5.0|So much has been said about this album that I don't know what to say.  All I really should say is that if you've EVER had any interest in getting into progressive rock, buy Moving Pictures now.<br />Most of the album is accessible for those unfamiliar with progressive rock.  From the opening moments of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" (like Yes's \\"Roundabout,\\" a huge radio hit that never *ever* gets old) to the fade out of \\"Vital Signs\\" (a vastly underrated song that I consider to be the best on the album), Moving Pictures is unrelenting.<br />You've definitely heard at least three songs on the radio- \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" the futuristic highway anthem \\"Red Barchetta\\" and the lamentation on fame \\"Limelight.\\"<br />All great songs, of course.  But you can't forget the headbanging instrumental \\"YYZ,\\" \\"Witch Hunt\\" (which is even more relevant today than ever), to the album's opus, \\"The Camera Eye\\" (the last song over 7 minutes ever recorded by Rush).  They all have a progressive tinge to them, while not being so esoteric as to alienate the listener.<br />If you're new to Rush, trust me, you'll love it.
B0000CD5FN|4.0|Joe Strummer's solo records have never received the attention they ought to have, though in fact they have been boundary-pushing, globally aware and experimental records. Streetcore, his final album, released after his death, is more of a return to an accesible style. Things get off to a rousing start with the gloriously catchy 'Coma Girl', which reminds you just how futile the second-hand versions of The Libertines and The Strokes are. This is one glorious triumph of a song - sung with true passion, and the greatest tribute one could imagine as a last single - going out with style, grace and - wonderfully - boundless energy.<BR> <BR>Elsewhere on the album though, things are more subdued. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - his cover of Bob Marley's 'Redemption Song' is just perfect - like the song and his voice were just meant to be together. Elsewhere, Joe returns to rootsy folk and reggae stylings on the likes of 'Get Down Moses' and there are some spacier, meditative songs like 'Midnight Jam' which are affecting in an odd way. There's only one true shocker, and that is the frankly awful 'All In A Day'. Much as I'd love to tell you the album is perfect, any song that rhymes 'this is the acid test' with 'I'm wearing a vest' loses all kudos immediately. It doesn't help that its matched with cheesy arena instrumentation and a horrible cod-punk singalong either. Nevertheless, its not enough to ruin what is a wonderful album. He couldn't have said goodbye better.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|First off, the second in a trilogy almost always sucks, since the director(s) lets the movie &quot;end&quot; in a cliffhanger instead of with an actual ending to the story. This one is no exception. Second, the DVD extras are long, boring babbles by the various people involved with the movie. I couldn't finish a single one of them. Finally, what's missing from the DVD is something that would help us better understand what is going on in the movie. Instead we hear more about what clever projects the directors are planning to get more of our money. I would have like to see bios of some of the Matrix-world characters, or maybe the scene where one of the Zion characters was liberated from the Matrix. How was Zion built? Why is Kung Fu so integral to the plot? Is it representative of some computer program/virus conflict? Sigh. No new information, just babble. There's no reason to buy the DVD if you can get the VHS cheaper.

0671027344|5.0|I first read &quot;Perks&quot; when I was sixteen, and at the time, I found a kindred spirit in the protagonist, Charlie.  Charlie will appeal to anyone who's ever been a stereotypical wallflower: he is introverted and introspective, and has different facets of his personality that very few people ever get to see.  It was a joy for me to read &quot;his&quot; perspectives on a variety of topics.  It was much easier for me to relate to Charlie than Holden Caulfield of J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; or Benjamin of Benjamin Lebert's &quot;Crazy,&quot; among other coming-of-age novels.<br />Three years later, I still like &quot;Perks,&quot; although not as much as when I first read it.  Now that I'm older, some of the issues that Charlie deals with in the novel definitely seem to be contrived for the teen audience (for example, drug use, abusive relationships, abortion, alcoholism, homosexuality...).  However, what really makes &quot;Perks&quot; memorable are the little pieces of wisdom and perfectly worded descriptions of things like interactions with friends in &quot;Charlie's&quot; journal entries.  Author Stephen Chbosky flawlessly captures the thoughts and feelings of teenagers.  He is never preachy, either.  That is where most authors fail, including teenage authors like Lebert.  <br />For the plot by itself, Chbosky gets three stars.  The writing style deserves more stars than Amazon will allow me to give this book.
B000002L9B|5.0|The strange persona of Around The World In A Day was one of Prince's first albums that really revisited the 60's pop sound. In 1986, Prince's second movie, Under The Cherry Moom was filmed. This movie was a disater and some people didn't even see it. I always thought that this 1986 classic was a life-saver for not only the film, Under The Cherry Moon, but for his 1985 double platinum album, Around The World In A Day. Parade was released the same time his second movie was filmed. This weird but, funky album was not really a big success for Prince.  The album was underrated at the time, and it still is. When I listened to this album, it made me think of The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper. The first 3 songs are weird to me. 'Christopher Tracy's Parade' is a funky, psychedelic number, which is a great opener to this album. 'New Postion' is a jazzy funk number with Sheila E. singing and playing the drums. 'I Wonder U' is a Lisa and Windy composition that sounds truly druggy with laid back rhythms and strange lyrics. 'Under The Cherry Moon' is very melodramatic with a sad mood in the song. I mean it's really not one of my favorites but, I listen to it anyway. 'Girls And Boys' is a hard funk tune with amazing synthesizers and electric drum beats. It's a more upbeat tune. 'Life Can Be So Nice' is another funk cut that has a chorus accompanied by a nice, catchy rhythm. Then there's 'Venus De Milo', which is a piano instrumental with a lot of smooth strings. 'Venus De Milo' are one of my favorites on this album. 'Mountains' is a upbeat, psychedelia soul cut with synth drums and other gaggles of instruments. 'Do U Lie' is another depressing and moody song. I hate this one, but it really doesn't bother me that much. 'Kiss' is everybody's favorite song by the Purple One himself. The funky guitars and the muted drums are great. How does Prince do it? 'Anotherloverholenyohead' is a strange, European-funk number. 'Sometimes It Snows In April' is a ballad that employs country music toexpress deep loss so poetically and personally. Parade should've been a double album even if the whole album was 45 minutes, in my opinion. At the time, The Revolution was delving into jazz and this album is really an experimentation of jazz and soul. It would be one more year, until he gives us his masterwork, 'Sign &quot;O&quot; The Times', where he dabbles into different styles and sounds to let us discover his real genius, art, and talent. 'Parade' is nevertheless, an underrated classic with lush orchestration and artful funk and soul. It's a must buy. A-
B00005JKC3|3.0|Not a bad movie, considering the source. Since it's based off a comic book, you have to ignore the obviously bogus plot twists, like the Army being able to walk into a civilian's house and hold him prisoner, or the general not knowing how to find someone who has left his address on file in the very building the Army has seized control of. The movie is great fun for kids, and the special effects are fantastic, considering the scope of what Ang Lee was trying to accomplish. However, the 3-star rating is not for just the movie. The extras included on the DVD were all junk. I usually enjoy seeing deleted scenes. I can clearly see why these scenes were deleted. The comic book artists' interpretation of the same scene was mildly interesting, but I was bored with the whole thing in two minutes. If you have kids, buy the movie. It's worth the price. Just don't put too much stock in the rest of the DVD.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|&quot;Let it Be . . . Naked&quot;.  Echhh.  That has got to be the most horrible title in the history of popular music.<br />The rationale behind this release is equally bizarre. &quot;The band's cut&quot;.  Oh, really? John and George signed off on Spector's original production. They weren't around to sign off on this version. So how can it be &quot;the band's cut&quot;?  What a load of bull. <br />Yes - it was indeed unfair to Paul that his &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; was altered behind his back on the original LIB. Well, isn't that why they released it in Spector-less form on Anthology 3?  Releasing it Spector-less again here provides nothing new.  And - Spector-less versions of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot; can be found on the Anthology's. Since those three were the only songs on LIB that were given the &quot;wall of sound&quot; treatment, then all the Let it Be material has long been available free of Spector's choirs, strings and horns.  Quite frankly, it's rather insulting to fans for this release to be pushed as if the songs have never been heard Spector-free before.<br />What's most bizarre of all is the removal of songs and other material.  It's great that John's &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; has been added. But why remove anything when up to 80 minutes of music can be put on a CD?  And with that in mind, everyone knows lots of LIB outakes are available on bootleg.  Why not pad the original with jamming (like Maggie May and Dig It) between songs and give the fans MORE?<br />I'm a huge fan but I frankly don't see a need to run out and get LIBN.  Maybe I will someday, but only to complete my collection, and only after the bad taste in my mouth from the misleading marketing has gone away.  But that might take a while . . .

B00005JMFO|3.0|Love Actually had the makings of a great Holiday classic. It had Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson and so many great British actors and actreses. But with all the unnecessary nudity this movie stunk. Also if they had made some of the story lines longer than we could truely appreciate this movie. There didn't have to be nudity and this movie could have been easier to watch and have been a great movie. But the good parts was the ending because it was sweet and over.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|this movie was filmed excelently and would make a... really good anti-drug ad. plain and simple. the movie was filmed expertly. (forgive me for repeating myself ) the style changing to fit the mood. things like lenses, pacing, and cuts. the sound was superb. which i used as a segway to my next comment. the score was EXCELLENT. im not so much a fan of the most popular main theme, but those sort of coney island dreaming songs and the one at the end titled &quot;meltdown&quot;.<BR>my only problem(s) with the movie is just the way it made me feel. i didnt really ever wanna see it again afterwords. it fascinated me but i didnt feel... i dunno... good, watching it. it felt like something was horribly horribly wrong. i got the same disturbed feeling from &quot;a clockwork orange&quot;. another fascinating masterpiece of stanley kubrick ( one of the greatest directors of ALL time ) if you have a weak stomach.. you may wanyt to avvert you eyes at times. the performances where convinceing and the story, although semi-plotless. now im giving it a 4 because... i didnt like the way the movie made me feel. BUT, i thought the movie was excellent.
B00005JMFO|4.0|This movie was a must-see for me because of the stars who were in it Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson. I just knew the movie couldn't go wrong.  While I liked the cast, who played their roles well, the varying sub-stories were interesting.  I just wish that there was less focus on the rock star's climb to the charts, and more focus on Sarah (Laura Linney) and Carl instead.  I think the movie could have done without the story of the nude actors as I personally did not find that storyline of interest.  Colin Firth's story was very entertaining, I thought he played his role perfectly. And Emma Thompson's story kinda left me hanging..but that gave the movie a touch of reality.  I rated it 4 stars because the movie had more nudity than I thought was necessary for the film.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Finally, my package arrived yesterday, and I hardly waited to get back home to watch it.  First, the overall image quality, as expected, was excellent...this has become so normal in the digital film world that anything lower than this would be considered awful...so, the image was very good...My real comments were on the extras..here they go:<br />1) Did anyone get the reason why they separated the main documentary into three parts?  I thought that these were three separate films, which separate people had made, and Paramount merged them into one on this dvd.  <br />2) The opening part of the first documentary was excellent...I mean when they separated the screen into four and gave few seconds for each character to speak, and then all gets into the opening theme.<br />3) Although I truly enjoyed every bit of the three documentaries, I was expecting some more content, such as:<br />- why not some other significant people like Ennio Morricone, Nino Baragli, Sergio Donati, Mickey Knox, Dario Argento, Claudio Mancini and some other actors, who I know still survive and active in the cinema world, never appeared?<BR>- the time allocated to people like Alex Cox was much more than the necessary duration.  Some other people, who were more directly involved with this film, or some other significant critics could have contributed in some of the time allocated for Cox, Carpenter and Milius.<BR>- When I first got the news that Paramount was working on this dvd, I hoped that they would discover some of the never-before-seen materials, like some tv spots, some behind the scene footage, or some real newspaper clips.  For example, I remember seeing a short part at a documentary about Henry Fonda, where his then wife shot some 8mm film at the set of the film.  There you can see Leone thinking about a scene, and crew working on a setup. That film could have been found from Fonda family.  I am sure, OUTIW should have made more impact on tvs or newspapers.<BR>- why did they shoot GabrielFerzetti and Cox from way above?  I mean, there are times when Cox and Ferzetti speak for minutes and the camera continues to stay still at the ceiling of the room. Do these guys have any defects on their faces?<BR>- why didn't anyone mention about the death of Al Mullock while they were getting ready for the last day of the shooting?    <BR>- why didn't the producers of these documentaries think of borrowing more of Leone's own words from other documentaries?  There is only one short part taken from the 1984 BBC documentary, but I know for sure, he spoke much more on this film at least two Italian-made documantries, and I am sure these could have been obtained.<br />the rest of the extras were fine, especially the pictures showing Almeria now and then.  Thanks to Don, Marla and Mike.  My overall impression was that although the effort should definitely be appreciated, the final delivery still have way to go to whet the voracious appetites of incurable fans like myself.  May be, the producers, who may not be deep fans like us, thought this could be more than enough, but I was expecting more from the extras of such a masterpiece.  I still think the money I paid is worth the delivery, but could have been much more, and I could have waited another year for these missing pieces.
630514415X|4.0|He Got Game, the surprisingly well acted and extremely entertaining film by Spike Lee starring Denzel Washington and basketball star Ray Allen takes an interesting look at &quot;the next Coney Island basketball prodigy. This movie depicts high school basketball star Jesus, (the SuperSonic's Ray Allen) and his hectic life leading up to his big decision: College or NBA? and if college, which one. It shows how he is pressured by agents, friends, and anyone else who can pressure him, and looks at advantages and disadvantages of both scenarios, the NBA and going to college. Denzel Washington plays Jesus's father, who is in prison for the manslaughter of his mother. Jesus acts as if he does not exist and hopes never to see him again. However, when the governor hears that an inmate in his system's son is the nation's top high school basketball star, he gives him a bargain; he will allow his father out of prison for a short period to try to convince Jesus to commit to his Alma Mator, The Big State University. If Jesus is willing to attend, his father will be paroled. This film also provides an indepth look at life in the inner city and high school, also the current issue of over publicizing high school sports and exposing kids to early. This movie will be particularly enjoyable if your are a basketball fan but is very good no matter what. This moving film provides an indepth look at a father trying to make a last appeal to a son, a struggling family, (Jesus and his sister) a struggling city, and a different perspective into the life of a high schooler.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|It's just so beautiful. Honestly, if the soundtrack is so great, hopefully the movie will be too. A different score than the other two movies, more bent on heroism and the tragedy and the ... well ... I bet if you read The Lord Of The Rings while you listened to ROTK, you can just see everything happen. I mean, wow, it it SO moving at the end. Annie Lennox has a wonderful voice. Get it now!

B00005JMGC|4.0|MONA LISA SMILE is beguiling not only because it's a well-done, mid-1950s period piece, but also because it stars the always-enchanting Julia Roberts. With a film title like that, who else would be appropriate?<br />Roberts is Katherine Watson, an art history teacher from California's public university system, who has the nerve to apply for - and get - a position on the faculty of the prestigious eastern college for women, Wellesley. Watson's goal is to make a difference in the lives of her students, but her Wacky West Coast feminism is immediately at odds with staid Wellesley tradition. The college is hardly more than a finishing school for marriage-bound debutantes. After all, it's 1953 and, at least according to contemporary cultural mores and commercial advertisers, a girl's ultimate dream is to be married to a successful white-collar professional, and have a house, children, washer and dryer, and a Hoover. To make things worse, Watson's first-day presentation in Art History 100 is gutted by a class that's already read the entire course syllabus. A humiliated Katherine must go to Plan B.<br />Watson's students are a mixed bag represented in the plot by: Betty (Kirsten Dunst), the patronizing and know-it-all editor of the school paper who's soon to be married to a young lawyer, Giselle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the free spirit that sleeps around, and Joan (Julia Stiles), who's torn between becoming a lawyer and getting married. Katherine is determined to get Joan into Yale Law School. Of the three, Dunst gives the most poignant performance as the one whose dream comes up against hard reality. And Joan's heartfelt explanation to Watson of her final choice gives Watson pause.<br />There are several reasons why MONA LISA SMILE is an engaging, almost-excellent film. As a period piece, it's lavish in its depiction of the music, fashion, dance, advertising, and social expectations of the time. (The pre-determined role for young women of the upper-middle and upper classes will likely cause feminists to grip the arms of their seats with a white-knuckled fury.)<br />MONA LISA SMILE has that general gist of MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (1995), i.e. the generally acknowledged but too rarely explored effect that a great teacher can have on young minds. The latter film was so excellent that, in comparison, I can't quite bring myself to award MONA LISA SMILE the same five stars. Compared to the career of Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss), which spanned decades, Watson's is a relative flash-in-the-pan over one academic year. (Also, I didn't find it so credible that Wellesley's severely conservative president should have been so surprised with Watson's non-conformity. I mean, didn't the college interview Katherine before giving her the nod, especially as she was coming from such a plebeian background? What were they thinking?)<br />Lastly, there's Julia Roberts, who perhaps hasn't done so well in a leading role since ERIN BROCKOVICH, for which she won a Golden Globe as Best Actress. I wouldn't be surprised to see a nomination stemming from this performance. It's a genuine treat to see her again in something other than a fluffy, romantic comedy.ll likely cause feminists to grip the arms of their seats with a white-knuckled fury.) <br />MONA LISA SMILE has that general gist of MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (1995), i.e. the generally acknowledged but too rarely explored effect that a great teacher can have on young minds. The latter film was so excellent that, in comparison, I can't quite bring myself to award MONA LISA SMILE the same five stars. Compared to the career of Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss), which spanned decades, Watson's is a relative flash-in-the-pan over one academic year. (Also, I didn't find it so credible that Wellesley's severely conservative president should have been so surprised with Watson's non-conformity. I mean, didn't the college interview Katherine before giving her the nod, especially as she was coming from such a plebeian background? What were they thinking?)<br />Lastly, there's Julia Roberts, who perhaps hasn't done so well in a leading role since ERIN BROCKOVICH, for which she won a Golden Globe as Best Actress.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Think of this album like a very fine wine, no in the sense that it gets better with age, but that for one to fully enjoy it you must develop a taste for what it is trying to present. For example when one is young, all wine tastes bad, and even if the most respected wine taster thought it was the best wine ever created, it will still taste bitter and displeasing. Just because YOU dont like the wine does not mean it is terrible. Almost every music critic that has reviewed this album has said it is great, doesn't that mean anything to all the people who are quick to throw away the album and give 1 star. This brings me to another point, which is that the majority of the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars, (the latter being dominant). This indicates many people were not thinkng and listening enough. YOUR REVIEW MATTERS. So don't be so quick to give it a rating after just a few listens, especially tis album. When I was first exposed to this album, I'll admit it, I fell asleep. I awoke thinking, &quot;what the hell are all these critics talking about?&quot; All the rave reviews i had heard led me to listen to the album again, and again, each time enjoying it a bit more yet still thinking it was boring. Eventually, I fell in love with this album and each one of its tracks. So please, if you've given this album a 1 or 2 because you think its boring, remember the best things do not come through instant gratification, but after several patient tries.
B00000JGHM|5.0|First, you guys all wrong!!! Robert De Niro and Al Pacino NEVERRRRR SAHRE A SCENE in the movie... if you look closely the scene in the restaurant, youll notice that they never appear in the same shot. They first did the pacino take, and then robert de niros part. CUZ THEY CAN BE IN THE SAME SCENE, I DONT KNOW WHY, BUT IS SOMETHING that they decided and requested.<br />BEST STREET GUN FIGHT EVEEEEEEERRRRR.<br />GET IT!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The album, &quot;In the Zone,&quot; may not have been one of the best cd's but its better than some other cd's I have heard. I will agree Britney Spears does not have a amazing voice, but she is a awesome performer and her songs are catchy. It doesn't matter what your voice sounds like, it matters how good of a performer you are.
0060930187|5.0|I recently asked my wife to create a list of the ten most important novels she has ever read; \\"The Bell Jar\\" was on her list.  I have spent the past two days reading Plath's novel and I come away from the book feeling vulnerable.  Plath has created a work that immerses the reader in a dark world in which mental stability is not a given.  I feel a new closeness to Plath for the struggle that was her life and for the power and urge that let her transform that into art.  She has ceased to be a \\"suicide victim\\" in my mind and has, instead, become a human being.<BR><BR>    I was initially surprised by the voice of the narrator.  It reminded me of Holden Caulfield -- honest, down-to-earth, knowledgeable, caustic.  I found Esther immediately likeable and a sympathetic character.  Reading like a diary at times, the story tells about simple events (a cab ride, a party, a visit from a boyfriend) told in simple language that frequently shines with such exquisite phrasing that I was forced to step back and laugh or smile or just appreciate Plath's ability to use language in such powerful and meaningful ways.  Two examples of this:<BR><BR> 1. Referring to a picture of Dwight Eisenhower in \\"Time\\" magazine, Plath writes: \\"The face of Eisenhower beamed up at me, bold and blank as the face of a fetus in a bottle.\\" (72)<BR> 2. \\"I felt limp and betrayed, like the skin shed by a terrible animal.  It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it seemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could lay its paws on.\\" (83)<BR><BR>   Language and technique made the sad events of the novel seem real and immediate.  Plath selects events in a masterful way, telling stories of simple conversations, giving brief insights into the narrator's mind, exposing fears, illustrating pathologies, foreshadowing events.  <BR><BR>   The horror of the initial suicide attempt stayed with me throughout the rest of the novel.  The second half that outlines her relationships with doctors and herstays in psychiatric institutions is dreamlike.  We abruptly find ourselves in new surroundings, in the middle of conversations.  This discontinuity creates a world that mimics Esther's increasingly nightmarish life.  As readers we do not calmly watch from a distance; we are thrown into the consciousness of the patient.<BR><BR>   \\"The Bell Jar\\" was a disturbing book, but one that expanded my understanding of Plath and her work and gave me a perspective on mental illness that I had previously lacked.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I love this film (and the book that inspired it).  It's a great true-life story which explains why reality is so much more inspiring and fulfilling than fiction.  I disagree with the amazon reviewer who didn't care for the narration style and nostalgic glimpses into the time period via film footage and photographs.  To me, it made the experience more evocative, as you get a definite sense of place, which is so often missing when today's filmgoers have little knowledge of history and just how important some things can be given a certain place, time, attitude.  The documentary style inserts work beautifully.  The only mistake the filmmakers' made, I think, are in not showing actual film footage of Seabiscuit's races, and other film on the horse, say during the closing credits.  Instead one has to look at actual documentaries.
0446677450|5.0|This book is not about giving solutions, recipies and such. It merely shows the way for some people who want to take a different path in life, make a change. Some things are so much &quot;common sense&quot; and ordinary that you need someone to remind you of them - like, for a self employed, income stops when they stop working. I enjoyed the contents of the book (the writing is not stellar) and it made me want to take more control of my financial life.
B0000DIXN7|5.0|What can i say? I really enjoy this album... I first heard her on Heavy TV, singing an acoustic version of Stronger than me, and i really loved her quirky, jazzy voice. The girl can sing! Then i found out she has a album coming out, and i thought, ok i'll take the chance and buy it. i did like her voice! :) I bought it the day it came out,and i can honestly tell you that her cd is still in my cd player!! It is irrestible! The album is brill from start 2 finish, but my fave songs are Stronger than me, know you now (WOW!) and take the box. <br />If you're sick of mainstream music at the moment and want something different, this is the album 4 you!.. her voice does resemble erykah badu, billie holiday, but she still maintains her own sound, without sounding like a best hits cd of billie holiday 4 example. She is unique, fresh, british and 19!! i can't believe at her age, she can come with such a &quot;grown up&quot; sound, and her lyrics are funny and witty. <br />I can not say any more than, just get it and listen to it. It is a very impressive debut. Keep comin with it Amy!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The Amazon review is pretty dead on, so I'd like to put in a few additional comments.  The original \\"Let It Be\\" was not the Fab Four's best effort, but still contains a lot of great music, particularly \\"Get Back,\\" the title track, \\"Let It Be,\\" and Lennon's \\"I've Got a Feeling.\\"  Some of the \\"Naked\\" version of the album is almost identical to the original, some of it is much more raw.  <br />For the most part, this is a good thing.  Removing all of the added tracks lets you hear the mistakes in what were live performances, including the missed vocals, the waiver in McCartney's voice.  Although less polished sounding, this also means you get to hear the raw talent that was the Beatles.  Phil Spector, the producer brought in to finish the album, should have been charged with murdered for what he did to Sir Paul's \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\"  The sripped version is marvelous.  This version has an unusual bit of instrumentation in the middle from some odd sounding keyboard, which I assume was either engineered in to fill in a gap in the soundtrack or engineered out of the original album, because it just doesn't sound like it belongs.  Beyond that, the new version is a masterpiece.<br />If your sound system is better than a $100 boom box, you will notice that the engineers did some very good work cleaning up the audio.  The tonal balance is improved, and tape noise has been substantially reduced, resulting in a very listenable CD.<br />The bonus disk, \\"Fly on the Wall,\\" is almost a waste unless you are a diehard Beatles fan.  It is an authorized \\"Beatles Bootleg\\" from the Let it Be sessions.  It would have been nice if, instead of giving us the bootleg, they put the album out on a higher quality DVD-Audio or SACD format.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban yet again sings with passion and emotion and you can feel every word!  Fantastic CD.
B00005B36H|5.0|I'll admit to having bought this album initially because of the well-deserved hype it received during its conception. Since then, I have bought every Tool album to date, and they are all masterpieces in their own right which continually grow better with age. Tool retains elements of greatness that are absent among much of today's mainstream garbage- intelligent lyrics; powerful, blistering riffs that are beautiful with their complexity; and an overall sound and stage presence that blow every other band in their genre out of the water.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania shows the reason she is a country mega star. Shania is UP! in this DVD. Shania walks down into the crowd and lets one sing a bit.Doing this shows Shania's love and willingness to be with the fans. The songs have more energy and shania seems to be more alive and full of energy in this performance.  I would recommand this DVD for everyone definitely!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Every song on this record is the best song ever written, not even debatable.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania shows a lot of life and spirit in her singing. There is heart felt warmth, love, friendship and just plain good advice in her songs. Shania showed she is a truly great talent. Shania also shows her love for her singing and her desire to ensure her fans see and hear the best she has.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This is a great have-fun album.  Jet has many upbeat songs that make you go crazy in your car while listening.  The only complaint is one or two too many slow songs (even though they are great songs too).
B0000TB03W|5.0|Only Shania could perform with the delight and talent shown in this DVD. Shania has proven she loves her fans and wants to be in front of them with great music. Great music is just what is here in this DVD. Shania pulls out all the stops and lets her voice and the power of the songs shine. She is a powerful person and performer.
0345440900|5.0|I'm a first-time mom of a seven-week-old girl.  Before reading this book, I read both the Nursing Mother's Companion and BabyWise (which came highly recommended by a few acquantances).  After having a very frustrating breast feeding experience in which my 6lb 6 ounce infant was hardly gaining weight, I gave up the demand-feeding methods recommended in the Nursing Companion (and ultimately went to formula feeding), but the scheduled feeding recommendations in BabyWise didn't feel right to me, either.<br />This book demonstrates a much more compassionate approach to infant rearing than either book, because both the parent AND the child are held in respect.  Not all of the methods worked for me - my baby sleeps after some feedings and wakes after others, she just doesn't seem to always conform to the EASY routine - however, the temperament section, and the section that interprets baby cries are worth the investment (both in money and time) in this book alone.  Her techniques for calming infants usually works for mine, and I found that I felt much more comfortable and confident as a parent after reading this book.   In fact, I plan to give the book as a gift to my now-pregnant cousin, who will also be a first-time-mom, this Christmas.  I couldn't recommend it more highly.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania just comes alive like I have never seen before. There was more depth to her singing. There was also new found joy of being in front of the people she loves to entertain.Make people happy with her music. Shania has found a new level one that most singers never reach. Shania has climbed and reached totally new heights with her music. Shania has proven again and again she is a true super star before but now no one can disagree that she is the new Queen of country music. Shania's songs can only inspire everyone who hears them. Live in Chicago is a mile stone.
0140077243|5.0|I read this book when it came out, and I rate it as one of the best books I ever read at the time.  The plot engulfs you and takes you into another world.  The character development is excellent.  This book teaches hope, teaches one to confront their fears, and empowers younger teens and pre-teens.  Highly recommend (much better than the movie).
B00000JPH6|5.0|This film was the first film Jim Henson did outside of the muppets and this film is in no way related to that except for the Henson. What's also unusal about this film is that there are no human characters, something we've been used to since the muppet movies and TV shows. It is orginal!<br />Jen is the last of his kind, a Gelfling. His race was mass murdered by the Skexis, a race that looks like a cross between lizards and spiders, because of an ancient prophecy that says a Gelfling will destroy their race. Jen is taken in by the race of mystics, six armed creatures who are pacifistic wizards. Their leader tells Jen of the prophecy and of how he has to heal the Dark Crystal in order to keep the world from going into darkness forever, sounds Tolkien-ish huh? <br />Wonderful production design and concepts by Brian Froud make this movie a feast for the eyes. The swamp scene, which is my favorite scene and where Jen meets Kira, reminds me of the Tulgy Wood scene in Alice in Wonderland in the sense that everything is alive!<br />This movie is mesmerizing. I watch it today with the same awe I had when I was a kid!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD is a must for any true Beatle/George fan.  This ranks right up there with the Last Waltz as one of the great concert films of all time.   The sight and sound is phenomenal and the performances are absolutely stunning.  You can really feel that they are all truly playing out of love and respect for a friend and fellow artist that they, and we, truly miss.  There are so many highlights that you will enjoy watching it over and over.  From the initial audience recognition of the opening strains of &quot;The Inner Light&quot; by Jeff Lynne to McCartney beginning &quot;Something&quot; just strumming on the ukelele to the full band joining in with Clapton and McCartney harmonizing on the chorus, well, to quote George, &quot;It's All Too Much&quot;.  The heart-warming performance by Ringo is just lovely.  The recognition between Ringo and Paul on &quot;For You Blue&quot; when in unison they acknowledge the &quot;twelve bar blues&quot; that George had sung on the original is delightful to see that the two remaining Beatles still enjoy performing together.  Some other standouts that deserve mention are Gary Brooker on keyboards and vocals on &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; and Billy Preston on Hammond B-3 and vocals on &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; w/Eric Clapton and &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot;.  &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; also gets an interesting re-working as the chorus is joined with the chorus from &quot;Hey Jude&quot; which make for interesting counterpoints.  This band truly puts in a spectacular performance.  Being able to watch all these people on stage, together, and with the benefit of history, knowing the contributions all of them made to rock and roll as well as humanitarian causes makes it all the more incredible.  And behind it all was Eric Clapton.  He truly puts on a remarkable performance and appears to be truly inspired by being able to perform his friend's music and keeping it true.  This DVD is a classic concert film that should go into your collection along with such features as The Last Waltz and Gimme Shelter.
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi is the equivalent of a 3-star movie with higher aims.  Its jokes are not so funny, its inventiveness is not so inventive, its action nearly nonexistent.  The story concerns Pi, an unlikely young Indian boy who decides to worship God through various religions (well, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian - I suppose, the main religions in India).  When the boat carrying his family to North America sinks, he is forced to share a boat with a hungry tiger and master the skills of survival in the opean sea.<br />To be fair, Pi is well-written, lucid, and absorbing at times (Pi's adventure on the island and some moments with the tiger).  However, it falls short of the kind of nuanced survival story once told by Daniel Defoe.  I would recommend this book to junior high-high school aged readers.  My other problem with the text was the awful treatment of Pi's family's demise, although it's possible to treat the rest of the book's tone as a way of dealing with grief while avoiding it.
B0000AI45P|3.0|I've been hearing about this album for ages and have purchased it 3 times over the last 15 years, each time with the thought that I must be missing something as it's always so highly praised by everyone.  With the reissue I figured it will sound glorious and maybe I'll finally get it.... well I still don't, the songs are still mediocre and really the guitar interplay is not the the holy grail of rock n roll like people cite it as... interesting yes, but not this incredible thing everyone has made it out to be.  I also disagree with everyone's opinion about the additional material ruining the integrity of the original concept etc. that' just a load, it's a cd for crying out loud, you can program it to stop when you want it to. My opinion on the &quot;untitled instrumental&quot; is that it's probably the best thing on here showing a more surf music side to the band and it actually almost has a melody which most of the original album lacks in my opinion. One interesting thing I noticed after recently purchasing the reissue of Crocodiles by Echo &amp; The Bunnymen just after listening to the Television reissue is that The Bunnymen were definately influenced by Television, you can here it in the straining vocal and the guitar interplay between Ian McCulloch and Will Sargent, it may not be as fancy to you guitar geeks but the interplay and choice of notes etc. is much more satisfying in my opinion, so if you want GREAT songs cool punked up attitude mixed with some psych influences purchase the remastered version of Crocodiles instead of Marquee Moon... oh yeah and it has loads more bonus material, and yes Amazon sells this as an import to... I'll go dodge the hail of bullets now. Cheers!
B00005TT77|4.0|Is it any surprise a soundtrack with songs by Aimee &amp; Michael, Rufus, Heather, Sarah, Sheryl, Benny, and Grandaddy wouldnt find it's way on my top cd list? Like most other reviewers I will say that the arrangements do not seem to be very different from that of the original Beatles' tunes. Funny though since I'm not a big Beatles fan...(still waiting for that Beach Boys cover soundtrack). I haven't seen the film yet, nor know if I want to; seems it could be too schmaltzy and laugh then cry at the retard. I enjoy the Black Crows version of &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot; thanks to the Brion-esque production though I find Crow &amp; Folds respective tracks disappointing, especially right next to each other. The Wallflowers also do a better job than normal for them. It's sort of a &quot;concept&quot; disc in a loose sense. Want to get the import to hear Aimee's cover of &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot; &amp; I think Neil Finn has a cut on the import too. Fave Tracks: Aimee Mann &amp; Michael Penn &quot;Two Of Us,&quot; Rufus Wainwright &quot;Across The Universe,&quot; Heather Nova &quot;We Can Work It Out.&quot;
B0000DIXN7|5.0|What can I say.....one of the best British female voices around.  <BR>A cross between Billie holiday, macy gray, Nina Simone and is still<BR>Able to sound unique.<BR>When I heard Amy on Jools Holland I thought she was a lot older than <BR>Her 19 years.  Her maturity and song writing, lyricism and wit surpasses her<BR>Years.<BR>Stronger than me, f**k me pumps are very strong songs and `there is no<BR>Greater love' juxtapose her different vocal capabilities and range<BR>I recommend any person who enjoys classy female vocals to purchase<BR>This album because it hasn't left my cd player
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Moulin Rouge was one of my favorite movies of last year, so the inclusion of its' soundtrack on my top 20 should be of little surprise. I could do without the new version of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; and would've rather heard more songs included from the movie rather than being enticed to purchase a second edition of the disc which wasn't released until about a year later. I really enjoy that Ewan &amp; Nicole don't have classically trained vocals as I think the wavering of the vocal cords provides for the expression of more emotion than if they had been singing their entire careers. Plus the disc has a Rufus Wainwright song on it giving him at least 2 mentions in this year's top 20! Moulin Rouge is the epitome of postmodernism and will surely be celebrated 50 years from now as one of the movement's pivotal films &amp; musical selections. (originally written May 2002)
B00005JM02|2.0|this movie, though cute left me a little flat.  it was not nearly as funny as ice age and monster's inc..  thou ellen degeneres  was very funny as the spacy fish  the movie just kind of fell flat in my opinion
B00005LB9O|5.0|Make no bog about it, the boys from Scotland are back in town. {rimshot} Travis 3rd disc, The Invisible Band, follows in much the same vein as their international breakthough The Man Who, though no track on Invisible is as instantly catchy as &quot;Why Does It Always Rain On Me?&quot; and &quot;Driftwood&quot; were. Nigel Godrich produced this one too. Just wish the boys woulda' toured more off of this disc than their opening/co-headlining spot with Dido in summer 2001, and their club tour with Remy Zero that fall. If you get to see them live, do it. They seem happier than anybody else to be performing and enjoying their own music with Andy's high scissor kicks and Dougie's strutting. &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot; is prolly the happiest song Franny has written. &quot;Safe&quot; sounds like it coulda came from many a film soundtrack. Fave tracks: &quot;Flowers In The Window,&quot; &quot;The Cage,&quot; &quot;Safe.&quot;
B00009TB5G|5.0|So we get through the amazing movie with the added scenes(&amp; as everyone has written- it's really gave more insight to the story!).  We put in the 3rd and 4th disc and they wouldn't play.  We took it back to the store and exchanged it and still had the same problem.  If you are buying this for a gift, save the receipt in case there's a problem. Hopefully the third try is a charm.  Tolkien has to be so proud that Jackson has reminded people how relevent these stories are.  Whether you read the books and/or watch the movies, you're thinking about Tolkien's work ultimately and that's got to suit him just fine!
B00005Y7AW|5.0|There are no words to describe Rufus' beauty - both physically and musically. Each song tells it's own story I can relate to in so many ways whether it's the sinful vices of \\"Cigarettes & Chocolate Milk\\" and \\"Greek Song,\\" the materiality and phoniness of today's world in the title track and \\"California,\\" the solitude of \\"One Man Guy,\\" or just wanting to run away with your lover and play \\"The Consort.\\" His voice will take many some time to get used to, but once you do you realize many of the wonderful performances it can command. So much has been said about him being an openly gay performer. (Has there been a review yet to not mention it?) Sexuality aside, when you get right down to it he's just a hopeless romantic singing about love - not just any love, this isn't schoolgirl and first crush love - but loves for the ages. Opera love where the suitor must conquer a nation to win the hand of his fair maiden. Love that would knock down buildings. Love to give artists a new ideal of emotion and beauty for which to strive. Wainwright expands on themes from his eponymous debut and turned what could be considered a thinking man's camp (earlier songs like \\"Matinee Idol\\" and \\"Beauty Mark\\") to a mature and fuller sound that the seriousness of his compositions would lend themselves (songs like \\"The Tower of Learning\\" and \\"Grey Gardens\\"). By opening himself and exposing his heart - both the good and the bad - Rufus has firmly lodged himself in mine and will undoubtedly reside there for a long time to come. Fave tracks: \\"Greek Song,\\" \\"The Tower of Learning,\\" \\"The Consort.\\"
B000002J09|5.0|This album is PHENOMINAL, and to the reviewer who called this album &quot;Junk&quot;, and listed of bunch of nu-metal/rock Sh*t, let me tell you something, first of all:, all those bands you mentioned are all crap, no talent, second of all: If it weren't for Led Zeppelin, you wouldn't have those talent-less bands, anyways, this is my fav, Buy it
B0000C6E4D|3.0|dear sarah,<br />i have listened to your new cd once. afterglow. and i have to say i find it disappointingly average. i will admit i wanted to like it less than i actually did, and i like it more than i thought i would, but it is still average, nothing more. many of the songs sound like rehashes of earlier fumbling towards ecstasy tunes. of course, fte may be your greatest album so can we blame you for trying to reclaim the ground you've lost over the past six years through your greatest opus? and a lot of the rest of the cd sounds like alternate takes on randy newman's theme from toy story two that you sang on, \\"when she loved me.\\" now, \\"when she loved me\\" is maybe the second best thing you've put out since surfacing (mainly because of mr. newman i'm suspecting, and b/c for the most part it's really the only thing you've put out since surfacing), and better than about 80% of that album. but this new one, after one listen, i don't know. you've lost the bite. i think you've lost the drive. blame it on finding love, the death of your mother, or the birth of your child...but gone is the kick, the torment, and many of the things that made your music interesting. you used to have such a great voice...for the most part, that hasn't gone anywhere...but there are just so many more better voices out there now. people who take risks and know when to place just the right crack and warble for emotional affect. maybe you should've stopped with the success of lilith fair and the birth of the whole \\"women in rock\\" thing. let that be your swan song, instead of an average album. we know you are capable of better, love. and i got to say that it's disappointing (though most likely accurate) to predict your next release (in three years) will be a greatest hits cd, and maybe you'll squeak out another cd in 6 years when i've reached the age of mortgage-cence. should i blame you or should i blame pierre? pierre is a very talented producer, yes. i think his work on rufus wainwright's poseswas fantastic and just what my favorite gay icon needed after working with jon brion. but i think your collaboration with pierre has become rather everyday and formulaic. i realize the comfortability and the safety that working with the same producer has to offer, but it's these risks that keep afterglow sub-interesting. you & pierre don't risk anything, you don't take a chance on anything new. i think i'd almost rather see you produced by david foster (celine dion, the corrs) at this point than pierre again. dear sarah, this is my plea to you. make me interested in you again. you're a very talented darling, you really are. but somewhere along the lines it got lost. lost in blandness. lost in everydayness. lost in ordinariness.<br />best,<BR>superball9
B000002J1O|5.0|This was the first album i heard of pre gabriel genesis...and i was just absolutely stunned by their complex  musical talent and amazing work on the keyboards ( I am a big time ELP fan and would compare the amazing riff on  Cinema show to Keith Emerson )<BR>    The album is lovely a pleasure to listen and i just cant get tired of it ....but there is one song ..The Battle, this song i just cant get like its just does not get to me ... i have tried to listen to it a number of times but all in vain... this is one song on the album that i always love to skip   ..but still this album gets the five star  rating as without this song the album still does not sound too short and is a amazong experiance to all the way ... anyone who wants to start from Gabriel Genesis Selling England is the place to start.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This 1994 Disney animated masterpiece is arguably one of the greatest movies they have ever made. <br />Teh story is of a lion cub who is driven into exile by his traitorous uncle after his father is killed but as an adult lion, he now has to return to Pride Rock and take back the throne from his evil uncle and take his rightful place as the king. This movie is just awesome. <br />The DVD edition has tons of new features such as two version, that's right, TWO versions of this film. One is the original theatrical edition and the other is the IMAX version with previously unreleased footage incorporated into the film. There are also some fun commentary and a hilarious deleted draft called &quot;Bug Football&quot; that is so funny. I could honestly do without &quot;Morning Report&quot; as it is rather dull and too short to really have an impact. <br />An excellent movie benifitted from an excellent DVD! Like another reviewer said: Buy this DVD today and throw out your old VHS tapes!!
B0000CFW87|3.0|If you ever hear Secret Garden's version of You Raise Me Up, you'll see that this is an inferior version. Emotion is clearly lacking here.
B00001XT76|1.0|i don't like dance movies in the first place, so it was really hard for me to enjoy this. <BR>actually, i didn't enjoy it.
