B009KG7EMC|5.0|if you're looking for a good storyline, forget it. These are awesome to see all the actors in one movie
020161622X|4.0|its a very good book! What you will learn here can be applied across a huge area of expertises, not only programming! Worth the time to read!
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Decent comic book movie.  Fun action scenes, and not too serious.  Nothing earthshattering, but if you're looking for a decent comic book movie to kill some time, this is as fine a choice as any.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was an interesting book. It kept my attention the whole time. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the entertainment. It made me think quite a few times, I am ready for more! Would like to see different twists in the next levels.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|For me, it was at times challenging and was easy to solve many of the puzzles, but not too easy, so I wasn't. bored. felt good to complete a puzzle all the way thru. This game was pure fun.!
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I love Dan Brown's writing.  And considering all we are hearing about surveillance these days, I found myself initially rooting for who I thought were the good guys - the ones keeping us safe.  But I must admit, my enthusiasm began to waiver the further I read.  The book presents us with the real dilemma of how much is enough, and how far should we go.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander has given us the privilege of sharing his amazing near-death experience.  While most of us will never experience it on Earth, it gives one pause and insight into a place where we long to be--a perfect place, without fear and lots of love for all with our Creator. Can this be true?  I am convinced and committed to making my mission here to help others find their way to Heaven.
B005K17RU0|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT APP . I USE IT ALL THE TIME , IT IS PRETTY ACCURATE ,PREDICTS WEATHER FOR 15 DAYS. WITH UPDATES, MAPS , WEATHER WARNINGS. TOLD MY FRIENDS. GOOD APP !!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book tore my heart out, but opened my eyes. Great read best one all summer. Some of the reviews gave away the story, still read it, it's beyond worth it.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|We had this book for our book club, with the option of the movie or the book. Whilst most had seen the film they did not know the book was &#34;written&#34; by the horse. I liked the latter version better.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Once you start the game you will not be able to put it down. Graphics are smooth and the shuffle option is a must.
B00CXQL828|5.0|As a lover of true rock, this album ticked all the boxes.<br />Great melodies and fantastic performances by the elite in Rock music
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I just recently updated the app and now I cant play it. I am so very upset because it has taken me so long to get where I am in this game. I absolutely loved this game, and I never had any problems before updating it. I hated uninstalling the game to see if that might help, but it didn't do anything. It totally hugged my Kindle Fire. Ugh! Someone please fix this update. Pretty please? T-T
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works great.  I will love it even more when more providers sign on to provide more content. No problems!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is such a funny book! I loved it. The story keeps you interested and the writing is great. Love her books.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Love it! Its addicting and entertaining to play... the last guy is like agassi on speed lol I bought the racquet for it to helo and I still cant beat him
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|Heart pounding,and evokes everything that was great about the movie.  Joe Wright was dead on, stating he was &#34;very excited to finally ... work with a more modern beat. There's a lot of bass, it's very loud.&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Keeps getting better! I Wonder where they will go from here...... New family dynamic. Can't wait for season 4 wonder when it starts...

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Has good graphics and challenges to overcome this is a really good game if you like Diablo you well like this game
B00AF82WTO|5.0|As you know most of these Jane Austin movies have been made over several times with different actors in them. I had bought another version with different actors, but this one had the characters I like more than the other. All the Jane Austin movies are great, but it's nice to have a choice as to which actors one likes better.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|My family LOVED this movie even though it's in French.  So nice to see a disability through another's eyes and know that there can be fun as well as difficulty.
0553801473|5.0|I can't wait for Book 6.  The TV series has plenty of  inspiration to continue its great run in the game of thrones.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Yet again, Jeaniene Frost does it!  The Night Huntress series is a very fast read.  I would recommend these books to anyone.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love this show.  There are at least three plot lines that keep going at once to keep me interested.  The character development is just awesome.  Just love it.
B0073SPDHM|5.0|Wonderful no nonsense approach to making ice cream. This was the first book I bought to use with my ice cream machine and even though i now own a small library of ice cream cook books this is the favorite. I use organic free range eggs so i am not afraid to use them raw.........................just wash them off beforehand.<br />Have made Ben's chocolate and the raspberry which i added Chambord to and its out of this world, strawberry and blueberry and looking forward to trying many more .........the recipes are easy to cut in half if you want to make a pint or double for a half gallon.......so you can make what you need but do plan on using within a week since there are no stabilizers used.
0740785508|3.0|It gives ideas on proportions and perspective on monsters and/or trolls or fairies to reflect realistic believability in your art of drawing exotic beings.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I was attracted to this book, as I was curious how women inmates lives would look.  Written well, and I believe honest.
1594204217|5.0|This book is wonderful!  Michael Pollan is a beautiful writer; his descriptions fill your mind with glorious pictures, his prose is heart-warming, his history is eye-opening and you feel smarter just reading his books. The four parts are Fire, Air, Water and Earth. We are taken into each way of cooking historically and how each has evolved in different cultures. We happily learn about the importance of cooking our food, to ourselves and our families and to end the hold the food industry has on us and the harm the convenience is doing to us. I wish everyone would read this book, I know everyone would enjoy it.
B00009NQQO|2.0|Cute toy but the net is already starting to come off of the ring after only a few months of fairly gentle play by my 1 year old.  Too bad because she likes putting the balls in the net.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Regina G. Sabato i had the same problen but i messed around in the settings for a little and i dont know wut i did but it fixed it i went to more in the tab u pull down from top screen then applications then i just messed around there do that 4 a little bit and see if it helps anywyas i have not played it yet it did not finish but i love the card game hope it finishes soon
140006922X|3.0|Using scholarly research regarding those times the author systematically picks apart the New Testament. I enjoyed the historic perspective but the author had a definite agenda that was insensitive.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Would have paid a buck for it  It is a fun game. Was able to get it cor free and is a lot of fun.
B009K5257M|5.0|This is one of the very few scary movies that never gets old. Perfect, especially around Halloween time! Thinking about buying it to watch anytime.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|very thrilling. Smooth shifts and I liked the way Robie was depicted as a hardliner with a soft heart for the girl. Great book
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great streaming quality.  Amazon needs to enable Airplay on the Instant Video app for the Ipad.  I really enjoyed the season.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I love the emotion portrayed in the film and the scenes from Lincoln's life that were highlighted. The music is also perfect for the movie.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|So my cousin comes to me wanting me to build him a Gaming PC hands me $1500 to play with and I went to town.  This is the case I selected since he said he wanted the most the gaming performance I could give him without any bottlenecks.  So onto the case its a pretty solid mid tower case comes with 2 fans a 120mm rear and 140mm top, and space for 3 120mm fans in the front and side.  There is plenty of room for everything even without a removable hard drive cage there is still 12.5\\" (317.5mm) of room for a graphics card, so his MSI GTX 770 fit without any trouble.  The cable management is great the motherboard tray is lifted so in places you have 1/2\\" to a full 1\\" of cable space depending on the where the cables are.  This case does have front USB3 but if you have say an AM3+ 970 board the cable has both standard USB2 and USB3 plugs so it is backwards compatible.  There are two removable air filters one for the PSU and one for the front of the case, there are no filters on the 2 exhaust fans and not on the side either but that's okay I guess..... Some things I don't like the Case  === 1. the inside is unpainted(knew that when I ordered it) 2. the mesh where the fans are feel a little flimsy like some firm pressure could bend them.  That is it! A Great Case, and a very happy cousin!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I have only received one issue, but I like it so far. Much of what I see is out of reach for me, but I can adapt some of the ideas to what fits into my budget. You don't need a lot of money to have fun, no matter where you are.
B001LKQDCM|5.0|I would recommend this CD to anyone wanting a little something different. It is relaxing, intriguing, and full of passion.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game it is also a great movie.  I wish it was the same version that is on my iPhone though
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best every very good on the mine and eyes. Bring games like this to my apps. Others should look at Amazon apps and see all they have offer best app site.
0394818237|4.0|Our soon just loves this book so much.  The stories are great and it teaches him so much of a variety of topics.
B000000OPQ|5.0|Loved the movie and had to have the CD so I could listen to the songs in my car.. If you love music from the 70's, you will want this CD..
0345529057|5.0|AMAZING PRICE! I wanted to read these because a friend got me watching the series and I usually think that books are better than the movies/tv shows. IT totally is. Wonderful series. Great read.
B000002KYR|5.0|I bought this CD because it has a lot of good songs on it.. Sharped Dressed Man and Leggs are my favorites!!  Miss this kind of music... The radio doesn't play them so I purchased the CD..
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I've read Enders Game and was riveted to the end.  It keeps you on your toes until the final word.<br /><br />What a great easy quick read.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|fun game little bit of a challenge.Hopefully I can figure out the stages that are in it later on.I have
0345529057|5.0|Games Of Thrones (book) is simply wonderful! I cannot wait to get into Clash of Kings! I shall let you know how I enjoy that one as well!  The books obviously have a lot of details that one cannot get in the series, however, I love them both! EXCELLENT READ!
B002SRQ214|3.0|Could not use this in my computer because it did not match my cpu socket.  I order the right one and it works great, return this for a refund to my account.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|I absolutely love the YouTube app for all my android devices. I'm hooked on this app since I can learn pretty much anything on YouTube.<br /><br />these surveys are pretty darned strict tho....sometimes I don't want to write 20 words. you may want to change that. I would do more surveys with a little more leeway
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a must read book. Can't wait to read book 2 Catching Fire .  This book kept my interest throughout the entire book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The mark of a great book is one you read over and over again.  And in this particular case, one you experience over and over again with amazing results.  I love doing Experiment One repeatedly, which is to expect an unexpected blessing in the next 48 hours.  In fact, do it right now.  Look at the time (for me it's 5:20 on Tuesday), and give yourself 48 hours for the blessing to manifest.  And your only job is to receive that blessing.  Awesome.  Easy to do.  What else could you ask for?  Among the many blessings that have come out of the blue:  a check in the mail, a long-lost friend who emailed me, a beautiful thank you note written to me, an invitation to go to the beach, a free dessert,  unexpected presents, etc.  Can you see why I LOVE doing the experiments again and again?  So get this book.  It's worth it.  And lots of fun to see things manifest in your energy field.  In fact, I have everyone I know doing Experiment One over and over again just because it's fun to see what happens.  The other ones are fun to do as well.  In fact, my friends and I entertained ourselves with the Einstein wands (dowsing rods) for an entire evening.  I would strongly suggest doing the experiments in this book with other people to compare notes.  Try this book!  I think you'll like it!  :)
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I love all of Avenged Sevenfold, starting with Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. I like that none of their records sound exactly alike.  This album definitely makes me think more of old school metal (and no I am not talking about hair bands).  Almost reminds me of Dio like songs.  This whole album is great though, highly recommend it for any Avenged Sevenfold fan.  Also, in regards to the reviews saying they have gone soft, this record is harder than some of their other records, so not sure what the other reviewer is comparing it to.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|Not quite as intuitive as the PC application, but gets the job done, and allows you to communicate with all your people on Steam, although that is only of value if you want to talk to people on Steam, who you do not want to have your phone # for texting etc.
0061906220|5.0|Greatly simple book and song - my 3 year old loves it.  The song makes it.  He bops his head and sings along.  Good fun.
B003FK8V7G|4.0|better than the 59 sound. amazing album all around. not quite as on par with hand written but definitely worth checking out.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Wonderful album. I bought this about half way through &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34;. Shame this guy never got the recognition he deserved until just now.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Great game for a Rainey day.  You have to have good eyesight to find the double objects as you cannot enlarge.  If you love hidden object with a story this is the game for you.  Looking forward to part two.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|Movie was not as good as the book was. I could have done without all the extra added story that didnt add anything to the movie.
B009AY04A8|4.0|this is a great hidden object game. lots of different kinds of searching objects. I am enjoying the graphics as well as the disloyal.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Love Wes Anderson and have never been disappointed by one of his movies. Saw this in theaters and immediately pre-ordered this blu-ray. Can't wait to see what Wes creates next.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game!!! Lots of fun building your soldiers and going into battle! Also the race games are fun as well!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game fun to play the different games makes it more interesting.<br />Have fun and relax at the same time try it
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The soundtrack is wonderful, and it is pulled directly from the movie. If you're looking for the full Les MIserables experience, I recommend you get the 25th anniversary edition of the soundtrack.<br /><br />Movie Edition: 20 songs<br />25th Anniversary Edition: 38 songs
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love the large LED screen and the downloaded music to wake up by...reliable alarm, just overall very useful!  Love it!
B00E9PXI3S|3.0|It was interesting but went dull at the end, I would still say its worth watching though, especially if you are a Rachel Mcadams fan.
B005HJ6MRO|3.0|I originally thought that it would back up all devices that are connected to the router.  You are able to view files on the Kindle.
141694737X|5.0|My toddler loves flap books. Dear Zoo has been a BIG hit since he received it! He loves the stories, the interactive play with the flaps and I love the illustrations. This book was recommended by a friend who has three school age children and they all loved this book. It is Very Cute and I would recommend it highly!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game. It gives you plenty of energy to work with. I have not, and do not plan on purchasing anything. So we will see how far I get.
030759565X|5.0|This book, and blog site, were recommended by a friend. It is my new obsession! This food is wholesome, approachable and yummy.  The photos are incredible and the stories accompanying each recipe are great! You feel like you could just sit and have a cup of coffee with the author and be right at home. I have given this to 4 different friends and they are all Smitten Kitchen Groupies! She had me at the roast chicken recipe and I am now a complete SK convert! Enjoy~
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is enjoyable and challenging to play<br />This app is easy to get around in. I am new to apps and have been pleased with the ease of use in this game
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This is a good game to pass the time, it can also become addicting. It has good graphics for a free to play game. However Game loft has no way to save your progress so if you have spent a lot of time playing and building do not do anything that would require you to reinstall the game because you game will be lost. for a game with so many players I feel this problem should be addressed so that you can continue to play your game.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Fun movie with lots of action. It brings together some old heroes along with some new ones. So if you just want to see some meaningless excitement with lots of action this is your movie.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Great show, and so glad that I could buy it for a great price! Came in the condition in which it was described.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'd give it 9 out of 10 stars so I rounded up to 5 of 5. It was a much better book than the second in the series and it was a good ending. It could've gone more in depth into the history of panem and the characters and games, but it capped the series well. I was not disappointed in this series, the only frustrating parts to read are when katniss goes catatonic a la Bella from twilight because she can't have both boys.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Great show, and so glad that I could buy it for a great price! Came in the condition in which it was described.
B005HSL626|5.0|Who knew slashing fruit could be so fun.  You find yourself always trying to beat your best score.  A good hand eye coordination game.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I love Bowie. I have been listening to him since 1973. This is not my favorite cd of his but I still liked it a lot!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Just got my kindle and really like mahjong, so thought I'd try this version. like it alot. Surprised how fast it downloaded, I live in sticks!!
B004TI5N38|3.0|Put together in a hurry...not usual quality..confusing at times...rambling...Some of the story was omitted<br />nighttime photography made it difficult to view.
0307352153|4.0|Susan Cain's point of view is so sympathetic toward introverts that it made me respect and value them more after reading the book. Her research seems exhaustive at times, but gives much food for thought.  Her style is gentle and perceptive, as she is an introvert that models the \\"Still waters run deep\\" saw.  Plus, although this subject has been discussed many times over the decades, Cain manages to come up with new facts and insights that still regale her reader, by taking us into the heart and minds of these people. She also offers valuable pointers such as showing how introverts can improve society as employees and leaders,  ways to parent and teach introvert children, and more.  But the most important feeling I came away with after reading this book was the incredible value and worth she conveys about these individuals who have so often been devalued and misunderstood in our society.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the3rd season of the struggling wealthy! Challenging times for the blue bloods of  England, while the 20th century rolls on. Women in the work force, medical progress, blurred lines when one of the working class marries into and is part of the next generation. Emotional, historical and a visual treat to watch.
0385341008|5.0|Just loved the book.  Highly recommend it.  Our book group as a whole thought it interesting.  Would recommend it for anyone to read.
B001TODCII|5.0|When I buy, I always look for go Hastings to see if they have the product. I trust them always to make it right if I'm not happy 100%
1452101248|5.0|Beautiful book, wonderfully presented and his passion for food comes through every page. love it, it love it, love it.
B000002GBD|5.0|I bought this for my husband. It was in great shape and he listen to this at least once a day thank you.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this weather app...with 1 click it I can see  what the weather is like &amp; what the weather is going to be like the rest of the week, so convenient!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Though it was a short game (so far), it definitely proved to be challenging on some of the levels. It really makes you think about all of the possibilities, and challenges you to think outside the box. I hope to see more levels soon.
B00AYB0SQQ|5.0|Plot: the most unlikely of aliens invades a local high school with plans of conquering everyone in it's sight! ...See if you can guess who it is!<br /><br />1. All around great cast!<br />2. Great performances and interesting allies made from the most unlikely of friends<br />3. Caught me off guard the first time I watched this with who the head alien is, cudos for not being completly predictable<br />4. the movie moves along, dialogue is believable...oh and did I mention there's some nudity??<br /><br />I recommend watching this for entertainment, solid B+/ A-
630463949X|4.0|The covering was not in that great shape, but the CD was excellent! Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to purchase it! I have been enjoying often.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|My god what a heart felt tear jerker this movie is.<br /><br />Plot: Cage is an angel who falls in love with Ryan and must become mortal to share his love and affection with her...but can it last? Can he undo what has already been done?<br /><br />1. The cast is pretty good, dialogue is great for this genre, Cage and Ryan make a believable couple<br />2. This movie is so well written you feel every ounce of sadness and passion as if you were the character<br />3. There is a great underlining point in this movie that you must watch all the way through to fully understand<br />4. Excellent soundtrack, Peter Gabriel's 'I grieve' couldn't be any more well suited for this movie!<br /><br />Watch this for date night or if you need a good cry! Solid B+/A-
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|its fun......very challenging but still able to level up i look forward to playing bubble blaze daily....enjoy playing along with me
B005LLXBYA|4.0|this cd, 'best of disco' is better than originally thought. besides the holder itself, the music is nice. I would suggest this cd to anyone who does like music
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I JUST GOT THIS APP FREE YESTERDAY, AUGUST 26, 2013. IT IS VERY COOL. THERE ARE LOTS OF CREATIVE PAGES TO TAKE NOTES ON. YOU CAN TAKE PICTURES AND DOWNLOAD PICTURES FROM FILES. THERE ARE VIDEOS U CAN TAKE TOO AND DOWNLOAD THEM TOO. THERE R LOTS OF PRETTY PICTURES 2 PUT THERE. IF U DID NOT GET IT FREE, GET IT. WORTH YOUR MONEY!
B005SAP45I|3.0|This film is a bit if stretch. Formula is being kind. McQueen is a token appearance but it is all about Mater. The film is aimed for parents more than kids, an inversion of the prior release. As such a feeling of awkwardness prevails. Ok but one feels somewhat creepy watching it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game every day it is fun , it has alot of fun games very fun and nive to be around .
B00BPB4EFU|4.0|More tracks from the vaults! Some of them give you a glimpse inside the mind of Hendrix the songwriter, as they are &#34;prototypes&#34; of songs we are all familiar with. As usual, Eddie Kramer does his usual stellar job of making these forgotten tapes sound so good that you'd think they were recorded recently, not decades ago.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I have read several reviews this app would not work with Kindle Fire HD.I t works fine with my Fire HD and a HP Photosmart 5520 printer.My printer has the eprint mode where you send your print jobs to an email account.This is a hassle that is why I tried this app.It linked with printer with no problems.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|I was a kid when the original King Kong movie was made.  I found it boring.  The remakes afterwards were okay, but boring.  THIS one finally gets all the story right, with spectactular effects, acting, script, cinematography, directing, the whole enchilada.  Because, they include all the pathos, and the whole portrayal is the most authentic to the idea.  First time I've ever even liked the story, is with this version.<br /><br />I don't know what's on the DVD, this is just based on the extended version of the movie.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|I didn't receive this product.<br />I checked the tracking and it said DELIVERED but the simple fact is, I DIDNT RECEIVE IT.<br />I tried emailing the SELLER but NO RESPONSE.<br /><br />SORRY But DISAPPOINTING. I am not a mean customer, and I just really want to see this movie for a long time since i missed the showing, so... I HOPE THE SELLER CAN SEE THIS AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.<br /><br />THANKS!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|While different from previous offerings, Mr Sanderson has once again produced a truly enjoyable novel. I hope to read more of this storyline in the near future.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|Enter of the Dragon is an excellent film in it s own right. Now, it has been enhanced by possibly some restoration and Blue Ray. The sound is better the images is better. It looks great. If you area fan of this film then this is a must have.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|No BS - to the point - engaging - persuasive, the author speaks from experience. I'm an artist/painter - and this book helped (and still helps) me to press on into the fray and fight the resistance that attacks me (and us all) daily.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Don't waste your time or pennies on this ap. That is of course unless you want to see a news video from somewhere else.
140006922X|5.0|Fascinating account that conforms to Jewish and secular histories of Jesus, the human being, whose sole intent was to rid Palestine of Roman rule.  This book has angered many Christians because it was written by a Muslim but Aslan makes a sound case for his opinions.  Yes, there is some conjecture here but the author's most convincing arguments use the words of Jesus himself and his disciples' account of him to make the case that Jesus of Nazareth was a zealot whose goal was to return rule of Judea to the Jews, and to overturn the Jewish priesthood and hereditary rulers in league with the Romans.<br /><br />I would like to add my own conjecture that Aslan is likely not a pure Muslim but probably a moderate, modern individual who wants to reform Islam and disarm fundamentalist Christians. He does not recognize Jesus as a prophet which is contradictory to what Mohammad thought.<br /><br />This book is an absorbing read that certainly stirs the pot.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a pretty fun game the only thing is getting the tickets is a little annoying because you have to have them and coins
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me riveted for several days.  Could not wait to have time to pick it up and read.  I don't want to give anything away but I would like to have rewritten the ending...
B00DHKKN6Q|1.0|My kindle fire stopped responding and continued to play. the theme music even after  turning off the device.I needed to get technical help to restore settings.

B0078XFYDA|5.0|Defining the difference between goblin magic and the magic of science is important for a reality check.  Get a reality check. Buy the book.  I also recommend this for teenage readers, who might just be starting to question the universe.  It's an easy read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is fun and I like it because it helps you get inboard<br />and that is all I have to say
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book for me was slow to start, as it was when I was in school and tried to read it.  However, unlike a school child, I have perseverance now, coupled with knowing that it is a classic and what that foretells about a book.  I am so glad I pressed on!!<br /><br />I am reading this book now, and so can't report on my final opinion, but once past the introduction of the characters and the setting of there somewhat dismal history, the story becomes a fascinating one.  In my opinion, a real cautionary tale on how miserable people can be occasionally, but fascinating nonetheless.<br /><br />All Classics are worth a read, this one definitely falls in that category.
145210655X|5.0|I got both books at once, and of the two, I found this one to be much much better.<br /><br />There are far more funny interpretations in this one compared to the one with Leia.<br /><br />The humor of a Sith lord raising a child in the situations we know from the movies was just a hilarious idea, and it is very well executed.<br /><br />Worth every penny for any Star Wars fan with or without kids.
B008EKMB82|5.0|About time, love, death, growing up, writing, reading, Buddhism, Zen, quantum physics, suicide, multiple realities, Japanese culture in the 21st century and during W W 2, and more. And somehow it all hangs together as a compelling story with characters the reader can love. Quite an achievement.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I am ashamed to say that I had put off reading this book because of the title.....can't tell a book by its cover.  However, the book was recommended to me.  I did not go see the movie, so I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Well done and well written.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner is the first in a series by best-selling author James Dashner is a post-apocalyptic YA novel centering around a young boy named Thomas. Thomas doesn't know who he is, where he's from, or even his last name. All he does know is that he's now in a place called The Glade; a place occupied by over a dozen other boys who also have no memory of how they arrived. They've built themselves a society, cooking, farming, healing, and most importantly: exploring.<br /><br />The Glade is surrounded by a stone maze, one that changes every day. A select few of boys - called the Runners - go out and explore the maze during the day in an attempt to find a way out. Two years they've been attempting escape, but not even a hint has shown itself to them. Until, the day after Thomas arrives, a girl named Teresa arrives.<br /><br />Teresa is the first girl to ever come to The Glade, and with her comes a message that rattles everything the community of amnesic boys have made.<br /><br />Thomas and Teresa have a way out - if only they could remember.<br /><br />The first in a series, this book hooks you right from the go. Thomas proves to be a very relatable character, trying to understand what's going on the best he can. Rather than sinking under the pressure, he presses for answers and follows his gut. He proves to be a very strong main character, leading the reader through the story with his brilliant mind and thrilling actions.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a heart-pounding read that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time you're reading. There are so many questions that need to be answered, and the only way is to not only read this book, but the whole series - which I, without a single doubt, plan to do.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|why cant I just like it its just not that big a deal too me<br />required more words one two three
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I loved the cheeky way they went about this one. great action, great chemistry. funny heartwarming shoot'em up. Red 2 is even better. get them both.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Some cute extras on the blu-ray like &#34;Good Morning Storybrook&#34;.  I love this show.  The cast embodies their characters quite well and there are enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.  I can't wait for season 3 this fall.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|something unexplainable about this one. its not well written and &#34;jump the shark&#34;??? this baby is a loaded school bus jumping 50 sharks but I keep watching.
055321263X|5.0|If you like period pieces like Jane Eyre you will like this book. It kept my attention the whole way through
1881273873|4.0|The book material is excellent and an easy read. My girlfriend and I are going through the book &#34;together&#34; over Skype and are using it to discern about our future together. Unfortunately, her book binding fell apart within a week and the pages are a bit hard to keep together. Overall, a good book for singles!
B001ENS0BI|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever seen. Each episode has you at the edge of your seat and you are always left wanting more. If you love being surprised with a series of convoluted plots you will love this series. I'm sorry it had to end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I Loved it! It was Unexpected, exciting,  emotional, passionate and so much more. It is a great series! Try it!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Accurate and dependable, but the new icons look like should be on a kid's weather channel instead of a serious one.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Good family entertainment and is well worth watching and saving for the next time. You will enjoy this relaxing film.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Absolutely perfect.  The intrige and deception reminded me of Michael Corleone, The God Father.  Never under estimate the power of a woman.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|it was a nice wellplayed out movie, no skipping, well done show..............ty very much i will watch it again<br />smiles
B0015F1VY8|4.0|Cate Blanchett is powerful, the depiction of the period her sacrafice for her country was amazing, but so was Mary Queen of Scott she was just as amazing her final scene was so moving.  The Power of Woman.  Costumes, Direction, staging perfect!
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|I've always been a fan of John Mayer's music, lyrically and composition.  He has always seemed to be able to morph between bluesy/pop/ and rock elegantly...kinda like my personality...this time though with all of the personal growth he's been doing he has encompassed a new sound into this eclectic persona called JM...now we get a country WESTERN feel and it's wonderful feeling!  I mean I literally feel good when I listen to this new sound.  I love it and I would recommend this album to anyone that likes to drift through genres.  I think it's a a great change of pace even if you do prefer the &#34;classic&#34; Mayer sound better.  Let's face it, we all change as we mature...and that's exactly what Mayer is doing with this new album:  Maturing
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think it's a lot of fun.  It takes me back to the very first Mario.  I would recommend it to anyone who liked Mario Bros.  It's easy but still fun.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Works great, for little kids AND big kids! The colors are vibrant and the music is soothing. I would only ask that you please up the starting pearls from 10 to 15 or 20, to give give a better chance at starting out. :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the characters in this game. bright colorful and funny.  if you've seen the movie then this game is for you.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Great movie! very romantic and full of history along with interesting outfits. The cast is wonderful and make the movie come to life.
B009FAQ9JW|4.0|Considering this was the only film Brando ever directed, it's worth seeing in that alone. But his performance is really strong. There's so many one-liners that he pulls off with brilliance. There's a lot of leading men back then that would've butchered the delivery and made it cliche. And there's one scene where he explodes that just about trumps anybody else's similar character unraveling. The rest of the cast is very good. Karl Malden is superb and Slim Pickens is almost perfect. Do yourself a favor. Turn out the lights and watch this one alone first. Because you're going to want to rewind a couple of times. There are some scenes you can't help but revisit. They're that good.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I've read the book a few times and find this rendition prefect for those who aren't going to read the book. It's also great for those who love the book and want to see another version of it. GO JANE Eyre!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I save up loads of clean laundry for folding to give myself an excuse to sit down and watch a streamed episode...delicious!
1452101248|5.0|This is an awesome book, you just want to make every single recipe.  It gives some alternatives on old favourites.  I love it!!
B000VYX8PE|4.0|A little tiresome for adults, but entertaining nonetheless.  My 6- and 8-year olds are enjoying it and look forward to the rest of the series.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Story began and I was immediately drawn, but then half way through, I became withdrawn. Chapters began with no clear direction as to whom it was referring to. Too many characters introduced without a true connection to each other. Story jumped all over the place. Not as a good novel as kite runner and a thousand splendid suns&#34; which I loved.
B003ASLJKO|2.0|If you want to see the sort of movies we used to see way back... this is a good example.  Not a very convincing story line...
B0058YPL66|5.0|Once Upon a Time is one of the most creative and witty series' I have seen in a long time. This series has it all...Forever Love, danger, childhood hopes, monsters, spells, modern-day escapes as well as a dragon or two. The characters seem to be type-cast, they work so well together. Rumpelstiltskin is positively creepy while Snow White and Prince Charming are the perfect 'forever' couple. This series blends modern-day thinking and values with tried and true moral compassing. I am a firm believer in happily-ever-afters. Keep the shows coming.
0316228583|3.0|I really liked the story that Rowling crafted in this book, but I have to say I was very surprised/disappointed at how many issues there were in the writing that could have been easily fixed if an editor had bothered to give the narrative a good look. (I could be wrong, but I'm assuming her editor didn't give this much thought and perhaps just figured \\"It's JKR, of course it's good\\" and sent it to print without a thorough reading?)<br /><br />The plot and characters are well developed, and of course I love Rowling's writing style and the way she weaves this intricate web of characters and subplots together.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />One of the biggest no-no's in third person pov fiction writing is shifting the POV too frequently and without warning. There were times in the Casual Vacancy that I had to stop and reread certain portions over and over because the point of view switched so suddenly in the middle of a paragraph that I had no clue whose pov I was reading, or who/what they were talking about.<br /><br />This is something that could have been very easily fixed, so I feel that Rowling's team over at the publishing house is partially responsible for making what might have been a great book into just an okay/sorta good book.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I have started re-watching the Gilmore Girls with my granddaughter and between the laughter and the teachable moments, it has us growing much closer.  The humor is usually done as simple fun moments and the witticisms are top-notch. This series is great for mother-daughter or grandmother-granddaughter bonding.  My husband and I watched the series initially, and we loved every show.  This series is a winner.
B003YL4KS0|2.0|This &#34;enhanced Ebook Edition&#34; is, or was, advertised to be compatible for the kindle fire. Not so. There is so much to this book I am unable to access. I would not have purchased it if I wasn't drawn in to the extra features with this book. Disappointed.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I admit I didn't think I would like another \\"Make-them-pay\\" type plot, but I loved the actress who plays Emily Thorne/Amanda Clark so much, in her role as Amy in the show Everwood, that I simply had to watch the pilot episode of Revenge.  Oh, my heavens! I was hooked and simply couldn't wait to watch the next episode to see who would be killed or exposed or betrayed.  A juicier adult series I have never seen on network television.  This one has it all, including twists and turns that will have you shaking your head and saying, \\"I didn't see that coming.\\"  It takes quite a bit to surprise me with a storyline, but Revenge has yet to disappoint.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I found some definitions a little too succinct.  I prefer dictionaries with more uses of the word in sentences and more synonyms. It was difficult to set up and manage at first, but works well now. I am very dependent on a dictionary and I am glad to have it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book is a very slow read in the beginning. It get good in the middle and then just winds up being about a mentally abusive wife manipulating her husband. Horrible ending.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Feeling like Elizabeth Bennet and falling for Mr. Darcy is the most amazing sensation in the World... love it so muchos,  even though is a little hard T9 understand if english is not your first language
B009AY04A8|4.0|I got this app via free app of the day. I don't think I would have paid money for it, I very rarely pay for any game. It is a fun game especially if you like playing hidden objects games. I simply enjoying playing anything to do with pirates. As of right now I have not finished the game...but I am enjoying it so far. There was one quest where the object was on the edge of the screen and I kept hitting  the menu button instead of the object. I got penalized 20seconds for random searches...but I have yet to go over the time limit. There is a hint button. Anyway, to keep from hitting the menu button I simply minimized the screen. So no biggie there. It is a fun and entertaining game it keeps my brain going and tires the eyes and helps me get to sleep.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will update this when I get to my PC. Suffice it to say that this is an important story of hope. Yes the self-interest of the politicians (read ruling class) is a powerful force for evil. But there is a slim chance that citizens can take back our country. But we must take the lesson of this story to heart and resist the decisive rhetoric crafted by our leaders that is intended to keep us separate and weak!<br /><br />Let us stop holding to slogans. Let us join hands with our fellow citizens on the right and left and speak of common ground. Let us commit to showing our leaders that we are not mindless sheep to be lead to serve their twisted agendas designed only to retain power at any cost.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Probably our favorite of the new genre of comic book action movies. A little less action than some of the other movies, but much smarter, funnier, and delivers the less known backstory of Thor in an informative and interesting way.<br /><br />I just learned that Kenneth Branagh directed it, which accounts for the uptick in quality over other comic book themed movies.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|My wife and I love this charger. She can charge her iPhone and I can charge my Android phone all at the same time now - prefect. It's fairly compact compared to some other dual chargers I've seen out there.
B000R3E2WW|5.0|If you like War movies this is a tremendous movie that provides a perspective from the enemy.  Movie is well filmed and you feel like you right there.  Great complement to Flags of Our Father
B0019O6IWU|5.0|If you really want to improve communication with yourself, with your partner, work or in any relationship this book is such a handy tool for your life. It should be required reading in all schools as it makes it so easy to understand communication.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Excellent movie and another example of Daniel Day Lewis and his tremendous ability to play a role.  The film is a can't miss
B002P3J3BW|5.0|Not sure how to rate this, I have not had a chance to listen to the tapes, last collection I had I gave as a gift to my father. I have never had complete collection but very excited about this purchase which I found many are selling for over a thousand dollars. I enjoy listening to any classical pianist but Duni Lipatti and Horowitz are over the top and never get enough. I doubt I would be listening to many others after this collection.
0345404475|3.0|I gave this a 3 star This book was a bit overpriced for a used book (non including shipping, so I had to pay for that on top of the actual cost) , and the quality of it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. The good thing about it was that it didn't have any visible writing or highlighting.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very informative. Covers all aspects very well. I will be able to reference easily in the future when I have need.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|As good, if not better than the original artist's recording.  If you like steel guitar music, then you will love this CD.
B000000QFY|5.0|Recently found and purchased a superbly mastered &#34;Moving Waves&#34;. The CD more than holds up with the passage of time. In depth liner notes detailing the original recording process, history of the band (through various personnel changes) as well as a listed discography. Very pleased with my purchase.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Relaxing and fun. I truly enjoy this game.<br />Old time arcade action without the need for a bag. Full of quarters
B00008MZ0O|5.0|Enjoy my new dvd very please with the product.
B002VHI8J0|1.0|Clod Atlas is a pretentious wank. It is hard to follow because the author was always trying complicate the connections with other worlds. For what purpose? It dint make the book interesting but disjointed and unsatisfying.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|it does everything it claims to and with out any difficulty. the uses are limited right now but more apps are becoming available. and with the 3 months free Netflix it paid for itself. well worth the $35

B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|i have yet to find one of the Jack Reacher noels not to be exciting to read.  No one will be disappointed with this book.
B007AL48UK|4.0|My son and daughter wanted this on his Kindle Fire. It downloaded and installed easily. They like it real well. So I would recommend this app.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I can't say enough about the book as it keep my interests up to the last chapter.  One that is hard to put down.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Oblivion is oblivious.  I expected a more entertaining movie with the interaction of the two very good stars and a good supporting cast.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I surely hope Lee Child continues his series with Jack Reacher.  The man is very interesting and is one bad hombre.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Worth viewing, but not as deep or exciting as I expected from the previews when they were really hyping this movie.
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|Gangster Squad had so much potential to be a very good movie, but the combination of cheesy one liners and the so-so acting left me wondering how the movie would have turned out if someone like Martin Scorsese would have been the director. I would still recommend watching the movie, just don't hope for an Oscar worthy film.
1452101248|5.0|Ottolenghi is already known worldwide for his creativity. For the home cook, he opens up a world of creativity that far surpasses most other works. It will be one of my classics.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was different than anything I have read because I never heard of slamming.  Thought at first I would not be into it but I could not put it down as soon as I started it.  I would recommend it to anyone
B00499NHLC|5.0|My wife and I love the movies, however, this is far and above in every way. Though my wife doesn't think Benedict is as hot as Robert Downey Jr.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I've read the book twice and saw the movie at the theater.  I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.  I don't buy many movies, but I just loved this one.  Stephanie Meyers wrote the book and it was amazing.  I loved the movie also.

0739352989|5.0|Excellent narrating. Rather graphic but exciting story line. We drove 5400 miles and it took most of the trip to listen to the books as we visited alot of family. Made the trip so much more enjoyable,
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Breathtaking...sad...happy...wonderful book i loved it and wud recommend<br /> it to everyone i know...very good read and the book was way better than the movie
B00271B752|5.0|Great acting by Al Pacino, and an inspiring, if somewhat depressing story. The pervasive corruption of an entire big city police force is a sad parallel to our current Congress.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|ship very fast, bought 3 pcs for kingston ddr2  2gb,windows xp and win7 is very good<br /><br />kingston is very good,win7 run it so good!
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I don't normally review anything I buy, but I'm truly excited about this album. If metal had been around in medieval days, it would sound something like this. Lyrically and musically the album just takes you on a journey. As someone who grew up on Metallica, Zeppelin, Sabbath, GNR, etc., I've been looking for some new music and a band who can carry the metal torch well into the 21st century. Came across A7X a couple of years ago and really liked a lot of their songs - but this album has turned me into a huge fan. M. Shadows does a great job on the vocals, and the rest of the band is just bone-crushingly heavy. Don't believe any negative (or positive) reviews until you give it a listen. Definitely 2 thumbs up, and I can't wait to see this stuff live!
B008CLI4N4|3.0|I heard a great deal of positive reviews about this series, but I can't understand why. I just viewed the first disc of season one and I won't waste any more time, effort or my money in trying to watch it further. Disc one is long and drawn out and nothing much happens until the last five minutes. The second episode on this disc wasn't much better either. For us, this is a long drawn out series spread out over three seasons and involves way too many characters to keep things straight throughout.<br />Overall, I guess if you're a fan of medieval times, you might enjoy this series, We, however, did not. We'll watch something else that involves less of a commitment.<br />I still can't understand all the hoopla over it, personally.<br /><br />UPDATE: Thought I'd follow up on comments others made about giving this show a chance by watching more than just one episode. As you can see, we watched two. Unfortunately, this show did nothing for us and if we don't like a show by two episodes, why on earth would we want to watch more? Fact is, there just hasn't much on TV worth watching over the last decade and this for us is one of them. That is our opinion, anyway.
B003F46RVO|5.0|Great, classic movie. Still holds my attention after all of these years. Still love the weird twist in the end
1878424319|5.0|This is a fantastic little book that only takes a few hours to read and a lifetime to live.<br /><br />I wish there was also a child's and teen's version. Getting these concepts into the minds of our young would go far for the world.

B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|When I heard that these three were collaborating on this new album, I was beyond excited. Stephen Stills has been one of my favorites for a long time and I have followed Kenny Wayne's career before he was old enough to drink! Every song on this album makes you want to sing along. I give this album a 10- hope it gets the credit it deserves!!!
0345806786|5.0|\\"I see dead people.\\"<br /><br />\\"They're here.\\"<br /><br />\\"Redrum.\\"<br /><br />It's to Stephen King's great credit that he created one of the elite few of staple phrases in the horror genre.<br /><br />And it's not surprising that this book is where that phrase originated.  In patient stages King takes his time peopling his story starting with Jack Torrence, a failed writer and teacher who's given one last ditch opportunity to make some easy money and get the time he needs to try and resurrect his writing career.<br /><br />Then we meet his embattled wife Winifred \\"Wendy\\" Torrence who's stayed with husband Jack through his alcoholism, his career reverses, in short his descent.  At the same time we meet young son Danny Torrence.  Like many Twilight Zone kids who preceeded him Danny Torrence is a child with SPECIAL POWERS aka The Shining which allows him to see things that have happened, to see things that will happen and has given him access to a special friend Tony who sometimes sheppards him through these visions.<br /><br />Finally we meet Dick Halloran a cook who befriends young Danny when he along with his mother and father are introduced to the last and most important character in this story: Colorado's Overlook Hotel, where Jack Torrence has been given the opportunity to work as a winter caretaker.  Halloran is important because like Danny, he can shine.<br /><br />Just as we learn that The Overlook will be cut off from the rest of civilization because of impending long winter snows, we also learn that The Overlook was the site of many and numerous HORRIFIC HAPPENINGS during its long and eventful life.  In room 217 for example a woman died tragically in a bathtub.  In the Presidential Suite a gangland hit took place leaving the room looking like a sluice floor.<br /><br />For mortals of course this history would be just that, the stuff of ghost stories. But for Danny who can shine the horror remains and what occurs looks real to him. As time goes on of course and the winter snows descend the line blurs from the look of horror to actual horror.  And as that line blurs Jack Torrence falls more and more under the power of The Overlook and its evil.<br /><br />Though I would be surprised if anyone didn't know the outcome of this story I'll omit that recounting here in defference to those few who haven't either read the book or seen the famous Kubrick film.<br /><br />But if you're only contact with this story is seeing the movie, give yourself a treat and read the book too.  For horror fans it's certainly one of the top choices and for Stephen King fans it may even be the top choice.and the winter snows descend the line blurs from the look of horror to actual horror.

B0037WP83M|5.0|All 3 LOTR are excellent movies, glued to my seat, I can watch them over and over, and still have the same intensity.
0061992860|5.0|Am still amazed at how much info is in this little book, from edible plants, medicinal plants,first aid, shelter building, trapping, etc...  This is a virtual encyclopedia and is worthy of stowing in your pack for any adventure longer than two days.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun and addictive.  Just wish ad pop ups hadn't gotten as bad as they have. My 6 year old niece loves it about as much as I do and I'm 33 :-)
B006S01GH2|5.0|We are all connected somehow. Amelie's observations of life around her give her a meaning and a purpose. She helps total strangers and ends up helping herself. An amazing story with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer thinking. The humor is subtle and you end up cheering for the heroine. The subtitles are not an totally accurate translation; however, the missing words and phrases do not detract from the wonderful storyline and the fully rounded characters. Amelie is a movie you can watch over and over again-each time seeing a slightly different movie by following the differing storylines of the individual characters.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|Legend of the Seeker is a fantasy series loosely based on Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series of books, which themselves borrow from the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.  The books were more epic in nature, while the show is generally more character based.  The fantasy element is secondary to plot and characters, and so I think even people that are not generally fans of fantasy could enjoy watching it.<br /><br />In this first season, the plot's broad outline will be familiar to fantasy enthusiasts: A young man living on a farm leads a simple life until his parents are killed by troops from a faraway land, sent by a power-hungry overlord who is on the verge of conquering the world.  A mysterious traveler draws the young man into the war, informing him that he has innate special powers passed down from his parents.  He goes to study magic with a wizard and inherits an ancient magic sword.<br /><br />Within this broad framework, several elements specific to this particular series are introduced, including confessors with the power to force people to their will, female warriors who can turn back magic, and an underworld to which the dead go but don't always stay.<br /><br />The actors are colorful, and uniquely suited to their roles.  Some of the younger, ones, though, seem to still be honing their skills.  Locations and sets are convincing, bearing in mind that this series was done on a relatively low budget.<br /><br />The one drawback to the first season is the episode's plots.  While several are fairly entertaining, overall they feel like they're searching for a direction.  Many are only barely related to the central plot, and the quality varies from one to the next.  One even felt oddly like a Scooby Doo episode.<br /><br />In the second season of the series (sold as a separate collection), the plot hits its stride.  That collection is a favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it, whether or not you choose to watch this one first to get the background.
B0091WMSNU|5.0|I really like this move.  Great cast, great story, some surprising twists along the way.  Dicaprio is excellent in this.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is entertaining without taking much brain power.  It is easy to pick up for a quick game.  I guess as you get better at aiming, the bubble points keep the game going longer.
1481130331|5.0|I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction, but felt drawn to the Luck of the Weissensteiners and I am so glad that I took a chance on this book.<br /><br />The book begins with the love story of two young people, one (Greta) a Jew and one (Wilhem) a German, in pre- world war two in Czechoslovakia. The book transcends place and time, flitting across Europe between various other members of the family as the story begins to unfold.<br /><br />It is hard to say a great deal about this book without giving it all away. No, it isn't an 'easy read'. But it it a litery gem in a huge field of historical fiction, many of which I don't get past the opening chapters. It is insightful, historically accurate, and informative. One I started, I couldn't put it down. A fantastic read for all ages.<br /><br />Above all else, I know now what to buy my grandfather for Christmas!<br /><br />I am looking forward to starting the second book in this trilogy.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was so happy to hear that I could finally watch Netflix, among other things, on my dumb HDTV in our living room.  The TV which is 15 ft away from my 6 month old $130 router.  First off there is basically NO support for iOS or Win XP. Luckily I had an old Samsung Android phone lying around that finally let me enter my password on my WPA secured network.  Nevermind that I had to enable my SSID broadcasting to get it to connect.  I finally got it connected and then it would disconnect, then it would reconnect, and then while connected I decided to try Netflix and every time I did it would disconnect.  So here I have a $35 device that can't connect to my router 15 feet away for more than a few seconds all the while I have computers, phones, and tablets that can do it atleast 6-8x as far away though my house.<br /><br />While it sounds like an amazing product it simply just doesn't work.  After 3 hours of trying to get this POS to work it's going back and I'll just spend $15 more and get an Android Stick that isn't going to be held captive to Google's whims of what it should and shouldn't be able to do.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|What can I say really?  I got this box set on a Gold Box deal so incredibly cheap I could not resist.  All movies in a really neat box set.
0307959856|1.0|I haven't read PD James' other books so I picked this up as strictly a Jane Austen fan. However, I would hope her other novels would be better than this one, because frankly, reading it makes me wonder.<br />Every sentence, every verbal exchange between characters is explained ad nauseum. She doesn't give the reader credit for being able to come to their own conclusions, and worst of all, she has made Austen's chracters flat and dull.<br />Where is the playful bantor between Lizzy and Darcy? Where's the easy manners of Colonel Fitzwilliam? Why are Jane and Bingley so lackluster and, when they get to speak, sound like every other person in the book.<br />Maybe that's the problem; every character details every movement or action (such as there is), that there is no unique personality in them or their speeches.<br />It's like the old plays where the character tells the audience what he is going to do at stage right: \\"I am going into the deep, dark woods now to look for Mr. Wickham and Captain Denny. It will be very deep and very dark, but it is my duty, so now I am going...\\" zzzzzzzzzzzz.<br />Sorry, I can't recommend the book either as a mystery or a Jane Austen sequel.In fact, if I could give 1/2 a star, I would.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|The title says it all.  We tried buying non-Nintendo (official) controllers and they were either cheap junk, didn't work or weren't compatible with Wii.  This official controller may have been more expensive but after an entire summer of playing old Gamecube games on Wii it's still going strong.
B009M4KTEM|2.0|I know I am going to get killed for saying this...Volume 2 of this series is excellent.  But this one, even on the great Sugaree, is ruined by a lousy space-like, cliche-ridden sometimes way off-key embarrassing, long, keyboard solo, on EVERY song.  I kid you not.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just finished reading this book....it's left me speechless. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. Definitely one of my favorites
0385474547|3.0|Although this book was book was bought for my sons 12th grade reading assignment, I also read it and found it to be ok but nothing I would read in the future.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|NOTHING wrong with this game. It's a time killer. I want the free gems they offered me for writing this review.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Kids love the movie and it's great to have copies for the house, car, and via the cloud. Enjoyable for all the family.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Decent story line, but the author often goes into cultural background in so much detail that it detracts from the main story line.  It’s great to include cultural information for context, but not so much that it is distracting.
0399159347|5.0|This was a great book. Easy to read like someone was telling me an unbelievable story. I couldn't put it down because I needed to find out what they were going to do. I wondered what I would do. I certainly recommend it!
B0027UY8B8|5.0|BSG is one of the best TV series I have ever seen with very good acting, serious making and very neat plots.<br /><br />The 20 Blu-ray discs are well packed into 8 hard plastic cases, each case holds 2-3 discs neatly with clear labellings of the various episodes at the back.  With such an excellent packings and rather low price, I can hardly complain.<br /><br />Also the supplier and Amazon did a very good job for processing and delivery (it took just over a week from ordering to delivery to my home in Hong Kong).  I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in serious TV series.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Got it on sale... love the series and the price. Finally got to share one of my favorite trilogies with my kids (11, 13 & 14).
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I some how missed the general movie release.  I have been looking for a place to rent the video and Amazon came through for me.  I enjoyed the story and marleveled at the challednge the actors must have had playing so many roles in one movie.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is non-stop hilarity at its finest! I cannot stop laughing every single time I watch the show. Love it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It portrays what it means to be a man better than any other movie I have ever seen. Every man should see this movie.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|Awesome escape without too much tedious things to remember quick and fun. I was so excited at the simplicity of the game.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This is a great book that definitely challenged me to rethink my way of living. Dan Pink did an excellent job of keeping me engaged the entire time. Already, I've seen improvements in my work as a result of practicing what Dan Pink preaches in this book. Thank you, Dan!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is the third time I watched Thor.  First time was at a drive -in with the family.  The latest was with the family before two headed off to college.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|A real eye opener for those of us who were not born yet when this atrocity occurred. I think every child in school should watch this to show them what really occurred during the rein of Hitler and the Nazi party! Its a painful movie to watch for anyone with compassion but I think important for us all to remember what the Jewish people have been through.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This movie has amazingly choreographed martial arts scenes. Really really well done. It is very violent throughout, so if that's not your thing than I wouldn't recommend this but if it is, this is a must-watch.
0743290933|5.0|Mr Lukeman is especially gifted.  I keep paperbacks of this book in stock for my motivated students and I always get a card of thanks for getting them &#34;really stoked up&#34;, &#34;better focused&#34; and &#34;I can't wait to have a publisher see my work NOW!&#34;
B002UWH8P6|5.0|It's my favorite of the sg series. Gritty and the acting and effects are superb. It's a definite 2thumbs up
B009MF5BXK|5.0|it is nice to watch stars share in the limelight, especially action movies.  Kudos to all of them, especially the Stallone for acting directing. .
B009P5S11G|5.0|I have all of her albums and like this more than any she has previously done.  She is getting better as time goes on.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and was glad it was available on Amazon.  Love the action and humor between actors.  Excellent cast and directing.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I guess it is no surprise that at this point you can't seem to get any decent electronics that don't have something wrong with them.  This does what its supposed to for the most part but doesn't blow me away, and I try not to give out 5 stars like candy.<br /><br />The battery life seems decent, sound quality is OK, MIC is good, however, it just shuts itself off randomly.  Even though it should not matter, it happens when mere feet from the dongle.  Ahh well....also getting rid of Win 8.1 soon so I will verify if this keeps happening with Win 7.  Not sure why it would matter, but who the heck knows at this point with this $100 mediocrity they keep feeding us.
B005544V6A|5.0|Very well written with characters that are a mix of good and evil. Each episode has its own plot (the case) along with the longer running sub-plots about the actual characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yo its super fun boii come come nd play so tht mean download download nd be better than he friends
B002TU1Q3Y|5.0|First read this book 20 years ago. Just re-read it and enjoyed it as much as the first reading. As with all Len Deighton books it is well researched, well written and thought provoking. An aspect of the second world war seen from both the British and the German sides.
8866135704|5.0|JUST IN CASE, I always like to keep a hardcopy of my schedule for the year in addition to my Goggle calendar (which I have scheduled to alert me everyday).
B005LN5UOC|2.0|Used this to play the Factions online multiplayer for The Last of Us and there is a constant static click regardless of whether or not I'm talking or not. I'm returning this for a refund.
B008602KQI|4.0|I really really love  and live it.. cant wait to see second part ... :D  I love this kind of movies
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved this trilogy.  The entire story is interesting and exciting.  Characters are well developed.  Recommended highly .  Easy read. Enjoy
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I was looking to create some personal spreadsheets, for tracking monthly spending, product pricing, etc, on my Kindle Fire HD. (Fellow Couponeers, Bargain Hunters, etc, I made my Price Tracking Spreadsheets for Price Book, that's in All You MagZine this month, and it was actually FUN, ESPECIALLY if you already have any experience with Excel!!) I saw the LOW RATINGS this app has gotten, but I took a chance on it anyway, especially because it's free!<br />I've used it now for about 6 hours, TOTAL, (not all at one time), and I've made colorful spreadsheets, from scratch (did not import and edit, actually created brand new ones), and it has been fairly simple.<br />I grew up using Excel, and did so throughout college and my career. I must say that this app makes spreadsheets a cinch, and in my opinion, could be easier to navigate if you lack experience with Excel.<br />It was also simple to save my work, (and find it again), on my device and also to the cloud.<br />Now, I'm going to test out the other things this app is capable of, and will update my review accordingly!
B008602KQI|5.0|Follows the book pretty well.  Actors and scenery are great.  Would recommend for young adults and adults.  Serious between the lines discussions for teens and adults.
B0025KW29U|5.0|How can you go wrong with this cast! Dr Horrible is a fantastic mini movie everyone should take the time to watch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this on my kindle every day, I love the game and the options. I have not had any problems with this app like I have others.
0553801473|5.0|If you have read the previous books in the series, it's a good continuation. It is not the strongest entry in the series, but it's still good. I rate it 5 stars if I'm not comparing it to the other books, but it's probably a 4 in comparison. The main problems with it stem from a few frustrating plot lines, and for being slower than some of the previous entries. That being said, if you enjoyed A Feast for Crows, or at least accepted it as necessary to the story despite being slow compared to A Storm of Swords, you will enjoy A Dance with Dragons. It's not quite as slow as Feast, though it's still probably slightly weaker than the first 3 entries in the series.
0765348780|1.0|I forced myself to finish Gardens of the Moon and after one of the most disastrous beginnings to any novel I have ever read, it did marginally improve by its ending. But did I ever care about the characters? No. Did I ever get hooked on the plot or drama? No. Was I ever entertained at least by the language? No.<br />This book isn't a novel. At very best, it should be the first part of a much larger book because it is nothing more than the introduction to what, I'm hoping, becomes a much more interesting story.<br />I am staggered that anyone gives this book more than two stars and I can't believe that anyone actually finished it for the first time and thought it anything but terrible. It seems to me that everyone who says they liked it, did so on a re-read.<br />Of course, books 2-9 may be fantastic, but no can honestly say that book 1 is any good on its own.<br />I've just finished The Way of Kings by Sanderson and let me tell you, reading Gardens of the Moon was incredible fall.<br />I may yet read some more books in Erikson's series because from the reviews they must get better. But wow! What a disappointment Gardens of the Moon was.
0345529057|5.0|One of the best book series I have read. If you are a fan of fantasy, it is a must read. It isn't quite as fantastical as other fantasy series, seeming more like a story about medieval politics at times, but that is a plus in my opinion. George RR Martin did a great job of world building, and he does a good job of breaking tropes and making story realistic. The only real downside is that the series is not finished, there are at least 2 books still to be written. Additionally, the 5th volume, A Dance with Dragons, is not included in this set.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The game is awesome no WiFi needed save progress automatically. I play this on the bus and friends watch me and that love it too. The hard tracks can get difficult but keep on trying. The price was not determined well,but that was just fine with me. HAVE FUN POPPING PESKY BLOONS
B000UIVRXG|5.0|I bought this movie because I didn't already own it, despite seeing it numerous times, and needed to remedy that situation. This is, in my opinion, one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The way nearly every plot point and little throwaway line from the beginning of the movie comes back at some point is incredible. Brief disclaimer: it's British, and the humor is British. I personally think its phenomenal, but I know some people don't like British humor, so if that is the case with this movie you probably won't enjoy it.
1451695195|2.0|This book was recommended to me by my grandson after he saw Eben on Fox TV.  We both found the book not be what we expected after viewing the interview on TV and online.
1400052181|3.0|This is an incredible book. No matter how intimidated you may be with the subject of microbiology or the intricacies of medical ethics, Skloot effectively treats these subjects so well that you're lulled into a smooth, almost uncanny comfort as she presents. However, it's with mixed feelings that I recommend her book. While she thoroughly deals with the details of HeLa cells past and present, the book probably should have been named \\"The Adventures of Rebecca Skloot & Henrietta Lacks' Family.\\"<br /><br />There's no way around it. Skloot injects herself far too much into the book. I would not have been so bothered by this if, in fact, she went with my aforementioned proposed title. Also, there are solid chapters (the ones dealing with the \\"immortal cells\\"), and then there are \\"fluff\\" chapters (the ones detailing with her interactions with the Lackses). If the cells were indeed the centerpiece of the book with the Lackses on the periphery--and with her completely out of the picture save for mention in the preface or forward--it would have received a hearty five stars from me.<br /><br />With Henrietta Lacks long dead before the author's birth it's obvious that thoroughly vetted research, tireless investigation, and countless interviews had to be in the mix. In these areas I give Skloot due credit. But, again, worded differently, I have to say it seemed at times there was too much of an effort to fortify relevancy where it hardly existed.<br /><br />Furthermore, Skloot mentions her Jewish background. Unfortunately, Jewish history permeates the book from start to finish. For example, she starts the book off with a quote from Elie Weitzel, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning Jewish man. With Henrietta Lacks being an African American--a descendant of slaves--it seems to me that it would have been more appropriate to quote Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a Nobel Peace Prize-winning African American, also a descendant of slaves.<br /><br />Skloot's book is tasty cake with traces of gravel. Exercise due caution in consuming it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting read.  Lots of twists and turns.  I just wish I could have liked at least one of the main characters.
B006TLFIAQ|3.0|its a remake of a earlier Hollywood hit by the same name, in its praise they do match the orignal almost scene for scene. and the actors are good just wasn't all that impressed. If you like the actors then you'll like the movie.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It was a fun movie with plenty of action, drama and funny scenes. Loki is portrayed as a cool villain with quirks. Captain American and Ironman make a great pair. The Hulk actually has a sense of humor. All around great movie. The other characters compliment the main ones rather well.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|It was a good movie but it got sort of long.  It is very comparable to any Disney animated movie.  I enjoyed it.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Phenomenal album!! These guys never ceaze to amaze me. Every album they put out is better than the one before. And that is crazy to say because I love ALL their albums. HTTK starts slammin' as soon as you press play. It's got that old school metal vibe with the A7X modern day touch to it. Matt's voice is better and more aggressive than ever. Johnny is amazing on bass. Syn's solos are the best he's done. Zacky is fantastic as he always is and the drumming is on point and perfect for this record by Arin. These guys have the metal reigns now. This album definitely solidifies that. Standouts for me on this album are Coming Home, Heretic and Acid Rain. LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Keep on rocking, A7X!!!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The idea was great but the execution was poor. This flick just had too many scifi-flik innuendos. It had many opportunities to break out from the shadows of over worked cliches but failed miserably at every turn, just to end up becoming highly predictable and almost boring. Watching this film for the first time will leave you feeling as if you watched it dozen times before.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Great movie and concept. Good acting and scenic design. The TV series continued the ideals of the movie. Must See.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I had great difficulty connecting with this book, not sure why it never grabbed my interest, I found myself not connecting with the characters and I found it somewhat boring. This was the first time for this author and will be my last.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|good insight into the best studio. A good look into what made the albums/CDs the hits they are. Learning experience of the recording industry.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful.  It is sensual and wonderfully written, loved it.  I plant to read the next two.
1781162646|4.0|Well written and a page turner.  I found it difficult to put down.  It was a little improbable in the culprit's actions in the end, but an enjoyable book.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|THIS IS A PRODUCT I RECOMMEND*********<br /><br />This item makes a perfect gift for a fan and it has a digital copy that you can download on pc/mac or Ipod touch/2/3/4/5 or iPhone/2/3/4/5 shipping was fast too! although you can get any kind of these covers:<br />***the jack skellington pop out edition (one shown in picture)<br />***the 3D pop out edition (****jack and sally and zero on one tilt******oogie boogie lock shock and barrel on another tilt****)<br />The 2nd DVD has the bonus features on it<br />The 1st DVD has the regular movie on it!!!<br />This item is truly great and an awesome gift for someone else!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have a sony TV which doesn't mirror my S4. Guy at best buy said to get Chromecast. I want screen mirroring. Dont get this if this is what you are trying to do. All this thing does is reflect google apps. You are completely restricted. I was very angry about this because it was a waste of time. Why companies continue to mislead and lie to people is beyond me. Don't call it a smart TV if your going to restrict everything and everyone. Complete BS. This device does nothing. Download an app on your blue ray, smart tv or PS3. This thing is junk.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|This game is so fun. i could not put it down. i finished it in three days.<br />every one should check ths game out.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I had not intended to read the book until I saw so many one star ratings by people who had never read the book or those with permanently closed minds.  Not being a fan of closed minds, I decided to give it a try.  The book is an easy and well written read.<br />My only problem with the book was the appendix at the end rather than at the end of each chapter, but that is hardly a reason to downgrade.<br />Whether the author is or is not a Moslem is of no consequence.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable and a nice history lesson with insight into some troubled times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book I can't wait till The movie comes out it will probably be my 2 favorite move of all times beside the first hunger games movie
0525953590|4.0|Carroll writes well and I understood some of the physics.  He presents the search well and I recommend the book even to those trying to get at least a feel for what is going on in basic research.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You guy's are awesome I can spend my breaks playing this game  This game is a great deal it's not super easy but not so hard that you only want to play once
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Although there were some very scary scenes in this movie, I thoroughly enjoyed the creepiness too. Great acting and well directed!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|i love this app!!! its not really like cut the rope...but it also is! its fun and free for me! i used amazon coins! but worth paying
B00634GHJA|4.0|good to transfer pix between devices, like android to iphone or android to pc or android to android.  but both devices must have the app installed
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy the music with the puzzle experience. I do these to relax and focus so I can breathe and not have panic attacks. Wonderful.
0345548981|5.0|The book is entertaining , I mostly enjoyed the background information given on growing up, it did leave me craving more and I wish he focused on a bio style book a bit later on, still hope he does.<br />As far as the dieting goes which is the main focus, it seems like sound advice and although gluten free is not necessary for those who don't have an intolerance, it definitely doesn't hurt to try it.
1932907009|5.0|I bought this book used, but it came to me as if it were brand new. I would totally buy from this seller again. Worth it.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I haven't ever really used Twitter until I got this app. I was bored one day and decided to check out Twitter. I made a page then found this app. It's really handy and very easy to get to Twitter! Ever since I got this app, I've been using it non stop! (Just like Facebook! Lol)
0307472590|5.0|Me gusta mucho como escribe, y este me pareció el mejor de toda la trilogía, pero todos sus libros son excelentes.
B007PF7MGS|4.0|I LOVE that this book made me not scared to eat plenty of carbs to keep me full and energized. I am having so much easier of a time following my vegan diet now that I don't feel either hungry or guilty anymore. The one concern I have about this book is that he seems to place a low emphasis on colorful fruits/veggies/mushrooms, saying that they are mostly for added color and flavor and saying that it would be OK to eat just rice and beans every day and you would get everything you need if you were to just eat that. I believe we should have a high amount and variety of the colorful fruits and veggies for their antioxidant benefits in addition to the starches for energy. Other than that though I loved the book and think everyone should read it.

067941715X|4.0|This is the first Austen novel I've ever read (and the first novel she ever wrote, which I was interested to learn). Her books are very popular, even to this day, so I figured I'd try it out. I can see why she has a large fan base. I imagine that even teens would find this entertaining as it isn't too slow to start.<br /><br />I plan on reading Austen's other books and see how they differ. :)
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|They are a wonderful group as most music lovers know.<br />This is a great album particularly with the title song.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Small disclaimer: I didn't become a Nightwish fan until after Anette became the new singer. Of course, when I did, I came across endless criticism of her singing because so many fans were (and still are) loyal to Tarja. Understandable, but unfair just the same. Anette is an amazing singer and, in my opinion, she she established that very quickly with &#34;Amaranth&#34; from Dark Passion Play. I am really sad she's no longer with them, but she contributed to making Imaginaerum Nightwish's best album to date.<br /><br />Tuomas, the keyboardist and lyricist to the band, is really quite brilliant. If he hasn't proven it up until this point, he certainly has now. The themes of this album (loss of innocence, life and death, transitioning from this life into the next) and motifs (rivers, dreams/nightmares, children's tales) tie in so perfectly with Anette and Marco's beautiful voices and the band's unique music. There is a clear story to Imaginaerum that makes each track almost like a chapter in a book (or scenes in a movie :x) Speaking of, I do believe Nightwish made a movie of this same name. (I recommend that too!) Amazing overall.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Their music is often a little strange, with parts being from .... voices from who knows what<br />strange radio program. But their music is amazing
B001TH16DI|5.0|To have the whole collection in one spot. To see Shatner go from underacting to his now classic. pause. after. every word. style is just awesome.<br /><br />Honestly who wouldn't want to just take the day off and watch all the original cast movies in a row. I know I did.<br /><br />Now, onto The Next Generation.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like to play games that keep my brain nimble. This game does just that. I like that it isn't timed, so I can play at my leisure. You won't be disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is incredible. It is rich with life, love, tragedy, and the beautiful musings of things bigger than ourselves. Read it. Just read it.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|I've seen a good number of thrillers, but this one tops the list. This is the creepiest film I have ever seen because it's so believable and I don't easily give a film 5 stars.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays a character who is so awkward it hurts to watch him. I think the movie works because everyone knows what it feels like to be a perpetual outsider. Ripley is very talented. He is very funny and very clever. But he is never truly accepted, partly because it doesn't take long to realize there seems to be no real Mr Ripley. He doesn't know who he is, all he knows is what he wants. In this way he is a fundamentally selfish character who doesn't really care about anyone.<br /><br />In the end Mr Ripley is thoroughly believable, as is everyone else in this film which is why it works so well and why this movie is so spooky, not because the plot twists the characters into unusual situations where they act unusually creepy, but because Mr Ripley himself is creepy beyond belief and the plot allows us to see the full extent of such a dark twisted man.<br /><br />Matt Damon is awesome in this role and this I think was the first film I ever saw him in. When I  saw this film I understood why he's so respected as an actor; Mr Ripley is an incredibly complex and contradictory character and Damon does him so well that the character and the actor become one and same person. Subsequently all his other roles seemed to me to be very boring and dry, although I've not yet seen good will hunting. I am thinking of saving private ryan, greenzone & the bourne series. I think a typical hollywood hero role is a waste of Damon's talent.<br /><br />There is so much going for this movie, the sound track is chilling, the settings are beautiful, the characters rub off on you. But all this brightness is out-shined by the very talented Mr Damon.

B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Very silly. Very easy to get into. Tons of fun at first, but gets old quick. Although this is an app I will keep on my phone, I don't see myself playing too often.
B0061S0A64|1.0|This garbage lasted about two minutes on my phone. It is the most worthless of all music creation apps I have seen. It looks cool, but the sounds it creates are about as weak as it gets. It's like Daft Punk for pre-school kids. It could not be more lame.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is the best.  I've been catching up on it through Amazon Prime and it's been perfect.  Just finished Season 2 online and am now catching up on Season 3 that I've recorded on my DVR at home.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was going to buy a more expensive camera bag for my Sony A230 but then I came across this. I was worried about all the stuff I had to put in it (4 lens's, 3 camcorders, and numerous filters/lens cleaners and a window mount) but I have to say that this bag is wonderful holding all of that. I am a little disappointed that there are no extra straps (the straps that hold your tripod on the side) as both mine got loose and lost both of them but it is no big deal. I've had the camera drenched in water (I am into storm photography) and have to say that though it was soaked outside, it was primarily dry on the inside. The water proof sleeves are a plus too, to help keeping my extra batteries and memory cards safe and dry. If you are on a budget and need a camera bag, I would definitely recommend this bag!
B003YL4L0W|4.0|Jodi Picoult's books always cause me to think about and sympathize with whatever issue she is dealing with and this book is no exception. I do get tired however, with the downer aspect of so many of her books......
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We loved watching Despicable  Me. It is a a great movie and I would recommend it to all of my friends.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|We loved watching Oblivion. We had no problems accessing the  movie. I will recommend it to all of my friends.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|When I need to build a machine, or buy a new one, I always start with Intel, but I usually end up with AMD. The speed that they offer for the money is unbeatable. This processor was half the price of and Intel Core i3, but with more speed. It does the job I need it to for my kids PC which I had to rebuild unexpectedly after a lightning strike.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What a movie to de-compress after a day of &#34;you know what&#34; it is a very funny movie, I love it.
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|A beautiful collaboration between the legendary Stephen Stills, younger blues man Kenny Wayne Shepherd and veteran keyboard player Barry Goldberg (Electric Flag). Originally marketed as a tribute to the famed \\"Super Session\\" (where both Stills and Goldberg participated) but actually it's more a fine, competent blues-rock album with not that much real jamming.<br /><br />The repertoire is vast spanning from Muddy Waters to Iggy Pop plus a few newly written songs. And some poignant political statements - certainly worth repeating and more actual than ever - in the form of \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\" and Stills' \\"Word Game\\".<br /><br />As expected the musicianship is beyond reproach although rarely cathing fire. Sheperd is definitely a fine blues musician. But it's the tracks where Stills steps to the mic and lets his gruffy voice and inspired guitar loose that the album lifts up in a higher stratosphere.<br /><br />Always nice to hear from Stills but The Rides will probably mostly be seen as a footnote to the ongiong legacy of CSN(Y).
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|The first movie had me terrified to the point that I couldnt sleep well for months. This one strayed from the terror
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|The movie is hokey and simple but the characters make you want to watch this movie. I love the characters.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful brilliantly written work of art. It gave a fresh perspective to the alien genre. I loved it.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Fast paced exciting read.<br />Good bit of popcorn fun.<br />Cant wait for the movie.<br />Looks good from what I have seen so far
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a very good short read to be inspired and to start following your dream, walking on the path of the geniuses.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We were just going to watch one DVD/week, but ended up watching all episodes in less than one week.  I watched series 1 & 2 before reading the books and in my opinion they're equally engaging and I wouldn't characterize one medium being better than the other, except for my bias towards books.  I usually read a book prior to watching a movie and 98% of the time think the book is much better than the film version.  However, between the series and the novels, I think both are power houses, well worth either watching, reading or both!
0345529057|5.0|I've read the first two so far (within a couple of weeks of having them - I'm not a fast reader and they're fairly lengthy) and know it will be the same for the third and fourth.
0920668372|5.0|This is one of my favorite books, for all my children and Grandchildren. I have bought numerous copies of this book, for all the previous mentioned. This is a wonderful children's book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game you start with some coins and you get about ten games and you thoughs fame to get coins
0345529057|3.0|I bought these books because I love the TV show. I figured the books would include a lot that the show necessarily leaves out and give me a chance to become better acquainted with characters and plot lines that whiz by on the show. The show pretty much tracks the first book exactly. The second describes battles and scenes omitted from the series, obviously due to cost. So much money was spent to produce the spectacular Kings Landing battle on water and land that some of the lesser battles had to be merely reported. The third book contained a lot of wandering here and there by the large cast of characters and a lot of interior monologues. Other than the now-infamous Red Wedding, and a few other developments I won't specify for the sake of those who haven't yet seen the third season, the plot is not greatly advanced. This would not be such a downer if it weren't for the enormous length of the book. By this time, it felt like I was being subjected to sheer drudgery for an occasional reward. Martin's writing is just not graceful or otherwise pleasurable enough to be satisfying in itself. The fourth book, the longest yet, repeats the faults of the third. I will not be buying any more books.
1476733953|2.0|A friend recommended this book to me based on reviews she'd read of it.  Well,  it's a stinker in my opinion.  There are descriptions (too numerous to count) of how worn out and beaten up people get by going up and down the silo's staircase.  By the time anything important happened, I was too numb to care.  There is zero character development.  Howey spends way too much time on trivialities and not nearly enough on important plot points.  Nothing in this book came off as believable; worse, nothing came off as even remotely interesting.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|I really really really enjoyed the second season of Dollhouse. I'm sure the creators knew the show would be cancelled and were rushing to wrap everything up, but I felt like the quick pacing made the show much more fun to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've loved this series and followed it religiously since the first season.  It's so refreshing to have nearly an hour of viewing time for each episode.  I love the writing.  I love the period look of it.  I'm only ever frustrated that the story isn't always cheery--but it would lose appeal.  It's also wonderful to have a program that is primarily devoid of vulgarity!
B00133KFGW|5.0|It's a beautiful story that our family truly enjoyed. I initially purchased it for my 9yr old son who is a guitar player. I wanted him to feel inspired by how well this young man plays. He was inspired. And he loved the story. Mission accomplished.
B0063IH60K|4.0|took device back and got a full refund on it. never used this game. thank you for your consideration in this matter
0807014273|5.0|It is rare to find a text that explicitly states &#34;this is the meaning of life&#34; and actually goes on to offer a convincing argument as to what the meaning of life is. I recommend this book to anybody who is searching for meaning or their place in the universe.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Very enjoyable. Missing a section on meeting and marry in husband seems strangely absent in such a candid memoir. Or maybe I missed it. Would have been interesting to see more of the dynamics of two comedy oriented people doing life together. Unless it's just not funny in which case nice edit! Btw: impossible not to communicate like Fey after her book: short bursts of ideas followed up with a huge volume of clarifying asides.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I still liked the first book best.  The end saved the book!<br /><br />His writing is easy to read...just the names are difficult!
B00E1L9N8E|3.0|did not like all of the spectale, and while leonardo Di Caprio is good in the movie, He is never going to be Robert Redford
B008602KQI|5.0|absolutely facinating book series. i would and have recommended this to my friends. i would sldo recommend the movie. enjoy
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Fabulous music.  very relaxing.  Contemporary classical music - wish they were full score concertos!!  Complemented the movie perfectly.  Listen to it all the time.
1439102813|5.0|This was an Absolutely FANTASTIC read from start to finish. Didn't want to put it down and was sad to finish it.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Best show ever. Kurt Sutter is a genius and the cast is awesome. You won't be disappointed if you watch this series
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Some of these songs have such vivid imagery you can close your eyes and smell the sawdust. Guy Clark delivers on this album beyond my expectiations...not one song is &#34;phoned in&#34; if anything, I would liken it to Cash's American recordings album Cash. This is a man who has always been an amazing song writer, that has been mostly and sadly over looked my the Nashville machine. Much to the detriment of the music world this mans music is hard to find on mainstream radio or tv, but if you look, the reward for finding his music will be like that of the chest of gold at the end of the americana/real country music rainbow. The only missing thing from the album is a song from his old buddy Townes, but he does include a song from Lyle Lovette that he makes his own.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|A genuine pop song, very catchy. Gaga isn't going anywhere.<br />Wonderful visuals with the video/vma performance as well.<br />Love you Gaga
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing and a tear jerker for all of the right reasons! john Green has done it again, and I can't wait until the movie  comes, and hopefully it will do the book some justice.
B0063M22QO|2.0|Not very many options, and navigation wasn't very user friendly.  I wouldn't purchase it again, or wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I'm generally not an early adopter, and the Chromecast reminds me why. Had it cost more, I'd be pretty unhappy and would probably return it. But since it was so cheap and I waited so long to get it (I placed my order a day after it was announced, and got it almost a month later--later orders are even more back ordered), I'll keep it for now. I bought it primarily to watch YouTube on my TV (for things like exercise videos) and to do some web surfing. Having said that, there are a couple of things I would've liked to have known before buying, so I'm listing them here.<br /><br />1) It doesn't work with Windows XP, or, oddly, Macs older than 2011, so beware.<br />2) You can only use the Chrome browser to surf the internet. Perhaps this is obvious, but the thought didn't occur to me. I mostly use Firefox, so I had to download Chrome (only to find out it doesn't work on XP). I haven't had any luck getting it to work with my iPod Touch except through the YouTube app.<br />2a) I got a Win8 computer over the weekend, so now I can use Chrome to chromecast. But even that isn't straight-forward--you have to download the chromecast app to use it. Another extra step.<br />3) The quality of most Youtube videos on a big screen is pretty bad. This wasn't a huge surprise to me, actually, but it was a bit worse than I was expecting. Doing some research, it looks like it doesn't support 1080p streaming. If you're expecting a good picture quality, you're going to be disappointed.<br />4) The setup is more awkward than it needs to be. It doesn't just find your wi-fi then you enter your password, like every other device I've hooked up. You have to change your wi-fi to Chromecast, then it guides you through the process of getting it back to your regular wi-fi. It just seems like an unnecessary step. Once you've got the wi-fi going, figuring out how to \\"cast\\" is also not as obvious as it should be. For this, I place the blame entirely on google's pointless move away towards using actual words and replacing them with symbols that may or may not relate to whatever it is you want to do. There's a short video that explains it, but again, if they just used the word \\"Chromecast\\" instead of a weird little symbol, the video wouldn't be necessary.<br /><br />I also have a Roku, which I love, and I think that it's a better value overall (the cheapest Roku, which is what I have, is only $5 more than the Chromecast). But the Chromecast has a lot of potential.
1600240003|3.0|First the good:<br /><br />Once you get past the story itself (see below), the book was competently written.  It is engaging enough to read, and it keeps up pretty good momentum.  Despite my complaints with the book, I kept reading until the end.<br /><br />So, where to start with my complaints...?<br /><br />Our hero, Harry Bosch, is old, and doesn't know how to use a modern cell phone.  We see first-hand that it hurts his ability to investigate when he can't use a smart phone that he finds.<br /><br />We always hear that Harry Bosch's life is all about how his job is his \\"mission.\\"  So, why doesn't he make a little effort to learn some of this \\"newfangled technology\\" that would allow him to become a better cop.  (I could cynically guess that it's because the author himself doesn't want to learn it.)<br /><br />I didn't like the Bosch we saw in this book.<br /><br />I suppose he's always been kind of selfish when it comes to worrying that other people will take over \\"his\\" case.  But in this book, it's especially annoying when you see that his petty actions could cost hundreds, maybe thousands of lives.<br /><br />He refuses to fully cooperate with the far more capable, better equipped FBI.<br /><br />The reader can see that the author will have to take one of two paths to deal with this -- either:<br />(1) allow Harry's selfish actions to come to their real life consequences, or<br />(2) create some improbable situation where it happens to work out that Harry's actions were the right thing to do.<br /><br />I am sorry (because I have truly enjoyed a lot of Harry Bosch books in the past), but I don't find either of those two paths to be acceptable reading.  I don't want to read a book where my hero selfishly allows terrorists to get away/kill innocent citizens; nor do I want to have the author collaborate with the crotchety hero to ensure, through plot contrivances, that his incorrect behavior somehow turns out to be correct.<br /><br />Here, I bump into a larger flaw with most of the Harry Bosch mysteries, which I will try to phrase so as to be spoiler free.<br /><br />There is a certain pattern, or formula, that the author decided to follow, starting from the very first Harry Bosch book.  He never deviates from this pattern and, once you've noticed it, you realize that there are very few options for where a given story might go.<br /><br />You can read a two-sentence description of this book, and realize that this story is especially incompatible with the author's self-imposed restriction.<br /><br />Finally, about the audiobook itself:<br /><br />My apologies to Len Cariou (reader), but he doesn't seem to know how to read a book like this.  He gives equal weight to just about every sentence, whether it is vital or mundane.  A trivial moment like someone standing up at his desk to reach over for something on the other side is given the exact verbal weight (a slow, careful explanation) as the details of how a nuclear attack might play out.<br /><br />I don't know if this is partially the fault of the author, in over-explaining people's simple actions (getting into a car, reaching for a piece of paper, etc.), but it is surely the reader's job to move more quickly through the mundane stuff and save his emphasis for when it's needed.<br /><br />One last note:<br /><br />Len Cariou performs the voice of Harry Bosch's Hispanic partner (Iggy) with a strange, awkward accent.  He makes it sounds like Iggy is struggling to slowly craft full English sentences, and could never keep up in a rapid-paced conversation.<br /><br />I honestly don't recall if the book says that Iggy has an accent.  Either way, there's no way the accent should be that pronounced, or slow Iggy down as much as it does.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Amazon says that 3 stars means \\"It's OK,\\" and 2 stars means \\"I don't like it.\\"  I think that others might find it OK, even though I didn't like it very much, so I'll give it 3 stars.<br /><br />I hope this reviewis helpful to others who might be on the fence about trying another Harry Bosch book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What's not to love about Solitaire? The ads are a little much and not always easy to escape, but, all in all, great for a free app.
B00DMKFN34|4.0|There is a bimodal distribution (2 peaks) in the user review scoring of Planes: 1-star, this is a horrible rip-off, nothing new here, Pixar's image is tarnished - and 5-star, what a wonderful kid's film, graphics are excellent, funny, good message.<br /><br />First, this is not a Pixar film. You read that right. It's Disney, not Pixar. But it does have common cast of writers/producers. You may even note the tag line, \\"From above the world of Cars,\\" overtly acknowledging the connection. If you can get past the notion of a rip-off, then, you'll find a lovely, joyful movie with enough to keep parents entertained while children are having a blast. Honestly, when El Chupacabre is on the screen, you won't stop laughing.<br /><br />Yes the characters resemble those in Cars. Yes some of the plot lines are familiar. Yes the animation is similar to Cars (the flight scenes are spectacular in spots). You know what I remember? Cars was a great movie! I'm pretty sure I remember that since I've seen it 147 times with my son (not really).<br /><br />This is not an academy award winning movie. But it is a lot of fun. Before giving this children's cartoon 1-star, remember what you're watching. Expectations make all the difference.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It keeps you rapped up a lot like when you we're very young and reading. It definitely pulls you along like all good reads should.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Enjoy the Despicable Me branding on the game.  it is deceptive about the value of bananas.  Need more ways to get coins.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I think it is fun for all ages. I would totally recommend this game to everyone I know. I love this game!!!
B00DY951RQ|5.0|&#34;New Morning&#34; was always one of my favorite Dylan albums.  I just loved the simplicity of it, and his voice at the time.  Even now, after all these years, I still love it.  And the additional songs that never made it to any of the songs, ESPECIALLY &#34;Pretty Saro&#34;, like the icing on the cake that's actually cupcakes filled with chocolate!  Just love it, that's all I can say.  Love Love Love It!
0064471837|5.0|Does one young girl have what it takes to save a a country? When her father disappears she must take up his bells and do what no one else can.<br /><br />I was amazed by Sabriel again and again. Her personality and character shine. She has an amazing journey and goes through so much with so much responsibility thrust upon her. I loved the way she is part of both worlds/realities. If you like the idea of a secret world existing alongside ours...and it being separated by a guarded wall, then you will love this book and won't be able to resist reading the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />Garth Nix creates a wonderful mix of characters. I especially loved Mogget the cat. But he isn't really a cat you see - he's an elemental spirit locked into the body of a cat by the first Abhorsen. Chained into service to the long line of Abhorsens. What a fiesty character he really brings a big helping of awesome to this trilogy. I love animal sidekicks!<br /><br />Read it you won't regret it!
B00340ESIS|5.0|I've read most of the major books out there on Screenwriting and this is the best. It gets to the heart of what makes a good story in the simplest way possible. There are books better for formatting and some read more like textbooks or are so complicated that it would render any writer helpless, but this is the book I'd suggest for anyone wanting to get started (great for high school students too) or a writer who writes technically well but can't get to the heart of what the story is about. I wish this book had been around 20 years ago. I would've turned in better screenplays in college.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Novels about magic are not normally my thing but this one was well done. Some of Gaiman's earlier works were better.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Love the show.  Well written, great mystery without all of the Hollywood garbage the typically accompanies a great show. Recommend to everyone!
0385344333|4.0|I have now read all but about 3 of the Jack Reacher thrillers.  For me a Wanted Man is one of the best.(my own personal opinion of course).  I have really got into the Jack Reacher character.  I just wish Lee Child would write more butt kicking into the story lines.
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|awesome little minion my little sister was real happy with it thanks i will continue to buy more from you
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Talk about some cardboard flat characters, with bad accents and little likable characteristics. While a good story, it seems to be lost in Beetlejuice special effects combined with bad accents and unlikable characters. Ethan and Lena seem shallow and lacking in genuine feeling, while Rid seems to be more of a mean girl than a dark caster.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is a awesome movie. I not one to start crying very easily.not really a big fan of  Annasophia but she did an awesome job in the movie.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I started to read this book several years ago and couldn't get into it. The other day, I read that it's been made into a movie. I opened it again, and for four days have been unable to stop reading. The writing is rich and at times poetic. The characters are alive and dance in front of you. The storytelling is compelling and hypnotizing....I cried at the end, not sure if it was because of the terrible things I'd read about, or because I had to say goodbye to such a wonderful group of people. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|My 5 year old son and I really love this movie. All the characters are great. My son loved the Easter gift that came with the movie, the eggs are really cute.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is an outstanding movie. The animation  and digital presentation was superb. The movie in blu-ray was wonderful with the<br />clarity of picture and fine audio reproduction.

1452113432|3.0|A few interesting, classic recipes that I will enjoy making, however, the majority of recipes are foods that are either too exotic or not particularly inviting to my taste.  It is a lovely presentation that reminds me of my trip to Paris.

B004LWZW42|1.0|recieved sealed dvd box, when opened it contained no dvd, just an empty box, so am unable to give a review of the movie
B001JI72AI|5.0|Ron Howard's attitude was that one day. . .  the world will look back and reflect on this event. . .by way of the movie.  He wanted it to be the most accurate account they could make it.  They were fanatical about all the details.  For instance ,&#34;The EDS switch was next to. ..&#34;. .  .and it had to be just so in the movie. The movie closely mimics the NASA tapes of the time.  While the mission was a failure. . . the rescue of our astronauts from a desperate situation was one of America's finest hours in history.  Flight director, Gene Kranz's phrase:  &#34; We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch. Failure is not an option!&#34; will live forever in American history. NASA and the flight crew of Apollo 13 were able to make a death defying rescue and make us all proud to be an American.  I remember living through that experience. . . and I am thrilled every time I watch this movie.
B00AKKS278|5.0|really enjoyed reading this book.  he inspired me to adapt my own morning routine to include affirmations and visualization and a quick yoga workout, been doing this 4-5 days a week since i read his book.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Short, but nice to read. Like the facts and hope to find another book more complete and detailed about the guy
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was a great story concept, that kept you wondering what was going on until the very end. Beautiful graphics.
B00B0CU2CI|5.0|This was recommended to me and I know why it is a fantastic Book and I would recommend to everyone it is beautifully written and a real page turner
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|It was not bad. It was at times a little graphic. I definitely wouldn't suggest for those under thirteen to watch.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Read the others.  Story and characters are well developed and book is an easy read.  Main character is interesting. Enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game for all ages. If you love minions you will love this game. One word sums it up: Bananas!
B00A285OOW|2.0|I found the story over romanticized and found many of the interactions of the characters had to believe; especially after reading the amazing sharok kay penman book on richard III the sun in splendour. The story read more like a cheesy teenage romance novel than historical fiction. If you want to read history or historical fiction look elsewhere...if you want to read cheese medieval fiction this is a book for you
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander explains his interpretation of an NDE (Near Death Experience) in provocative style. Many of my own philosophies were actualized in this book.  Alexander, an esteemed brain doctor, explains the complexity of realms outside of our understanding as best as any human can from multiple universes, infinite dimensions and the reason for evil.  A must read for those who lay awake nights questioning the great unknown.  While the book is easy to read, it took me many nights to complete because every dozen pages or so I had to put it down to internalize the content and the possibilities it provoked in me.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love it! I love being able to stay in touch with my friends via e-mail and taking care of other issues through it as well thanks to this app l am able to do just that.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Absolutely wonderful !!! Best I have read in years. Hoping to see more from this author or a sequel to this book.
B007Y36K46|5.0|After having seen the original for the first time I could not believe it had not done better in the theaters. With as many people that have seen it by now a second film is very likely to succeed. This movie has action romance humor and intrigue all tied together so nicely it is a must see. I certainly hope Disney does decide to go ahead with another movie because it is bound to be fantastic.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|When it was announced that the next record in the Bootleg series would be sessions from Self Portrait & New Morning, I was hardly doing back-flips with excitement, especially as the first single released was \\"Wig-wag\\", & we're all still awaiting music from The Basement Tape, The Slow Train Coming Tour, & the Infidels sessions.<br />But my interest was pricked when it was announced that the long lost tapes from the 1969-71 recording sessions had been discover in 2012, so I thought there might be the occasional little gem hidden in there.<br />So I need to cut myself a big piece of Humble pie, as I just cannot believe how good this record is. With most of the tracks being either demo or with overdubs removed, played & performed with genuine enthusiasm, the quantity & quality of the songs is almost overwhelming. I mean even the three tracks form the Isle of White concert sound good (don't believe every thing Lennon tells you).<br />Interestingly tracks from New Morning (Sign on your Window, Time Passes Slowly & New Morning) that have been over-dubbed with orchestra, Horn sections & rock backing band don't really work as well as the versions that were eventually chosen for New Morning.<br />So one of the better CD's in the Bootleg series (compared to No Direction Home & Witmark Demos anyway), & the booklet smell nice as well, a bit weird?

B00D41H2PS|2.0|I would say that I got a whopping 6 hours of play and it was complete.  Not worth the time or money if you are any good at puzzle games.  The puzzles themselves were pretty pedestrian IMO.  KEEP LOOKING!  2 Stars, and I am being incredibly generous due to the fact that I was stumped once or twice.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I wasn't even going to write a review because there are so many great reviews already of this flick. I picked this movie to watch at random at the end of a hard day mainly because of star Christian Bale being in it. Didn't know anything abut it. Ten minutes into the movie I said to myself that if this is one of those with an ending that has a \\"point\\" but the \\"good guy\\" loses then I will be really disappointed. NOT!!! Like I said stay with it! The movie has a simple but POWERFUL plot, enough twists to keep it really interesting to us slow regular folks that work for a living, and an ending that makes you glad you watched it. But by the 30 minute mark you will be so into it you won't care - like that good book that you can't put down you will be on the edge of your seat to follow this one as the story AND the action gets better by the minute until the climax at the end \\"sets you free.\\"<br /><br />Like I said - I wasn't even going to write a review - but I had to! Watch this movie!!!

B0023SDPS6|4.0|After reading the first five books in the Longmire series the first one is still the best one.  It successfully establishes the identities of the individual characters. Johnson explains the unbreakable bond between Walt and Henry Standing Bear.  The scenes Johnson describes of the &#34;old Cheyenne&#34; and the snow covered mountains almost makes the reader feel the chill.  Johnson incorporates drama along with enough humor to keep the reader wanting more.<br /><br />Recommend reading The Cold Dish first and the successive novels in publication order.  They could stand alone but the character development is so good you won't want to miss the progression of each character's life.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I love Star Trek.  Also, the Amazon Prime original series if great quality as well.  Will cherish this for years to come.

B00DQAM5LI|5.0|2013 has been very disappointing in terms of metal. Yeah, you have great albums from KILLSWITCH ENGAGE and AUGUST BURNS RED, but you also have disappointments from BULLET FOR MY VALENTINE and FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH, both of which stuck to the same formula instead of progressing and were lyrical disappointments. I was really skeptical about the new AVENGED SEVENFOLD album HAIL TO THE KING, praying that it didn't wind up as one of the disappointing albums of the year, and thankfully, it is far from disappointing. HAIL TO THE KING is a huge improvement over the rather mediocre self-titled and NIGHTMARE albums, and is their best album since their breakthrough album CITY OF EVIL. Instead of sticking to a boring metal formula, HAIL TO THE KING is basically A7X's BLACK ALBUM. There is a lot of diversity featured on this album, from standard A7X fare such as SHEPERD OF FIRE and COMING HOME, to fantastic throwback tracks such as the title track, CRIMSON DAY, and album highlight THIS MEAN WAR, which kind of reminds me of SAD BUT TRUE, from the aforementioned BLACK ALBUM by METALLICA, all of which are well written songs. Overall, this is one of the best releases of the year, and will eventually become a metal classic.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Going back and watching each episode in near HD quality is pleasing.  I don't think I could ever get tired of Star Trek series.

159463176X|4.0|This is the first Hoesini book I have read.  I enjoyed it until 2/3 through because of the shifting back and forth in time and characters which were brought in with no background, one had to keep thinking as to how they fit into the original story.  It is a very touching book and makes one contemplate lost pasts and lives in war torn countries.  Above all it makes one get distressed about the role of women in such a society.

B00C9G22R2|3.0|Find the article by the movie's director on the Huffington Post site. The director notes that the U.S. version is the third \\"incarnation\\" of the movie. The DVD version available on Amazon at the time of the U.S. theatrical release is about 20 minutes longer than the U.S. version. This DVD version was difficult to follow for me and my friends. In addition, note that at the end of the DVD version, the subtitles mention that the text of the subtitles is a rough draft. They request recommendations for improvements of the subtitles. From the Huffington Post article by \\"Wong Kar Wai\\": \\"While the previous version was more chronological, adding narration and captions to explain certain plot points gave us the freedom to bring more life to moments in the characters' stories.\\"
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|&#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; is a rare and masterful film that few directors can bring to the screen in all its glorious facets.  Of course, what can I say about Director David Lean, except to thank him for his amazing accomplishment.  I think a film like this stands the test of time, like a fine work of art.  Actors are perfectly cast!  And the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.  Many thanks to Maurice Jarre for a moving score!!  I never tire of viewing this masterpiece.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is a much more aristocratic version of the story, but rest assured that when Firth (Darcy) dives into his pond beside his home, he brings all the testosterone needed to the story! Almost 6 hours of story and much more in-depth then the 2 hour version. I love Miss Austen's work beyond all authors. This does justice to the written word.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This is a great value.  I have bought 2 (because my cat knocked the first one down from about 6 feet up).  The audio software is great also but don't expect the track separation to work most of the time.  In my experience, audio software rarely separates tracks, plus that's just lazy.  I tried an Ion USB turntable before buying the second one of these Sony's and there was a huge difference in quality for being the same price.
030758836X|5.0|Wow, wide range of opinion on this one. I for one loved it. I loved the alternating points of view, & trying to figure out who could be believed, & for what purposes.<br />Obviously, many people object to the ending. I guess I can see why people have that opinion, I just happen not to share it. I found the last twist to be great, another act of manipulation worthy of Walter White.<br />I will say that the one would-be suitor who conveniently shows up just a few hours away from where she ended up in MO was more than a little contrived. That part of it jumped the shark for me.<br />But I actually thought the author reeled it back in nicely after that, & again, found the conclusion very satisfying.<br />Can't wait to read more from Gillian Flynn.
B0012GMW34|5.0|This collaboration is epic.  This is not the kind of album you put into iTunes and listen to one song at a time.  This is an album you have to play all at once and appreciate as a concept.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Lots of dialogue but the story is a good one, if you can put up with reading it all. I wish they could put more words in each bubble. Otherwise, challenging and fun for a casual game.
B00821OX98|5.0|Season one of Falling Skies exceeded my expectations. I wasn't too sure about the series after reading the description, but I was pleasantly surprised.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This is a good tie in for the show and a decent stand alone novel. Fans of the show should really enjoy this, as the first book in the Nikki Heat series which is the basis of the show and often referred to. There are certainly moments when this book is as good as the best of the episodes but other parts let it down a bit. For fans it's closer to 5/5 as a stand alone 3/3.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh no I'm not sure if this is a good thing for this to be coming to an end. I will so be missing the e-mails. The trips to the playroom. Those were great.

159562015X|1.0|This was a complete waste of time & money for me. I am thinking of going back to school to pursue a career change and was hoping to get some guidance or insight into what I might be good at. It did not help at all.<br />First off, the test is not in the book. You get an access code to take it online-One time. And the test is timed, so if you take longer than 20 seconds to mull a question over it SKIPS it. Poof, gone.<br />Then, you only get your first 5 strengths out of (34 it was, I think). They don't tell you how you rated on those strengths, so if you tied for 5, 6, & 7 you'd never know it.<br />Following that, you get a brief section on each of your 5 strengths online, When you refer to the book, its the SAME information. What good is the book other that the access code & something to prop your table up with?!<br />Finally, all this book had 'helped me discover' is that I'm adaptable, dependable, fair,  blah, blah, blah. Nothing of any use as far as career search guidance. Or really of any use at all.
B003XYERRM|5.0|This historical novel is one of the best  I have ever read.  The historical descriptions, references to actual people and explanations of characters is outstanding.  The explanations of the life and death of Richard III are sympathetic not simply Tudor propaganda like Shakespeare's work.He  was younger  when he showed military leadership abilities than is usually depicted.  The entire portrayal of the War of the Roses is extremely well written . I would recommend this book to all historical novel readers.

B007FY9ZWI|2.0|This player goes on at random times. Sometimes a playlist on this app will start while I'm on the web. Last night my husband and I were awakened in the middle of the night by random loud music. After flailing about trying to figure out what was happening I realized the music was coming from this app on my Kindle fire. Songs have started playing randomly at least once a day since I installed it. I am uninstalling as soon as I finish writing this. So disappointed.
B00DU74U74|1.0|We endured this whole movie hoping that it would get better but I'm sad to report it never happen,  In fact this movie was so bad I suspect that M.Night Shyamalan produced and directed it using a different name in order to con people into spending their hard earned money to watch it.  I will say one thing though the scenery and locations they shot this movie at which appears to be Utah's Monument Valley was breath taking and was the best part of the whole movie.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Just what the Doctor ordered for an action movie with some older as well as up and coming stars.<br />Penn seems to be showing what he can do artistically to contrast movies such as Milk.  He makes a good De Niro/Pacino type character.

If DC could just do a little bit more to bring up it's hero movies to par with what Marvel has accomplished...<br /><br />That being said, it is a bit fun and entertaining, but can be a bit scary for the kiddos under 10 or 12 (per my observance of my kids).  There are some scary spots in the beginning by the main enemy and a transformation scene  towards the end.<br /><br />As always, stay for after the credits.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I enjoy this game immensely and can not put it down. I recommend this game. It is much more fun than temple run.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This season is even better than season 1. The number of subplots has increased due to the war being fought on multiple fronts and the separation of the Stark family members, etc.; but the subplots all cohere nicely and relate to each other perfectly. I suspect even the Night watch foray behind the wall will eventually marry up with the main plot as the threads converge in season 3. My only complaint is that there is a nude scene of some sort every episode, sometimes 2. They are integral to the story lines, but I believe they (the writers) could forgo the nudity and still make their plot developments work.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I thought the book was unnecessarily violent. I allowed my 13 year old to read the first two but would not allow him to read the third. I did not enjoy the final installment and I loved the first two.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book is done in interview form, which you most likely already know if you are getting ready to read it. This effect becomes tedious in many parts and more so as you get through the book. So far I have not finished reading it- I may eventually do so but not so far. As well, since there are a variety of characters being interviewed the author's limitations at character development begin to show through and they seem more and more two dimensional. I would assume the author is American though I could be wrong but his American characters come across as more real in tone and behavior. There are some truly interesting parts and the premise is well thought out, sometimes but overall it falls rather flat.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The book is definitely a long book. It dragged for a while, but the last 400 pages or so were fast paced and awesome.

B00479SVBU|3.0|Works as expected - the quality is good but I would not say 100% FM quality - but for the price, no complaints.<br /><br />I wish there was an On and Off button - instead when it's plugged in, it's On - when it's pulled out , it's off. This wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that I plug the device into a socket within the arm console that sits between the passenger and driver seat, so when I want to listen to the full spectrum of radio frequencies, I have to open up the console and pull out the player.<br /><br />Overall, not bad for the price.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Great book.  I can usually figure out the who did it but this one was a surprise.  Highly recommend the series
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Got sucked right in., great story ' great set of characters & actors. Can't wait for season 3.<br />Like downton abbey . I feel the story is along the same lines but it is portrayed a little more seriously, more detail about WWII.

B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This is truly an excellent lego package. My 8 year old has never seen the BTTF franchise and this lego set is spawning that conversation.<br /><br />Really love the detail and for the price you cannot go wrong. The kit comes in a more \\"premium\\" packaging than your run of the mill legos and the instruction manual has some information on the movies in it also.<br /><br />Overall a great Lego set for young and old.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|This series is thought provoking and gently deals with the emotional complexities of the human soul.  It also exposes the hypocrisies that exist between Faith and those who have none.  We are similar regardless of moralities.

B005HP2J66|4.0|A couple times a year, the physical anthropology majors of my university hold a movie night. Sometimes it's a \\"bad\\" movie night, and we laugh at a horrible film--something like \\"Link\\" (about Elizabeth Shue and a killer Orangutan), or Ben Stein's \\"Expelled.\\" Other times it's a \\"good\\" movie night, and we learn from a documentary, such as \\"Project Nim\\" or \\"The Revisionaries.\\" One night I brought \\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams,\\" and it got a mixed response. I think one of my professors summed it up best when she called it a \\"good/bad\\" movie.<br /><br />In this documentary, Werner Herzog takes viewers on a rare visit to the interior of Chauvet Cave, in southern France, to ponder the significance of the 30,000-year-old works of art there. The Chauvet Cave paintings depict lions, horses, and other Ice Age mammals. They are beautiful works of art, with fine detail, oftentimes utilizing the contours of the cave for dramatic effect, and some of them clearly meant to indicate the subjects' movement. These are not the crude sketches usually associated with the art of \\"cave men.\\" Along with the paintings are bones and footprints of Ice Age fauna, and even a footprint of a child from thousands of years ago. The cave is exquisitely preserved, and officials want to keep it that way. Few visitors are allowed inside the cave, and Herzog's time in the caverns is both exclusive and brief.<br /><br />Why did these pre-historic people go through the effort to paint these animals, and what do these images mean? The filmmakers and the experts they interview can wonder and speculate, but leave the viewer with the impression that we will probably never really know. And not only is the subject inherently fascinating, and the music ethereal and haunting, but Herzog truly makes the viewer feel as if he or she is part of the crew, descending into the caverns to peer back in time. It is utterly enthralling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is also a bit silly at times. At one point, an expert perfume sniffer (yes, really) attempts to sniff out new cave openings. He apparently doesn't succeed at this, but he wanders through the caverns, treating the viewer to his thoughts on what the cave might have smelled like when the artists were there. In another scene, when musing on the hypothetical eroticism of the one human figure in the cave's art (an alleged depiction of a woman I, and many others in my group, could not see), Herzog reinforces a German stereotype by mentioning TV's \\"Baywatch\\", as if it is the modern epitome of sexiness. The music and narration are also sometimes overly dramatic. Finally, I thought the reviewer who said the film ended with albino alligators floating in water from a nuclear power plant was joking. He wasn't.<br /><br />So yes, \\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\" is a good/bad movie. It's captivating, haunting, and thought-provoking, but it is also unintentionally funny. It's also about 90 minutes long, and, while I greatly enjoyed that hour-and-a-half, I can see how that might lose some people who don't have an intense interest in the topic. Recommended for enthusiasts of art, anthropology, and albino alligators.fer (yes, really) attempts to sniff out new cave openings.

0525478817|3.0|The dialogue is quite tedious. Everything is a metaphor and everything right down to the eggs you eat for breakfast has a deep and profound meaning. While I appreciate the effort, it just got to be too much for me. I felt like the characters were always trying to show off all the big and fancy words they know.<br /><br />My favorite character throughout the whole thing was Isaac, because he was the most... well, normal. He didn't talk in millions of metaphors or say things like \\"breakfast exclusivity\\" or \\"existentially fraught free throws.\\" He was honest and raw and if every character had been more like him, I would have love love loved this book.<br />Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for having an expansive vocabulary, however it gets old after a while of looking up the definition of word after word, and you quickly get tired of two sixteen-year-olds talking like the Queen of England.<br /><br />I do see, however, how this story got to be so popular. It's because of Tumblr. There is a very large part of Tumblr, which I try to avoid, that's filled with deep, meaningful, emotional quotes from poetry, books, and songs. This book fits right into that category; it's a hipster's wonderland. Think of all the glorious quotes you could take from this book! Just take a piece of paper and write down \\"Why are you staring at me?\\" \\"Because you're beautiful,\\" and then upload it to Tumblr.com and you've got an instant 30,000 notes.<br /><br />Okay, so, in all honesty, I don't hate this book as much as it may seem. I actually really loved it the first time I read it, and I will probably always like this book on some level, simply because of how much I loved it the first time, but it is not something I will read again.<br /><br />Read this book if you can manage to borrow it from a friend or something, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing your own copy to read for the first time in case you don't like it.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game if you are looking for a game that you can come and play every day.<br />You earn points and can gift items to friends.
B00006F83Y|4.0|always a solid choice to go with queens of the stone age,  some great hard riffs and excellent tracks.  i do like the new album more, however.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a novel of suspense although the suspense sneaks up on you.  The writing is superb and the author keeps jerking you around until the end.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|My grandson loves this game, but it is just not for me.  I don't have enough patience. For younger than me.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you ever wanted to learn about WWI without actually having to &#34;learn&#34; about WWI, then this is your book. The various fictional character intermixed with actual historical figures kept the book moving and interesting. Got &#34;politicky&#34; at times, but then Follett throws an affair into it and you forget about it.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Stargate is a gate to star. Stargate made a movie about star travel. It is a good time.  Keep watching until the credits stargates.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Characters and script are outstanding. Forget the reality TV shows, this is quality, fast paced dialogue with unforgettable one-liners as the series goes deeper into season three.
B001NXDSLQ|3.0|I love Woodstock.  I must have seen the movie as a midnight show several times in the 1970's.  I bought this edition because of the promised unreleased footage, including CCR.  It is NOWHERE to be found on the two disc edition I received.  Apparently, there is a third disc containing this in some special editions, but NOT the one I got.  I am still glad I bought it, but cannot recommend it to others for this reason unless you know what you are getting.

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Neil Gaiman has an incredible imagination but though I was interested it didn't hold me for long.  When I read a book like this I usually read something else at the same time.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a good book to take to bed with you, had no trouble falling asleep.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|So glad I bought this book. And I've been regretting why I didn't find it earlier. ... Hey amazon how much ... Ok

B00E5INZ82|4.0|Cool racing game, kind of like CSR racing on the android. I think this could use more cars but I like the made up names. Also does not use the tilt functions which is a plus for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun to play. Like the game. My son loves to watch the horse. Hop it will keep him entertained on the plane.
1781162646|4.0|There is a lot of jumping back and forth between different timelines in this book, and I'm not talking about just two different points in time either. I always find this a little jarring and confusing. However, it does suit the tone of the story, which is being told by an old man recalling something that happened to him in his youth.<br /><br />Joyland is rather short for a King novel, but it's equally as entertaining as any of his longer works. There's plenty of emotion in this book, along with a few ghosts and a murder mystery. As always, King paints a fascinating portrait of humanity and while Joyland is not as intense as some of his other books, it stills packs a punch. I know I cried at the end and for me tears are always a good sign of fine writing.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|THe same year Kick Ass came out was the year that a far better and more entertaining film called Scott Pilgrim vs. the World came out. Although this film does not follow the comics closely at all, it was still an entertaining and many feels movie.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I'll start off  great app with download at home watch on the go an  all but the app basically shuts down every night at seven pm to six am every day EST time I don't know if this affects all users or just me but I don't like it. Sometimes for no reason an error pops up for no reason why is that? If u want to manage it channel or account you need to go to YouTube.com you also cannot subscribe only like and dislike you cannot post comments or look to related videos but we get YouTube to watch videos and I rate based of that I feel as if the problems need to be fixed and when they are I'll revise my rateings.
B002HK9I04|5.0|This movie has grown on me the more I grow up and the more I understand some of the subtlety and sarcasm. The message isn't overly preachy and the musical numbers are often hilarious.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|The plot isn't difficult to understand but the writing was good and the visuals were amazing. A favorite of mine, though I was severely disappointed in his later film Elysium.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Ok this is ok. I love the app because it's soooo addicting. But why so many ads... it annoys me... please make a better update. Thank you
0374533555|2.0|To maximize learning one's mind must be sufficiently aroused.  After spending significant time trying to get into this book, I can conclude with confidence that no one affiliated with producing this book is capable of arousing anything but disappointment and frustration.  The primary frustration being that seemingly good research and intention has been obfuscated by a cloak of drab.<br /><br />The author can clearly produce quality academia, two of his articles are appended, but he did not succeed in bridging the gap between academia and 'mainstream'.  This book falls uncomfortably in the middle, not succeeding at either.  Moreover, the author attempts to flatter readers after posing questions to test our brains by opening with phrases like 'clearly you saw' and 'you figured out immediately'- not exact quotes but you get the point.  Its annoying and clearly specious.<br /><br />I was really high on this book and wanted, and still desperately want to add this to my favorites list, but I am afraid it will never happen.  This book spends far too much time stumbling through countless behavioral economic anecdotes without allocating any time trying to capture the reader.  I wanted to be introduced to the author's world and then taken on a tour whereby I can exit feeling as though I have added another important and invigorating life experience.  Instead, I feel as if this book is keeping me on an endless and hopeless path outside the gates of wisdom, circulating what could be some interesting insights.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the author appends to this piece two of his academic publications that apparently form the fundamental basis for the concepts (that are somewhere) in this book.  After previewing these articles and returning to my reading of the book, I began to perceive this book as an unthoughtful recitation of that which the author has known and consistently presented for years.  It thus appears that he made little or no attempt to engineer into them any new life.  Either that or the representative description of the character 'Tom W' is really a summary of his personal traits.<br /><br />The book is way too long, the paragraphs are painfully long and poorly organized, and the execution is relentlessly cumbersome.  The author simply uses far too many words attempting to communicate his ideas.  I have not found any indication that a sentient being produced this material.<br /><br />The piece is simply not thoughtfully executed; a fatal flaw for a book purportedly intentioned on expanding understanding and appreciation for the beauty of the human thought process.  Please revise and resubmit.<br /><br />***Update<br />Still trying to find some value in this book, but not having much luck.  I am reconsidering my earlier position that I believe the book is based on good research and probably, if better written, could contribute some interesting insights.  Upon further thought I am not sure if this is true.  The overarching concept is not exceptionally novel:  There are two ways humans can approach information.  The first is through instinct, which, unsurprisingly, is not terribly effective for producing accurate results.  The second is through deeper cognitive thought.  This second module is however limited in is ability to perform complex calculations.  The author demonstrates this point by describing an experiment in which he and an assistant observed pupil size while test subjects attempted to add digits to a four-string line of digits while simultaneously tapping a beat.  Yeah, this tests sounds like a futile nightmare.  And reading about it was not much better.<br /><br />Upon deeper thought, however without any help from the author, I developed the insight that humans do not exist to perform complex calculations; supercomputers can do this.  No, for humans its all about creativity-designing the supercomputer to do the grunt work for us-and emotional judgment and decision making, drawing on our unique (a word I almost never use) experiences and perceptions of the world and our talents.  We use the calculations merely to facilitate faster and more accurate decision making.  For example, whether the economic benefits of allowing a factory to pollute outweigh the social costs or what to do about externalities i.e., the important policy questions.  Of course we also use the brain as the mechanism by which we can deploy our thoughts to create art and the world in which one wishes to live.<br /><br />I don't care about how long I can tap a beat while adding sequential numbers and I don't consider it groundbreaking that one must allocate a lot of mental energy toward doing so.  Describing the experiments and technical results is fine for academic research, but for a book, for which people pay, there needs to be more.  If I wanted to read black and white research I would rely solely on SSRN.<br /><br />And this, in essence, is how this book really misses a chance to do something special.  We know that the human brain is limited in its ability to perform complex calculations, but tell me why you think this is so, or tell me how to comprehend information and organize my thoughts more efficiently---based on your research.  Research is grand when it informs solutions- we research to find solutions for problems- but with this piece the author only has the first part of the equation.  There is no destination with his work.<br /><br />Furthermore, I now think the research is rather unimaginative (author cites other works onto which he and his colleagues have built- status quo in academia- but his contributions seem desperate in relation to the theories onto which they build.  Plus, there is a lack of consistency in examples.  For instance, the author uses a table to describe what he labels 'the four fold method' (only one of which is his own contribution) to describe the different outcomes that can be reached in settlement negotiations depending on personality characteristics (risk averse or riskseeking).  But upon elaborating, the author extrapolates his observations beyond the context of the legal settlement context, e.g., referencing the lottery.  I get the points, kind of, but it is just sloppy and demonstrates the lack of thoughtfulness that infects this entire book. Context is important and assumptions often fail to carry well into different contexts.  I could go on but would risk becoming Kahnemanian if I did.  So I will stop while I am ahead.<br /><br />On a positive note, I am looking forward to receiving Penelope A. Lewis' book The Secret World of Sleep: The Surprising Science of The Mind at Rest.  Here, I am confident, is a book that produces science, more understanding, and solutions for a better life; heard her discussing the book and her research and am encouraged by what I heard.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game. playing this game makes the time pass. this is fun for both myself and my son.
1608870081|4.0|I'm not a Harry Potter fan, but the rest of the members of my family are.  The &#34;trailer&#34; I saw on this book intrigued me enough to purchase it.  As this was a new purchase everything was in tact, but if it doesn't have ALL the many aspects that come with this book, I wouldn't purchase it - like the letter from Hogwarts.  My children were ho-hum about this book though some of the pop ups are quite phenomenal.  How does one fit all the books/movies into a pop up book?<br /><br />I would recommend this only if you are both a Harry Potter fan and a pop up book fan.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have kindle on my iPhone and on my nexus 7.  i love it.  i have downloaded and read so many books it is super easy to use and it links up to both my phone and nexus.  I can take it anywhere.  At work I use my phone more and at home my tablet.  You can use the kindle home to search for your favorite books or authors and download to your device.  It lets you know if you already downloaded the book so you don't have duplicate copies taking up space..  It's great
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, and wasn't really in the mood to see it, but was instantly drawn in by the spectacular visuals/cinematography and ethereal soundtrack. A perfect match, and I practically forgot I was watching Tom cruise. Subtle acting, no unnecessary over-explaining dialogue, and no distracting product placement. I was a bit baffled by negative reviews on rotten tomatoes. I've watched this film twice now and liked it just as much the second time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|good for now...too many unrelated quests that must be done to move on and expecting more to come later. this review being one of them
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Despite the original marketing campaign, martial arts sequences and Christian Bale's cassock, this is not a \\"Matrix\\" ripoff. What it is is a fairly clunky mash-up of \\"Brave New World\\", \\"1984\\" (or it's precursor, \\"We\\"), \\"Total Recall\\" and especially \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". For a while, despite cheaper than we've come to expect from this kind of movie production values, it's not bad. Bale is good -- better than \\"Batman\\" -- as are Emily Watson and Sean Bean in what amount to walk-ons. The gun kata is novel. But the direction is indifferent, the pacing and narrative flow problematic, and the second act feels like it's going in circles. Despite a few twists, by the end the dystopian cliches pile up like the body count. The result is neither smart enough to be thought provoking nor cheesy enough to be a guilty pleasure.
0061339202|2.0|Never have so many words added so little to the understanding of a topic that most readers will already grasp quite well. It got me thinking about opportunities to create more \\"flow\\" in my life, but I found most of the book uninteresting. You'll learn more about flow by spending the time with a musical instrument.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I read this book in a few days and immediately got invested in the characters. The author has a gift for portraying many ranges of emotions and submerging the reader into the story.
0062255657|3.0|I'm not going to go into big detail, here, so if you want to know exactly what the book is about, read the write-up or some of the longer reviews.<br /><br />I was disappointed.  It was entertaining, easy to read and hard to put down.  I finished it in a couple of hours, if that.  It was a short story, not a novel.  Not satisfying, like a good book usually is.  Just an interesting short story with some good plot lines.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers have fallen all over themselves about how fantastic of an author, how unique and original the story is, how it stayed with them after reading because it was so luminous, etc, etc. I am a voracious reader, and saw nothing new, luminous or unique in this story.  Others have done it before and better.<br /><br />Get it from the library, like I did, so you won't be as disappointed as I would have been, had I actually paid for it.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|We have this light in a landing area that leads to the garage and down the basement.  We took the door out that had a window.  It is pitch dark.  This light provides enough light to be able to see clearly.  It turns on and off appropriately!  Has worked great so far!
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Released in 1970 the album, Self Portrait, was the downfall of the irrepressible Bob Dylan. I can remember it as though it was yesterday. I hadn't loved Nashville Skyline. I was hoping for more in the vein of Blond On Blond or John Wesley Hardin and Nashville's country pop didn't do it for me. But Self Portrait was perhaps the worst record by a major artist ever released, or so it seemed to me at that time. The back-up singers, the Dylanettes or the Dyltones or whoever, were an embarrassment. The over production would have been funny if I hadn't spent something like seven bucks (in those days a very expensive double album).<br /><br />Released on CD in the late 80s I came to have more respect for it. Copper Kettle and Days of 49 I thought nearly 20 years later were not so bad.<br /><br />Imagine my staggering impression when 43 years later I receive this NEW &#34;Self Portrait&#34; and discover the gems that Dylan had hidden away all the time! Had Dylan released this record in 1970 it would have been hailed with accolades. It might easily have won Grammy or the Year and if it didn't a mob of us would have been angry and clamoring that Dylan was robbed...again. Of all Dylan's &#34;bootleg&#34; series all of which I've purchased and enjoyed, this is absolutely the best. These recordings represent Bob Dylan the artist at his most productive and least pretentious as contrasted against what he originally released.<br /><br />After listening to these two CDs and the accompanying Isle of Wight Live set I can only conclude that Dylan intended for Self Portrait to be a dismal failure when he released it 43 years ago. This view is backed up by comments he made about this release in his autobiographical book, Chronicles Volume 1. But why the most revered, iconoclastic writer and performer in a generation of iconoclastic song writers and performers, would deliberately undermine his own career after he had produced a masterpiece like this is something only Dylan can explain... hopefully in Chronicles Volume 2.opefully in Chronicles Volume 2.
B004EPZ0BG|1.0|I remember why I don't like these two actors. The boy band guy and annoying chick on that 70's show return. I think I just threw up in my mouth. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have landed some good roles to distance themselves from the banal and overtly commercial. They then did this movie. Keep these two apart from now on, please!<br /><br />Without giving away too much, this movie has one of best and one of the worst sex scenes. The first sex scene is funny, realistic in the awkwardness and that is truly sexy. The second is smarmy, over-the-top stylized psuedo-porn. This is important because it at the end of the first sex scene that the two lovers joke about Rom-Coms and the use of too many indie songs. The second scene is just plain insulting to the audience, showing us no respect.<br /><br />So what does the Director do? Overload the soundtrack with wall-to wall wishy-washy indie songs that you are now conscious of it the entire time. It is unbarable in the extreme! Any charming aspect to characters is out the window, as this movie sinks into monotony and stereotypes. The humour goes out the window, and the ending was unapologetically vapid and cliche. Another way this movie robs the characters of sympathy, is by placing them in the upper-middle to upper class. \\"Oh, I've got too much money to be happy in a committed relationship\\".<br /><br />If you like 90 minutes of upper class twit self-pity wrapped in an unfunny Rom-Com. This is your movie, complete with awful music that you probably love. Yeah, I hate you too.
0062073567|4.0|If you've never read this book and would like to really match wits with Christie, the fact about the book (not the story) that every reviewer mentions may be a hideously unfair clue and ruin your chances. The blurb on the recorded version mentions it too, and made me suspect the murderer much earlier than I would have otherwise.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor- read the book, not ABOUT the book ;-)

B001QJUX24|1.0|It's not that this is an older movie. I enjoy some classics. I just can't stand John Wayne. He annoys me. It's like watching William Shatner. They might be polar opposites but they're both horrible actors. Payment process was easy, and I was able to watch the video with no issues right away.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I like the low price and free shipping. This movie I would recommend to anyone who like the Sex and the City Series on HBO.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So my game playing skills are non-existent, when it comes to games where timing is a factor, and this game is pretty easy but I still suck at it.

The book did not disappoint!<br /><br />He walks you through how to create your 'Miracle Morning\\" step by step. It doesn't have to be an hour, and starting out, it can be just a few minutes each day - time to set the stage for the day for success and creating the life you want (instead of allowing life to just 'happen').  We can all have a level 10 life and by taking the time to figure out what that is and setting aside just minutes each day, it's amazing what can happen. It's not complicated, but it can be life changing.<br /><br />There are a handful of books I think EVERYone should read and this is one of them!
B006TXDOZ0|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase the sophomore music album as follow up albums, sequel movies, etc. rarely provide satisfaction as the original; however, Sweet Sour definitely comes through with very good songs.  I've enjoyed the entire album.  Yes the flavor is a bit different from the original flavor, but what music group provides the same flavor of songs on each album?  As a whole, the sound is very similar.  I think it's actually fresh and still interesting.  Kudos to BOS for continuing what many bands couldn't.

I was a bit putt off at first with how the story continuously went back and forth between past and present, but I got used to it and it added to the suspense.

0399159347|5.0|This is my first Moriarty book, but it won't be my last! I really enjoyed this story - and if I didn't have children to take care of during the day, I'd have read it in one sitting. Though I anticipated some of the story line, I was shocked, cried, laughed and squealed a time or two at the twists toward the end. I really felt close to the some of the women in the story, and my heart went out to each of them. If you want to know what happens, and how the author weaves the main characters together, grab a copy, because I'm not spoiling it for you. ;)
1400079144|3.0|Look, I think the world at large is aware that Dan Brown isn't going to be the next John Milton or David Foster Wallace. And I don't think anyone picks up a Dan Brown book expecting to get a factual crash course in art history. What you CAN expect from a Dan Brown book, though, is the written version of an action movie, complete with cheesy dialogue, questionable timing, and leaps of logic. If you want a book that will really challenge you, you're looking in the wrong spot. But if you want an entertaining treasure hunt that will let you turn your brain off for awhile and just go along for the ride, then try to shut off your inner editor and just enjoy these books for what they are.<br /><br />That being said, I agree with previous reviewers about the repetitive nature of this book. There was a lot of running from point A to point B, followed by a bunch of info-dump dialogue that Robert Langdon scoffs at, and then some more running.<br /><br />Speaking of Professor Langdon's scoffing, you'd think that with everything he went through in the previous books, he'd have an easier time believing in the legends people are telling him are real.<br /><br />My third and final complaint was that the thing all the characters were so worked up about? Not really that big a deal. I'm not sure we really needed all the histrionics, because the stakes didn't turn out to be all that high after all. If characters are going to spend all night in a tizzy over something, and get me worked up along with them, there needs to be a satisfying payoff.<br /><br />HOWEVER! Although I bought the Kindle version at first, I also got the audiobook, and that kept me suitably entertained for two weeks while commuting. So that's something. Thanks, Dan.

B001BNFR6W|2.0|I read all the negative reviews before ordering so I can't blame anyone but myself for being disappointed in the quality of the product, which is horrible. The show itself deserves 5 stars so it's a shame to have to downgrade the review based totally on the poor quality. I have tried rewinding and replaying, hoping to see missing minutes but have had no luck. With years of negative reviews I don't understand why Amazon,which is a reputable company, doesn't refuse to sell a known defective product.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|The film played without interruption and was enjoyable. Amazon has good movie options that are inexpensive and offers recently released films.
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|The movie starts off great talking about the studio, and the artists that recorded there, toward the middle it kind of gets off track, and the end has nothing to do with the studio at all except for a mixing board.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|One great movie, lots of fun for the whole family! Not too violent, but when it is, it's more like a cartoon or video game equivalent to make the film feel more realistic? Just allot of science fiction story lines, but it moves quickly and keeping you involved in the story! Unlike more big budget films, this one actually builds up's characters and their interactions within the story line and helps making the movie more enjoyable!

B000JIHP88|5.0|My 10 week old daughter LOVES this mobile. I can put her down in her crib and she'll lie there &#34;talking&#34;, cooing and even giggling for sometimes as long as 20 minutes, entertaining herself. She's so happy every time she sees it, even when I'm carrying her - if she catches sight of it, she lets out a little happy shriek and starts kicking and flailing her arms about excitedly.<br /><br />We didn't attach the felt leaves because the mechanism that waved the leaves kept getting stuck on our unit, and the little animals would in turn get stuck. So all we have on are the animals and the plastic leaves. Not a big deal. Still love this mobile!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. It is so much fun to play. I just wish you could earn more bingo tokens daily. But if I skip a day or two than I get enough to play the games I want.
1416594795|5.0|I am a Christian. Up until reading \\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\", the only material by Dawkins that I was familiar with was The God Delusion, and a number of his speeches dealing with religion. On those subjects, I was none too impressed by his rhetoric. I found his argumentation skills extremely flawed, and was left wondering what was so influential about this man. Then I read this book, and I understood. As a science educator and writer, he really blew me away. His ability to explain evolution in such simplistic yet convincing ways was wonderful, and I have recommended this book to many friends because of it. I really enjoyed his writing style especially because he really engages the reader, and it comes across as not only passionate, but very personal. That right there hooked me immediately. I also liked how he touched on the fact that this book is not about God or religion: its about scientific education and preventing further scientific illiteracy. In it, he presents a note to the Prime Minister that he and several other academics, as well as religious figures, wrote stressing the importance scientific education and literacy in schools, and separating science classes from religious classes. If you are looking for an in depth, yet easy explanation of evolution in all of its beauty and genius forms, this book is for you. I simply cannot praise it enough! I highly recommend it!

B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I bought this cutter in hopes that I could create interesting pieces for my wedding. After trying about 30 bottles, I have 5 that worked. The most common user error was that I didn't perfectly tighten every single screw and the line would move mid cut. This was my fault but the cutter made it extremely easy to make a mistake. Even when I cut the glass perfectly (at least it looked perfect) when I used the hot - cold water technique, the glass would crack unevenly. This happened about 90% of the time. Highly frustrating to work so carefully to remove the label (this is not that easy), align everything, turn with a steady hand and then pop the bottle cracks in a random place and is useless.  Maybe I am using this wrong but I am being pretty careful so think that the product is to fault. If anyone has tips, I am open to hear them I really wish this thing would work!

055357342X|3.0|Mayhem, treachery, betrayal, and death, lots of death, dead dead dead...everywhere! End of review. One more book to go and I will have finished the boxed set that I so foolishly bought. Getting through three of the four has been excruciating.<br />Reviewed by Shelley Riley author of [[ASIN:1482679248 Casual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure]]
B007AL48UK|4.0|Fun, easy to play and I like that the tiles that aren't available show darker so i can see what is able to play.
055358202X|3.0|Finally I've slogged through nearly 4000 pages of mayhem, treachery, betrayal, and death. Thank goodness it's over...but wait, there's more. Book five? I don't think so, I bought the first four in a boxed set, and I persevered until I finished the last page.<br /><br />When I set the book down I reflected on the series as a whole, and I realized I couldn't think of one incident in the entire four book set where the author made me feel good about anything. I don't want to beat this donkey to death, but there is no one to like, and there is not one character I can latch onto as a hero or heroine. I don't want to be part of their fellowship; I don't want to get involved in their lives on any level, and there doesn't seem to be any goal beyond surviving another horrifying twenty-four hour period.<br /><br />Every time I find a character I might be able to like, or pity or care about. They die, or get maimed or turn out to have a poisonous side, one which makes them no better than anyone of the dozens of disreputable, treacherous, disloyal, villainous, heinous....characters that populate every volume.<br /><br />Man's inhumanity to his fellow man and woman, is front and center at all times. Not only do these characters kill and maim, they feel thoroughly entitled to do so, and without any compunction.<br /><br />So why did I read all four books? Why would I subject myself to 4000 pages of misery? Since I can't answer those questions, I can only assume I need professional help. Was I hoping at some point Mr. Martin would bring me some joy, that the last stale cookie in the box would be sweet and fresh?<br /><br />Fool me once, twice, three, four and no more. Thank you very much, I appreciate that you put a lot into these books Mr. Martin, but I'm so depressed now that I don't think I could endure another. Besides how can there be enough people left in the ravaged kingdoms, to plant, harvest and produce food. Seems to me, winter is coming and there are only killers, connivers and villains left.<br /><br />I'm headed out to find a good comedy to cleanse my palate, bring back my joy and remind me that the sun will come up tomorrow.<br />Review by Shelley Riley author of [[ASIN:1482679248 Casual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure]]ers and villains left.<br /><br />I'm headed out to find a good comedy to cleanse my palate, bring back my joy and remind me that the sun will come up tomorrow.<br />Review by Shelley Riley author of [[ASIN:1482679248 Casual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure]]

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|another update:  use my iPhone w/ Netflix to play a movie... then the Netflix app hangs (due to chromecast?) ... then had to hard close Netflix.  & restart Netflix, but app cannot control chromecast anymore... only after 1 minute or so, it the Netflix app can control again.... quality is poor.<br /><br />use case for this seems very limited when all it can do is to show selective video apps (and photos).<br />Airplay Mirror can redirect full iOS screens.  Miracast is one similar direction for Android... but here comes Chromecast.<br />Thought the Chrome and Android teams have merged and  can create a better user experience product versus such limited capability.  Computer is required to set up chromecast... that's going to be a limitation moving forward as well.... guess that's what you get since it's a cheap dongle.  if it (or AppleTV) can run Splashtop, that will be awesome... then, you can redirect your PC/MAC screen (all your apps and data) redirected to TV.... play your PC 3D games on your TVs...  unfortunately, this is just a cheap dongle with limited capability....
B007AL48UK|5.0|Most of the Mahjong games I have tried for tablets do not have a traditional layout and additional layouts, require you to pay more than this one costs to get additional layouts other than the initial, and tiles are too small to be able to see easily. I got this as a free app for the day, and liked it well enough to purchase Spring Mahjong for my tablet. For the money, I would definitely recommend it.

If constantly freezes, causing you to restart and lose those tokens. The game is great if you could actaully play.

1442419814|1.0|It all starts about 3 months before Tally's sixteenth birthday. She couldn't wait. Not for her license but to turn pretty. Tally's best friend (Peris) already turned pretty because he was older than her. After a month of Peris being pretty Tally decides to go to Prettytown to see Peris (Uglyies are not aloud to go over into Prettytown), but on of the pretties sees her and she has to jump off of the building with a special jacket on so she wouldn't get hurt!  After she made it back to Uglyville she saw a shadow and it scared her because she thought is was an officer. But turns out it was a girl exactly she age! Her name was Shay, Shay and Tally shared the same birthday. Turns out that Shay's friend have also all turned pretty. A few days after the girls met Shay showed Tally how to hoverboard! At night the two girls would sneak out of there dorms and leaves Uglyville to go hoverboarding at please like the Ruins, The Smoke, and many other places! Shay was not as excited about turning pretty as Tally was. It was finally their birthday,<br />Tally packed all of her stuff that she wanted to bring to Prettytown. Right before the car picked her up Shay went over to Tally to say that she is not going to turn pretty and that she is going to run away where all of her friends are (she had lied to Tally about her friends being pretty). All she gave to Tally was a note just in case she would want to go join her. After the car picked her up and brought her to the operation center that had to take her to another place called special circumstances. There they had told Tally that she had gone missing and Tally won't turn pretty until they find Shay. Tally was wondering if she will ever turn pretty or not. Read the book to see if Tally turns pretty or not. - I.G. OJRMS
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought that this was the best game and I hope LOT  of people like it too. So if you don't have it already go out and get it.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Very dense movie. If you turn your head you might miss a critical moment. All of the actors played at least 3 or four parts. My fav was Hugo Weaving as a Nurse Ratchet archetype. All of the movement back and forth between times and places was confusing at first but I am a relatively bright person and caught on. Won't give away ending but.....

B00B1D7ANK|4.0|I don't know how much you can actually do with this Schleich Dragon Rider Toy, but one thing is to be said, it is made of a superb quality, sturdy material and the artwork or look of the thing is fantastic.<br /><br />Upon removing it from the box, the wings are unattached but they easily pop right into a joint-like socket and are secured with magnets. This is a nice feature because it allows for the wings to adjust like it were an arm or an actual wing, moving up and down. The rider is also secured in the saddle by a magnet and this is nice too because you can still take him off, but he doesn't fall off easily.<br /><br />Schleich Dragon toys, from what I gather, aren't based on any movie or television show. Schleich is a German toy making company and these toys are totally unique. As far as I'm concerned they are a collectors item and a really really fantastic quality one at that. I found this Dragon Rider Toy to be a really cool item to go with my large movie room, along with my other movie memorabilia. Just its mere presence adds an air of quality to the room.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun game to ease boredom and also for completion with others.  My family all has it downloaded and we are constantly comparing where we are to each other.  There are several vehicles to buy once you start gathering coins and then different levels.  Buy the moon as soon as you can.  That is where you will get the most money.  I am continually trying to beat my old scores. Only bad thing is, if you get a new phone, you have to start all over.
1401234550|4.0|So much of the new 52 is so novel that the continuation of the most interesting part of the DCU feels disappointing.  Still, Sinestro is always interesting to see on the page.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Love this game.  It has several different items you can buy with the coins you earn to enhance the game and it also has missions to complete to give you something to work toward.  My 3 year old can even play it and loves it.

0062255657|4.0|Some books catch us by surprise.  I decided to read Neil Gaiman's THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE the other day because I was going to take a walk, and it was going to be a long walk, and I wanted something to read that would feel simple.  Since the book I had originally planned on a reading is around 500 pages, I opted instead for the 178-page, much lighter, Gaiman novel, having no idea what to expect (the dust jacket synopsis does little to explain the true nature of this story), only to return nearly 3 hours later with over half the book read.  I could have finished it that day, but I decided to let it rest, and to draw out the enjoyment.<br /><br />THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE begins with a 47-year-old unnamed main character returning home for a funeral and, seeking some solitude, he finds himself driving around town and winding up on a farm he vaguely recalls having visited the year he was seven.<br /><br />He finds the pond on the property and suddenly memories begin to resurface.  The little girl who lived here, she was eleven, her name was Lettie Hempstock, and she said the pond was an ocean.  And with those memories come the rest.<br /><br />That was the year the opal miner who had been boarding with them stole their father's car, drove it to the end of the lane, and committed suicide.  And that act, desperation over his partners' gambled money, allows a supernatural force access to the town where it starts giving people money.  The boy wakes up the next morning, choking on a coin and he goes to Lettie because he sensed something . . . more about her the previous day, her and her mother and grandmother.  He tells them what's happening and Lettie brings him along as she sets out to discover the source.<br /><br />What they find is a creature trying to gain further access to the world, which Lettie tries to bind to its current spot, but a momentary shock gives the creature all the opportunity it needs to hitch a ride back with the boy.<br /><br />The next morning, his mother announces they've got a new babysitter, Ursula Monkton.  And Ursula's first rule is, neither the boy nor his little sister are allowed to leave the property while their parents are gone.  And if the boy doesn't like Ursula's rules, and if he tries to disobey them, he'll be locked in the attic.<br /><br />This sets in motion a chain of devastating events that culminates with Lettie being given to the ocean, which may or may not return her if and when she's ready.<br /><br />THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE surprised me at every turn.  When I ordered it, I didn't expect such a slim novel.  I didn't expect such fluid writing (my experience with Gaiman novels swings back and forth between the pleasant and easily-read THE GRAVEYARD BOOK and the much more demanding and cluttered AMERICAN GODS) nor such a swiftly moving tale.  And as much as I should have, because I've been reading Gaiman for so long, I didn't expect such insight.<br /><br />Gaiman's recollections of childhood and the magic contained in the objects of our childhood still amazes me.  Every time I read a book like this, I have that moment when I think ok, I'm not alone, someone else remembers, too.  And that's a good feeling when you're 40 and you realize one day that your own kids are less interested in playing with toys than you are.<br /><br />In Gaiman's hands, there's nothing more magical than childhood, nor more dangerous, because children are so in touch with that world that it's very easy for the lines to become blurred and for that stranger place, and its occupants, to find ways to cross over and do their damage.<br /><br />While I found the novel to be an easy read, I did find it odd that the author only uses contractions in dialogue, but never in the narrative.  I just find that a strange choice and it only serves to remind me writers get paid by the word.  Another curious thing about this novel, I have spent so much of my Gaiman time listening to him reading his own works, from the WARNING: CONTAINS LANGUAGE cd to the CORALINE audio book to the NEIL GAIMAN AUDIO COLLECTION, that it's nearly impossible now for me to read one of his books without my mind automatically translating that inner voice to Neil Gaiman's.  I suppose that could be seen as a positive, because now, no matter how long or what book, if Gaiman wrote it, in my mind I always get to listen to him reading it to me.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I would consider THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE a novel for adults or for younger readers.  While the main character is 7, and while the main themes of the book are childhood and those lines between child- and adulthood, the book does contain a sex scene.  It's not a graphic one, but it's one I don't need my 14-year-old daughter to read, even though the scene is played out in one or two sentences, and the word \\"sex\\" isn't mentioned.  The fact remains, it's there and it gives me pause before I hand the finished book over to my daughter.  Just something to think about.<br /><br />Overall, however, I very much enjoyed the book (even if I did feel, at times, he was just mining unused material from CORALINE and MIRRORMASK, but I think we all do that from time to time), and can recommend this one with no problems, even if only for ease of reading.  If you've ever wanted to read a Neil Gaiman novel but were halted by AMERICAN GODS and THE GRAVEYARD BOOK just seemed too silly (it's not, that's an excellent book), then THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE could be the one to finally let you see what a talent Gaiman is when he's really cranking on all cylinders.  This is a good story, well-written, and easy to read.  What more could you ask for?

098478280X|5.0|I've been in software for a number of years, but had been in the same job for a number of years so I wasn't used to interviews. This book really trains you to think about how to solve interview problems, as well as the patterns that they tend to fall in and how to deal with them. I definitely recommend it to anyone that's been out of the game or college for a while, and needs to brush up on their interview skills.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|My main problem I have with this movie (but I can't change) is the aspect ratio. It was shot in 2.35:1 ratio, which when played through my ps3 and 65&#34; calibrated TV, comes out not filling up the entire screen.<br /><br />I've read on different A/V forums that this 2.35 ratio refers to how the movie was filmed and can't be changed unless you have some setting on your TV to change it (unfortunately, mine does not).<br /><br />Content-wise, I loved the movie. Just a slow-paced, dreary-environment laden setting. Somewhat wished there was a little bit more depth and background to all of the characters. The sound was amazing. When the bell is ringing and they need to get to the church, it was like my living room was alive with sound.<br /><br />Just upset about the Blu-Ray version only utilizing 2/3 of my screen with a nice big black bar above and below the picture.<br /><br />4/5 overall
B00B9366VO|5.0|Cannot recommend this film enough! The history of rock 'n roll weaves in an out of Sound City, and makes for a very compelling tale. Even if you're not a big fan of a particular genre or act, seeing how all the pieces fit together through history make for a very enjoyable film.
B003L77GRY|5.0|If you're looking at season five, you should probably buy it because I imagine you've already watched the previous seasons and you're not here for a plot synopsis.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert!)<br /><br />The show keeps on rolling strong after Rita's death.<br /><br />Picture is great on Blu-Ray & sound matches - 5/5
B00BH0VSM6|1.0|I guess that is why the publishers did not start with the first book in the series outside of Norway: it is awful. Amateurish, with plenty of ridiculous plot holes (no pun intended) and laughable cliches and dialogue. I love a good mystery and was really disappointed, but this guy gets great reviews so I may try one more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun entertaining. Skillful game love playing it.  I would recommend this game to any of my friends to pass the time or just have fun.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|TH KITCHEN HOUSE WAS A NOVEL THAT HELD YOUR INTEREST FROM THE START TO FINISH.THE CHARACTERS WERE VRRY REAL AND THE STORY JUST KEPT GETTING MORE INTERESTING.  WOULD LOVE TO READ MORE BY THIS AUTHOR.
B00EOO55GW|2.0|Ill keep it short.I am a A7X fan, but this album left me scratching my head. I have to admit, my music interest skipped over the late 80's hair metal bands, just never cared for them. I also have to say as much respect as I have for metallica, they are not on any of my playlist. So to me they have dumbed their sound down to simple 4/4 beats, predictable rhythms, and an outdated sound. Even their guitar sounds like they borrowed metallica's setup. Extra star just out of respect for their previous work.
B007SGM084|3.0|I am in the middle of the second book in this series. It's a good read if you don't want something too heavy. Writing gets a little repetitive, but it has a good plot and characters.

1401938906|5.0|It's good because it makes you think about how you think and how changing that will change your life.  Good book...
B00005N6KG|2.0|I would have given it a 1 star if it hadn't been for the fact that it actually is very comfortable and flexible to wear.  The ear buds fit perfectly in my tiny ears and the headband (adjustable) fit my very small head.  This has always been an issue for me wearing any kind of ear buds or headphones. I've even tried the super small earbuds for women for very extreme activity and the earbuds would slip out.  NOT this one! However, the left side started to short out a little after 4 weeks (intermittent noise coming out...very annoying).  The right side lasted about a week longer before the same issue started to happen. Perhaps they would last longer if used within normal activity conditions.  I am a marathon runner training 6 days a week in extreme humidity (South Florida) so there is an excessive amount of sweat/moisture in addition to the long exposure to this climate (2-3.5 hour runs multiple times a week).  Perhaps all that jarring on the wires was just too much.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book takes a bit to get into, but once you get past the first couple chapters you can't put it down! Love the character, setting, all of it. Ready to follow up with the rest of the saga!

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is the best iron man game I've ever played.  Occasionally you have to make some in-app purchases but this game is still awesome! Amazing graphics lots of armor from the movies and I still can't believe that this game is free! I would recommend it to any iron man fan.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I got this to help power my audia technica ath pro 700k headphones. With the bass all the way up it will crack your skull! Insane power in a little package. The downside is that it makes the music sound more fuzzy. Not only that but when you plug it in there is a super loud pop that will make your ears bleed.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Super fun game. Hours of entertainment. Helped me through bed rest of six months. I reccomend anybody who like bingo play this game. Lots of different rooms to play and a variety of ways to win.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Title: Wool (1-5)<br />Author: Hugh Howey<br />Rating: 4.5 Stars<br /><br />Warnings<br /><br />1.) This review will be long. This story has triggered a LOT of thought and reflection.<br /><br />2.) I will discuss serious spoilers at the end (though I'll warn you again before I do), so if you haven't read it, pay attention. One thing you DON'T want to do with Wool, is know all the twists and turns in advance because they are many and they are mostly very adept.<br /><br />When I first picked up Wool, I'd heard that it was something of a phenomenon. I did not know anything about it other than that. And when I began Wool 1, I got about 20 locations in and put it down. I was so disinterested that I read an entire book in between. What a mistake! The (also widely touted) ya tome I chose instead was so annoying that I DNFed it. Wrote a tough review and then took it down deciding the DNF meant I just shouldn't review it. Just wasn't my cup o' tea at ALL.<br /><br />At which point I picked up Wool 1 and tried again. The first thing that struck me about Wool 1 was that it was a short story. I was perplexed (again, I mentioned that I knew nothing about it). But this time I pushed forward through the bits that had stopped me (more on this later) and found it to be a very well-crafted and enjoyable short story. It has all of the massive PUNCH in the GUT that a great short story should. Howey yanks you about on a cord until you're as exhausted and devastated as his characters and you falter along with them, stunned by Howey's surprise twist.<br /><br />But where it could go from there was a mystery. It seemed distinctly over to me. So I picked up Wool 2 and was thrust into the world of Wool in more detail and with deeper characterizations that grabbed me. I was hooked, fascinated with the extraordinary world-building. There's something magical about the way the characters wind down the great staircase and Howey shows you his world in spinning, gorgeous, heartbreaking 360. You could as easily call this one \\"The Descent\\" and get the heavy feeling that each tread places on the reader.<br /><br />Even so, when I finished Wool 2, I thought, \\"What an excellent, subsequent short story.\\"<br /><br />Then I picked up Wool 3 and it really took off because we TRULY meet Juliette. And. She. Is. AWESOME.<br /><br />You all know I'm a stone-cold sucker for a kick-ass female MC and Wool's Juliette delivers. My praise for Howey is in no small measure due to his decision to draw his \\"Bruce Willis\\" Die-Hard with ta-tas and a greasy wrench in her hand. FANTASTIC.<br /><br />What I Loved - Not too many spoilers here...<br /><br />Um, obv. Juliette. She's an enigma in the very structured and orderly world of the silo. Rather than follow her proscribed path, her heart (and heartache) leads her into the down-deep, where she buries herself, quite literally, in Mechanics. She's so at home among the oil and sweat and filth of hammering pistons and rattling bolts that in 20 years, she's never climbed back up to see her father in the nursery. When her life intersects accidentally with the Mayor and Deputy of the silo, who live up-top and wish her to join them as the new Sheriff, her carefully constructed world falls apart.<br /><br />But does she crumble? Does she fade? When she faces the most horrible possible ends, possible truths, not just for herself but for those whom she does love, her friends and family in the down-deep, what does she do? Well, I'm not going to tell you the specifics because I promised no spoilers yet, but let's just say that if you count Juliette out, you're a fool. She may very well be one of my top five favorite female MCs of all time. Seriously. For reals, yo'.<br /><br />The Silo/World-Building - Wow. All I can say is \\"Wow.\\" Now THIS is world-building. I will admit, I have a few questions (as a sci-fi and apocalyptic nut) that I address below, but 99% otherwise is WOW. You can REALLY picture the silo, with the great spiral staircase twisting its way through the heart of the society, the levels all separate and orderly, their purpose and missions clear. It's an extraordinary vision. I've read books that could not include enough adjectives to make the space they describe make sense to me...but Howey's is as sharp as a movie in my mind. What's most amazing is that he (almost always) manages to do so with a relative economy of description. (That being said, there is such repetition of the up-and-down of the stairs over the course of the entire Omnibus that he gets many opportunities to crystallize the vision.)<br /><br />Twists and Turns - Howey delivers a ton of twists and turns and really gives you the sense of an overall mystery to be solved, \\"What's real?\\" And, \\"How did we get here?\\" That's what we always want to know in post-apocalyptics isn't it? How did we get here? But the \\"What's real?\\" part is an important piece of dystopians as well. It isn't a \\"dystopian\\" unless there is some sort of lie or opacity that \\"keeps people in place\\". You chase both of these questions in Howey's story, following them up and down the stairs yourself until you're ready to tear out your own hair. But he gives you just enough tid-bits to keep you hanging on and by the time you've fallen in love with several of the characters (not just Juliette), it doesn't matter how long it takes, it doesn't matter how he tugs your heart, you are GOING TO GET SOME ANSWERS!!! :) It's great when an author can inspire the same feelings in you that he does in his characters.<br /><br />Sideline - The tragic love of the Deputy and his Mayor in Wool 2 was one of my favorite things. This is one of the tenderest stories of \\"longing\\" I've ever read and the fact that it occurs between life-long friends who are also in the twilight of their lives makes it even sweeter. You've really done something exceptional with what is essentially a short story, when you can make your reader SOB for the protagonists after only just getting to know them. Truly.<br /><br />Solo - I Loved Solo. He was a wonderful \\"story-within-a-story\\" because he was the human embodiment of what could and had gone wrong in the past. And yet you love him with a sadness usually reserved for children...and there's a reason for that.<br /><br />The Ending - Without saying more, I was satisfied with the way Howey wrapped it up. The only thing I would have liked is more information on some of \\"The Stranded\\" that isn't given after Juliette's departure (sorry to be cryptic, but saving spoilers for below), but I think Howey leads you to believe in Juliette, ultimately. That's all I'm gonna say.<br /><br />Analysis and Critique - SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />Now I'm going to discuss the things that caused reflection and a few that didn't work so much for me. I have no idea if this interests anyone else, but it kind of interests me when other readers or authors share their thoughts like this...<br /><br />Central premise of \\"How we got here\\"<br /><br />When the true complete \\"reveal\\" is done of how the world had been destroyed save the 18 silos remaining (or however many), I...didn't buy it.<br /><br />I know! *Horrors* How can you recommend a story so highly when in the end, you don't believe how it began? I don't know. In some ways it doesn't matter. (Funny, Bernard feels the same way, ick.) What does matter is the NOW that the characters live in. But I guess I should explain why I didn't buy it, so here goes.<br /><br />Lukas eventually figures out with Bernard's guidance that the ancestors of those living in the silos had constructed them knowing the world was going to end because... *drum roll* ...THEY BLEW UP THE WORLD ON PURPOSE.<br /><br />*blinks* *silent*<br /><br />Say what now?<br /><br />And the because was the worst part. They blew up the rest of the species (and WORLD) because they wanted us to be homogeneous so we wouldn't fight anymore...wouldn't repeat the mistakes of the past.<br /><br />*blinks* *silent*<br /><br />Say what now?<br /><br />I have just some huge problems with this every which way...<br /><br />1.) If you were going to try to save the species (albeit a homogeneous cross-section), you would need a LARGER FREAKING SAMPLE SIZE. Even if there are 100,000 among the silos (doubtful), that is not really a good enough number to ensure we're gonna make it long-term, particularly given that...<br /><br />2.) You have them all segregated so their gene pools are DIVERGING, not CONVERGING, relative to one another...so the whole plan to make people homogeneous? Not very effective, I guess, unless you only expect one silo to survive, in which case I'm back to Point 1.<br /><br />3.) And it seems counter-productive to wipe the slate clean if in doing so you have to also destroy the environment that sustains our life. So there was no way to eliminate all the \\"unacceptable\\" people without destroying the world to a point that your \\"seeds\\" may NEVER be able to re-emerge? I'm sorry, I know it's repetitive, but...<br /><br />*blinks* *silent*<br /><br />Say what now?<br /><br />Finally, my other major issue with this \\"homogeneity is the goal\\" theory is that NOTHING about dystopia in general or Howey's dystopia is homogeneous. The entire crux of tension in dystopias is the disparity between those in power and those without it. In fact, Howey's silo is perfectly stratified and divided as a good dystopia should be. It's believable as a dystopia.<br /><br />But if the whole reason we ended up blowing up the world was to ensure homogeneity, to avoid giving people reasons to fight, then you would NEVER set up a society with such stratification and division. It doesn't make any sense. It's completely opposite to your supposed end-goal. (For example, they still have some weird, vague religion despite the fact that religion has led to many of the largest scale wars in human history. Wouldn't the homogeneity-loving world-destroyers have outlawed religion?)<br /><br />So the \\"How we got here\\" part didn't work for me at all. I wish he'd have gone with a more traditional massive nuclear war or asteroid hit or something where there was some warning or prep-time and people with forethought gathered the best and brightest and/or took people by lottery. Something like that. But one small group destroying the entire planet so we can maybe, probably not, emerge as a happy, homogeneous family one day? Didnt' cut it for me.<br />Reflection and Analysis<br /><br />Howey loves a metaphor. Clearly when he began with Wool, he loved the double-entendre of the wool used by the cleaners and having the \\"wool pulled over one's eyes\\". But then he went on with a knitting metaphor as long as he could, which turned out to be 4 volumes. (The Stranded is pushing it...strands...)<br /><br />He also uses the silo and seeds metaphor, which I did enjoy. When Solo starts asking Juliette what happens to seeds when they stay in their silos for too long, I thought, \\"Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhh, that's a good point. They ROT.\\"<br /><br />But one of the other things that they can do is SPROUT. And that is the true metaphor in this story to me...that the silos, which are supposed to be filled with quiescent seeds, keep SPROUTING with questions, with wonder, with desire, with frustration.<br /><br />All I can say about this series is that I am SO glad I read it. The story is tremendous. I'm definitely going to read The First Shift (prequel). Maybe it will make me feel differently about the Gods of Shiva Howey suggested as Wool's ancestors. Regardless, I'm willing to bet my sweet bippy that it will be a great read...

B004LROUW2|5.0|I had already read, \\"Ichi kyuu hachi yon\\" by Haruki Murakami, when I bought the Kindle version. The Japanese title does not make much sense, unless you realize that the Japanese word for \\"nine\\" is \\"kyuu.\\" Thus, the title is a kind of pun. If you pronounce each of the numbers 1984 in Japanese (ichi kyuu hachi yon), they sound exactly the same as \\"ichi Q hachi yon\\" (Q is kyuu in Japanese). I have absolutely no idea as to translate the title. To give it a different English title would loose the allusion to the great English novel, \\"1984,\\" by George Orwell, which when written was somewhat far in the future, a kind of alternate world book itself. \\"1Q84\\" is a reference to an alternate and parallel world which Aomame has entered and is able to hook up to a childhood friend, Tengo. Having said this much, I haven't given away any of the plot.<br />  In my opinion, this is Murakami's most mature and well crafted novel to date. Others may differ in their evaluation of the book. I wanted to read the book again and look carefully at the details. I find that there are so many things that I missed in the first reading. I highly recommend \\"Ichi kyuu hachi yon / 1Q84\\" to fans of Murakami. It is as good as the \\"Wind up Bird Chronicles (Neji maki dori)\\" which was the first book I read by Murakami. It was the one that got me hooked. 1Q84 (Ichi kyuu hachi yon) is also a book that first time Murakami readers might like. But, be warned this is not an action novel, although there is some of that also. Definitely five stars.
B00AHDXTIK|2.0|I had one of these for a while before leaving it in a hotel room. I ordered my first from Griffin the DAY they released it. I ordered a new one and the quality has DEFINITELY changed since the first one I had. The cord is thinner (actually kind of nice) but also shinier and seems cheaper. The original had a nice matte finish. Also, the pins are crooked and off center in the lightning end of it, so it doesn't work with my phone. If I put pressure on the cord so it's angled just right it'll charge, but sitting on the table by itself it will not do anything.

1594746036|5.0|It's difficult to find books that are appropriate for all ages, interesting, while still challenging the limits of the imagination and introducing a new angle of fantasy to the genre that has slowed down significantly after spitting out classic series, most recently the Hunger Games, etc. This is a great beginning to what is seeming to be a wonderful series in the making! Children to adults of all ages will enjoy this story and the visuals it also brings. The book was in great condition as well, so all in all, lovely!!
B003498SDA|3.0|Acting is good, music is great, ambiance of LA is well reflected, some of the script is poorly written.<br />Some unrealistic scenes, most notably the shoot-out in the club. FBI agents came with many men and helicopters, are (supposedly) everywhere, and armed to the teeth and are nowhere when there is a long clean shot of Vincent, or when he leaves.<br />Nothing makes sense from the shoot-out on. For example no way they survive that type of 60+ mph crash without fastening their belt. May work in \\"Die Hard\\" but \\"Collateral\\" is not meant to be a \\"shoot-them-up\\" movie where nobody needs to reload...<br />End of the movie kills the movie. It should be a dark ending.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Not worth the time. Twice the game has started over from the beginning. I am glad I did not waste any more money buying stuff the second time.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|If you like Jane Austen, you'll probably like this book (so my friends tell me - I don't).  It is so slow moving, that the good thing is that it puts me to sleep at night!
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I'm rating this album 5 stars even though it's not the \\"best\\" work from A7X simply because it's a very solid album from front to back, and probably deeper than \\"Nightmare\\", despite the title track of the latter and some good singles.  I don't think it makes any sense to hate A7X for being one of the few \\"metal\\" acts that can sell albums, or arguing over whether they're metal or not.  Ironically, you hear BLATANT callbacks to Metallica (\\"Sad But True\\") and GNR on this record, and those were two groups that people often criticized at the time for not being \\"metal enough\\".  At the end of the day, buzz words and genres don't matter if you're just a great band.  This is a dark period in time for guitar music in general, and A7X is still one of the better guitar bands out there, IMO.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|bought it to go with the book, but sorry I like the book better. and I don't think it would have been hard to put more of the story from the book into the movie.

B00BYISQTO|3.0|I have been a National fan for 7+ years. I was first introduced to them with Alligator and I quickly went looking for all of their former albums because I couldn't get enough. The disturbing lyrics, the unbridled arrangements, the truth and emotion in their art/music hooked me. I was in love with this band. So in love that The Geese of Beverly Road was playing in the background when I married my husband.<br /><br />I noticed their sound started to change with Boxer and then even more so on High Violet. To me, it felt like the band had lost interest in telling abstract, emotional stories in their music. The songs no longer gave me goose bumps, they no longer spoke to my heart. National found more commercial success with this new sound, but it was less and less appealing to me.<br /><br />With Trouble Will Find Me, this band is almost unrecognizable to me. They have kept with the same formula/sound as High Violet. The music is no longer compelling, the lyrics are no longer weird, creative, thought provoking.<br /><br />I wish they would go back to the sounds of Cherry Tree, The National, Alligator...I want to hear songs like Karen, Baby We'll be Fine, Mr. November, Wasp Nest, About Today, Theory of the Crows, Secret Meeting, All the Wine, American Mary...<br /><br />Please go back National, go back to your roots...be my festival, my parade!

B005JTAP4S|5.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale by William O'Brien is a classic children's story straight out of Alice in Wonderland, but with far more imagination and style. Peter is about to get into double digits and is so excited. He visits Mrs Kipple's antique shop and likes a small wooden box. He takes it home and while tinkering with it, opens a secret compartment. He takes out a velvet pouch with curious items in it, one being key. He returns to the shop for his present and is shown an old clock with vivid drawings all over it. Mrs Kipple reminds Peter to take the pouch on his trip as he will need the items in it. With all the eagerness of a birthday boy, Peter slips the key into the keyhole. A door opens and Seebright the bird asks Peter to come in. Peter is swept along on a fantastic journey full of fantastical creatures that defy the imagination. The tale is well told and never lets up. The scary scenes will not frighten children, but make them gasp, giggle and guffaw. All in all, this reader very much enjoyed the ride and didn't want to get off.<br />A FIVE STAR wonderment for all ages. A must read that will have every kid wanting more.
B0063M22QO|1.0|never got the game on my kindle can not leave feedback on this game. how do i get my game now
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Loved it. Wow at the end. Think it was a good story line. My daughter watched it and loved it
B0064X7FVE|2.0|If I had been asked to review this app a year ago, when I had 1st downloaded it, it would ha e gotten 5 stars. However, now, after the update it isn't the same. Too many ads and other junk with it!! Don't waste your time ... look for something else ... I will be.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is fun and challenging.  I have played a few that I couldn't even escape the first room.  It took a little while but it wasn't too complex.
1451696191|3.0|I thought the book was well written but I didn't enjoy the story all that much. I thought the epilogue would've been better known at the beginning. Although had it been left out completely, I would've never known he had such a traumatizing experience. I could have just chalked up his quirks as being a hormonal teenager without any cause and effect.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awesome app to use. I would give this app to anyone to use. Best thing ever. I love horses. If you don't love horses, you will after this.
B00CATONCA|2.0|My dvd's got stuck in the back of the display and the plastic aquariums did not look clear.  It's cool looking but I am sending mine back, for that kind of money it should be better quality.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game is all i have to say! Well spent money for sure- get the game and im sure you'll love it.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|We have watched this movie every year since it came out so I thought it was about time to buy it on DVD.  It never gets old even though we can all say the dialogue along with the characters and sing the songs too.  Our kids are now 18 & 16 and this is still the first Christmas movie they want to watch!<br /><br />Merry Christmas!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a must haves for all bingo on the go lovers only one thing they could improve on is when buying power ups 1000 is a bit steep for 4
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Nice app and it usually works well. I use it daily for cities across USA and Canada. Works better on my android phone than it does on my kindle fire.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Absolutely Completely in love with this song. I love watching the video too. Daft Punk/Pharrell songs are must haves as most Pharrells songs are.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Although the start was a little slow, I must say it was worth the buy. If you thought the movie was good the book will blow you away. Take the time to sit down with this read and heavily enjoy it. You won't regret it.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Heard so many songs on the independant radio station and when I finally heard radioactive I knew I had to hear the rest of the album and it was as good as I hoped it would be.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Only gave it four stars because i don't know what other missle defense games are out there. Upgradeable blast radius and duration, missle count and speed, and repair buildings between waves. Not a bad game and caused some atari nostalgia.
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|I recently received it and have not had a chance to view the disks.  I am sure they are what I expected.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|So nice find an app that I never knew I needed but now can't live without!  This app customizes to your use and makes my typing as fast on the on-screen keyboard as it was on my old blackberry with physical keyboard.  It &#34;learns&#34; where you are pressing when you intend to press a certain key so there are fewer mistakes.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|My aunt got my mom on this series and she loves it she recently got a kindle and she could not be more pleased.

B000OHZJLY|5.0|Here it is: Elvis Costello's magnum opus and arguably his finest album. Imperial Bedroom is a sprawling and epic piece of work that finds Costello at his creative and contemplative best. It's an ambitious effort that, thanks in large part to Beatles producer Geoff Emerick, succeeds on every level and it took Elvis Costello and the Attractions further than they'd ever gone before.<br /><br />The first striking thing about this album is the sound itself. It has a warm and inviting atmosphere that immediately draws you in. The songs have much more breathing room and feel more laid back than they did on any previous EC album; there's no doubt that Emerick is responsible for this. He takes Costello's songs and gives them a life of their own while still allowing Costello and the band to work their magic. It's slick and more restrained with a gentle warmness that flows effortlessly through every song. \\"Beyond Belief\\" is another gem in a long line of great album openers and immediately the album's production sets in, giving the song a wide-open atmosphere while making it intimate at the same time. The poppy \\"Tears Before Time\\" immediately follows and gives keyboardist Steven Nieve a chance to shine with some unique sounds. This is really an album where he gets plenty of time in the spotlight, both on the keyboard and as a conductor and arranger for the various string arrangements sprinkled throughout the record. The soft accordion and piano melody of \\"The Long Honeymoon\\" is a perfect companion to Costello's lyrics, a story about a young wife who's waiting for her husband to call or come home, yet can't bring herself to actually pick up the phone and face the fear that he may be having an affair with her best friend. It's the kind of twisted tale only Elvis can weave so eloquently.<br /><br />\\"Almost Blue\\" is one of Costello's most famous songs, a gentle piano ballad with a smoky blues feel. The fanfare trumpets of \\"...And in Every Home\\" completely take you by surprise but they fit the song so well that they quickly feel second nature and it's one more nice production touch that sets this album apart from anything Elvis had recorded before. The fast-paced \\"Little Savage\\" is an exhilarating ride while \\"The Loved Ones\\" contains a lyric revealing the original title for the album: \\"PPSILOVEYOU\\". The album's closer is the beautiful \\"Town Cryer\\", complete with Nieve's delicate piano and a soaring orchestra that brings the entire album together and leaves an indelible impression.<br /><br />I have to save a paragraph for the album's true highlight and one of the most devastating songs in EC's library: \\"Man Out of Time\\". What's really interesting is that the track both begins and ends with an earlier and rougher version of the song. These bookends take you by surprise because the final cut of the song is sandwiched in the middle and is far superior and much more polished. The pop melody is incredibly bright and catchy while the words paint a picture that could be as autobiographical as they are allegorical. The entire album should be heard from beginning to end but if you absolutely must hear only one track from the record it's this one, without a doubt.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it was met with some commercial and critical indifference upon the time of its release, Imperial Bedroom has gone on to become one of Costello's most beloved and acclaimed albums. From its glossy production to its colorful cover art, everything about this record is sheer perfection. The Attractions are flawless as always and Costello's words and music are a bit more open and optimistic, which results in a fresh experience that isn't easy to forget. All 15 tracks flow together effortlessly and the whole album should be heard from beginning to end. It's like a movie where every scene is important and to not see the whole thing would greatly hurt the experience. In fact, this album is my second-favorite EC album, only behind All This Useless Beauty. From an artistic standpoint this may just be his brightest and best.<br /><br />This is one of the most stirring and beautiful records of the past 50 years. Own it, hear it, and experience it time and time again.ic standpoint this may just be his brightest and best.<br /><br />This is one of the most stirring and beautiful records of the past 50 years.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I have no idea what would have happened if this album came out in 1971, however, coming out in 2013, in the midst of all they hyped nonsense being played today, it is  breath of very fresh air. This is delightful music, stripped down and joyful. In a time (today) when America is lost and searching for it's missing identity, this collection of folk songs, stripped down original songs, informal recordings, and alternate takes, speaks from the past with a clear voice. Today, with digital this, that, and the other thing, this is a course correction that speaks to us right now. Thanks, Bob.
B005544V6A|5.0|Several story lines, and interesting twists to legal negotiations.  Fiction, but enough reality to be interesting.  A series to enjoy back to back episodes.

B005IQZB14|4.0|I was looking for an escape book this summer to compensate for not really being able to escape. This fit the bill nicely, thanks Cheryl!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I watched the movie a couple months ago and enjoyed it well enough, then I just recently got the book and read it.  It was amazing!  It flows so well and it easy to follow.  I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good easy going book to read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm a puzzle freak and can't get enough. I need more levels! Some of them were easy, but I have to admit that I got sick at times. Love the challenge.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Ryan Reynolds is wonderful in The Proposal.  He's gorgeous, funny, sensitive, and an absolute charmer.  Sandra Bullock is her trademark funny  and carries off the role of the difficult boss and convincingly transforms into a fascinating person.  Loved The Proposal!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's missile command. It's what you expect, but it's done well, so if you like that, enjoy. I did. Thanks
B000001GBJ|4.0|this is a very calm and relaxing music cd and helps to get in the state of mind for meditation.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|How nice to have on my Kindle Fire.  I use it all the time.  I wish that I would have had it sooner.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|This book was hard to read in many parts due to the nature of the content, but it's an interesting and worthwhile book if you are prepared emotionally to be dragged along through Ms. Sebold's horrendous rape and the aftermath. It's an intimate look into the life of the victims of rape and a glance into the eyes of a perpetrator. It's thought-provoking and chilling, and will haunt you for weeks after reading the book.
B005XZHQKY|5.0|I had been mostly unimpressed with my husband's new 3D tv.  This changed my mind.  While some of the footage is better than others, I was STUNNED to feel like a manatee was physically present in our living room and could be examined from every angle.  I actually found myself reaching out with the kids to try to touch it!  I can't imagine ever getting to have this experience in any other way.  We're only about halfway into the 1st disk on whales, but that one image alone was worth the price of the set and I'm sure we'll be finding other treasures, especially the coral reef.  This is getting rather specific, but if you home school and have a 3D tv and Blu-ray, don't pass this up- it's an incredible learning experience and builds kids' appreciation for sea creatures in a totally unique way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun , game for people with patience and this is a game for people who really likes horse or are interested in horses and horse games I recommend this game to everyone and anyone xxxc.  Xxx.  Xxxxx

1401937519|5.0|For me this is the Book of the Year. Everywhere on the Net I encounter interviews and videos with Anita Moorjani, and even quotations by her. And this is well-deserved - we all need to hear of her experience.<br /><br />Wayne Dyer was involved in \\"discovering\\" Anita and helping to get her book published, and has written the foreword to this book.<br /><br />Anita informs us of her upbringing - born of Indian parents in Singapore but residing in Hong Kong. She was exposed to several cultures and spoke both English, Cantanese and Sindhi fluently.<br /><br />She managed to avoid an arranged marriage, and eventually finds her \\"true love\\", Danny, whom she marries.<br /><br />But Anita's problem is that she is a people-pleaser and is always trying to do what others believe is best, thus finding it impossible to be her true self.<br /><br />One of Anita's biggest fears was that she might develop cancer, and her best friend died of the disease, which made her even more fearful. And so she did contract cancer, Though she tries various healing modalities, they are to no avail, and eventually she slips into a coma. This is when she begins to be aware of everything those connected with her are doing and saying. She is at death's door, but has never felt so good! She had unlimited perception and \\"360-degree peripheral vision\\".<br /><br />She felt \\"all moments\\" at once. \\"I was aware of everything that pertained to me - past, present, and future - simultaneously.\\"<br /><br />She feels she understands the Universe. She realizes that \\"God isn't a being, but a state of being ... and I was now that state of being!\\"<br /><br />She was completely enveloped in unconditional love and acceptance. She saw that she was \\"a beautiful being of the Universe\\". She deserved to be loved simply because she existed. She became aware that we are all connected - everything in the Universe was connected. \\"The entire Universe is alive and infused with consciousness, encompassing all life and nature.\\"<br /><br />In this book not only does Anita describe her NDE in absolute detail, but also explains all the insights she takes back with her from it. Before she wakes from the coma she is told that if she chooses to return to life, she will be healed completely, and this is what happened, despite the doctors doing their best to seek out traces of cancer somewhere or other in her body.<br /><br />There is a chapter on \\"Why I got Sick ... and Healed\\", \\"Infinite Selves and Universal Energy\\", \\"Allowing and Being Yourself\\" and, finally, \\"Questions and Answers\\".<br /><br />Anita's NDE was a glimpse of our Oneness, and she experienced becoming the Source.<br /><br />She realized that even the worst criminals, including murderers, are victims of their \\"own limitations, pain, and fear\\". In the other realm we are all One, all the same.<br /><br />Anita Moorjani is wonderfully articulate, and the book is a joy to read. Absolutely everyone should read this book, particularly of course those afraid of death. They will not be afraid ever again. Anita went through her ordeal in order to experience her NDE and inform you and me and the whole world of the amazing love, acceptance, joy and bliss of the afterlife.<br /><br />Anita's final instructions to us are: Go out and live your life fearlessly!/><br />In this book not only does Anita describe her NDE in absolute detail, but also explains all the insights she takes back with her from it.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|It is tough and durable. If you want a sharpener, please buy this one. You will not regret it forever.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|So I finally finished this book. It was good but the constant jumping around can get a little old. It's really cool to keep updates of characters parts of the storyline from the perspective of different characters.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It was cool and some were really hard and really really easy hope u enjoy this game if u get it
1603425381|5.0|I really like this book. It has so many easy ways to finish a crochet project that is hard to choose which one to use. I have used three of the borders on three different scarves.  They all turned out beautiful. I recommend this book if you are into crochet.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Just recently got this headset, it works great so far, really good audio sounds, and best of yet, this is a great product for livestreamers that go AFK every so often. Being able to talk to your stream while AFK is a great way to keep people entertained. Battery life lasts about 10h of me before I charge it up. Even better, you can use it while you charge it.<br /><br />Great buy. Comfortable and everything :3
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app. It is one of the few that work as good on the tablet as it does on the desktop.  I'm on here a lot.
B00DU6UD0I|1.0|A few funny moments, but with an overall feeling that you were laughing at the misfortunes of others. Perhaps this is a case of a film being directed at a target audience that is well outside my own demographic, assuming, of course, that the target audience is fart-joke fourteen-year-olds who find boobies hilarious and fascinating.<br /><br />Rude and crude, a true &#34;nothing is sacred&#34; film which offers next to nothing to justify its cheap tricks, and cheaper punchlines. The references to other films are noticeable, but so what? They're not noteworthy, and carry little weight except to suggest that the Wayans brothers watch too many videos and have appropriated too many scenes from what were pretty dull movies to begin with to no purpose other than to make reference to those other films. Some of the references even serve, by their contrast, to remind us of how truly awful this film is, such as the allusion to the final scene in &#34;The Usual Suspects&#34;.<br /><br />How sad that undeniable comedic talent such as has been demonstrated by the Wayans' has been co-opted in the service of such tasteless unfunny dreck. How uninspired does one have to be to make cheap jokes about a &#34;retard&#34; (their term, not mine!) who craps his drawers...?<br /><br />Not worth the time to watch it.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Bought to pair with an ASRock mobo for HTPC. A bit of overkill, I know, but I haven't had a single stutter with HD playback, either network or Netflix/Youtube/Escapist. Works great with XBMC. Would definitely buy again if I needed another HTPC, or even a simple gaming machine. Would probably kick butt as a MAME box too.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|ultraviolet stinks.<br />Don't buy it if you want a true digital copy<br /><br />Can only play off of the internet on a computer.
0786891416|5.0|From the very beginning I could hear Beckett and Castle saying things that were written.  Had a grin on my face from the get go.  I love the twists and turns that happen.  Great Book!
0920668372|5.0|I give this book in place of a card at every baby shower. I love the story and it makes me cry every time I read it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game, nice and fun. Graphics are nice and gameplay is straight forward. Kept me entertained for a bit, unlike most other games
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Great graphics, adequate challenge for casual gaming, enjoyable mechanics, easy to learn, etc. Overall, a very solid game worth playing!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|*Some spoilers in review.<br /><br />I think it is important that I disclose that I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all 5 Mortal Instrument books.  So much so, that I am now in the process of reading The Infernal Devices, a prequel to that series. The books are lengthy and chock full of background information, so I was concerned that \\"City of Bones\\" on film would pale in comparison to the book.  I was wrong, but not as wrong as nearly every critic that is calling this movie another  \\"Twilight\\" (there are vampires in the movie, but that is not all the movie is about), or a combination of all teenage fantasy movies combined (again, there are supernatural creatures in the movie, but that doesn't make it a hodgepodge of young adult fantasies). It appeals to moviegoers over 15, too.  I am way over that magical age and I can say without hesitation(or shame) that I loved this movie. I have no clue why \\"Rotten Tomatoes\\" gives this a 12 out of 100. The audience rating on that site is 73.  Why the big difference?  I think it is because most of the critics expected it to be bad (\\"The Host\\" could have soured their taste for young adult fantasy) and previewed the movie predisposed to finding everything they could that was wrong with it. This is an exciting movie about a young girl living in New York who discovers that she is not a mere mortal (mundane). Her mother had a warlock put a spell on her which prevented her from seeing the supernatural world around her or knowing the part she plays in the ongoing battle of good against evil.<br /><br />There were a few top critics that gave the movie high marks for the same reason I am.  It was fun to watch.  The action sequences were thrilling, like going down the first drop on a roller coaster ride thrilling.  I might see the movie again just to see Jamie Campbell Bower's fantastic back flip onto a wooden table while he fought off an army of  vampires. This was one of the movie's best action sequences (and there were many).  I read that the actors performed most of their own stunts, and I give these young stars a lot of credit.  I'm sure they were all black and blue more times than not and not from the runes (tattoos) that the makeup artist applied.  Great work! The actors also were believable in their respective roles.  Lily Collins was a perfect choice to play Clary.  She didn't look too old for the part, and was very convincing as a teenager whose life is turned upside down when she learns she is a shadowhunter (part human, part angel).  The actress shows the shock and conflicting emotions perfectly. I think she is getting better and better with every movie she makes.  Jamie Campbell Bower is Jace Wayland (Lightwood, Morgenstern...whatever)! If you read the books you know what I mean.  He is cocky and vulnerable at the same time.  JCB looks the part, too right down to his big blue eyes (don't think I've ever seen eyes like his on screen before). His accent makes him even more attractive.  It is easy to see why Clary finds him irresistible.  Robert Sheehan (Simon) also was cast perfectly.  He comes across as a nerd but is handsome, witty and extremely loyal. When he tells Clary he loves her and his feelings are not reciprocated, you almost wish it wasn't so. I'm rooting for him and Isabelle (another shadowhunter) to connect.<br /><br />Having said all this, my last words to you are...If you haven't seen this movie yet, use the bad reviews you may find in your newspaper to line your birdcage or make paper hats...whatever!  Go and see \\"The Mortal Instruments\\".  It is much better than \\"Breaking Dawn\\" or \\"Hunger Games\\".
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This is an interesting mental movie about finding ones self.  You need to pay attention to the dialog as it is the meat of the story.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I was hooked by the promising concept of the book, but very disappointed with the read.  Too much of the tale is too painful and too sordid to endure, entire opening chapters and many portions throughout immersed in the author's devastating loss of her mother to cancer.  Even close to the completion of her journey, she still evidences unbridled &#34;acting out,&#34; making her alleged ultimate &#34;change&#34; or redemption, barely alluded to in the end, quite unconvincing.  Sorry.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|After listening to Another Self Portrait  I was taken back to 1970 and rembered these songs.  Blue Moon was one.  I thought it strange because he did not write some of the songs.  This is an Excellent find of hidden gems and it is a fine addition to your library of Bob Dylan. How could these not have been released before. I really liked his Nashville Skyline  voice and this missing puzzle  piece of Another Self Portrait  is wonderful.  Did Bob Dylan get so discouraged with the public as to give up on his rock period far too soon and therefore went back to his folk roots comfort by turning country pie. I will have to say he has finally found his own genre in later life. And it is all good to me.<br />I like this new Self Portrait. And his voice is unique and enchanting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 7yr old daughter &amp; I LOVE playing this game! It's VERY fast paced &amp; keeps us busy for hours!

I can't wait to see it! :) This game is a must get! I can't believe this FUN/GREAT game is FREE! And it doesn't make u buy stuff to keep playing like most free games do.

B00B7PIRIE|4.0|I recently became OBSESSED with this series thanks to my grandma, aunts and mother and wanted to suprize my mom by buying the whole series for her. It arrived a day early, the packaging was clean and perfect. However I docked a star due to a few lines showing on the screen during my viewing of the last episodes of Seasons One and Two. Well worth the money for the series, though the discs themselves looked perfect, it's an error with them I think.

B00DY951RQ|5.0|So everyone knows the legendary quote in Rolling Stone from when \\"Self Portrait\\" was first released.<br />I admit , at the time of it's initial release , it was a confusing album. Lots of obscure material , lots of awkward cover versions , lots of overly orchestrated material.<br />But Mr. Dylan has always done whatever he has wanted to do.<br />This box set strips away a vast majority of the over-production , and revisits songs not only from \\"Self Portrait\\" , but also others from that era. The newly remastered version of \\"Self Portrait\\" itself , included in the 4 cd set ,is cleaned up and a revelation in itself.<br />It had been a couple of decades since I listened to the original release , but the wealth of previously unreleased material on this set , I have already made it through the entire set 5 times in 4 days.

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The story is okay, Mark Wahlberg is fabulous and Ted, the bear, is hilarious. Overall, the movie was very funny and of course, Mark Wahlberg is always great.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|If you like horror and you haven't seen this show you gotta watch it. All the actors are wonderful and the story line will make you wish they played episodes back to back. I bought the first season and will buy this one too when it is released. I still have the entire 2nd season on my DVR. Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Sarah Paulson, Zachary Quinto and James Cromwell as the evil Dr. Arden are all very entertaining and talented. They play their parts well. Also you can expect to hear some great music on the show. The themes I recognized included music originally used on Carrie and the CandyMan movies. Also the episode with the Name Game song was really good. I hear the 3rd season which should start sometime this Oct. will star the amazing Kathy Bates. I heard it may also be about witches. As you can see I highly recommend the show. It isn't over the top gore and even the somewhat uncomfortable moments are so enticing they're hard to ignore. I like shows like Teen Wolf but that is more of a drama to me than a horror show. This is the horror show TV has been missing.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! It has a twist at the end that I didn't see coming! Overall, I loved the movie! And, of course, Jennifer Lawrence is great!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast can do almost any media. I admit, you do need a decent wifi connection, but given this, get ready to enjoy all your media consumption at the touch of a button...it's even easier than a remote!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie was great. I loved the story of the daughter and the father reconnecting. It was great and the ending was fabulous! I recommend this movie to my friends all the time :)
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughters birthday.  She had it on her list as was thrilled to receive it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very Compelling and each story connected to the next. It was like reading a history time line. I love zombie movies and I only wish that the movie would've taken a few stories from the book.
B000683VI4|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughters birthday.  I love the movie and was happy to be able to go online and purchase it for her.
038533348X|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut liked to say that he wasn't a science fiction writer.  Don't believe him.  Cat's Cradle is a brilliant bit of science fiction that does what all good science fiction does: starts with a \\"what if\\" (in this case, the existence of Ice 9) and explores the resulting world.  His characters are at once insane, fantastic, and recognizable, and what happens to them is a delightful combination of nail-biting and laugh out loud hilarious.  I highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game it is easy to use and I play it almost everyday. Recommend to anyone. I Play this game more than any other
B001KX50BK|5.0|Bought this for my bride of 42 years.  She loves it.  Always fun to watch it with her.  Most women I know really love this movie, and it is great in Blu-ray.

B007XIC1GI|3.0|I like MMs music, but during the phase of his life, some of his stuff was over the top even for me. But I guess some have to push the edge so we can find out...ahhh man, it was ok.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|As with all of Nicholas Sparks' books, it is hard for me to put them down until I am finished.  This is a great love story.  It is not only a story of love, but a story of loss, also.  I read the book before watching the movie which is also well done.  I definitely recommend reading the book since movies always leave things out.  I will read it again someday.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|ACADEMIC QUALITY !!! A VERY thoughtful NON-Fictional treatise on the historical Jesus (if not the &#34;Christ&#34;) as placed withing the ancient Jewish community. Reads and flows as a novel - packed with historical perspective, source references, and excellent end notes.

1607744104|5.0|I ordered this book a month ago, and it's already starting to get dog-eared in places.  Simply overflowing with fascinating information and remarkable photographs that do exceptional justice to information regarding the husbandry of such a diverse group of plants.  The first edition was good, this edition still improves on what was already one of the most valuable books on the subject.  Cannot recommend enough to someone who is interested in carnivorous plants from a scholarly perspective, or someone who wants to dive on into the hobby and start growing.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|decent shoot em up movie. There were many cameos that were amusing but added little to story line which is pretty thin to begin with
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  I hope the series never ends.  I watch the season over and over again.  It is wonderful to watch quality TV.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|In not religious myself, but I enjoy learning about them. This book was thought provoking and a fun read, but perhaps most importantly for me, was the fact that it actually tried to uncover the man behind the myth as it were.<br />I am thinking about looking into more of Mr. Aslan's books.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|Good drama that the kids can watch.  I love time period pieces as well.  Worth checking out and the best part is its free to prime members.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I love this movie! It is cute and hasn't really been done before. A baby blue macaw (Blue) gets separated from his family as they all get loaded into crates. Poachers snatch a bunch of wild birds from the amazon. Blue falls out of the truck in snowy Minnesota and is found by a little girl.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|It's a dark book at times. But often very relatable. Hold on till the end, you will be surprised!  Enjoy.

B002YCVX5S|2.0|I love violent and gore but this wasn't even funny. I thought the plot was stupid and the gore was just too inhumane. I'm not usually this harsh on movies but I couldn't even finish it. I guess my expectations were too high.
1452126607|5.0|The captions are great....very funny!  The punch lines are short and to the point.  This calendar is better than Maxine.
1400052181|2.0|I'm not a big fan of reading about people's vaginas getting cut out and hearing about how much they bled, but I guess some important ethical issues are raised. I couldn't help feeling like this was yet another &#34;white people should feel guilty about slavery&#34; type deal. I don't know. Buy it if you want to, I really don't care either way.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|Read this series, you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />A dystopian novel at its best! I loved this book! Love is everything
B004LX0D36|2.0|Was it correct at the time this book was written to use the word \\"farther\\" rather than \\"further\\" when not referring to distance?  At that time was it proper to say \\"every body\\" when today we would say \\"everybody\\"?  I don't know whether these things are in every version of the book or only in the Kindle version  I read.<br /><br />  Who am I to criticize a classic written by such a famous author?  However, if Jane had submitted this book to me, and I had been her teacher, I would have advised her to rewrite her rambling sentences.  I had to read many sentences over again to understand what she was trying to say. When she mentioned more than one person in the sentence and when the sentence went on and on, it was not clear to me which person she meant to be the subject of the action or the thought.<br /><br />  When the author switched names from Elinor to Miss Dashwood, I found that confusing.  There were many characters to remember, and I found it tedious to remember them all.<br /><br />  The opening sentences each time when the author wrote about Lucy Steele seemed no different than those about other characters.  Then, suddenly the author would interject some poor grammar as if she had just remembered that she had told the readers that Lucy was uneducated.<br /><br />  Perhaps it was just the way things were at the time the book was written, but I really disliked reading about people whose main interest in others was how much money they would get from their parents.  That amount defined the person's total worth to others, it seemed.  As for Marianne, though, her beauty was her ticket to success.<br /><br />  None of the characters seemed to be ashamed of not doing any work. As long as they were going to get money from their parents, including enough to have a few servants, nobody seemed to feel a need to work.<br /><br />  If the characters had done some work, perhaps they would have overcome their disappointments in life sooner.  All of the characters seemed verylazy to me, and I found it hard to believe that any of them would be welcome guests in the homes of others.<br /><br />  The best thing about this book was the illustrations.  They were delightful.

B00AFQC4QC|4.0|History of the twentieth century was one of my major areas of study in college. However, the history I studied presented an ethnocentric view of World War II. Of course, I know about Hitler's rise to power, and the major steps he took in Europe prior to our entry into the war. I understood the political and social ramifications. I understood the uneasy alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. But I only knew of these histories from the perspective of the first, isolationist United States, and then, as the full-speed ahead entry into the war heroes who saved the world from the evil Axis powers.<br /><br />Reading Christoph Fischer's The Luck of the Weissensteiners presented another view of that period through the camera lens of people living in Eastern Europe. The book shows people from all the different perspectives before, during, and after the war. It's an eye-opening read to learn that the United States wasn't the center of this war. In the lives of these ordinary folks, the United States played an almost peripheral role.<br /><br />The Luck of the Weissensteiners exposes how the Eastern Europeans reacted with a wide range of attitudes and actions as the war tore apart families and friends and allowed no trust to exist in all the varied relationships. There may have been a world war taking place on the larger stage, but for the characters in Fischer's novel, it is a civil war being fought, and the lines are blurred and often changing, depending on who's in charge.<br /><br />Jews and Gentiles fall in love and marry, which creates a problem when Hitler's master plan begins to take effect, even in countries where he's not invaded. . .yet. The propaganda used to smear the very genes of Jews causes one husband to question the moral integrity of his wife. He buys the line of inherently weak genes so much he even takes their son away - a son who is Aryan in looks, leaving behind his Jewish wife and their unborn child. The atmosphere of fear changes people, oftentimes not for the better.<br /><br /> Through it, all one family stands strong.<br /><br />This book's retelling of the history of this period in Europe is personalized through the characters that represent a cross section of the lives impacted by the atrocities of war. Jews, Gentiles, Germans, Slovakians, lesbians, and traitors all point to one direction. War never makes much sense when the individual lives of its victims are examined. Neither side wins when people are persecuted for their religion, political beliefs, nationality, or sexual orientations.<br /><br />It's a sad commentary on the human condition when a people are forced to hide their identities behind forged passports and then forced to throw away the forgeries to appease the winning side. When it comes down to it in the aftermath of the war and the liberation of Europe, all individuals are suspect, and mankind is taken down a notch.<br /><br />Christoph Fischer has written an important book for its historical perspective. He personified the vagaries of war through the fictional characters. At times, it reads like a history book, but before it bogs down into a lesson in civics, he comes back to the individuals experiencing the actual effects of the persecution.<br /><br />As always, we study and examine the past so we don't forget it. As long as genocide exists in the world, we must do as Fischer has done in his novel - remind us, and remind us again, that our faith, our color, our language, and our life choices should matter not a wit. In the end, it's our integrity and how we treat others that matters the most.<br /><br />Thank you, Christoph, for writing this important book to remind us never to repeat the mistakes of the past.for the better.<br /><br /> Through it, all one family stands strong.<br /><br />This book's retelling of the history of this period in Europe is personalized through the characters that represent a cross section of the lives impacted by the atrocities of war.

0525952926|5.0|This is the best book of all of Folletts that I have ever read.  Following the stories of 3 families, there are many insights in the lives of people you knew in the first book.  Some of the story takes place in the USA, other parts are in Russia, Germany and Poland.  The story follows the lives of several families and keeps you turning the pages. There was so much detail that did not get a lot of attention during WWII.  I hated to see it finish.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I purchased this Mahjong game for use with my Kindle Fire. I am not sure if it is an issue with the game itself or the sensitivity of the Kindle Fire touch screen but the tiles do not consistently recognize that they have been touched. The game is time sensitive so the delay in the tile response increases the time that it takes to play. On the plus side, there are many variations of the game to play. The inscriptions on the tiles are easily recognized.

B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I am not your average A7X fan, until a few years ago I had not even heard of them. Then one day, visiting the grandchildren I was asked to play a \\"rock band\\" type of game, since my ability with instruments was little I was handed the microphone. My introduction too A7X was \\"Afterlife\\"....I was hooked. I have listened too and enjoyed most of their material. I make a habit of listening to the entire album, niot just the \\"hits\\"....and with new albums I find it almost mandatory to give it three listens before I make a decision.....The first time I heard \\"Hali to the King\\" (single) I really didn't care for it, now I really enjoy it.  On my first go around with the entire album I was somewhat displeased. My second time around I grew to like it, on my third go around I am a fan. As a 54 year old, classic rock fan, I highly endorse this album.<br /><br />Edit  10/4/2013<br /><br />After listening to this cd multiple times I have come too really like a couple of the \\"ballards\\" Crimson Day and Acid Rain are stand outs......

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I have been a hard core Bob Dylan fan ever since I belatedly discovered his music during the television broadcast of the concert film \\"Hard Rain,\\" when I was a freshman at Oberlin in the fall of 1976. (At Oberlin, at that time, Dylan was one of the two most-requested artists on the campus radio station; Joan Baez was the other.) As a serious fan, I have owned multiple copies of every Dylan album on various formats over the intervening decades, and have seen the man himself in concert many times, so Dylan's music has been a large part of the fabric of my life. I hailed the appearance of first volumes of the \\"Bootleg Series\\" in 1997 as a chance to finally own \\"legitimate\\" versions, with improved sound quality, of songs I first heard on vinyl bootleg albums I bought from a basement record store in Greenwich Village in the late 1970s. However welcome they were at the time of their release, though, previous volumes of the series have provided little more than fascinating glimpses into the artist's creative process, much in the manner of the \\"Beatles Anthology\\" discs, wherein we belatedly learned that even Lennon and McCartney were not infallible. I approached Dylan's \\"Another Self Portrait\\" cautiously, especially in view of the fact that I am among the legions of fans who, notwithstanding their overall admiration for Dylan, were unimpressed by the original 1970 release, which did have some good tracks, but which was, on the whole, chaotic and unfocused. Imagine my delight, then, when I discovered \\"Another Self Portrait,\\" a genuine, if long-neglected, masterpiece which far surpasses the vastly inferior album released in its stead more than forty years ago. What Dylan was thinking when he passed over this consistently splendid material in compiling the original release, I can't begin to imagine. \\"Another Self Portrait\\" is the album that ought to have followed \\"Nashville Skyline;\\" had it done so, Dylan's star would never have waned. I will not trouble you here with a track-by-track analysis, as others have done; suffice it to say that I--genuinely--loved them all. I will leave you with this thought, however. More than any other release to date in \\"The Bootleg Series,\\" \\"Another Self Portrait\\" is an album I will actually listen to, again and again, in the coming years. Far more than an interesting historical document, ASP is a collection of vibrant, beautiful music, fully realized, which will bring lasting pleasure to Dylan's many fans, and perhaps even win over a few of the not-yet-converted. From the first chord to the last, the entire set is a treat.by-track analysis, as others have done; suffice it to say that I--genuinely--loved them all. I will leave you with this thought, however.

B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|This is a book like no other I have read in that it taps into something wonderful, dark and primal and managed to transport me back to both the magic and terror of childhood, a time of possibilities and when dreams and nightmares really did come true.<br /><br />Finding himself back at his childhood home after attending a funeral, a middle-aged man (who is never named) recalls events that happened during his childhood - how the peace and joy of his life on the farmstead was shattered when a visitor to his house commits suicide in the family car. This act releases a darkness that threatens the young boy and his family, a darkness that his mother, father and sister seem unable or unwilling to see let alone confront. Only the bravery and chthonic magic of the girl down the road, the amazing Lettie Hempstock, who has a pond that is an ocean in her backyard and all sorts of other wondrous things, and her mother and grandmother understand and have the wherewithal to aid the boy in what becomes a life and death struggle to defeat the all-consuming and seductive powers of the darkness.<br /><br />Like the man remembering his childhood, the reader is transported back to ours. As the boy battles his own and some very real demons, so too we revisit and vanquish (if we're lucky!) those that haunted our youth. What I loved about this book (and Gaiman's work overall) is that nothing is cliched or expected. Furthermore, it's what's not described, but in the spaces between the words, the absences on the page and into which the reader's imagination slips (or tumbles), that so much happens. Gaiman respects the power of our imaginations to take the story into places other writers would not dare. Thus, we fill in the gaps and the powerful but ofttimes partial descriptions with our own menacing ones. This makes the book at once eerie, wild and disturbing. Sometimes, the words and scenes howled through my mind, making we shiver and look over my shoulder. Other times, I felt warmed by itsmagical embrace and found great comfort - as if a blanket had been flung over my shoulders and a cup of something hot, sweet and strong had been placed in my hands.<br /><br />There is something restorative and meaningful in peeling back the layers, in being reminded of the power of stories, of imagination, of being anchored once more to a time that while a part of us all, rarely gets dusted off and re-examined, though our childhood is what shapes us. We tend to relegate it to the attic of our minds. Stories like Gaiman's reinstate childhood and the terrifying and wondrous interpretations children use to negotiate reality in all its great and scary glory.<br /><br />Finishing the book is like awakening from a dream and I couldn't help but grieve as I felt that the funeral the man was attending wasn't only for a lost beloved, but a lost self. That we outgrow (or choose to ignore) the capacity to see and relate to the world through the eyes of our childhood selves is surely something that deserves mourning.<br /><br />Astonishing modern fable that vividly recaptures the beauty and dread of dreams and childhood imaginings.

B00CCX9DUG|4.0|The latest Philippa Gregory book, The White Princess, is the fifth in her “Cousins War” series and follows the fortunes of Elizabeth of York after Richard III, her lover, has been killed and Henry VII (father of King Henry VIII) has ascended the throne. Forced to marry Henry and prove her family’s loyalty to the new dynasty, Elizabeth struggles with what’s required of her. Comparing her husband to Richard, she finds him wanting – and with reason.<br />As the first of the Tudors and a foreigner in all but name, Henry has to prove himself worthy of the crown – in terms of his leadership but also his blood. There are those loyal to the House of York who perceive him as a usurper and for the duration of his reign, plot to overthrow him. Claimants in the form of the princes in the tower (Edward and Richard – Elizabeth’s younger brothers who disappeared, believed murdered by Richard III) crop up everywhere – particularly Richard - and folk rally to their side. Scotland, Ireland, France – all collude to overthrow the king. Thus, Henry, raised abroad and under the thumb of his ambitious mother, Margaret Beaufort, sees threats and enemies everywhere, including in the shape of his beautiful wife, who is also the heart of the York clan. This affects not only his relationship with his wife and children, but with his court and people.<br />Covering at least a dozen years of Henry’s reign and Elizabeth’s marriage to him, I found Gregory’s interpretation of Henry’s insecurity and the possible reappearance of Prince Richard, the Duke of York, interesting. Told from the first person point of view of Elizabeth, you get the sense of strong female bonds, of what women were forced to endure and how often they had to bite their tongue or compromise their morals for their own sake and that of those they love and seek to protect. Elizabeth lacks her mother’s fire (perhaps she observed and learned), but does retain an inner strength in Gregory’s rendition. Though, there were many times you wanted to slap her. How she could love a man like Henry – selfish, needy, paranoid and a “mummy’s boy” beggars belief – especially in the way he is represented in this novel.<br />That was the least attractive aspect of this book – the portrayal of Henry. He had no redeeming qualities whatsoever – insightless, fickle, demanding – a complete arse, actually.<br />Nonetheless, Gregory does have a compelling writing style and even when you’re most fed up with characters and the repetition of phrases and ideas continues (occasionally too much and this is a flaw in the book), you are drawn into this world of religion, politics and royalty, and the burgeoning romance at its centre, and it’s Elizabeth who takes you with her on a journey into the privy rooms, court and bedrooms of the greatest in the land. The words unfold, poetic at times, sharp at others, and yes, repetitive too, but Elizabeth’s world and the pressures under which she must operate and find her place are well drawn.<br />I didn’t enjoy this book as much as I have some of the others and that’s because there was a sense in which Gregory kept telling the same story over and over, emphasising the same characteristics and foibles and concerns of the main individuals as well. There wasn’t so much character growth in this novel as diminishment. That being the case, it was hard to invest in them. Knowing the history and the conclusions to the story of great historical figures does not take away from the reading pleasure of historical fiction, on the contrary, it can enhance it as you seek to uncover how the author reads the times and people involved, the hues in which she paints them. Whereas Gregory has been unsurpassed with some of her books, in this one, she is – perhaps aptly - too black and white – thus the White Princess fades into a snowy backdrop that, ultimately, disappoints more than it gratifies.<br />Nonetheless, I did mostly enjoy the bookand will look forward to the conclusion.<br />Rated 3.5 out of 5.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This film is fantastic in the way that Leonardo DiCaprio plays such a great, mysterious Gatsby.  Follow the story as narrated by Nick (Tobey Maquire)as he follows Gatsby along for the ride.  This story is about love, mystery, struggle, and life.  Such a fantastic journey.
0374533571|3.0|Sidenote: I watched the movie prior to listening to this book and I have to say I was confused by the casting choices when I watched the film and am now even more confused.<br /><br />There are parts of this book that I really like. For example I love that Pat is going through the entirity of Nikki's reading list and I love his commentary on the books he reads. It was fantastic to read commentary that so many people think but are too afraid to vocalize.<br /><br />I also love unreliable narrators who are completely out of touch with reality. Pat is most definitely an unreliable narrator but he is so entertaining that you can't help but find his delusion slightly charming.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of the AHHHH E-A-G-L-E-S or the consistent dropping of the f-bomb. I also found myself to be fairly bored with the plot. If you read this go into it expecting to be charmed by the narration but slightly bored by the plot.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Wonderful game, somewhat difficult at times to know what you are doing be patient though you will get it. Still waiting for the underground on level 21 I think I should get it by now. We will see
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was interesting and kept me engaged but too often, I felt lost ....  Like &#34;who are we talking about now?&#34; He seemed to skip around or skip forward and it left me confused and a little frustrated.  I liked his other two books much more!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I was hooked the moment I tried this game out wonderful addition to the previous temple run games, great job Imangi!
1936608898|5.0|This book was amazing, informative, and full of facts that should be common sense to all of us. I would recommend every American pick up a copy of this book and take a good look at yourself and what you are eating. Our culture is one of the worst for garbage foods that fill us but don't fuel us and give us so many diseases and health problems. That's truly where we need to start.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Oh man this film was great zombies,awesome relationships,story and hot chicks like omega hot checks lol. Just sweet tottaly reccomend to any anime fan that likes zombies and hot chicks oh yah!
1416955070|1.0|This book is a complete waste of time. Even considering the rather interesting overall storyline, if I could give this book a minus-star, I would. Overall, the storyline, although very similar to the Harry Potter universe, is interesting enough, but that does not make up for the flaws of the book.<br /><br />The events supposed to act as \\"twists\\" are incredibly predictable. The main characters are incredibly unpredictable, at first, due to the fact that they act nothing like the way the author describes them. After a while, it becomes evident that the author has an idea of where a characters storyline is heading, and will simply go for that idea, disregarding previous descriptions, events and anything that might stand in the way. Not only do the characters actions feel forced, but the dialogue as well. The characters feel more like they are writing to each other, rather than speaking.<br /><br />In addition to this, the actions of the main characters made me hate every single one of them. They become angry for simply no reason. Clarys inner dialogue comments on her own body and how much she dislikes it seemingly without prompt. She sometimes slaps people without prompt. There is no explanation as to why Clary finds herself enamoured by Jace, as he is pigheaded, arrogant and often times very mean to Clarys very best friend. There is literally not one single aspect of Jace's being which would lead to Clary falling for him.<br /><br />Every single female character in this book is described as slender, thin or skinny. With big boobs and nice ass, of course. The main character, although slender, thin and skinny, lacks big boobs and nice ass, and spends some time every few chapters with bemoaning this fact.<br /><br />I have not even mentioned the enormous plotholes riddling the book. I am not talking about a weapon appearing mysteriously in someones pocket, but rather, large, enormous plotholes, on which the book heavily relies.<br /><br />This book is amateur, at best.As it is directed toward girls in their lower teens, I would recommend reading almost ANY other book directed toward teenage girls. This book promotes girls standing around waiting to be saved by a white knight, and promotes destructive body image ideals. Read this book on your own risk.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|The actress playing all the &#34;orphans&#34;  is just the main reason to watch this show.  Her ability to move from one character to another and actually have the viewer develop empathy for each is astounding to watch.<br />There are a few holy cow moments that will catch you by surprise.  I don't want to give away too many details on this show as it must be watched and enjoyed for the high production values and characters.  Sit back and go along for the ride.  Crazy!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  This is the story of a very smart boy and his mother who are dealing with the terrible grief of losing his father, her husband who was trapped and died in one of the towers on 9/11.  The story is inspired and so well acted.  I mean, what's not to like about Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks?  I must warn you, this movie makes me cry EVERY time I watch it but it is oh so worth it.  Buy it--you won't be sorry.  I guarantee it!
B005G5PPGS|3.0|Great start that gets the reader engaged. Stop 2/3 through and you will have  had a good read. Wraps up with little purpose. Could have  been really good -
B001HN6918|5.0|I ordered a new copy of Kung Fu Panda 2 from WELOVEBOOKS123.  I noticed the new price was close to the used price so I decided to buy new.  The seller sent me a copy that was so obviously worn, scratched, used, and had finger prints all over it and smudges, and the title was worn off the disk!  It wasn't even a good condition used copy!  Someone had put a shrink wrap on it trying to make it look new!  Immediately upon opening it was obvious there was a very beat up used copy in the case.<br /><br />However, I wrote the company through Amazon regarding the problem, and they got back to me very quickly via email, and told me that they buy movies wholesale and this must have been a bad apple that they themselves unknowingly purchased.  They didn't have another copy to send me but they IMMEDIATELY issued a complete refund of the DVD AND shipping to my credit card, and said I could keep the DVD and they did not want me to send it back.  So, although it started out bad, this company really pulled through with their impressive customer service and I would feel safe purchasing from them in the future knowing that they will immediately address any problems I have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game keeps me busy...it helped me quit smoking mind and hand busy..  I suggest everyone plays this not to young not to old to play!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|First saw this in the theatre and was expecting a decent sic-fi movie, but instead much better than I thought. This move was great, really enjoyed it and had to own it. Plus the soundtrack by M83 is absolutely stunning!!!
B00CAKCS9O|4.0|One of my favorite flicks of all time! Kate and john have true chemistry ! You have to own this movie and watch it over and over!

B008QDCZ3S|5.0|This is by far the finest recording of this CD I have found.SACD shows the depth and width  of this recording. I loved the last LP of Time Out. But this puts that analog record to shame. Buy it Now!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got this for my kindle and literally could NOT put it down. My favorite out of the series so far!
B009POHHPS|5.0|I enjoy seeing familiar DC characters in alternate story lines and settings. A very good and intense reading experience. I would recommend this to any comics fan!
B00CFA225Y|3.0|3d wasn't what i expected it to be, and did not meet up with some of the reviews.It still was worth watching But a little too<br />violent for my 4 and 5 yr. old grand children.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I've had a copy of this music in all of it's incarnations except CD until recently.  When I finally bought this CD, I thought to myself &#34;why did I wait so long&#34;?  This is terrific music with a story to tell.  I guess now I'm going to have to get the DVD of the movie because that was great also.  I really enjoy all of Pink Floyd's music but this particular album resonates with me because I've read a lot about World War 11 and this album puts you right in the bull's eye of how that war affected the young people of Britain.  It's timeless.  Listen and learn.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Hi solo I thought this book was a totally awesome idea in fact the whole idea of demigods in the first place was brilliant! I am a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series and Greek mythology in general and I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment of reading these amazing books thanks to Rick Riodan! :)
B0083SBMBM|4.0|The best action movie of 2013..Joss whedon has put all the elements for a fun action movie together.great action&special effects,fairly good dialogue mixed with snappy humor,and a great cast..no wonder you still can't get this movie cheap,new or used..

B00DGMVJAO|1.0|People being eaten is not something to watch. Even while you do not know them and that they are actors does not diminish the violence.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Joe does it again. I love this CD. Joe is one of those Artist you can just grove to at any age.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This film was interesting because Tom Cruise was the actor. But take away that and the story is old and not freshly told.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game I love it. is so much fun I like to see the difrent. Places. Like Rome and pairs
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|See after a cup of coffee and feel the rush. Eckhart is an engaging actor even when he is just picking up the paycheck
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Overall I like this series, but as time goes on, it has taken on the air of a soap opera.  The emotional highs are too high and the lows too low.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Real or caricature, Diesel is the &#34;diesel&#34;. This actor knows how to have fun with a role facing menace with humor and bravado.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|My Mom loves this cover. It`s bright and very nicely made. Looks expensive. I bought hers used, but it was as good or better than new.

B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Funny, but I have read alot of these books and this one isn't as good as the other. It is still funny though.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Wife and I are totally hooked on the series and will continue to watch.....love the convenience of amazon on the playstation 3

B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app its easy to use and u just text nothing else. only thing is that it doesn't work on kindle fire and I really want it to. hope it does!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great game and all but it is so so so so so far away from the PC mac. I think they should make it right behind the pc mac version .
B0000062FJ|5.0|What a classic !  Must have played it on cassette hundreds of times over the years but the crystal clear quality of the CD is unmatchable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game me and my daughters play all the time its the cutest funniest and not boring game ive seen and its amazing cause its a mix of my other two games subway surfers and temple run....plus i loved the movie so i deff love the game
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child never disappoints. His stories are fast moving, violent, and sprinkled with just the right amount of mordant humor.The challenge for Child now is how to keep the character fresh and the plots fresher. Reacher is getting older and starting to show it. Child no longer depicts him as even close to good looking, Years on the road and the abuse his body receives from his adventures are starting to show. Reacher's troubles start when he accepts a ride from a carload of strangers, and things go downhill for him from there. As always, Reacher chooses to deal out some unconventional justice (read: vengeance) and finds it comes with a high price to pay. &#34;A Wanted Man&#34; is another satisfying entry in the Reacher saga, yet leaves you hungry for more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is soo fun to play!! Have always loved the movie and now get to play the game!! My 7 year old daughter loves to play it also even though it's a little harder for her!! Is very addicting!!
B008602KQI|4.0|This is novel concept. Lawrence's action is great. The depiction of the movie is superb. Though the concept is novel, it is sickening to see young people put one against other. But, I know history is replete with more horrific things like holocaust which was more inhuman and sickening.
B006C45LHA|3.0|Daniel Craig is very exciting to watch I don't think it would have been a well liked movie without him.  I have a love of Harrison Ford but I feel the native American who was one of his cattle hands and his death scene, really made Fords character shine.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini grasps the marrow of the human experience in a series of short stories that intertwine. Powerfully written and beautifully crafted.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|It's amazing that \\"The Walking Dead\\" didn't become a zombie with all the creative turn over in the last three years. The fact that it is continuing to roll out exceptional episodes is a credit to the creative crew and cast (including creator and co-producer Robert Kirkman). The third season is no exceptional with some startling developments for Rick and the other survivors. Having watched the show on AMC, I'm going to focus more on the quality of the Blu-ray rather than discuss (in detail) the changes in the plot for the third season. There is a brief synopsis below and there are some some minor spoilers in that paragraph.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Rick (Andrew Lincoln) loses it during the third season of \\"The Walking Dead\\" and the group isn't quite sure what to do with him. The group have found a \\"home\\"--a prison that, while it provides security, has its own challenges. The third season features a number of stunning changes including personal losses for a number of characters in the show. We also get to meet the Governor (David Morrisey) and long time fan favorite from the comics Michonne (Danal Gurira).<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks spectacular with a sharp, detailed and crisp transfer that stays true to the grainy look of the series. Audio continues to remain a strong suit as well with an active, strong 7.1 TrueHD presentation. There is also a French Dolby surround track. Subtitles are provided in English and Spanish but, curiously, there is no Spanish language track.<br /><br />The special features continue to remain top notch with eight featurettes. I haven't had the opportunity to view them all yet but they provide interesting observations and character background from cast and crew.<br /><br />Audio commentaries appear on the fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth and 15th episodes. I haven't had the opportunity to work through them all yet but the two that I did listen to were informative providing interesting background on the respective episodes (four and five).<br /><br />Finally the special features are rounded out with six deleted scenes.<br /><br />As with previous seasons the show is housed in a Blu-ray plastic case. There isn't any insert with information about each episode and special features on each disc but they are mentioned in the onscreen menu.<br /><br />The third season of \\"The Walking Dead\\" continued to provide life threatening challenges for our heroes and introduced two major characters that are pivotal to this season and the changes that occur. The presentation for the show on Blu-ray is terrific.<br /><br />Highly recommendedive episodes (four and five).<br /><br />Finally the special features are rounded out with six deleted scenes.<br /><br />As with previous seasons the show is housed in a Blu-ray plastic case. There isn't any insert with information about each episode and special features on each disc but they are mentioned in the onscreen menu.<br /><br />The third season of \\"The Walking Dead\\" continued to provide life threatening challenges for our heroes and introduced two major characters that are pivotal to this season and the changes that occur.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|colors are vibrant and do very well on my vizio blu-ray player just wish i could manage to make it full screen on the 55 inch vizio screen.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|This is my baby boy's favorite toy. We got it for him at around 2 months and at 4 months he still loves it. He loves to look it in the eyes and talk to it and of course gaze at himself in the mirror. He's recently started sucking on the red teether as well. Great toy!
0330533444|5.0|Its a great mix of human experiences, scientific history and current scientific research and controversy. Book was in great shape.<br /><br />Definitely read it. The scientific research did not make up the whole book and was explained very well.
0425266060|5.0|Most of these adult erotic romance novels are just for women, but this page turner will set anyone of any sex on their rear-literally!
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|It was FREE but hardly worth the effort to download it to my Kindle.  Unless you simply want an overview, don't download it.  It's OK for general knowledge.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I give it five stars<br />I loved I think everyone will love it<br />I can't wait for more book s from her
B0081L37Z0|4.0|I saw trailers for this and didn't plan on seeing it, however after some recommendations from friends I gave it a watch. Turns out it Channing Tatum is a funny man and I ended up enjoying the film.  I now find myself often linking gifs to friends from this movie.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Easy to see why Curtis Mayfield ranks amongst some of the greatest musicians of that era.<br /><br />These are some seriously good, seriously deep tracks.<br /><br />Well worth the money.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|I liked reading most of it, but it was only barely better than &#34;meh.&#34;<br /><br />Pros:<br />-James has a very strong writing voice. I've read several of James Altucher's blog and long-form facebook posts but this is the first of his books that I've read and now I feel like I know him.<br /><br />-His advice to an allegedly suicidal reader, and the readers of the book, is solid advice. We should worry about foundational health before things in the external world. That includes taking care of our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual condition. It should be practiced daily.<br /><br />-He talks a lot about rejection from a real, believable perspective. Many books spend very little time on this topic.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-This was clearly written in a hurry and did not get a ton of thought. It reads like several blog posts put together.<br /><br />-He never defines what he means by &#34;spiritual.&#34;<br /><br />-He gives half-assed, barely researched arguments on the financial crisis, then later advises readers not to give opinions on complex or political issues and admits he knows nothing about them.<br /><br />-His writing style gets really annoying at times.<br />Ex.: &#34;The good news is that there are 250 million people in this country. Maybe more. I forget.&#34; (p. 88).<br />It's unprofessional, sloppy, and irritating. When I read that I had to ask myself &#34;Why am I bothering to read this if you didn't bother to use google and look it up?&#34;
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I don't like this new version at all. Your getting all these negative reviews on it, so change It back......PLEASE........NOW!!!!!!!!
B003M6FGTE|3.0|I watched it is about all I can say.  I loved all the music until it became overtly formulaic, therefore boring..
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Never heard of this band before till a friend was playing one of her songs on his laptop and I asked who that was and he said Halestorm, I love her voice and she just plain kicks ass. Cd came in great condition.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app is very dangerous and if you have children at home that are online with tablets or any other wireless devices make sure that they don't have this app.<br /><br />This app allows anyone to text to anyone else who have this app.<br />-when I say anyone I mean even if you don't know the person or the person doesn't know you they can interact with you, your children, or anyone who even has gotten the app.<br /><br />There have been countless people who have found out the hard way that this is just down right dangerous to have anywhere near a device.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|This is the album that I got into when I was in the army, I lost that copy and I forgot how much I loved this cd.  This cd rocks and it came very quickly and in very good condition.

B000OCXFCO|4.0|I haven't been a fan of Megadeth very long I first got into the band back in my army days, my roommate played way to much Metallica and I wanted something heavy but not Metallica. I discovered Megadeth. One of the best finds for me, been a fan ever since. This cd is cool I liked the song with Christina Scabbia .Cd came quickly and in good condition.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is an amazingly interesting game that everyone will be able to get into easily and will definitely enjoy it.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|This is the first in many Pink Floyd cd's I plan on getting in the next few months, this cd was in awesome condition, and it came way quicker than I thought it would. So very pleased with my purchase.
0446555002|1.0|I enjoyed all the Preston & Child books. With Pendergast they did stretch credibility with what he could do, but we let it go with a wink and a nod, because the story was so good. With Two Graves the authors have turned Pendergast into a written comic book action hero. Look! Up in the sky! Its a bird! Its a plane! Its Super Agent Pendergast! Able to survive all kinds of physical assaults on his person while continuing on at light speed! The base story is ridiculous in the extreme and the other sub-stories are irrelevant. They should have made a third grave and buried this manuscript in it  with a wooden stake through it! If I even read the next one I will get it from the library rather than spend good money on it.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Good story, characters, great adder of the hearing impaired brother and the supportive relationship between the siblings but was spoiled by the explicit, graphic sex.  The general tenor of the book was spoiled by it.  I am hesitant to get more Pride stories because of it.  Too bad....
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|A great, compact mystery crime drama.  Was highly reviewed by the critics and lived up to the expectations.  Can't wait for another season!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|These worked great with Samsung S3. These are very durable. Far more sturdy vs a simple sticker. I would buy these again any day.
B001QJUX24|5.0|very good movie and John Wayne is a great actor I would advise everyone to watch this movie as it is excellent
1452126577|5.0|This is the perfect book to teach you the fine art of being grumpy. It has numerous photos all captioned with a sassy attitude. There are puzzles to make your day more grumpy.After reading the book I applied what I'd learned and developed the prefect grumpy mood. If your a happy person and you want to learn the fine art of grumpiness then this book is the answer to your prayers.
B00005NTNU|5.0|This box set is a great addition to my collection, the movies themselves reflect the time period they were made and were a blast to watch. The picture quality of this set was good and the packaging great - each DVD is packages in its own case. This is a worthy collection to anyone's movie library, it really will &#34;make your day!&#34;
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a great read.  The word flow moves along with a realistic,quickly moving plot  that keeps the reader in suspense.  The prison scenes make you sweat awaiting the next problem to be encountered.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I did not see this show when it aired on TV, lots of people told me how good it was but by then it was in about season 4. I rarely start watching a show unless I get into it at season 1. I bought the seasons and am now enjoying this show tremendously, it is as good as people claim. I have to admit I sometimes do not have a clue what they are talking about, but then if I did I guess I would be a doctor myself!<br /><br />As a side note, it is pleasing to see Hugh Laurie (a fellow Brit) showcasing his acting skills here.
0395389496|5.0|I bought this book because I do a unit on The Polar Express at Christmas time in my first grade classroom. My book was lost last year so I ordered a new one. Pleasantly surprised that the book included a recording, an ornament and was a signed copy!
B003U51D58|4.0|I liked the series, but the end did not provide any answers. Still as mysterious as ever... but worth the watch.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great App! Helps keep me organized. I'm big on making lists and taking notes, and writing my thoughts and reflections as they occur, this app made it so easy to keep all those things at my finger tips!
B002VECM6S|5.0|My son started football and he has a lot of characteristics that Michael did.  He was about to relate his first year of football with the movie.  His love for the game grew overnight.
B005544V6A|4.0|I was happy to watch the series to catch up.  I found it on Prime, and it wasn't available on Netflix
B00338QENI|5.0|This book spoke to many sides of me. As a microbiologist I loved the details and history of culturing cell lines and tissue research. I was made grateful for the advances that have come in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. As a black woman I am beyond grateful that I don't live in a segregated world where proper and equal healthcare were almost unheard of. I loved getting a peek in the brief life of Henrietta and her family history. Although there was so much sadness in the lives of the children she left behind it was good to see the process of how they eventually made peace with. The book posed so many ethical questions that I am still pondering. I'm glad I read it and would highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Could be operator error. I can't seem to get this to load at all. I have 2 other solitaire games so doesn't matter. It was free so what do I have to complain about?
B007URVZJ6|4.0|It teaches you how to write a book for Kindle in a good and easy way. I read through it but I haven't tried it out yet, but I definitely will soon. It is definitely a try especially since it is free. You can't go wrong with free.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are so many different types of games and anyone can play. there are different types of games. My personal favorite is the dart game. you should try every game. it is very fun but addicting
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game because it ceaps me entertain because the dinosaurs look so real and it has a hole bunch of detail!!!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game A LOT and I only got it yesterday! I'm really addicted to it and it helps me get thinking when my brain isn't working! My point is, get the app it is totally, completely, WORTH IT!!!
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|Some pieces are hard to put in but overall this set is great. Even though it costs so much you should get it.<br />-Max (6 year old Lego Expert)
B009MO5ES8|5.0|Movie was in great condition! And the movie itself was pretty amazing! I've been wanting to see it for a while now and I'm glad I bought it and have it in my collection now!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. It even has survival. It has monsters, zombies, huge spiders , people with bows who shoot at you, these creepy alien thing who blow up if you touch them. And more. But you don't just have to do the monster version you can also play regular version where it's peace and quite. And in the monster version it also has day and night.<br />All I now is that it deserves a 5 star.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|Great condition and Guy Pierce is a bad ass!!!! When I first saw this in theaters I was thinking wow this is basically like Escape from L.A. but for space. So, I didn't care that it followed somewhat of the same plot, it is just an amazing movie and you should get it! The comedy is the best!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Just a huge Star Trek fan - great movie - builds on past episodes and explains how it all happened
B008KHG2K2|5.0|This item is great in detail and packaging  .It looks a lot like Jim Lees illustration .Loved his work since the X-Man reboot  cover .Just wondering why there is no Green Arrow in the collection .Look he is older then Cyborg and he is in it .
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I was not surprised by the content of this book as I have studied this period of history for many years.  What I found particularly interesting was the history of Paul and how he became so influential in Christianity.  The author puts Paul's teachings in perspective with the fall of the Temple and Roman influence.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app shows ads on my screen in the rare case that the video even loads DON'T GET THIS APP I CAN'T STRESS IT ENEOUGH!!!!
B00E72OKAS|5.0|it is awesome and I love to play it all day.So much fun<br />to play and to watch all day long
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|Honestly, at first, I found this film mildly disturbing - due to the cutting scenes. But, it grew into something I found very exciting to watch - James and Maggie are amazing in their roles. It is a film well worth watching.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I realize the game is free, however, the game freezes too much. There's no since in downloading a game that you can't play whenever you'd like. Also, the numbers at the bottom are too close to the bingo button w which causes you to accidentally hit the bingo button and lose that card. This needs fixing. I don't recommend downloading it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|So frustrating!! Every time the app is opened, it crashes before the page uploads. This needs to be fixed. This app is currently useless.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|enjoyed the product .......story line was great and would recommend to anyone to watch this product give it a five star rating
0451191153|5.0|Don't question it. If you haven't bought it, do! If you've read it, you know you want it. If you haven't, you'll love it.
B004LROMWU|5.0|enjoyed the product .......story line was great and would recommend to anyone to watch this product give it a five star rating
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Built in micro-USB cable a little too short and the connector is too big and does not fit through a case, so I have to use the short micro-USB cable (also supplied) instead. Other than that no problems. Unit very slim, easy to carry and feels bomb-proof.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I found that this book could get slow in parts but as you get closer to finding out who the killer is it seems as if it is hard to put the book down
055357342X|4.0|I tremendously enjoyed book 3 and would recommend it to anyone.  The author Martin clearly knows what he is doing, but there are times when his excellent, witty dialog is buried under narrative detail.  It is a minor criticism though.  The characters are often very memorable.  A great read.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This book triggers you to really think! I really enjoyed the historic references as well.  Gladwell 's writing really captivates you!
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|This battery is just what the doctor ordered.  It's small, compact design makes it so easy to carry on the go.  It charges my Samsung Galaxy S4 reasonably quick.  A must have!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game was great wish there was more like it!!!!  kept my interest and the graphics were great!!!  please more game
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I just downloaded it and it seems fun. Haven't learned all the ins and outs. Screen expansion needs to be larger.
B00124PXW8|5.0|A Hollywood interpretation of a true story. The real life event was from a little boy whose grandmother gifted him a Ouija board and met an unwanted house guest. Of course whether you believe or not whenever you eat split pea soup you will remember this movie.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Great animation, action, humor and touchy moments. My family enjoyed the movie very much.  We laughed lot. l would recommended
B004IDG97S|5.0|Judge Dredd was an incredibly vivid movie with top notch big name actors. If ever a comic book came alive on screen it is here. This is age appropriate for the whole family which is nice considering how many movies lack intelligent speech by using words no larger than four letters. I liked this so much I bought it twice, once on VHS and then on DVD when it came out.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|it is fun to start then you get reruns of same scenario.  6 yr old girl liks to play for short amount of time
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|The first Judge Dredd comic book turned movie with Stallone was awesome. This movie was such a low budget that special effects were few and far between. Not good for a Scifi flick. The actors lacked charisma and the script was as predictable as a nursery rhyme full of four letter words. If you pay over 99 cents for a viewing you will feel taken advantage of.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My daughter is two and loves all of the Dr Panda games.  We downloaded the airport game as soon as it came out.  She enjoys it but it is definitely more advanced than the other Dr Panda games.  There is a game where you need to match numbers.  The numbers are not written exactly the same which makes it less of a matching game and more of a numbers game.  There are also a few games that require more fine motor skills than previous Dr Panda games.  I am glad that we bought it and my daughter likes it but it is probably more appropriate for an older child (4?)
B005K17RU0|4.0|the app could use better radar imaging. the radar display is too small and difficult to read.  I like the humidity readings too.
B0081JFGQU|4.0|Loved the song Midnight in Harlem - even loved the guitar solo - of which normally I'm not a big fan.  This couldn't be more perfect.  Lots of old songs remade.  Darlin' Be Home Soon is probably the best.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|An incredible story about a musician who became a major success overseas but was unknown in his homeland.  It took a dedicated music lover-film maker to uncover the story.
B005USZML4|4.0|From an adult perspective, it wasn't great but it was good.  Kids will enjoy it and it was interesting how Theodore handled poorly behaving adults.  Good lessons.
B0027MJU00|5.0|My new favorite author! This kept me guessing to the end. Truly brilliant writer ! I can,t wait for her next book
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The quality of the program was wonderful!  I ended up watching the entire season in one evening.  I especially liked watching the HD version.  I can't wait to see Season 4.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I have not used these that long yet but so far I am blown away by them for being only $10. I needed a pair but had little budget, anything in the store for $10 is complete crapola. These things are awesome given the price. They sound fine and do a good job removing outside noise too, they even make a good amount of bass but not headache causing.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Went into this one with some trepidation - but found it very entertaining.  A queer blend of Blade Runner and Mad Max and Robo-Cop - extremely violent and gritty, but then watching the bad guys die realistically does offer a good measure of satisfaction.  Excellent direction, intriguing style, good acting, and a solid score.  No complaints from me - and hope they do a sequel.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I have been playing this game for a few days off and on, it is a good game. Makes a person think and use your multi tasking skills! Very good for making use of down time while waiting and sometimes we have to do a lot of waiting!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|As I say in the headline this does hold everything I need. Currently I have my camera body with lens attached, five other lens, and assorted accessories in the pockets.There is also enough room to stow some personal items- cell phone, credit cards, etc.<br /><br />It is well made and sturdy, you can set it down on it't bottom and it will not tip over. It is well padded and I like that feeling that everything is safe. It is large and can be heavy if you are spending a lot of time hiking around with it full of equipement, I may invest in a smaller backpack for those times when I know exactly which lens I am gonna use, I just tend to like to be over prepared so I really like having EVERYTHING with me!<br /><br />The price was right, at $30 dollars this was the best deal for a bag that holds so much so well. Way to go Amazon!<br /><br />All in all it's a great buy!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Nice read.  Very accurate life experiences with good twists an turns to keep you reading.  Not sure if believable with ending but anything is possible.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Considering this a Kindle fire and the volume on this thing really low. I heard it go off. One thing it needs more loud alarms installed. Only one is loud enough to hear. But, I love having another spare alarm.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|amazing app, especially for the little ones.... fun and addictive!!!<br />Five stars!!! Really teaches you how to take care of a pet too!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is pretty fun to pass the time. The missions seem cool if you have the time. Worth a try.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It's the best book I've read in awhile.  It had all emotions and was totally believable and dramatists.  Can't wait to read her next one losing hope  I just hope it doesn't mean that there is separation because they are meant to stay together forever.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great books. If you have seen the series and want to take a deeper dive in to the plot, you'll enjoy the books.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Yeah best app I've down loaded loads of fun and makes you think a lot alotalotalotalot more apt ani all all my friends
B003G4W49C|5.0|I ended up reading the entire Ender series as well as the Shadow series after reading Ender's Game. Great novel for teens and adults
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is really well done. We look forward to watching every episode and it actually keeps my husband from falling to sleep sitting in his chair!
B005NNVUBM|1.0|This album is trash if you can believe that about a pink Floyd album there are no musical instruments to appreciate.You have to be on a trip like they were to understand any of it .A total waste of money. Its got nothing to do with Amazon I'm glad they offer variety , I would buy another old album just for musical value this one is junk.
B009KWU6Q2|3.0|Acting was ok - not Robin Williams best. Storyline is weak and cast is cheesy. Harmless, but other movies are better entertainment.
B000P0J024|5.0|I saw the video on-line, had never heard of them, fell in love with all of them, I saw a side of George Harrison that I never knew,<br />and I liked it, the music is so up-lifting and entertaining, I am so glad you have it available, and to have the DVD included is really wonderful,  thank you.<br />I really do not know what to put in the headline or summary line, please for give me if it is not correct.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this series and adore that it is included on prime. Please, keep the episodes coming! Hooray for Downton!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The concept is simple but enjoyable.  I like that even when you run out of energy there are still a few small things to do if you are not to pay for more energy or stop until the energy charges back.
1433502410|4.0|This is a very thorough study Bible. Positive points include many notes on the original languages, cultural notes and helpful articles in the back concerning doctrine, ethics, and other religions. The notes within the text will often discuss many different interpretations of passages and their strengths and weaknesses. They take a hard stance on basic doctrine, but otherwise allow the reader to come to their own conclusion based on the facts.<br />The only downside is that sometimes the notes favor summary over analysis. This is especially prevalent in the New Testament. I would have preferred more discussion of overall themes, different viewpoints, connecting symbolism, etc., but often it felt like they were just paraphrasing the verses. When the notes are good though, they are very helpful.<br />This is a very good study Bible overall, and is at a very, very good price. I definitely recommend it for someone looking for just a basic study Bible for everyday study.
B002RI9ORI|5.0|This is a great book! It explains the scientific principles and also shows how irresponsible the media can be regarding medial studies, scares and promoting alternative medicine that have no effect.. Ben Goldacre! Thank you :)
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Helps keep mind busy when trying to relax. My kids and race each other to play first lol. Happy it was free very worth it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|\\"Might\\" be of help if App worked well.  Loads, then wants to install app-adware (seems to be sole purpose), after that most helps are hyperlinks that don't start the Silk Browser. When you try to make use of the proposed \\"helps\\" is when the App starts crashing.  Doesn't crash your KFHD, just the App.<br />I knew this wasn't the game as many others apparently didn't from reviews, so my 1 star has nothing to do with \\"I thought it was the game\\".  It's just the most worthless thing I've come across in a long time.  At least on the Kindle Fire HD 7\\".<br />Maybe it works on some of the phones?
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It is a rare book that lives up to the hype, but this one does. Often I find lengthy descriptions boring and find myself skimming over them but the descriptions in this book were gorgeous. I could truly see this magical circus in my mind, I could practically smell the caramel in the air. I loved the story, I loved the characters, I loved it all. I only wish I had the words to do it justice. Highly recommended.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's definitely a great book and I would recommend it to anyone.  I just felt that it ended so suddenly in comparison to how long it took to build up.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it, its cute but it tends to freeze up quite a bit. Other than that,  its a wonderful game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome because it teaches you how to take care of a horse and it has helped me a lot with my horse lessons.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is pretty challenging at times but it is also a ton of fun. I highly recommend it to everyone.
1400069807|5.0|I didn't know someone could talk so much about salt, sugar and fat, and keep it interesting.  Good to know some background on the industries forcing these substances into our diets - why they do it, how they do it, etc.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I read the short version of Les Miserables.<br />This version is Full. It's very hard to read. I just read less than 1%
B005XE33FM|5.0|Very well pressed record. Extremely quiet when it needs to be. Even on my modest stereo it sounds awesome, like he is right there!<br />Classic songs sound more dramatic in this acoustic setting. Highly recommend if your a CC fan.
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|It's action/ sci-fi thriller.  Quality of the movie was wonderful !!!  Crisp HD picture.<br /><br />there were a few moments when i was taken out of the experience because i couldn't accept some of the character's actions or surroundings.  It was not so much that I had to stop the movie, though.  I still watched it in its' entirety.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita's book is a beautiful recollection of personal pain and glory. It inspires a deeper understanding of who we are and why we are here. It is full of optimism and wisdom that speaks directly to your heart.
B002O2THRO|4.0|This movie was much better I thought than the one w/DeCaprio.  The latest one was over the top with the partying and all. also the soundtrack music was rap? Mia and Robert were a bit more civilized.
B009AY04A8|2.0|Can't say I'm very happy with this game. SO glad it was free! EVERYTHING was going fine, enjoyed playing until level 16. The game just stops? I done the normal check to be sure it wasn't my Kindle. It is the app! To bad. The idea was great!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo.I wish my touchpad on my kindle was a little larger to stop from hitting \\"bad\\" biingos.<br />But great game.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Couldn't put it down.<br /><br /> WWll is a time in History and we should never forget.  This book takes us back to that time.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I really wanted to like this headset. The sound is clear and its wireless!<br /><br />Would be nice if it stayed connected though! What good is it if halfway through what you are doing it decides to go to sleep. I have used this headset for 3 days and I'm in IT so I thought I could fix the issue. Bad software, fixes you find on the internet for the issues don't work and you have an expensive paperweight. I can't use it as a headset for VOIP because it goes to sleep between calls and there is no way to stop it. Only the earpiece too! so answering the phone they can hear me but I can't hear them. Search the product and you'll realize YOU DO NOT WANT TO BUY THIS, YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Nice to have current conditions at my fingertips.  Good app for anyone on the go.  I do wish it would include the percent chance of rain or snow in the free version.
B00992CF6W|4.0|please add the end &amp; enderman &amp; more spawn eggs like the Xbox 360 and some different skins and make it so that you can mine Redstone
B0001FGBD4|2.0|Though of trying some hi-res jazz, well all pieces inside not to my like-ing.<br />Think this disc will remain on my shelve to collect dust :-(
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Doctor Who is amazing! Havent been disappointed yet. Can't wait for more. I'm all caught up and waiting for the new season.
B005LAII80|5.0|On my HT setup - the sound effect is super  :-)<br />That is about all that is important to me  :-)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book, a bit misleading at parts, but all around an enjoyable Sci-Fi novel. Great book for kids / teens.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Really good beats lyrics of course are amazing, not a big fan of the song &#34;let nas down&#34;, but the rest i like very much. My little brother has listened to it more than I have and I'm in love with J.cole
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This is not your usual fair.  Intelligent thought-provoking intricate music with no hint of a lower common-denominator.  Harkens back to the 60's and 70's free-thinking production of music for art's own sake.  Hopefully, this group will get the commercial success that will keep them making art for years to come.
1455526959|5.0|Michael Connelly knows how to write a page-turner, what can I say.  Intelligent writing with an adrenalin rush.  Three-dimensional characters that are engaging and flawed.  A master at his craft.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game started out fairly easy but it boy progressively more difficult. I loved the challenge but got stuck.  I'll try again another day.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|If I'm to be completely honest, at first, I took one look at this book and thought, \\"oh jeez, it's another boring summer reading book. Let's get this over with.\\" So I sat down, my kindle in one hand, a cup of hot chocolate in the other, ready for the long few hours ahead. But, as I flipped through the first through pages, my eyes lit up. Each chapter held my attention, beautifully written and enchanting. Soon, I had already read for four hours straight without taking one sip of my drink! This book will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and most importantly, it will make you think about society and the difference between what's right and what everyone else is doing. Like the more of Wonder, don't judge a book by its cover. Because this book's beauty is on the inside.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I have been listening to this album off and on all day and it is without a doubt a true metal album, leaving behind their metalcore roots. For some this will be a bad thing, but for me this is the kind of album I have been waiting to hear for quite some time. Admittedly I am a fan of the 80s metal scene that brought us Metallica, G&R, Megadeth, etc. Although some current bands catch my ear, none have done so quite like A7X. I have always been a fan. But I have also felt there was still that something missing from what they were giving us. Hail to the King fills that void.<br /><br />I honestly did go back and forth between 4 and 5 stars for this album as a couple of tracks leave me feeling underwhelmed. However, since 4 and a half is not an option I decided to round up and go with 5. In the end this is a very solid metal album that brings back some of the elements metal has been missing more and more of for the past ten years. Sure, band like Metallica and Megadeth are still churning out new music, but the torch needs to be passed and A7X, in my opinion, is the band to carry us forward.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Love it. Try it out! You won't be disappointed. One of my favorite card games around. Extremely addictive and progress based.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This YouTube app was fine at first. After a while none of the videos would properly load and it's very aggravating. I started using the app because on my kindle fire hd it's not letting me get on YouTube via internet. If someone could help me with that problem that would be highly appreciated. Also this app has adds and ofcourse amazon wants you to buy an upgrade to get rid of that. No app is truly free anymore. I feel like the quality purposely go bad so I would upgrade. Very disappointed!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Put this on my kindle HDfor my daughter and she LOVES it!!!!<br />She is figuring out how to navigate it to get all the extra points all by herself.<br />Great find!!!!
B00AHHODH2|5.0|This book has to depend entirely on coincidence and a number of other factors that defy logic in order to come out right.  Normally I would say, \\"don't insult my intelligence.\\"  But this time everything was acceptable to me.  The book is so amoral, so non-sensical, yet so satisfying.  I loved all the strange twists in the story line.  Read it.  It will tickle your funny bone.  Alfred Hitchcock would have enjoyed making this book into a movie.
B00E5C3AJM|3.0|It takes five years to add a friend and you have to have a Facebook and what kid has a Facebook!! Please fix
B000RPCK1U|5.0|Pierce Bossman does an excellent portrayal of James Bond. Action packed, lots of special effects, good storyline. All James Bonds fans will love this flick
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My absolute favorite game! First thing in the morning, I grab a cup of coffee and start playing. A great way to begin the day. Great way to end it too.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My son loves it and plays it all the time (he is 6 yrs old).  Can't wait to see the movie.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love this Mahjong game.  I deleted all but one of my other ones. I like the fact that I can go back and replay each one and try to beat my score.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie! All the characters are entertaining...the one liners continue to be funny and the action scenes are cool as in other Marvel movies of late.
B00640UICA|5.0|Very cute!!  It gets harder as you go and there are no hints so you have to figure it out on your own.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Cinematography is spectacular.  HD Movie at its best.  Makes a nice demo for HDTV.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Recommend to all.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a fun, easy, and relaxing game.  A must have for those days when you want to just lounge around.
B000002I4S|5.0|If you like jazz, or any other great music, spring for the CD.  It is presumptuous of a non musician like me to be critical, or even analytical.  The more I listen to fine Jazz the more it means, the more it lifts the spirit.  And Coltrane never fails to touch the heart in one way or another.  Of course with JC there are a lot of notes, but so it is with M ozart as well.  For me, the notes all fit, and each one carries things along.  Go with it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a very good and addictive game but it's a little hard to earn those cards which you need to build a lot of the stuff other than that overall a great game
