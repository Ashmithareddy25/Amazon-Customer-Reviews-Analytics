B000FC0SIM|4.0|A fellow writer recommended Stephen King's book on writing cum personal memoir as a staple for anyone who wants to be a successful writer. Who better than one of the most successful novelists of all time to share his valuable insights on writing to a budding writer?<br /><br />His book begins with a series of personal stories King shares from his childhood that crescendo to his early years as a novelist. His anecdotes are insightful, humorous, and showcase his easy-on-the-eyes writing style that has made him a literary \\"King.\\" The book abruptly switches half way through to his general thoughts on writing and best practices for the would-be author. I appreciated his practical advice caveated with the understanding what worked for him might not be the best approach in every situation. While dedicated writers pay lip service to the noble goal of writing 2,000 words a day and reading more than 80 books a year, many find it challenging to adhere to King's formula by spending dinnertime reading books.<br /><br />King ends the book recounting his near-fatal accident in 1999. The touching story written to perfection by the master tugged at my heart strings when he described his miraculous recovery and struggle to write again. I had wondered about the abrupt change in tone from storyteller to writing instructor when I read the first half of the book and realized that On Writing was King's first book after the accident. He was under contract to write it and admitted how difficult it was for a novelist who dreaded nonfiction to write. Suddenly, it made sense. The book itself is an encouragement to writers to stop complaining about everything that distracts them from writing and to start writing. If King could write this piece months after a debilitating accident, there's no reason any writer of sound mind and body couldn't write one of their own with far fewer limitations.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any writer or Stephen King fan who hasn't read it yet and give it 4 stars. It may not have the suspense of his fiction novels, but it does have spark - from an electrical experiment gone wrong.tars. It may not have the suspense of his fiction novels, but it does have spark - from an electrical experiment gone wrong.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very intriguing game! Can't wait for the next one!<br />I felt like I just couldn't put it down until I had beaten it.  Had to use the hints a few times but pretty simple to figure out.
B008B11RLQ|5.0|Years ago while in the Air Force I had a friend who was a hard core Elvis Presley fan. He knew everything about Elvis Presley and I'm certain he had all of Elvis Presley's albums. Well I'm not into Elvis Presley the way my friend was but I do like the music Elvis put out and I like and respect everything Elvis Presley did for the music world. I decided it was time to have music from Elvis Presley in my music collection. So I started looking and I saw this collection of CD's. I ordered the item and I was not disappointed. This collection has music from Elvis Presley that I am familiar with as well as music from Elvis that I've never heard before. It's a great collection that gave me hours of listening enjoyment.<br /><br />Now to describe the product. I take it these are CD reproductions of albums put out by Elvis Presley. On some of the CD's the songs aren't always what is on the CD/album cover. The package does come with a booklet that list all the songs on the particular CD. Also some songs play more than once. Now this may bother the Elvis Presley purist but for a novice like myself that should not be a problem. I didn't find it to be a problem and I am a Elvis Presley novice. This is an awesome product for anyone who likes the music by Elvis Presley. I believe the hard core fan, the purist, and the novice will get much pleasure and hours of listening enjoyment. The item is worth buying.

B00D5CENXA|5.0|In Mountain Justice, by Karen Black, Annie is an abused woman. She presses charges against her husband George, and he is thankfully and justifiably sent to prison. When he gets out of jail, he decides to take up where he left off with Annie.<br /><br />As a former volunteer for a domestic violence shelter, I found the descriptions and the story line apropos and realistic. The thoughts and motivations of Annie are consistent with what is unfortunately found in chronically battered women.<br /><br />I admire Annie for finding the strength to make the break from an abusive man. I wish I could see such empowerment among more women like her in the real world. Getting off my soapbox now!<br /><br />As I've come to expect from Karen Black, the ending was a surprise.
B001DUGOWY|5.0|One of the best American novels in the past 100 years. The story may be more relevant in 2013 than ever before.

B004XWLN20|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and they were very impressed. If you are a fan of the series, you will like it.
B004XWLN20|4.0|Great show and all the disc's played well but alot of the discs had scratches on them when I took them out, but other than that it is a great product.
B004GYY714|5.0|but I wish I could find one that uses your ear phones as a signal<br />other than THAT BEST RADIO APP EVER
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This movie was recommended to me. I normally watched George Clooney in light hearted movies as the majority of his films are. This is a serious role for him and he portrayed the part quite well. He can only get better. Highly recommended if you are a George Clooney's fan.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|Big disappointment. I loved the first three.  They might have stretched another in the series with Matt Damon as the star.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I love Adele. I have always enjoyed listening to her on the radio and her CDs too. I certainly love watching her performance on the DVD.  She is fun to watch!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I wish I had not read the review about how many times a certain word was said, because it made me aware that it was said in every other paragraph. This book opens it's page's wide to criticism, but what's the point. If I met Jack in a bar and he said all the things he did and learned as an Army MP, I would say BS. I would tell him to try sentences longer than five words occasionally, he's not Jack Webb. But the fact is I enjoyed the story, couldn't put it down and will read another in the series soon. I hate myself for it, I feel like I woke up the next morning and said; who is this beside me, but damn it was good.
B008WALV94|5.0|Been waiting for this album for almost a year. But the wait is over. Belinda never disappoints. I love this cd so much. I recommend this album to y'all belinda fans and just people who love good music.

B002JXK5VU|5.0|I watched this series on the Sy fy channel when it was on I am now watching it over since I enjoyed it so much the first time. You always see something you missed
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I have enjoyed the story and have loaned it oout to many people who are also hooked on the series as well.
B002SJKWZ4|2.0|If it could handle all ten devices that I have, it would be OK, but it's too shticky, and I need a bunch of remotes anyway, so it's not worth the fun.

1423140605|5.0|My daughter needed to find a book series that she enjoyed as much as Harry Potter and The Rick Riordan books seem to have done that.  She really enjoyed this book and is so looking forward to the next one in the series.  She has really enjoyed learning about Greek and Roman mythology through these stories and has really enjoyed the characters.  Now if Rick Riordan could write as fast as she reads them that would be great!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I had not read anything by this author before and have now started some of the other books ha has written, which I am also enjoying.  It is hard to put the book down
B00CA4S27W|3.0|The Prog Rock is alive and well on this CD, although it sounds rather tired.  The idea of 'Renaissance' music is good, but it seems Ritchie is longing for some old Deep Purple/Rainbow days.  Synth and organ w/instrumentals recalls more elder sounds, not the 'Night' we're looking for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I agree with all the other positive reviews.  It was challenging but not impossible.  I am looking forward to more rooms.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is an awesome app. all where's my apps are awesome. all of them areworth the money. buy them with glee. I give this app 10000000000000
0345472322|4.0|The book is written in an easy to read manner, but offered powerful insights into how we think.  I was challenged by the points made throughout.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I loved the book and the characters. It kept me enthralled and entertained throughout. I would recommend it and the series.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Cant go wrong with this collection. Great show and I have never bought a DvD collection that had such high quaility packaging. I got it on sale for 66% off and I think it was an absolute steal. If your a Smallville fan, get this collection now!
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best books l Jane ever read.  I am glad that they are finally making a movie of this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Please download this app then turn off your tablet/mobile device, then the app should work after a couple tries of opening.

B00A7W29BE|1.0|Thought this would allow for better viewing of pages of text but my camera does better. Also thought it would allow editing of previous documents but won't. Uninstalling.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|A lovely album; it is both haunting and atmospheric. I bought the whole album after listening to Smother and was not disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Descent  game could use more challenge. Hope the new levels are harder. Use of all walks and ceilings and floors would be good and more moves to complete a level.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a very good game. I found that some of the answers actually took some thought and also some luck.
B005FQ2H8W|3.0|This Movie wasn't to bad it had some good scenes in it and just like in all her other Movies Joan Allen was her Usual Self as well as Micheal Pare but he still Remains A Boring Actor to me.it had some Crashes but not the ones you would call Awesome.the Storyline was OK but a Little Weird to.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Don't bother with this film. It was slow, slow, slow and confusing! the only interesting part of the movie was trying to figure out which actor was what character. I swear they only employed 6 actors for the whole film. Skip this one.
1616550414|5.0|Fantastic!!! Always been a zelda fan. All my friends were jealous! Came in great condition, its in depth and a fantastic coffee table book!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|who knew that vikings could be sexy and smart. this show gives a great insight into history as well as humanity. Sure there is blood and gore, but that was how killing went back then. Love the relationship between Rothguard and his son. Sure is nice to see a boy stand up for his mother.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This was my first time reading this book as I never read it as a child. I was expecting the book to be rather dark considering it has a history of being banned from schools & libraries and the movie kind of scares me. The book wasn't dark at all. It's fairly simply written so that a child could read it easily but it is still very amusing. I can see how this book has become such a classic. It has great morals all throughout the book and teaches some pretty great lessons. I ended up buying the whole 14 book series and I'm looking forward to reading it all.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Gotta see josh. Julianne is good, but frankly Josh was the draw for me. Love the ending with the dead wife being a ghost. in fact this flick made me go out and purchase and read my first Nicholas Sparks book. I think I'll just wait for more of the movies.
B00338QENI|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />If you care about the history of biological science; If you care about the history of the USA; If you care about black history; If you care about black/white race relations and the history of black/white race relations in the US, then you *NEED* to read this book.<br /><br />I bought this book because I majored in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and I basically started my career doing cell culture on HeLa cells. I knew only a minimal amount about the actual history of the cells. I have heard from colleagues that this is a great book so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. I learned so much from this book that goes above and beyond the actual cells.<br /><br />I had no clue that they started being cultured at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. I had no clue that Johns Hopkins started as a hospital for African Americans. At that time, Johns Hopkins was the only hospital around that would even care for blacks. It was also a clinic for poor people who couldn't afford care. At that time, people would travel for hundreds of miles to go to Johns Hopkins because it was the only hospital around where they could get care.<br /><br />This is where our scientific history of Henrietta Lacks starts.<br /><br />So much of the story will anger you, will make you sad, and will make you chuckle. So much of it is unfair and so much of it is enraging but you will not regret the read.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I have really enjoyed this game so far but in the upper room with the big fan at the back it will not let me retrieve the last piece of the record. I have a kindle fire HD and the record piece is right where the three lines where my menu button are so I can't finish the game. alawar can you please fix this? Does any one have any suggestions? I would gladly give a four star if I could finish the game without glitches. Thanks
B0042X9L6A|5.0|It does a great job for everything it is supposed to do!  I've been very pleased with it.  I had a Sun Pak from Walmart, and it sucked!  This is soooo much better!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Totally enjoyed the movie! Blended well with the original Wizard of Oz. Characters were all terrific. The only thing I did not care for was Glenda's head piece. Wish it was more like the original head piece that Glenda had in the Wizard of Oz. Other than that, I loved the movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app for your computer or tablet. You can read from it anytime you choose, or listen to it being read on your tablet or computer. Would recommend to others.
B00280LYIC|4.0|It was great getting lost in the world of the Ancient Greek but keeping my foot in modern times.  It was a hoot.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I have to share what my daughter has to say about this series. I have never seen her so enthusiastic about reading. Hat's off to Rick Riordan! \\"The author did such a good job keeping you hooked. Ever since I got the book I stayed up until 11:00 reading it and it would have been longer if I could have stayed awake! I liked every moment of this book. If you like adventure and great characters and writing totally get the first book in this series!!!!!\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My three year old granddaughter plays this i thought it would be a piece of cake... NOT!!! Very addictive and fun...hard to beat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! it really makes you think. I would want to play this all weekend over and over again! best game ever!!!!!!!
B004VD3YIM|1.0|I bought this app as it appeared to be the most downloaded and highly rated. Unfortunately, it won't connect most of the time. Instead, I get a \\"video failed\\" message. It's DEFINITELY the app that's the problem - the Foscam IP viewer app on my iPad and the Internet on my Kindle Fire both connect just fine. Very disappointed the app doesn't work, and that I'm out $4.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I found this movie to be very offensive.  It was just plain porn.  Watched less than 5 minutes; then turned it off and rented a different movie.  I would like my money back.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|The choice of tiles made this a very good app. They are very easy to tell what they are and what level they are on. Lo e all the backgrounds and puzzle choices
B002DOSBMK|5.0|A friend recommended it to me, have only just started reading it but I am hooked!!! Great writer, looking forward to reading the whole series.
1781162646|4.0|This is a quick and entertaining read.<br />Stephen King is one of my favorite authors and I was looking forward to reading it as soon as it was published.<br />If one is expecting a book as deep as many of his others this is not for you. However; it's well written (as always!) and I truly enjoyed the genre that Mr.King chose. I'll tell you one thing I knew nothing about carnivals/amusement parks or the people working them, except of course the stereo types one grows up with. Happy to report I learned about a subject I knew nothing about! As usual even with the knowledge this book is fiction I felt as if much of it is fact??? Doesn't really matter though I enjoyed my few days at the fair! Thank you Mr. King for another few days lost in your stories.
1603427244|5.0|Really learned to knit n purl when I was 8 but all I knitted were rugs for my dollhouse and doll blankets. I started knitting argyle socks when I was 12. By age 13, I was designing, graphing and knitting mens' socks for family and friends.  I could really have used this book then but more importantly when I branched out to knitting sweaters, scarves, afgans, hats, etc. I was 78 on July 4th and really am looking forward to using many of the examples in this book.  Just learned to knit on circular needles in the last 8 months; so far have knitted several pairs of socks for family and hats [beanies) for family and the homeless. I recommend this book for all knitters from beginners to old timers.
B009R659L8|5.0|Once again, Mary Higgins Clark did not disappoint.  The story was extremely good and kept me hooked until the end.  I great read and I would definitely recommend it.
1603429999|5.0|Really found this book exciting and educational.  8 months ago I taught myself to knit socks and hats for men and women (all ages) on circular needles. As I mentioned in a previous review, I turned 78 on the 4th of July and first learned to knit when I was 8.  Okay, that's a little plug that you CAN teach an old person new tricks!<br />I really love this book and even if you have knitted a long time on circulars I honestly believe there are so many tips in this book that you would find a lot of new ideas to try.  No matter your age (with arthritis or not) what a great book to help you learn &#34;Essential Techniques to Master Knitting in the Round&#34;.
B0009P66TK|4.0|This watch is being sold at a lower price point that it deserves. The feel and function of the watch is for one more expensive.<br />Large size only for the big guys, neat design and definitely catches everybody's attention.<br />Overall, great value..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game because it's great you get to take care of a horse or horse's. If you like horse's this app is for you. I hope you like it.
1451696191|5.0|This book was written a long time ago, but I finally got the chance to pick it up and read it, since I was bored to death. UM, best choice EVER! This book practically changed my life!<br /> A little summary in my own words:<br /><br />''It's about this one boy, Charlie. He's not your typical average teenager. He's been through a lot of rough things. Stuff with his aunt, his dad, his brother, his sister. Especially a friend dying. He screws things up a lot. But he's human, so give him a break! He loves this girl, Sam. But she's too busy with some other jock. And sadly, Charlie is suicidal.''<br /><br />I just kept putting myself in his spot! I mean, I haven't been through everything he has, but I certainly know how it kinda feels to be the not so popular type. I WANT a friend like Charlie! He's always so willing and caring, and just goes with the flow. You have no idea how much I CRIED during this. The only thing is, the movie was a lot different from the book, but I think it was for its own good. The book was just one of those OMG books. You know? I really wish there was a book two, but it's been like 14 years since it was written, and I doubt it. Oh and just saying, in real life, Charlie is HOT. :D I love this book way too much, and same with the movie, and I recommend anyone who's at least...hmm... 14? Should read this book, because even though it has its ups and downs and inappropriate content reference, it's probably a book that will change your life FOREVER.
B000P407K4|4.0|The Combination of Kubrick's directorial genius, coupled wiith Peter Sellers incomparable to make people laugh at even the most catastrophic situations - along with a good supporting cast - makes this a must see. Strangelove is an outrageous character, thinking, with mathematical precision, the manner in which the men in the War Room can survive the coming apocalypse. And the exclamation point on this comedy of errors - Major Kong (Slim Pickens) riding a hydrogen bomb down to its target.
B009A882D0|4.0|A great memory CD with all of the groups greatest hits.  All are the classics I grew up with, and all are as fantastic as when they were issues back in the 60's and 70's.  I especially enjoy the \\"long\\" version of \\"Heard it through the grapevine.\\" One song I have always loved the group do, but was never well played by the radio jocks.  A great CD overall.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game a lot and wish that I could play this game all day. I wish that this game would let go on to play the next day
B00847KFDS|5.0|The first I heard this album, I was very happy and enjoyed the assortment of duets of top named performers along with John and his music.  I cannot think of any songs I do not like on the CD.  An absolute wonder and perfection is on my mind as well.  Please keep up the great songwriting, John, we love it at my household.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|this book has been discussed numerous times amongst my social groups and so i decided to finally read it. i was immediately surprised by the captivating film style writing that portrayed the book in almost a cinematic way. this is a style i personally love and immediately immersed myself in this peculiar world. the characters were strongly developed and the scenes were described with such elegance hat the book flowed seamlessly. i hope the second book is as captivating. i recommend this to anyone older than 12. its an easy read and it had a nice plot.

B005MJFA2W|5.0|This is the kind of book that everyone should read.  It comprehensively takes you through all the pitfalls of thinking and evaluating, mental processes which people perform every day of their lives of course, without ever realizing how absolutely unskilfully we actually do this.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Very good way to relax and spend a few minutes having challenging fun. My son and I both enjoy it.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Great book! Fun read you won't want to put it down. One of h we best books yet. Would love to see this made into a movie.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|There are any number of adjectives I could use to describe this book that I wouldn't have thought one could use in connection to something about zombies. But then, it's not really about the zombies. It's about our humanity, and Mr. Brooks cuts a wide swath to deliver a nuanced account of the quasiapocalypse caused and (almost) resolved by people. Yes, nuanced.
0671646788|5.0|This book takes you from humdrum thinking to the power you have inside yourself to dream big and accomplish your dreams.  A great book for all walks of life.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I LOVED Delirium.  It was one of my favorite reads 2 years ago.  The sequel, Pandemonium, wasn't nearly as good.  I never felt that connection between Lena and Julian like I had with Lena and Alex.  I always felt like he was her rebound guy. She wouldn't know about rebound guys because of the society in which she grew up.  So, at the end of the book, when Alex reappears, I suspected where the story was heading.  In the end, I just feel bad for Julian.<br /><br />One thing I really enjoyed about Requiem was seeing Hana's perspective.  I enjoyed her parts more than Lena's.  It was interesting seeing her struggle with figuring out who she is and piecing the puzzle together about her fianc&eacute;.  Lena's story was filled with struggle and turmoil.  And I knew she'd be struggling with her feelings for the boys, but I was kind of bored with her story.<br /><br />In the end, it doesn't necessarily leave you with any firm answers, but it leaves you with hope, and I think that is what Ms. Oliver was going for.  This definitely wasn't the best book I've read this year, but I'm glad I took the time to read it.
0425166805|3.0|Haven't finished this book yet but am very skeptical about the conclusions the author has drawn from his investigations.  However, it is an interesting read.

B007KOYEOC|2.0|AFTER THE HYPE OF THIS BOOK IN THE MEDIA I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SERIES OF BOOKS.  IT WAS VERY REPETITIVE AND I FOUND MYSELF SKIPPING PAGES TO GET TO THE NEXT PART WITHOUT SEX WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME, PAGE AFTER PAGE,  JUST SO I COULD FIND OUT HOW THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHARACTERS WAS GOING ALONG.
B005LAII4E|1.0|I don't even care about the money, I just want my time back.  I saw this in the theater, and regretted it from 20 minutes in, and that included 10 minutes of previews.<br /><br />I can't even get into all the incredible mistakes in this movie, or I would be going line by line through the script.  There are problems from plot development to character development to human behavior to human stupidity to weapons design to the laws of physics.  Every aspect of this movie is bad.  Nobody of any level of intelligence above 90 should even try to watch this movie.  I said the phrase \\"Seriously?  You expect me to believe...\\" at least a dozen times through that movie.<br /><br />Oh, and if you release a large metal bar from a satellite in orbit, it stays in orbit right next to the satellite.  Even if you shove it out of the satellite toward earth, while it would mess up the satellite's orbit quite a bit, it will not crash into the earth.  It will just go into a lower orbit, unless it is shoved really, really hard, like railgun type hard.<br /><br />The idiocy level of this movie is staggering.

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I loved the awesome action and effects.  It was a fun movie from start to finish.  A few things came a minor surprises, but most was pretty predictable.  The 'enemy' starship was incredible!  I advise it to any action or sci-fi fan.<br /><br />However, there are a few things that bugged me and kept me from enjoying it fully.  Apparently, with the suspension of the normal behavior of gravity came the ability for people to walk on walls.  When a starship has power, it apparently just hangs in space, and as soon as it loses power, it falls directly toward Earth, never mind the fact that the nearest gravity well is the Moon.  While falling, and having no power, apparently the people inside don't experience freefall, but rather have to deal with 'down' being the direction toward Earth, regardless of where they are in space, and thus the wall walking.  Also, the skinniest guy on the crew is apparently able to pull two of the heftier crew members up with one arm, as well, despite what seems like Earth normal gravity.  Also, the momentum built up from falling from a near lunar orbit down to Earth's cloud layer is reversible in just a couple seconds, without affecting the crew.  The rest I can't talk about without major spoilers, so I'll just leave it with this.<br /><br />I only take one star off for those blaring missteps.  JJ really failed us on that aspect, but I forgive him.  The missteps I mention are only a small part of the film, and the rest is just so much fun.  Overall, I loved it, but it is not perfect.

B004QX07G4|5.0|My daughter really enjoyed reading this book.  I heard her laughing out loud while reading several times. Entertaining !!  A good buy.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|OMG so this book was recommended to me by a good friend. All guys drool over scarface and the Godfather and Good Fellas - all those gangster kind of movies. I watched Good Fellas in high school. Good movie. I watched scarface in college. I am still confused.  I tried watching the Godfather and kept falling asleep because I had no idea what that guy was saying at the beginning!<br /><br />I read this book and it changed my life.<br /><br />Not even kidding - the BEST book I ever read. And I have read many books. Jurassic Park, most of Tom Clancy novels, Eat, Pray Love, John Giddeon's vampire books (which were previously my faves), the Hunger Games, etc. None of them had as many twists as this.<br /><br />True artistry to tell such a story and build characters so well. You know - stuff not appreciated anymore. It's been replaced by rippling muscles and sick effects.<br /><br />I can't wait to watch this movie now. To see if it does this book any justice. Just read it - you will be at the edge of your seat.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Nice! Excellent mahjong game!  I like my others but this is the best.  Tons of options, online leaderboard, shuffle option.  Nice and relaxing! How I like my solitaire.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|Enjoyed this movie, it fits the mode for fans of Sci Fi and fantasy and enjoyed watching it! Recommend it for people that like this type of movie.
0714843377|3.0|The Book Title was a grabber. It began to address the subject matter , but eventually drifted into the author's familiar territory, advertising. Midway through the book,all references became what to do to advertise and how to handle meeting with clients about the same subject matter. I did like the shortness of the topics and getting right to the point. I also liked the illustrations which were at times very thought provoking.
0061478784|5.0|I love the story line and how she writes. I would recommend her stuff to any person of any age.
B001O8C5KK|5.0|This is one of my favourites and this particular presentation with Jonas Kaufmann is superb!  I just saw (film) Tosca and will order it soon.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the better books I've every read.  The story of these men kept you on the edge of your seat.
B00847KFDS|5.0|What can I say? John's hits and a slew of fellow artists jamming together.  What's not to love? This album is a definate hit!
B009H442DG|5.0|This is a gift for my daughters birthday. She will be pleased. It was from her wish list plus I got a free download of the music.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I got this on a lark when it was free-it's a lot of fun and you can lose a lot of time with it.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|One of the best pinball games I have ever played outside of an arcade. The game handles really well on the Kindle Fire and with the DLC's it keeps the game fun and fresh.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fantastic!!  only thing it needs is more minion babble. its pretty easy; only the part of the game where u have to tilt your device is hard. all in all good game
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Wonderful to listen to and a great bargain for such quality music. You cannot go wrong purchasing this easy listening music.
B00422LESO|4.0|This was a quick read, which is very handy for pool reading. I had read many reviews (both positive and negative) before purchasing this book. To be honest, the negative reviews were quite harsh! The biggest complaint is the ending- wanting Jane to remain lonely, basically- I disagree with them... I found this book truly enjoyable and found myself really going along for the ride in main character Jane's adventure.<br /><br />If you're a lover of Jane Austen, and you want to read a care-free romance book with a happy ending, then this is a very entertaining choice. I really enjoyed it, but then again I liked Northanger Abbey, which apparently Hale did not like...<br /><br />No, this book isn't the most well written novel of all time. Yes, it could be a bit predictable. However, if Austenland was a real place, I'd totally visit!
B0087EACJK|5.0|I bought this game for my iPad and I LOVE IT!  It keeps me busy when I need some down-time and my girls love trying to get through all the levels.  Great job, Noodlecake!
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|That was the funniest book I've read in years. If you love dogs, you've got to read this. If you don't laugh out loud, you're nuts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In the first part, this book jumps and jumps around!  I am looking forward to getting to the end... and I hope I'm not disappointed!  I couldn't pass this book up, the price was just too good.  I also saw an ad for it on the back of a popular magazine, so I know it's gotten some attention.
383651723X|5.0|Every photographer, amateur or otherwise should own this book.  Brilliant.  also has an essay describing how when and where the pciture was taken and Jeanloups thoughts about it.  really great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game. As others have noted not too hard and not overly easy. Looking forward to more levels. I will check out more games from this developer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keeps me mentally engaged in a boring overnight job! each level is a bit more challenging. I hope there is more after level 10
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Such an amazing album ! I bought for my FATHER and he is dancing on Gaga's bad romance song :o) So weird to see 58 years old, engineer guy while he was dancing on bad romance single by Lady Gaga. I think her difference is that she can reach everyone. Love her, hate her, she is an unforgettable ICONic person...
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|the best program on tv.  sex is around every corner and it sure raises the level of my bp.  i would recommend this program to everyone.  wish it was on every day..  gabriel is above and beyond and should be voted sexiest man in 1914.  the writers are extremely talented.  all of the actors are above and beyond for their parts they are playing.  i will buy every dvd of suits that comes out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was having a great time and thinking this might become my favorite game when I suddenly found I had run out of levels. Hopefully new levels will be available soon (and not too expensive!).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this game, never played it until my husband asked &quot;What is this?&quot; I said &quot;I don't know, I never played it...you have to try to get out of the rooms.&quot;  Well, he was addicted from the beginning and in turn got me involved.  Enjoyable and sometimes stressful.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Loved this story. Cheryl is a very brave woman to hike the PCT alone and to also write an honest memoir about her life. I thought it was a great read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game, I'm so addicted to it and I recommend that everyone should try it it's a really fun game
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A very satisfying ending to an amazing series. This from a loyal fan who really grew tired of it all a few books back.  There were some pretty mediocre books there in the middle.  Not so with this final set.  Well done, Sanderson.  I think you completed Jordan's vision with an amazingly satisfying flourish.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is one of the best apps ive ever bought you should get pocketinvtool it's like a cheat thing for it i hate those fake minecraft apps
B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter loves all of the Monster High playsets, and this is no exception. It provides her and her friends with hours of fun.
B003L77G10|5.0|I'm ready to buy season three.  it is easy to get invested with these characters.  You should give it a try - Start with season one.
B008B68IEA|5.0|My daughter loves all of the Monster High furniture sets, and this is no exception. It provides her and her friends with hours of fun.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|If you're a fan of Neil Gaiman's this book is a must read. If you aren't familiar with his work, this short novel is a great place to start. Dark and joyous, a bittersweet recollection of the magic and unique terror only possible in childhood. Note: even though the protagonist is 7 during the majority of the telling, this is not a children's book.
B008B68IUY|5.0|My daughter loves all of the Monster High playsets, and this is no exception. It provides her and her friends with hours of fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. I would highly recommend it. I had a hard time putting it down. I finished the game in one day because it was very addicting.
1878424319|5.0|This book is an awesome read. It is a good reminder if how you shoud live your life. It's a must read for everyone.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|We enjoyed his performances on AI. The album is what you would expect from him. We enjoy listening with our young children.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I've seen JUDGE DREDD several times already and after watching this one, I think that SYLVESTER STALLONE and KARL URBAN do it much better than any other actors on the big screen. They should make a movie together sometimes because the deadly style and the grin on their faces shows this comic hero's identity in a much more cooler perspective that all the audiences would be blown away. Their performance as the fearless DREDD will be talked about for a long period of time. YEAH, YOU JUDGES HAVE YOUR OWN WAY OF FIGHTING FOR ORDER IN THE CHAOS.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am a big fan of Despicable me Minion and now there is a game. Best of both worlds. My whole family loves this game.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|THIS IS WONDERFUL FOR EYE HAND COORDINATION.  GAME IS GRAT FOR ALL AGES. ENTERTAINING, KEEP CHILDREN AND ADULTS AWAY FROM THE TV.
B005FQE2E4|3.0|I liked all the illustrations, but it's to short. I thought it would be longer. It's not worth the money. But I did get some laughs out of it.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I liked it for the price it was actually not that bad. The part that holds your phone or device definitely feels sturdy but too hard in my opinion I was afraid that it was going to damage my phone, and just getting it open wide enough to place the phone or camera in is really hard to do. The pivot allows for alot of movement and angles so that was nice and useful. It isn't the best tripod you can buy out there there are definitely better ones but for the low price I was definitely satisfied with it
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Horribly done CGI blood.  Just comically bad.  Roger Rabbit had better integration of effects and live action than this overproduced piece of garbage, and that was a couple of decades ago.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Boring beyond belief. I am a third of the way through the book and Iam not sure why the main character is telling the story of his youth. I wondering if the book has a plot.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This new update is HORRIBLE and unusable. I referred to the Weather Channel daily on my Kindle Fire ( and often more than once a day) because I do Search and Rescue. The new update is so bad that I will delete it as soon as I complete this review. The update looks like it was designed by a 2 year old.<br />None of the usable features were carried over in the new update. I only gave it one star because they had nothing lower as a choice.<br />If they were to charge money for the old app I would gladly purchase it. The garbage they are putting out now - they can't give me for free. Be smart and go find some other app...that is exactly what I am doing next.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A refreshing change from what I usually read. the author has Interesting writing style. I was drawn into the story in the first chapter.<br />Hard to put down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I got so sucked into the game that I finished in one night.  A great game that was well worth the money
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game but the movement it jerky and hard to get consist response.<br />Minion reactions to hitting obstacles is really funny
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game! The levels are pretty challenging and again very fun to play. I can see this easily being a time consumer, just needs more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's the best game ever it's like temple run but way more better you  should GET IT<br /><br />I play it all day
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Great like all of these games.  This one might be the best yet.  Awesome game.  These never get old for me.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Most amazing book I ever read. God uses this author to speak to people, relate the message of judgement-free love for one another.
B00BR476TG|5.0|The Preview is what got me to see the movie & then when I watched the movie, I was so angry because it was like a remake of the movie \\"Big Fish\\" with better graphics. This movie was pretty good until the reveal @ the end which made me so mad that I paid to rent it at all. What a waste of time and money.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is it is it is good brill wkw wooow super twelve yay whoah omg fallafel real wow yeah pop cartoon s yup peerr safe
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Easy to use and amazing picture quality. Fun to play with and great for anyone young and old. If your looking for a camera app then this is your app.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This product is incredible! The Fiio E5 is a must buy, you will not regret purchasing this product. The shipping is fast and the item comes just as described.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This clearly states HELP GUIDE. How can anyone think this is the actual game? Come on! I mean, really?<br /><br />YOU NEED TO THINK BEFORE YOU SUBMIT!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This Game Is Horrible. Wouldnt Even Let Me Make An Account. DON'T GET THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT IS WORTHLESS.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I choose a five star rating because I really enjoyed reading this book.  My likes and dislikes of the book were the characters I really liked and I highly recommend this book to young adults.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.  All around a great book.  John Green is a genius for writing this book.  I have no dislikes for this book!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I think it's a great book. Because of the characters. This book rock's. I think  you should get this book. It is the best book ever l love this book. I think it's a awesome book. Even now it's 8 or9 dollars it is worth it. You will love this book I promise. When l read this book I can't get my eyes off of it. This is the best book on my kindle fire HD. I LOVE THIS BOOK.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The actors and situations they faced were very much in time with what everyone has to deal with, love, compassion and differences. Very well done, not tedious
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This album has all my favorite songs by Kelly Clarkson!  I would recommend this to all the Kelly Clarkson fans.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|I bought this for my iPod and it worked great for three months, then lost its ability to pair with either of my bluetooth receivers, though my tablet pairs with them just fine. So I tried it on my iPod Nano, which produced a message saying \\"this device is not supported\\". Maybe that's because it is now defective and the Nano can't figure out what it is, but who knows? Then I tried it on my iPhone. No luck there either.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like to play a soothing game occasionally & Mahjong Deluxe is perfect! I also like the different tiles & choices.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I am still new to the tablet world, but I find this to be quite helpful. I am glad I purchased it!
B00407PO0K|5.0|I saw this movie on cable but it had been cut down so I purchased this to watch it uncut and I wasn't disappointed thanks I have been buying blu rays from amazon for sometime now and at great prices
B0099PCUIC|5.0|I love these and will be sad when I can't find them anymore!! I use mine every morning and bough 4 last time!!!
B0010WFGGA|5.0|I love Doctor Who, the writing is excellent and the actors are amazing, but one of the little noticed thing about the show is the amazing score, up there with Star Wars in my opinion.  Listening to this soundtrack will take you back to those amazing Doctor Who moments and its fun putting it on shuffle and trying to guess which episode the music goes with.  Fun times...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Better than 100 Floors but I wish it had a hint option. Walkthroughs are on YouTube. Can't wait for more levels!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|As most people who collect Star Wars minifigs will tell you, getting C3PO is kind of a pain, as he only comes with large expensive sets, UNTIL NOW!  Plus, you get 2 cool Tattooine stormtroopers (with really cool little silver and orange sashes).  The escape pod is pretty cool, and it kind of looks like the one from the movie, but I think when you buy this set, you buy it for the awesome minifigures it comes with, and they are good.
B00C2H24AI|4.0|It was a good book to read. There was a little sticky brown stuff on cover but overall a good book.  Thank you for prompt delivery.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is great for all ages and is really fun. All the kids will want to play it too because it is based on the movie. When I got it it was a little slow and laggy but with a few updates that will be fixed up. It is very addictive and it is my favourite game EVER :-D
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Straight to the point, does exactly what it is designed to do, be a calculator. Nothing fancy, but still very dependable. Well worth the download.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Full of twists and turns.  Exciting and unpredictable.  Characters fully developed and likable and unlikable at the same time.  Wonderful!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie.  I love that it came with all the copies too!  Enough to give one away to a great friend!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Be patient, dear readers.  The series has a slow beginning...so hang in there.....it's worth the rest of the story!  Now off to see what else Hugh Howey has to offer.  Great job Hugh!  Cant wait for more!
0345536886|5.0|I am always overjoyed when a new John Grisham book comes out! I hope they keep on coming on and on and on. And then on some  more.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|facebook is very neat:) lol and i have one its fun u can message and socialize with family or old friends!!!!! bahahahahahahaha thats my amazing review..... yep
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Amazon recommended this book to me. I'm 69 and I found it very melodramatic and trite.  There were many unlikely twists and illogical conclusions. The boy in the story
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is 'appsolutely' amazing! This game requires the mind to play, but you don't even realise it. I can play this game for hours on end! This game is worth the money I paid for it. It runs the app smoothly with only few errors occosionally! I strongly recommend this to anyone! Great for ALL ages
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|ww2 guns is the best gun app I like how it is like you are in ww2 . but it could use more guns .
B005Q1W10A|5.0|i love it  why do i have to write a set number of word my time is valuable and less is more
B0000067L3|4.0|When I was a kid, I loved this innovative and seminal Cream album. You had Rock, the Blues, Psychedelic beat poetry, all intermixed with instrumentation not typical of a Rock band at that time: brass, (\\"Pressed Rat And Warthog\\") glockenspiel (\\"Those Were The Days\\") and cello (\\"As You Said\\") along within your face volume, and lengthy jamming, which few bands could get away with.<br /><br />The remaster, which I picked up cheap,(not on Amazon) sounds(disappointingly) a bit thin to me.<br /><br />I think over time, your memory of how something sounded years ago (For this record, I remember loud, thick, and heavy) plays tricks on you.<br /><br />At the risk of committing heresy, the guitar tone, (especially the Fuzztone from Clapton) wears thin on the ears. Granted, there wasn't a diversity in guitar effects at the time this was recorded.<br /><br />The creativity and diversity in songwriting is stellar, and Cream remain iconic over a short career. But I just don't think this translates well to digital.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A real page turner.  The story takes hold and wont let go. Loved it and it's compassion.  Do read it.<br />Geri
B00AYB16EO|5.0|This a very funny film which spoofs other horror flix (most notably [[ASIN:B00AYB0VO0 Scream]] and [[ASIN:B002DMM9XE I Know What You Did Last Summer]]). If you've not seen those two, I recommend checking them out beforehand that way you get all of the highly-exaggerated and over-the-top references :)
B0015HOFZI|1.0|When I got it out of the box it was chipped and corner broke, bootlegged software, no usb cable, when plugged up it did not work. I bought this for my husband's birthday it was very disappointing.
B00005JGAB|5.0|This album is a classic of the genre. i love all songs. ramones the best punk rock band ever! 5 stars
B008VBYN80|1.0|This is a pleasant enough game and quite addictive, but suffers from the usual free game con where by you have to spend a LOT to get on in the game. When you consider you can get something like Civ V for $20  and can spend 40 or 50 on this 3screen derivative you can see who is making the money
B00005JGAF|5.0|this is my favourite ramones album. all songs are very close to me and remind about the different situations of my life.
1452101248|5.0|Finally, vegetarian recipes that are easy and unusual...I'm loving it.<br />This book is definitely a good choice for vegetarians (and non-veggies) looking for something a bit different.
B007R3B4RG|5.0|very good album! Thanks Mickey Leigh to that embodied the recording brother. all the songs on the highest level! Joey R.i.p
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Another John Corey page-turner from Nelson DeMille.  The story was intense from beginning to end.  Although the story was 95% anticipation and 5% climactic action, even the anticipation was gripping and enjoyable.  Anyone who has read any of the other John Corey books will probably enjoy this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a great game that took a great movie and made it into a game for all ages.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book gave me much insight into the lives of people I will never know.  They suffered so much and yet kept going.  All of Khalid Hosseini's  books have been great reads!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love it. I play it whenever my kindle is charged an  I Love  the new update no  there is water lava and animals I get so mad when my kindle dies and I just made a  castle
0802473156|5.0|It was everything I expected. I appreciate that it goes into detail of each language and then talks about how to discover your love language.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the awesomest game to exist. As a 12 year old child i recommend this game to all ages.<br />GOOD:<br />You can get different characters with bananas you collect by playing. While you<br />run you get different gadgets.<br />Awesome:<br />You can ride a unicorn and become a giant<br /><br />Chloe BUTLER
B008SOSBJM|5.0|Great album! Good to have Gwen back with No Doubt. Totally underrated, not sure why the sales were not there.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|Some good bits some awful. The gay romance seemed irrelevant. If there was a message, it was garbled to the point where us common folk ( the majority of the viewing public ), didn't get it. Great eye candy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the game a lot but I bate being Steve really a girl being Steve<br />it not fun play Steve I am a girl so I do not want to play Steve:(
B00CFA222M|4.0|Evil heartless villians, evil heartless giants, some romance, a handful of magic beans and voila! It was well worth watching.
B008OOYALE|5.0|so how likes a lighting dragon they rocky mine has 2000% of life so shadow girl still going to battle me
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Bang! boom! rat-a-tat-tat, who would have guessed. Same old stuff, but worth watching all the same. I need more wods so hows about blah, blah, blah.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Simple, yet addicting.  Just want to keep going and going to get that gold so can upgrade the car and track.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Who doesn't like guts, gore, camp, witches,heroes and hot heroines. I watch movies to escape the norm and have some fun. This puppy was a hoot!
B005LJK3AC|5.0|this is movie is so good, just brilliant.  I dont say that about comedies but this movie is very entertaining.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Dont buy if you want multiplayer because your not getting it!!! I made the mistake of -10 dollars and you shouldnt either.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game! It's very realistic, my only complaint is that it can take a while to load sometimes &amp; you have to wait for actions.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game super fun.It's like Temple Run but way more fun.I like how you have to get the bananas instead of the coins.
B000EYK4GC|3.0|Its nice enough listening but not revolutionary inndemoing your stereo, hi fi or close and play. Save your money for music you really  like
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Grate game<br />Loved to play. Fun challenges that are not to hard and not to easy fun for every and anyone
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I was surprised after I finished the first book. I really enjoyed it... I HAD to read this one as soon a  possible and I only wish book three was  out already!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Dustin Hoffman's [[ASIN:B00AZMFO6I Quartet]] is a rich film in so many ways. It captures the charm that comes from living a full life offering us a simple story about a collection of wonderful characters that is not limited to the five billed stars [Smith, Courtenay, Connolly, Collins and Gambon] who are all more than excellent. The grand Beecham House, which is just outside of London, is portrayed as an elegant home for retired musicians that is full of the most charming extras, many of whom are actually retired professional artists. Such a unique ensemble adds its own texture and charm to a story of relationships that tenderly confronts issues of aging and loss.<br /><br />The smart, witty British dialog pulls you in quickly and focuses your attention on the intricate interactions of these amazing seniors, making you more of a participant rather than an observer. Their collective energies are pushing for the success of an upcoming, annual celebration of Verdi's birth and his music that binds them together. I would not describe this as comedy but rather as a warm picture of life with many of the lighter moments of these elders elegantly addressed; I highly recommend it. I can't ever remember seeing a better ensemble cast and they challenge you to keep up as they warn you that 'old age is not for sissies'. Kudos to Hoffman.<br /><br />Bob Magnant is a novelist who writes about technology, globalization and Internet security, and US policy in the Middle East.
030758836X|5.0|Without giving too much away this book is amazing. I stayed up all night reading it, couldn't put it down. I don't usually like thriller's but this was different. Read it.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|Absolute RC Simulator has some pretty advanced features for a free app.  The simulator's touch-screen controls take a bit of getting used to, compared to an actual RC controller hooked up to your computer, but once you do, the planes are pretty easy to maneuver.  It's more like an RC simulator-simulator.  It's a lot of fun, and you can't beat the price.
B004XIVQ7Q|4.0|Kept me quiet for a few days, could not put it down, only for meals.Wonderful reseach goes into all Rutherfurd books
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This is a good movie it has a good lesson for kids to learn. The movie is good it teaches hope and team work to me I think it is good and is worth watching!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very fast moving, intriguing, as books by Baldacci are......read them all! Great read, can't wait to read the next one.
B0045D3N3O|5.0|All I'm going to say is Spike Lee & Denzel Washington, both  should have  received  Oscars, for this excellent ode to  Malcolm X !!! If you have never seen this film; now is the time to see it on this Blu-Ray 20 year  anniversary Blu_ray release !
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 8 times, and every time I see it, I am challenged to see how many tissues I need.  Just knowing that it is based on a true story adds to the enjoyment.  Oh, by the way, Richard Gere is great eye candy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game because of great graphics, and being in control of the city.  Yet I would love if you could put taxes on the city.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|great series, even better than twilight. more characters, more chaos, more fun. Movie also coming out August 2013! Also recommend Justin Cronin's The Passage series if like Twilight or Bones.
B000050XEI|5.0|Wonderful CD. Evokes calmness.  I listen to it as a background for when I do paperwork at work.  Highly recommend.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|This is book two in the trilogy. The authors says you don't need to read the books in order, this reader recommends you do.<br />Great characters and a gripping story that flows through each book.
B000002N3N|5.0|Wonderful CD. Evokes calmness.  I listen to it as a background for when I do paperwork at work.  Highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|such a good game. works well and is very fun. my kids love this game. it makes the reflexes good.
B000026FJ6|5.0|Wonderful CD. Evokes calmness.  I listen to it as a background for when I do paperwork at work.  Highly recommend.
B002LFCPLO|5.0|This is a very odd but interesting movie. Solid performances and a really original premise. Thought provoking, funny and at times moving
1620404869|5.0|I downloaded the book after seeing a trailer for the upcoming movie that my friend put on her FB page.  It's predictable in many ways (the ending for example) but it's fun and there are parts of it that just made me laugh.  When I was single and looking for my Mr. Darcy, my friends and I would watch that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" over and over again.  We would drown our broken-hearts in it and wonder if we'd ever find the right man so I can relate somewhat to the heroine of the book.  I read it in a day (on vacation) and couldn't wait to turn the next electronic page.  If you want something that is serious then this isn't the book for you.  If you want to read something light and funny get it.<br />BTW I would love for there to be a real Austenland-Disney for the grown up Princess.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Unfortunately, I was unable to continue on with this book as I found it too offensive.  I do not  know what happened after her first encounter with Mr Grey, but I had a pretty good idea, so I stopped reading it.  Whips and  all sorts of things sounded too ugly.
0151003084|5.0|The book is a wonderful read with beautiful illustrations. Being a fan of Gorey, I love it!  Furthermore, it arrive very quickly and in beautiful condition.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love this game and am at the 7th floor and am stuck. I have one key and screwdriver but just can't find anything else.  I'll keep trying, but starting to get frustrated.  It's fun though.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|But there are definitely flaws. First, it's not fully functionalon my Kindle Fire first gen. It's supposed to ne compatible but first day it would not play at all. It downloaded however. I uninstalled and installed again and this time it did play but very buggy. Constant freezes. Pretty much it's not playable on the first gen Fire.<br /><br />Second, due to the fact that I can't use it on my Fire, I downloaded it on my Samsung Galaxy S2 where it does play. There are freezes here as well however. I had no choice but to use the virtual currency to skip the Vector scene because it would always freeze not even allowing to go the previous screen. Good thing I had some free currency.<br /><br />When thw minion enlarges it froze as well and in every part of the game where I need to tilt the device. In order to complete the tasks it requires I meeded to unlock the horse which allows me to grab bananas by tilting, however this part of the game did not work for me so I have no choice but to skip over the section which is irritating because I would like to enjoy the full game not just sections.<br /><br />Third, in the beginning of EACH run, it won't allow me to move left or right for the first few seconds even if there are bananas to collecr to the sides. Even worse, if there is a barrier in front in those few seconds expect to lose but it won't allow me to move. After those few seconds it moves freely as I choose. Again, it's frustrating because it is a setup for failure if they put an obstacle right in the beginning.<br /><br />I still rate it a four because at least in my phone it's mostly playable and a very good game much like Temple Run or Subway Surfer where you run as far as you without falling or hitting anything. I also like the fact that you can challenge your friends who play as well. Overall I highly recommend it but not for the Kindle Fire first Gen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. It challenged me but also wasn't frustrating. I would love to see more levels in the future!
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Such a great deal for these classics. Amazing blu ray. I love it! They each come in their own blu ray case, but they are all in a slide so you can store them together. Sweet deal
B00CHMBQ0C|3.0|\\"Someone erased my e-mail, my phone records, my life.\\" Ben Logan (Eckhart) is living and working in Belgium when his daughter comes to live with him. She is not having a good time at all and lets him know. When Ben gets an e-mail from his work telling him to stop in and pick something up he is surprised when the building he works at is empty and no one knows anything about it. When he finds out that all the people he worked with are dead and he is the next target he must find a way to save him and his daughter as well as find out the truth. This is a good movie and is worth watching but isn't really as exciting as the plot sounds. The movie is very tense at times and really keeps you watching. The easiest way to describe the movie is a mix of Mission Impossible, Eraser, and The Net. The only thing that really bugged me in this was the daughter. She seemed to be bi-polar, really wanting her dad to help, then next second being mad that he did. Watch and you will see what I mean. Overall, this is very much worth seeing. It does seem to slow down in some parts but I do recommend this. I give it a B.
B000O77RLE|5.0|I love this movie, the soundtrack is amazing, it gives me goosebumps every time. I love the story as well, great perspective of the battle of Iwo Jima. The blu ray was done well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm always looking for free games on my kindle fire that are for adults, not only children.  I just passed level 4 and can't wait to move forward.  It's not too simple or difficult, but definitely requires some thinking.  I'm very happy with this download.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if you like temple run this game will knock your socks off! its even better!!  the minions are hilarious and the challenges are awesome! my daughter and I have played it for hours on end! thanks for the awesome app! oh if you had trouble loading it on your fire it took us about 8 or 10 times of shutting the kindle down. it freezes up during install at first.  it takes a few tries but well worth the effort. don't give up. its fun fun fun! :)
0812550706|5.0|I read this book back in the 90s. Since the movie is coming out in November I wanted to re-read it. And I fell in love with it all over again.
B00BUT5HJ4|5.0|Loved this! The artwork on the inside of the album is great and the vinyl itself sounds awesome! So glad I bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it. I love it. SO. MUCH. YES.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|This cable is perfect for a replacement, it works like it suppose to and I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Another Jared Leto movie to fall in love with, it's a little bit trippy, a little bit edgy, and interesting above all else.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|just got the game. i thought it would be a fun challange, so far it is leading up to my expectations. it makes me think a little an try to strategize how im gettin out of the room.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great companion to the film. Fun for all ages. Play as a minion and navigate the world of Despicable Me 2.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is SUPER FUN and easy to play. This game reminds me of temple run........  so if you like temple run.... you'll like minion rush!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have it on my macbook pro. my kindle. my iphone. its fantastic cant say anything bad about it. Especially because its free!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game to play when I am bored or when I'm on a road trip! Its easy to play and fun to play with family and friends! You can buy characters, hoverboards, outfits, and upgrades with the coins you earned in the game. You can also use or buy keys to keep yourself from dying. And most importantly, the upgrades of the scenery. I recommend this app to children and adults!
B000GCFX36|5.0|We all read about the treatment centers that the Super stars go to, like in Malibu! The truth is, most rehab programs are realistic, no glories, no spas, blah food, no super stars!  Poor Rachel kept searching for the luxuries of rehab, however she finally reconnects with reality!  Great read!  I have purchased this book 3 times in hard copy over the last 10 years, loaned them out and never got them returned. Finally downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. Now it's mine forever!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love to play this game on any mobile device. Its challenging and overall addictive. I highly recommend this game! :-)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty fun and easy to understand. At times it's frustrating when you're stuck but I guess all good games are.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was not only able to relive the events which defined my late teens but also the events that defined the nation and began the destruction of its innocence.  A gripping, engaging and imaginative look at things as they might have been.
B009X01ELC|4.0|It does everything advertised, and I like it a lot. Except for the fact when used in landscape it does not tilt back enough. I have their case for iPad and it tilts way back, making the screen very easy to and type on. It would be 5 star except for that.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly is a good replacement for Google Reader.  I am still getting used to using it but I think it will be a great substitute.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|I got it today.  The DVD looks good condition without any problem.  Thank you for mailing it to us.  I know the movie is very good and action the more fascinating story bout Hanna's childhood being fighter against bad witch.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This book was a fun read. The milieu and the characters were fun and interesting. The story owes, and acknowledges its debt to Starship Troopers (the book). This story was more complete than Starship Troopers.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Any Doctor Who fan will absolutely love this product! It works well and is well made. I have a blast &#34;protecting&#34; myself with the Doctor's trusty tool. Totally worth every penny. :)
B0054R6BFM|4.0|It's a very good book. In some parts it did make me wanna cry yet other parts I think that the main character Clay Jenson overreacted to many things Hannah Baker said.  Hannah brought a lot of the events that happened onto herself. She makes most things sound worse than they really are.  Other than that it's a great story that most teens can relate to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun really enjoyed this game. I highly recommend this game. This game is a must have. Cool cool cool
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is an awesome game!  Great free app with good graphics and sound.  If you like Temple Run you will like this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like others have said before me,  this game is just the right amount of challenging without needing outside assistance to solve it.  Nicely done!  I cannot wait for more levels!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very intriguing, but disappointing when it ends some what quickly.listen to other posts, and don't use hints if possible.two days stuck is better than only two days of game play.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Adapting books into movies is the new fad in Hollywood. With zombie mania taking over just about all aspects of multi-media, it's been getting increasingly more difficult to find a zombie tale that stands out. World War Z, based off of the popular novel of the same name by Max Brooks, is the first zombie movie in quite a few years that tries to take itself seriously. And for this reason I was intrigued. Okay, and maybe because Brad Pitt was starring in it. Zombies and eye candy, right? But anytime I hear about a movie being delayed for reshoots, I get nervous. Originally, World War Z had a December 2012 release date but due to extensive reshoots, it was decided to move the film to summer 2013. Before the movie hit theaters, I had planned on reading the book version, but once I learned that the movie was heavily deviating from the novel, I decided not to read it so I could go into the film with an open mind. I'm relieved I went with my instincts, because my 3 star rating probably would have been lower.<br /><br />Here's the thing. I liked the story and the general direction WWZ was going in. Gerry (Brad Pitt), a man who once had a dangerous job as a United Nations employee, gave it all up for his family. The movie doesn't get into much detail here, but you get the sense that Gerry was tired of spending long periods of time away from his wife and daughters. It's also not stated what he currently does for a living but I sort of assumed he was a stay-at-home father and appeared quite happy at making his girls breakfast and packing their lunches. I like that Pitt's character doesn't fall into one of the many stereotypical male characters, ya know, the one where the husband/father gives up his dangerous career to make his family happy but secretly yearns to get back into the field and jumps at the opportunity when it comes knocking at his door. Nope, I never got that feeling from Gerry; he appears content and happy with his role as doting husband and father. However, this all changes when zombies enter the picture. In order to protect his family, he is forced to go back out in the field to help find the origins of this devastating pandemic. Yes, I mean literally forced. While his old UN ties help get his wife and daughters to safety, his old boss has his own agenda. If Gerry wants his family to remain on the ship with protection and 3 square meals a day, then he must go. If he refuses, him and his family will be dropped back off into the ravaged, zombie-invested city they barely escaped. I definitely felt bad for him because seriously, what kind of choice is that?<br /><br />Let's back up for a moment. Gerry's previous job makes the beginning of WWZ somewhat believable as he navigates his family through the city of mass hysteria as people start changing into zombies within seconds. Although you don't quite know exactly what his previous set of skills were, you can tell by his calm, take- charge demeanor that he's had some kind of training. I actually liked his wife. Again going back to stereotypical characters, it was so refreshing to see that this wasn't the case with her. Instead of the typical, hysterical females we are used to seeing, Gerry's wife did everything he said, remained calm, no bitching or crying-- basically she appeared to have complete trust and faith in her husband and his abilities to keep them safe. Gerry's daughters on the other hand...I'll get to that later. I also liked the female soldier he meets up with later in the film. She was pretty hardcore, although she annoyed me towards the end when she...yeah, I'll get to that in a bit as well.<br /><br />The zombies themselves were pretty interesting, even though you don't get a real up close and personal look at them until the end. They also deviate from some of the characteristics we are used to-- these zombies are super fast, not slow. Also, they are not drawn to people by scent. What gets these walking dead fired up is sound.They kind of walk around in a dormant like state until they hear something. Cool, right? Yeah, well, it could have been cool if it wasn't for...I'll get to that in a moment. I promise.<br /><br />The last thing I liked about WWZ is the shift in priority \\"the cure\\" takes. There are so many zombie movies and books out there that focuses on finding the cure. But what if you find something that can camouflage you from the dead? I reviewed a zombie book earlier in the week called FIEND by Peter Stenson that focused more on the discovery of what they needed to do in order to NOT turn into a zombie rather than actually finding a cure. In WWZ, a kind of camouflage presents itself first, which takes precedence. I'm trying to be as vague as possible, but I guess what my point is, I like the twist and it is more realistic. After all, not all cures can be found in a week or a month. It may even take years.<br /><br />If you are still with me so far, thank you for being patient. Because I am sure at this point you are wondering what possibly could be so bad after talking so highly about the movie. Here is where it all went wrong.  Remember how I said World War Z is the first zombie movie in awhile that tries to take itself seriously? Well, one thing I CAN'T STAND is a movie that tries to take itself serious yet is filled with cliche after cliche. Like I said above, the movie starts off solid. Gerry and his family are stuck in city traffic when zombies start to make their debut. They steal an RV which is smart since it's (a) big enough to push other unmoving cars out of the way and (b) can possibly serve as a temporary home instead of being cramped in a car. I was slightly annoyed with Gerry's daughters; I guess since his wife didn't fit the typical stereotype, they figured to make his kids do all the whining and not listening. But whatever, small price to pay if the rest of the movie goes smoothly, right? Just when I am thinking this, one of his daughter's has an asthma attack. And it JUST so happens they forgot the inhaler at home. Why I didn't see it coming when they had talked about packing the inhaler before they left the house, is beyond me. But it should have been my first warning that more cliches were coming. The asthma attack forces them to stop at a grocery store that has a pharmacy inside. Okay, cool, they can grab the meds and some supplies. Once they go inside, it is complete chaos. People, including police officers, are running up and down the isles, ransacking the place. So what does Gerry and his wife decide to do? Yup, you guessed it. They SPLIT UP. WTF! Isn't like Survival 101, NEVER SPLIT UP??? Because you know what happens when they split up. Gerry's wife gets accosted, one of his daughters is screaming her head off. Oh, and let's not forget the RV is gone when they finally get back outside. Yup, cliche after cliche...<br /><br />...And the cliches continue. Once they learn that sound is what attracts the zombies, you can guess what the rest of the movie is filled with. Yup, people making noises over and over and over again. Here are a just a few examples:<br /><br />1) Riding rusty, SQUEAKY bicycles in the RAIN in hopes to get to the plane faster. Really??? They were better off walking quietly and letting the hard rain cover their footsteps!<br /><br />2) The epic scene in the trailer where the zombies scale the walls in hordes. The only thing that saved that scene was how awesome it looked. But you know what caused it? A whole CITY of people singing and if I remember correctly, the sound was even louder because the singing was being projected through speakers.<br /><br />3) Towards the end, Gerry and a couple of others need to get into a certain part of a lab that is overrun by zombies. Gerry says no guns since it will attract sound. Do they listen? Nope. Soldier chick not only takes a gun with her, but uses it. You're smart enough to imagine the consequences of that.<br /><br />4) Gerry appears to forget his own advice to stay quiet as possible as he and his little group: (a) walk on broken glass, (b) \\"accidentally\\" kick something across the floor, (c) push a creaky door inch by inch instead of just opening it quickly.<br /><br />World War Z had a lot of potential. The focus of the story was engaging, the non-stereotypical characters were refreshing, and the zombies were interesting. But why ruin a perfectly good movie with cliche after cliche? I'm not stupid. I get movies like this need to build suspense and I can handle a scene here and there. But when characters keep making the same mistakes over and over again, I can't help but get annoyed and extremely frustrated. Oh, and I forgot to mention the 3D. Or should I say, what 3D? I am not a huge 3D fan like some people, but after being blown away at seeing Man of Steel in that format, I figured what the hell. I now wish I hadn't because I can't remember one scene that was shot in 3D. A definite waste of a few extra dollars. A sequel to World War Z is apparently already in the works and I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. On the one hand, I can see the potential because of the way WWZ ends. But I cringe at the thought of sitting through another 2 hours of cliches.<br /><br />Mia @themusescircle.blogspot.comhe inhaler at home.

B00000760T|3.0|While only being a mild fan of the group, This compilation of hits does what it needs to do. It has all the best of WHAM or WHAM U.K. as they were known in the early days. The highlight of the disc is the \\"Everything She Wants\\" (Remix). The original is a great track, But the remix sets it off.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|This product does not appreciably increase the volume that is noticeable. I was hoping i could get more sound in my headphones through my cell phone. Attachment is easy but the volume control on my Widows lumina cell phone does about the same as this device. Combining the two didn't help.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|this CD took Stephen Stills retrospect of his music from solo career to crosby Stills and Nash and did it justice excellent music in my book definitely 5 stars
B008220BLG|5.0|My tween and I saw this in a theater. I was expecting it to be kind of lame. But, I enjoyed it SO much, that we bought it. It really has an excellent cast. Love the message premise of: 'change for the better IS possible'. I also really enjoyed hearing what the Zombie character is thinking to himself. It's very funny. Some of the scary creatures- are VERY scary. (Take the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz- and multiply by ten!) NOT a good idea for younger kids- could cause nightmares.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great way to kill time. Add me as friends I will send gifts love collecting dinosaurs game loft has a lot of good games
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Saw Paul live in Akron Ohio.  Had to get this DVD to revisit the performance and preserve the memory.  I'm a long time fan dating back to the late 60's and early 70's S&G concerts!  i knew this guy was a master of masters from the getgo.  I believe he was chosen to be what he brings to the world. God Bless Paul, and thank you for all the hard work and dedication from which we all benefit.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I've been playing this game since the first version. Absolutely love it. Definitely worth getting it, you'd be crazy not to.

0439023521|5.0|16 year old Katniss Everdeen wants nothing more than to support her family and keeping them fed even though food is hard to come by. When her sister's name is pulled to act as District 12's tribute in the hunger games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Katniss understands that to participate in the hunger games it's virtually a death sentence, but if she can win - it would change her life and those of her family and friends forever.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Hunger Games immensely.  Even though they made this book into a movie - and will continue with the trilogy on film, it is definitely worth reading. I give this book 5 big stars.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|the game requires a level of skill that I am yet to master but the game is very fun for all.
0786838655|4.0|Percy Jackson hates school - but that seems to be the least of his problems.  Creatures from mythical Greece have become larger in life in a very real way. Percy finds out that he is the son of Poseidon and has been accused of stealing his lightning bolt. Percy and his friends must locate the lightning bolt in 10 days or the Gods on Olympus will go to war.<br /><br />As both a first in a series as well as a book made to movie, I say that this is a really good read.  This book was filled with all sorts of action and still managed to broach the subject of a boy who had been left alone for far too long with an absentee father and being left at boarding schools.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Love the intuitive look and feel.  Previously, I didn't have an easy way to organize files, pictures, music, etc.  Nice app for those wanting a Windows explorer type app on android devices.  Thumbs up!
0385737955|4.0|Thomas wakes up in a strange place and can't remember anything past his name. Low and behold Thomas finds himself in what's called the Glade with a bunch of other boys - the Gladers.  The Glade itself is a large open area that is surrounded by tall stone walls with 4 doors. The Gladers know that every morning the doors open to reveal a maze and that every night they close and if you get caught on the wrong side of the doors when they close - you never come back. They also know that every thirty days and new boy is delivered.  On the second day of Thomas's stay in the Glade a girl shows up.....and nothing prepares the boys for what their future holds.<br /><br />I liked reading the Maze Runner because it reminding me tremendously of Suzanne Collin's Hunger Games trilogy. For boys who want to read books like the Hunger Games with a male protagonist - this is it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the best game ever.... it was so much fun. coolest game ever..... u should gt this app. it is worth it
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|Great movie of science fiction ,and romance.Acting from Diane Kruger and Saiorse Ronan  was impressive.Was everything  I expected. I highly  recommend to friends and family.Enjoy!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Great movie for a history buff! Steven Spielberg does an amazing job illustrating what it was like back then. Oskar Schindler is portrayed amazingly by Liam Neeson. All in all amazing movie!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I read. A lot. I have hundreds of ebooks on my kindle fire. And this app gives them filenames like Amazon does when it sends books to you over its system. Which sucks considering I use calibre and all my books have proper titles, author names, meta data and covers in my computer database. Having hundreds of books show up in this program as B00001k83954.mbp or whatever is not in any way helpful.<br /><br />If the company could do something about making sure books and documents show up with the titles and information that they were assigned before I loaded them on my kindle I'd maybe change my mind.<br /><br />Otherwise my advice is don't bother. As far as I can tell there just isn't a decent, usable file system for the kindle fire at all. WTF developers?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As someone who has worked in the medical field for 22 years, I found Eben's book believable and well balanced with self doubt and questioning. The read will probably be over some peoples heads in certain spots who do not have a medical background but the story as it is told does not hinge on those medical explanations or details. You either believe or you do not. I do.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|This movie really surprised me. It's storyline is top notch and a film that I would watch again! Great movie!

B000FC0V3E|5.0|I have not completed this book as of yet, but thus far it is a great read. I expected it to be as it is written by Hemingway. I was not dispointed!
B00AW57L96|4.0|An enjoyable read by an Australian author. With Aussie references, I found it a little slow at the start but it all comes together unexpectedly for a satisfying and juicy read. Recommended!
B000FC2PKG|2.0|Although the book was well written, it was heralded as a D. D. warren novel and that was completely misleading.  D. D doesn't put in an appearance until page 151. After that, she appears only sporadically when the author seems to remember that it was supposed to be about her. I was very disappointed.
B00A04O6PQ|5.0|The Lightning Thief is a fantasy adventure book about a demigod boy named Percy Jackson.  He is accused of stealing Zeus' master bolt. The book is about his quest to find the bolt and reveal who took it. If you're looking for a good action adventure book with some humor mixed in, you will LOVE this book. The Lightning Thief is different than anything I've read before because it combines modern activities with ancient Greek mythology. Percy battles monsters and Greek Gods, while traveling to the Underworld and Mt. Olympus. Mt. Olympus is on top of the empire state building in present day New York. I like this book because the characters are my age (11-12 years old) and we have the same sense of humor. I think the book is way better than the movie and I would read it time after time.

B00C5XBAOA|4.0|My daughter loves these dolls! Yes it is true that the heads pop off often---Just put them back on and don't give the dolls to your child if they put a lot of things in their mouths. Nonetheless my daughter loves Sophia and loves playing with these dolls in the Sophia castle!
B000J10ERO|5.0|Came in plastic wrap also in good condition. I remembered watching this on the silver screen or theater as they would say. Didn't look good at first, but when I look at the main character who plays Superman, then it got to me. Brandon Routh do look like Superman as I would hope he be. The story isn't all that interesting & good when I watch this.

B00847KFDS|3.0|I love John Fogerty when he was with CCR,  The music on this cd was pretty good but I probably would not have purchased it if I had heard it first.  I did like reading the booklet that came with it.  It gave a lot of background on the why and how he wrote each song.  I really liked that his sons were on the CD.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book reminded me of a young reader's mixture of Big Fish and X-Men. I was very engaged in the story in the first half of the book but found myself skimming the end as the children teaming up against the \\"villians\\" was a bit too young reader-ish for me. Overall I liked it. I hear it will be made into a film directed by Tim Burton. I think it will make a fantastic movie!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Not a bad book, worth the time and effort to read. The character seems real world and is a different from what you are use to. Worth the money and it is at the right price.

B0000A0DXA|1.0|Brian Sieve failed to imitate the elements of the story from Boogeyman. This movie has hardly anything to do with Boogeyman. The story-line is inconsistent at times, the movie seems underdeveloped, and there are flaws that are rife throughout.
B00BOXZAG6|2.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Wow, what a mess. Judging from the trailers, Upside Down had the potential to be really good. The concept of two worlds with opposite gravity is one that I've never seen before and it looked like a strong basis for a good story. Unfortunately, Upside Down never takes advantage of what it could have been because the entire film feels flat. The story, the acting, everything, it all feels so lifeless and dull. Add that to the fact that they do a very poor job of explaining how the gravity between these two worlds work and you have a mess of a film. I actually had to look up the rules of their gravity once the film was over to get a better understanding of how things worked. They tell you at the beginning of the movie, but they kind of blaze through it and it doesn't give you enough time to process because you haven't seen these rules in action yet.<br /><br />In the movie they kept saying that there were two worlds - Up Top and Down Below - but it never felt that way. Instead, it always felt like one world that was split in two halves which resulted in their gravitational pulls being switched. Tell me this, if two worlds really were circling around each other, would the people be able to see the towns and cities of the other world in detail? No, that wouldn't make sense. Well, would they be able to be connected through a huge corporate structure called TransWorld? No, that would require a really, really, really tall building. This is what I mean. Instead of labeling these as \\"two worlds\\", they could have come up with a solid back story for one world instead of not giving us anything for either of them. The only thing we truly know about these worlds is that Up Top is rich and prosperous while Down Below is poor and dirty.<br /><br />Upside Down follows the story of Adam (Jim Sturgess), a man who grew up in Down Below. As a child he met Eden (Kirsten Dunst), a girl from Up Above. It's law that people from DownBelow are forbidden to speak to those from Up Above. Well, over time, these two gradually form a relationship until they eventually get caught. After a major fall, Adam doesn't see Eden for ten years. While at work one day he sees Eden on a game show and sets out to find her. It doesn't take long before he finds out that she is suffering from amnesia which is a result from her fall ten years ago. Adam's mission has now changed into a journey to win back the heart of the woman he loves all while not getting caught by the authorities.<br /><br />While I originally thought the romantic story between Adam and Eden looked captivating, I now realize that it made Upside Down wasted potential. Part of this is because Adam and Eden aren't terribly interesting characters. Not only that, but the scenario of two individuals being separated because of social class has been so overdone in film that in no longer seems to have any sort of impact on me. I found that I was more interested in the world and how it worked and I really didn't care about either of these characters. In fact, the only character I actually liked was Bob (Timothy Spall), an employee of TransWorld that Adam befriends. Sadly, he is only in the film for a few brief scenes.<br /><br />The things is, there were times where Upside Down embraced what it could have been. You'll find these occasional moments of brilliance during the films 107 minutes, but, sadly, there's not enough of it. There was a point towards the end where Adam was in Bob's house and they were mixing matter from both worlds to create a gravity resistant material. When I saw that my jaw literally dropped and I couldn't help but ask myself why there wasn't more intelligent, thought provoking scenes just like it. Everything goes back to the wasted potential and I feel like Upside Down could have been a brilliant film had it been done right.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Upside Down isn't all bad. Visually the film is gorgeous and I wouldn't have aproblem saying that Upside Down's visuals are its strongest attribute. There's an obvious difference between these two \\"worlds\\" and I think the grey and yellow/gold contrast each other beautifully. My only complaint about the visuals is that, at times, I felt like Down Below was too bright. Whenever Adam was walking outside I found that I had to close my eyes because they began to hurt. It was really weird. I think part of this is because there's so much grey and white in the surrounding frame that it became slightly overwhelming. Other than that, though, the film is truly a thing of beauty when it comes to the world(s) these characters are inhabiting.<br /><br />Overall Score: 4.25/10 - Unfortunately, you need more than some pretty colors and landscapes to make a film enjoyable. Upside Down is another one of those films that attempts to do so much, but accomplishes so little. The plot was boring and, at times, predictable and the two leads weren't anything to write home about either. While Upside Down may have had a solid idea, it's brought down by a poor script and a somewhat generic story. I really wanted this film to work out in spite of all the negatives comments I read while watching the trailer, but that's not what happened. While I can't say that I would watch it again, I would recommend giving it a viewing on the visuals alone. While it may not be the best film in the world, it's one of the most visually beautiful movies I've seen in a while.

I'm also wondering about the multi-device opportunities since I have a Fire, a droid phone, and of course the PC.
B005YPJ62E|5.0|I bought this audiobook on Audible.com so it probably won't show Amazon verified purchase. This book is unlike other audiobooks I've ever listened to. I believe the author herself is narrating. Her voice is soothing yet invigorating. At times, there is music playing in the background. If you are having troubles in your life, feeling unmotivated, just broke up with someone, listen to this. The Power gives you a new energy that you didn't know you were capable of having. Good luck

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Wow! I can't get over how good these headphones sound, look and fit. I am usually very critical of audio gear as I can really appreciate great sounding equipment. In the audio world usually you get what you pay for with exception of some ridiculous overpriced brands. So it's rare that I come across something that is truly a bargain and that's what these 7506's are. For $80 I don't think there is anything that can beat them. The sound is like butter, smooth and accurate and very detailed. Are there better sounding headphones? Sure but your going to have to spend $300-$500 to do it, yeah their that good. Bonus for me is their not corny looking like beats audio or some of the new sets out there. I've been wearing them for several hours now with no fatigue issues as the fit is really good and I have a really big head.<br /><br />I've known about this model for years as I've seen many professionals using them in radio and in studios and just assumed they were company issued. Now I understand why I see them used so much they are truly a great value.<br /><br />Stop reading and just buy them you will not be disappointed.

0802473156|5.0|\\"The object of love is not getting something you want, but doing something for the well-being of the one you love.\\" Statements like this and many others are the treasures that fill this book. This book is a must read for anyone who is married or even considering it. It is full of real life accounts from people who had problems in their marriage, but eventually overcame them. These stories give not only ideas on what to do, but inspiration and desire to build a strong marriage. The 5 Love Languages are something Gary Chapman came up with after years of marriage counseling. He didn't come up with these out of thin air, he had so many experiences with relationships and discovered common love patterns among spouses. He concludes that there are 5 different languages of love that people speak. A love language is the way a person feels love from another. That could be through acts of service, or physical touch. Discovering the way your spouse feels love will save a relationship. I thought to myself, \\"Ok, the 5 love languages are listed on the back cover; what's the point of reading it now?\\" But after reading in depth about each love language my eyes have been opened on exactly what I must do to accommodate my wife's love language. The book gives so many examples; at least one of them is sure to be your case. If you didn't realize what you were doing wrong, the examples will spark that within you. I took notes and underlined many passages. At the end of each chapter he asks an open ended question to make you think about how you can apply what was discussed. This book is the service manual for any marriage. Study and apply what you read and I can assure you a full \\"love tank\\" leading to a better marriage.

1590171993|4.0|Academe is such a fertile breeding ground for the full range of human foibles that it is difficult to craft a novel about it without irony. Thus, most academic novels follow in the tradition of Mary McCarthy's pungent and corrosive wit, as revealed for example in \\"The Groves of Academe.\\" In \\"Stoner,\\" John Williams (an author roughly of McCarthy's generation) takes an entirely different approach. This is a book whose hero cares and cares deeply about the principles that lie behind the scholarly and pedagogical profession. According to John Williams, who opens the book with a quick retrospective of Stoner's life, \\"He did not rise above the rank of assistant professor, and few students remembered him with any sharpness after they had taken his courses.\\" But this unlikely hero--a kind of Willy Loman of the academy--will be remembered well by all who read this book.<br /><br />The novel's strength derives from two things: first, that respect for the academic enterprise does not blind Williams to all the many ways that it fails to live up to those ideals. What might turn to irony in the hands of another writer becomes in this book the source of complexity and finally tragedy. It has been said that irony is a sign of \\"bad faith\\"; that makes sense since our laughter signals our complicity in and our submission to compromise. This is not a book that compromises.<br /><br />The book's second great strength lies in its style, sensitivity to language, and lyricism. (If you have not yet read it, please skip the next two paragraphs as I must give away a little of the plot.) The example I want to describe comes from the point in the center of the novel where William Stoner, son of hardscrabble Missouri farmers, beleaguered by destructive colleagues and departmental plots, and coming to terms with the fact that he will never achieve his most treasured ambitions as a scholar, suddenly and unexpectedly finds joy.<br /><br />The joy comes from his falling in love. The timing and build-up to this event, monumental in his small life, is superb. It begins when he glimpses that a young female colleague, whose work he respects enormously, may actually have some warmth and friendship in her feelings for him. After this realization, he makes his way home: \\"The smell of smoke from trash burning in the back yards was held by the mist; and as he walked slowly through the evening, breathing the fragrance and tasting upon his tongue the sharp night-time air, it seemed to him that the moment he walked in was enough and that he might not need a great deal more. And so he had his love affair.\\" The burst of joy in that final sentence gives way to a long section of the book which gradually conveys the revelation that his feelings are completely returned and a sustained description of fully experienced happiness: \\"In his forty-third year William Stoner learned what others, much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.\\"<br /><br />Of course that wise observation contains within it the foreshadowing of the relationship's end, which comes--as all ends in this patient and comprehensive novel do--in its own good time. Just as William Stoner's great virtue lies in his commitment to his principles, John Williams never toys with his readers. Another amazon reader praises this book for its \\"rectitude,\\" a wonderful word to characterize it. But don't let the severity of that word put you off. Who knew that \\"rectitude\\" could be so marvelous and absorbing?<br /><br />There is, however, a little \\"bad faith\\" in this book, which emerges in the character of Stoner's wife Edith. In my judgment she is far too much the mad housewife, mumbling to herself (which she does). This alternately silent and shrill woman becomes the bane of Stoner's existence: She endures his love-making only as a means to an end; at first indifferent totheir child, she later uses her as a weapon in their marriage; she takes over the only little refuge Stoner has made in his study (in their house that she forced him to buy) and appropriates it as her own studio--forcing him to work and sleep in a tiny porch where she casts off their old furniture; she loudly bangs on the piano to distract him from his work; she feigns a biting indifference to his affair (\\"your little coed . . . I never can remember her name\\"); she manically and selfishly changes course again and again. And yet at the end of the novel, the two characters make a kind of peace with each other (\\"They had forgiven themselves for the harm they had done each other, and they were rapt in a regard of what their life together might have been\\"). This slow reversal shows that Williams in a sense recognizes that such a damaging marriage is entered into by two people, both of whom really are at fault for its failures.<br /><br />I wish he had revealed that complexity in Edith earlier in the novel. But this is truly not a fatal flaw but more of a lapse. Other characters--Hollis Lomax, Gordon Finch, Katherine Driscoll, Charles Walker, and many more--are presented with great integrity as individuals with both flaws and virtues in this fine and moving book.

B0090SI4LU|4.0|I never knew Stephenie Meyer wrote anything besides Twilight until I saw a coworker reading The Host one day. She told me it was Meyer's attempt at writing something for a more mature audience. I knew I wasn't going to read it, but I did want to see the movie when it hit DVD.<br /><br />The concept is that aliens have taken over most of earth. They are a peaceful race and humans serve as hosts for the alien souls. The conflict arises from a group of humans who live in hiding who are confronted by one of their own who was recently captured, all while the alien seekers are trying to find them. Could an alien switch sides?  Is it possible for the human soul to still be alive inside their body? If so, can the human soul interact with the alien now living in its body?<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan does a great job in the lead as Melanie (the human) and Wanda (the alien). Her voice is in a slightly different register to help you determine which is speaking, though only the alien as function of her mouth when she takes over, and Melanie is an interval voice. She is surrounded by a young cast of mostly unknowns - but that's pretty much how the cast of Twilight started out too. I did recognize Boyd Holbrook only because I'd watched him on The Big C and recently in Behind the Candelabra.<br /><br />For those who prefer their alien fiction a little more fast paced, blow-them-up, giant space craft, war-type films, you'll hate The Host. There is nothing more than a bit of blood shed. The aliens themselves are even tiny, white, sea urchin-looking things. If you are looking for a different and interesting teenage romance, Meyer has served you that dish again just as she did with her previous books.  And there are some new and interesting concepts here when it comes to the whole romance thing: Melanie's lover, Jared, is there in the group. And another member of the group falls in love with Wanda. How does Melanie get Jared, her young brother, and the group to realize that she's still alive in there? Can they save her? What will happen to the alien?<br /><br />There are also a lot of underlying themes about the soul and reincarnation to explore here, which really makes this a serious and phenomenal film. Look past the young inexperienced cast and the fumbling romance stuff, and you will be rewarded with a film that is worth the watch. There's a great line in the film where the humans have been experimenting violently with extracting the aliens from the humans.  Wanda tells them it will come out peacefully if they just basically ask it to. It's very true of the way humans look upon those who are different or those who could be a threat. We act out in anger.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I loved making fun of Twilight even though I watched all four films.  The Host has given me a new respect for Meyer if she continues to write stuff like this.ive in there? Can they save her?

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|This movie keeps you in your seat since the begining to the end, a lot of emotion. It really worths to seeing it. I fully recommend this movie.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|We love the movie that is why we bought it! It came sealed and it is working just fine! Thanks!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoy this game to pass the time. The price is right and helps to keep your mind sharp. Well recommended!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I have been listening to the cd everyday going to work.i love a lot of songs! Great price and product!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I bought this book because a girlfriend of mine reads this author.  I am not a big fan of this type of book especially a book about teenagers but I read it because it was recommended.  If you like this type of read then I would have to say it was good and well written.  I did enjoy it but would not seek out something like this again.  I am giving it 4 stars for those people that do enjoy teenage romance type novels.  I think it was a bit long and drawn out but I can't think specifically what parts I would leave out entirely.  In general I think there just was a lot filler type writing that could have been left out.  I found myself saying \\"yeah, yeah who cares\\" several times.  Either I missed it or it was never completely addressed is the \\"why did she want to do it\\" part.  I understand part of it but it never really comes right out and says this is the entire problem the girl was having.  Plenty of times when the author goes back in time and is speaking the Emily part I think it could have been more conclusive as to all the reasons. She also eludes to the fact that perhaps Emily was gay.  Maybe it was a part that I was bored with and I missed the entire reason.  I would wait to buy this when the price goes down maybe.  Again, if you like teenage romance novels, this is for you.  I am not big on romance novels period.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I like the story line that she started but the way she ended this particular book is so disappointing...i felt like the story went down in circles and the result was nothing and on to the 4th book i guess.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Works and runs great on my Kindle, better than on the PS3. Great way to play on the go but really its become my preferred method.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great game it is the best game on my Kindle fire it's like league of legends, you don't have to spend money on this app unlike a lot of the apps on the kindle.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is the worst thing that I played. It won't let me get the update, and I really want the update,the London one.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I love every part of this album. It is so different from other music, yet so similar. Blew my mind the first time I listened to it (on Youtube!) and I knew I had to get the album.
0345522478|5.0|The is one of the best modern fantasy books that I have read in a while.<br /><br />It holds many similarities to the Dresden Files: witty dialogue, fun characters, and magic.<br /><br />It's just cool.
B00AB7IA1S|2.0|if your going to sell a game make sure people can complete the game. the toranato fans are glitched in the game and the ships run into them like walls so you can NEVER complete the game. You can't get to the middle of the game before your stuck. NOT WORTH A DOLLAR TILL THEY FIX THE GLITCHED FANS.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I loved the storyline and drew....he was hilarious but I do feel like the story was too short like there should be more like the book was over just as it began....but overall this is a great read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it is on my kindle fire but I reconnect it for kids of all ages and adults cause my mother and father is entertaind by this app
0345529057|5.0|Inspired to read books which I don't usually do by the tv show. Great series. Yea yea yea yea yea yea
B00BKU9ZFU|4.0|Nice group of recordings. I was hoping to hear a bit more vocal drama or a bit of risky interpretation.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Anyone that plays Bingo and other places will enjoy this game with interesting sounds and speed.  I think this is one that can tech all age groups the fun of Bingo and maybe even speed up a few brain cells.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Van Morrison is one of my all-time favorite artists. This collection is so good. I listen to it over and over and never tire of it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Not at his the best, but still a good read. I enjoyed reading it and I do not regret buyng it.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|I know it only cost 99 cents but it doesn't work on my original kindle fire. It is a complete rip off and I wanted my money back after I bought it. The problem is there is no option for a return. I am a loyal Amazon customer and I'm extremely upset about that. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU OWN AN ORIGINAL KINDLE FIRE!  The 99 cents won't break me but you can bet I won't purchase another app from the Amazon store. Stick with the original kindle fire e-mail app. At least you can read it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have to say I am a very picky reader but this book had no problem hooking me! I could not put my kindle down once I started reading .
0307474259|5.0|If you want to know why you are overweight and what to do about this read this book, it explains it all. If you just want the answer and not the reason you dont need this book I will tell you right now. Carbs it what makes us fat, its that simple.
B009LJZJL6|5.0|Great read. Nicely bound. A true keeper. I won't loan this copy out like I did the last one I never got back.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Good music, I like drake and this is one of his best cds, good buy. If you like drake buy it.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|I needed this for a recent trip to France. I have a few Fast F-mount lenses and with a f1.8 and at 2.7x times focal length  I got some great low light shots. There are issues with Lens compatibility but I found it satisfying to have the small challenge and don't feel as if I missed any shots because of manual focus or center metering limitations.
1401225756|4.0|I haven't read much in the way of graphic storytelling, but I dig Neil Gaiman. I enjoyed this volume a lot and will be reading through the series. It took me awhile to get into the groove of how to read graphic text, but once I did it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Could definitely tell when the artist changed, though - unfortunately, I like the first artist's style way better, but overall it's still enjoyable.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting volume 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game<br /> It's very fun and I enjoy to play with friends. And my 2 year old cousin has the best time with the app so ya I love subway surfers
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The book is very good--  I enjoyed the characters and the simultaneous chapters on Jamie and Lydia and 86.  A difficult  story about the orphanage but an important story to understand the mental health implications to the victims.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Great deal for three classic sci-fi post apocalypse films.  Some of Mel Gibson's earliest work.  Prompt delivery and a neat case sweetened the deal.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|lots of fun to figure out the clues and escape! some of the levels are easy and some will drive you crazy.
B00AW57L96|4.0|A well written book full of plot twists and turns, a little bit predictable in parts but overall very enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its so fun!! the best part is that its FREE but with some purchises get it now if u like the movie!!!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Everything about this film screams competent, but ultimately, it's just a generic thriller that provides a mildly entertaining couple of hours. No depth to any of the characters and thus we really don't care what happens to any of them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best if u ever played subway surfers its basicly the same its fun for all ages I'm eleven and my parents luv this game get this game
B000GCFG7E|5.0|No politics this time. Lots of action and characters you can really hate and others you will really care about!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is the best app for sleep &amp; relaxation. So many wonderful choices and you can mix them to play together! (So smart!) My personal favorite combination is the purring sound mixed with the jewelry box tune. Sweet and innocent-feeling combination, like a carefree childhood.<br />Have already referred friends to this app, and they are loving it too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow!  What a book - so glad  read it. Would definitely recommend it. One if the best I have ever read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I hesitated to buy this game, since I usually stick to whatever's free.  But  a buck is a more than fair price for the hours of strategy gaming this title provides.  Considering the fact that it costs less than two arcade plays of Mortal Kombat.  The different disease types extend the gameplay quite a bit.  The zombie expansion (free!) is challenging, extending the gameplay a level deeper.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|hate it. hate it. hate it. hate it. it used to be one of my favorites.  it used to be informative.  now its a joke.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Great movie... ultimate transformation from super villain to super dad.  Not so unlike many self absorbed men who become fathers.  Easy to relate to... ego, desire to look tough, peer pressure to hang with old buddies... vs real heart tugging kids.
1935670913|1.0|Locke's strategy is...odd. After reading through this book I found myself wondering how in the world such a strategy could even work. To be totally honest, I don't think Locke's system could possibly work for 99.999% of authors out there.
B008602KQI|4.0|read the books before i saw the movie in theaters. back then, i was more critical of the adaption. watching the movie tonight when the books were less \\"fresh\\" in my mind lets me be less sensitive to the finer points of this book that could not be done in a single movie. another review suggested that the adaptations could have been done on tv--like, maybe as a mini series on cable. well-yeah-but that would have to have had to have been done as a mini series (closed world-it is a trilogy)rather than as detailed, ongoing series with much unfolding and still being written as with game of thrones or walking dead. within the confines of this medium, the adaptation is very good. the essential spirit of the first book was put forth faithfully with \\"flirts\\" for readers and amply for non readers. my wife did not read the books and thought the movie was great. since the themes and plots become more complicated in the subsequent books, i am more concerned about the adaptations of the other 2 books yet look forward to them.
0062238868|4.0|As has already been stated many times, the book is incredibly detailed, and truly places you with Chris in the field. I especially enjoyed his wife's point of view during various times. However, some of the detail was overkill, and the book gets a monotone, &#34;one note&#34; feel. Good read, not great.
B004GXJBWA|5.0|Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson's birthday-he loves penguins-this is well constructed at a good price and he loves it.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Still one of the most thrilling films Hitchcock made.  Mistaken identity makes Grant the victim of attempted murder by a spy gang.  Bewildered by the nightmare he finds himself in, he sets out to try to find his doppel ganger.  This takes him across the country by train (remember train travel?), finds him attacked by a crop duster in a cornfield, and climbing over the Mount Rushmore National Memorial with the beautiful Eva Marie Saint.  Essential viewing if you are a Hitchcock or Grant fan.
1476712042|5.0|these are great books to read , i just enjoy getting them in the mail. they are so enjoyable to read , that when i get them i cannot put them down. and when i do i am so sad that i finished it that i am looking for another to order . so that i have another book to read.
B001THZAAI|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I watched the dubbed version and the subtitles, which did not match the dialogue, came up on screen.  Chaos.  The second time, maybe I got it right.  French dialogue, english subtitles.  It was hilarious.  I have watched it twice since and still find it brilliant.  But then I love French films ....
B002ZG98C8|4.0|i like it . it was interesting to see steven segal as a bad guy, i don't recall a movie where he played one until i got this one. so i really enjoyed this one as i am a fan of steven segal and i own at least 42 dvds of his movies. so this was a surpise.
B00AEBB97S|5.0|Hitchcock the genius brings together the two most beautiful stars on the planet, Cary and Grace, in a mystery about a copy-cat cat burglar who has stolen the retired Cary Grant's style.  If you haven't seen this film, you are missing one of the greats.
0425263924|5.0|these are very good books when i get them i cannot put them down, they are soo good. it only takes me a couple of days to read them and then i'm waiting for the next one to come out.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|There are plenty of comprehensive reveiews already about this fine disk. I will not attempt to match them, word for word. I just want to say that this disk is completely accessible, & recognizable to those of us of a certain age, yet at the same time entirely fresh & new. Comparisons of Brittany to the Queen of Soul & especially Janis are 100% on point. For me, it is like she is channelling Joplin.<br />Yeah, this is recorded rough. Obviously, some are disappointed by that. I am able to write it off as \\"charmingly underproduced.\\" Has anyone ever listened to the old Stax records? Much less going back to Robert Johnson or Ledbelly? I'm OK if they continue to leave the rough edges on, or evolve by providing a crisper recording next. I just can't wait to see what they do next. Please, record again soon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a pretty good game extremely addicting defiantly worth the time cant stop playing it the second movie is funny as heck
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Just got Kindle Fire.  This ap is one of the first I wanted to put on.  Family on a trip and I could easily keep in touch.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Born in 1941 I always have been interested on WWII and Lindberg. This was a great look into war and effect on the US and the world
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|I could not play. I kept typing in names but nothing happened. I will never download this again. It is horrible. Don't download this.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Doesn't take much to play but still fun.  Appeals to kids and the young at heart Or anyone who loves penguin.
B0095MVOMC|3.0|It's fun and easy, but it did stump me a few times. The hints were great when I was having a tough time. Lookin' for a way to waste time and test your brain.. I'd recommend this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought the game was really good it wasn't too difficult but it wasn't super easy either. I enjoy it
B000P6PVLC|3.0|It took until the end before I connected the dots and it started to make sense.  I still wonder about the naked teenaged Japanese girl.  Seems like that didn't fit in with the rest of the gun stories.  I wouldn't choose to see it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I felt it was fun and it gave a good challenge as the levels went up. It makes you think to complete the levels. Have fun!!
0062080237|5.0|I have read this book years ago. And I have since lost my copy but i wanted Wendy to read it. I love Neil Gaimans work. I hear they are making a series based on this novel! I'm pretty excited about this.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|The author dispels some commonly held beliefs about how we cave in to temptations and how we avoid them and she uses scientific studies to back up her assertions. She also sets out strategies for improving willpower and making better choices, and with all the problems we have with obesity, substance abuse and others, there is some real value in these pages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun, addictive, and has you think outside the box. The only resaon I gave it 4 stars instep of 5 is because they need to add more levels each undate.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and very affordable to have despicable me minion rush is awesome and over the top five
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This is one of my favorite books with good reason. It is never to complicated and even though it is in the future many day to day problems come up. Like the stepmom stepdaughter situation. Does Cinderella ring a bell. Anyway read it nomater who you are!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A story told from the dog's point of view.  Well written and it speaks to the heart! Such a wonderful story that really opens before the reader!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|All positives, no negatives. I like the way you can order it by songs, and I also like how it has a link to the MP3 Store. I wish you could download your cloud playlists independent of the songs, but I suppose that's a moot point, unless... If they could make it so that anytime you are playing something from the Cloud, if it would automatically play the next song in the queue from your device if it's on your device, and then switch back to the Cloud for whatever isn't on the device, now that would be cool. If I think of something to add, I'll come back to it. Cheers, Jerry
B000UX6OHK|5.0|I bought this watch on a European vacation.  Paid way too much, but I LOVE it.  My favorite souvenir!  It's feminine, but not too feminine with the large face.  It sits flat to my wrist so it's not bulky.  The bracelet was crazy big for my tiny wrist, but I had it sized at the Swatch dealer I purchased it from.  Over the years, it has gotten scratched and has a little crack in the face...disappointing, but I still wear it every day.  It's too beautiful not to wear it daily.  I'm considering buying a second to wear for special occasions.  However, I still get great compliments on this watch despite the condition problems on the face.  The clasp has gotten looser over the years, but it only pops off when I knock it against something and the face has stayed intact despite having fallen on the floor a few times.  Finally, I've had it over 4 years and have yet to replace the battery.  It has been a great fashion investment for me.
B005GK6QAM|5.0|This sound just like it was recorded in the '80's - in a good way. I saw Joe Lynn Turner opened for Europe in Washington, D.C., in the '80's and his voice sounds just as good now as it did then. If you are a rock from that time or just like music from late '70's - '80's and early '90's - you'll like this. He covers a couple songs from Michael Bolton (covered by Cher), Diane Warren and Desmond Child. A lot of good stuff here.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Wanted a sharpener to keep in my tool chest so I have something handy to sharpen my knives and this is perfect. Works great, no complaints.
006178480X|5.0|I always enjoy James Rollins' books and this one was no exception.  I did not care for some of the theology and it definitely doesn't change what I believe, but it was an essential part of the book.  This book has it all - history, intrigue and science all wrapped up into an exciting story.  The characters have become old friends as I've read the Sigma Force series, and this helps the reader enjoy the book.  Can't wait for his next book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A testament to faith, family, patriotism, willpower, perseverance, comeraderie and so much more.....A must read especially for young people. Terrific!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|We like numerous others have become used to twisting the cord around the kindle to try to coerce to charge.  After letting the kindles charge overnight, they were not even half way charged.  When talking to the amazon rep, I found a help that showed how to utilize 'battery hd' to help with this charging issue.  Since our warranties are up, I thought I would try the free fix before the discounted prices given by Amazon.  I followed the post's instructions and It WORKED on the first Kindle.  It was fully charged in less than the 4 hours and it held the charge.  Now I am testing again on the 2nd kindle but am expecting the same results!
B00BNZN27E|4.0|These are 5-star performances. The 4-star rating is for the incompleteness of the set. Sony had a great chance to release ALL of the Bruno Walter material in their archives in one go. But they chose to just do it - well, in a half-you-know-what manner. The real loss here are the stereo Columbia Symphony recordings of the late Mozart symphonies. Yes, the NY Phil ones are great, but the stereo Haffner (35), Linz (36) and particularly the Prague (38) are such superior performances I just can't fathom why they are not here. We are talking about two or three CDs of material here, so what is the problem? The more I write the more I want to penalize Sony and give this set 3-stars, but that would not be fair. At any rate, great set, most of the great stuff is here, some of the REALLY great stuff is missing. This incarnation of the \\"Edition\\" ought to be called \\"Bruno Walter: The Edition - Almost Complete, But Not, Thanks to Sony.\\" Sony really missed a chance to make a SUPERB legacy edition for this great conductor. Maybe next time, when they re-release it in DSD remasters in, oh, 2025.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|Get it. I would leave it a that but they make me write more.Basically this is Ronnie James Dio's - Black Sabbath. There will NEVER be another RJD. His voice was made for this group and Metal music, period. Those other guys from that era are just trying to be him. Go listen.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|To reviews much negative to keep this product on my Kindle. Don't want to keep downloading additional programs going forward.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game. It was the best game I've ever played , but I do wish<br />there were other people to give hairstyles to on the game.
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|It's been almost 4 years since the last Paramore studio album. It's worth the wait. This album is different compared to the previous albums. And this album has several different moods and style. It makes it very fun to listen to. There aren't any hard rock songs like Crushcrushcrush or Emergency. But, it's still a great Paramore album. Don't be fooled by the long list of songs. There are 14 songs just like any other normal studio album, but there are three interludes. Many of the songs are at least 4 star songs. It's really worth buying the whole album instead of individual songs, wether you're a fan or not. I'd rank this CD higher than Brand New Eyes. It knocks that album out of the park and puts it to shame.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I rented this movie without reading any reviews so I am to blame for being totally surprised that it is a complete an utter dog. This was a low point in Tom Hank's career and another dreadful performance by Haley Berry. She needs to find another line of work.<br /><br />I gave Cloud Atlas one star because I could nor figure out how to give it NO stars. It totally sucked!
B000TGCR38|4.0|The Black Book will haunt you as the tale of a Jewish woman who makes a tragic decision to remain quiet and fraternize with a Nazi officer who falls for her.  This is a hard movie to watch but rewarding because we see the hard decisions that some women had to make to survive WWII and the nazi occupation.  There is no happy ending here but it is a story of social justice and tragedy. This movie reminds me of Malena, another great film about women during WWII.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I need more. I hope that I get to read the Sam and sookie stories next. Loved every book. More please
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|OMG, this game is spectacular! It 's so fun to try to get the high score and eat as many fish as you can, but it 's much better than Hungry Shark 1, 2, or 3 because the graphics are better and you can evolve from a reef shark to a great white (with other kinds in between) by leveling it up and increasing it 's speed, bite, and boost. All in all, a great game. You should DEFINITELY get it. And it's free! What more reason do you need? GET IT!!!!
B00BIR381W|5.0|I pre-ordered this DVD and could not wait to receive it. It was new and in packaging. Great TV series, I'm addicted to the show now!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Kids loved it.  Has some good messages & lessons.  Mostly just for fun. Just an enjoyable movie - even my 20ish niece liked it when she saw it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is quite addictive but so much fun to work out how to get out of the room.<br />Satisfying when you open the door & if you've been stuck you wonder how as its easy
B0055V6EZE|5.0|So surprised when this showed up in my recommendations. Couldn't believe how great Hugh Laurie was. I knew he played piano, but he totally delivers on the vocals too. He's also written books. Singing, playing piano, writing, directing, acting - is there anything he can't do?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game brings the minion in a fun new game. I love it.<br /><br />It also has some characters that aren't interested the movies. Have fun playing!
1447211898|5.0|....is that I have to wait until the end of next year for the third book in the trilogy to be released!!  So much history wrapped up in a great story.  Love it!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved it and so did the family it had lots of spiral moments and moments of change. I would recumbent it to any one young or old.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Good read, especially for women who have are a little exhausted by the impossible expectations set on mothers. It has some very good points of view and is inspirational.
B006N57PXG|5.0|Keeps you interested so you don't want to put it down. I read this book till my kindle shut down on me due to low battery. I plan on getting the 2nd book.
0439813786|5.0|First, the images in this book are BEAUTIFUL. Although the book may appear quite long, half the book are these wonderful drawings. You can't take your eyes off them. Don't let that fool you though. The writing is just as good as illustrations. Such a fast read. I go back to it again and again. If you loved the movie, you'll love the book. If you love the book, you'll love the movie. Great for anyone who loves movies. Truly takes you back to childhood and the magic and awe of it all.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This account of the brave marines on Peleliu and Okinawa is both fascinating and sobering in its content.<br />One is pulled into the grim reality of war and the story of the brave young men who fought in World War II in the Pacific against a fanatical enemy.<br />The book is both hard to read and captivating at the same time.<br />I cannot imagine what that was like.<br />Well done and thank you.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a terrific book.  It effectively communicates a German Air Force culture during WWII that seemed a high calling.  Although Franz lived a difficult life unlike anything he could have dreamed when he was a child glider flying with his brother and father, he ended up having a good life.  Charlie Brown was a hero who finally got the recognition he deserved.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|20 REASONS THIS MOVIE IS BAD:<br /><br />1) It's a boring, slow, badly paced, disjointed story.<br /><br />2) It's WAY too talky.  This is a Western, Westerns aren't suppose to be about people just sitting around tables and rock croppings just talking endlessly.<br /><br />3) It's way too preachy.  Slavery was wrong?  That's your message you keep hitting the audience over the head with?  150 years ago slavery was a bad thing?  Ahhh, no sheet, Sherlock.  And to suggest all Southern White people back then were evil?  I mean, come on.<br /><br />4) The \\"hero,\\" Django, is boring, weak and unrealistic.  He's NOT a cool or interesting character at all.  He has ZERO personality.  He's a total dud as a \\"hero.\\"<br /><br />5) Jamie Fox's acting (as Django) is boring, weak and unrealistic, which made the \\"hero\\" even more lame.<br /><br />6) Django, a slave who had never fired a gun in his life, suddenly picks up a gun and is an instant expert bulls-eye quick-fire deadly killer shot with both pistols and a rifle??? Capable of single-handedly slaughtering a dozen heavily-armed men in a gun fight?  TOTALLY unrealistic.<br /><br />7) Half the guns in this movie did not exist in 1858.  The guns were so wrong.  Don't set a movie in 1858 if you're not going to use guns from 1858.  Also, Dynamite did not exist in 1858.  Yet it's a key factor in 3 scenes.  Obviously, no research went into making this movie even try to be somewhat accurate to 1858.<br /><br />8) The violence/action (what little there is) is WAY over-the-top cartoony with people looking like they are being shot with huge .50 caliber machine gun bullets.  The shootouts in the movie are just ridiculously bad.<br /><br />9) The period dialog is way off, with virtually no character remotely talking like a person who lived in the 19th century.  Some of slang that characters use is from the 1980s and 1990s.  I mean the writer should have studied and researched, at least a little, how people actually talked back then.<br /><br />10) Some of the locations don't even remotely look like the true \\"South.\\"  Particularly the scene where the stupid Aussies get killed.  That's California, NOT Mississippi.  No place in Old Miss looks like that.  Who was the location scout on this movie???<br /><br />11) The music/soundtrack is horrible.  I mean rap songs in a Western?  How dumb.  And some of the scenes felt like crappy music videos, with nothing going on except for the song, like the scene was there just so they could play the dumb song.  REALLY bad use of music in this movie.<br /><br />12) The cinematography and editing are terrible.  For example, so many scenes cry out for Close Up shots of the characters--because they're constantly talking--yet there are very few Close Ups in the movie.  It's like the filmmakers don't want us to see the characters for some reason.  One scene in particular, the introduction of \\"Big Daddy\\" REALLY needed some Close Ups of Don Johnson, yet there were ZERO.  Ruined the whole scene.<br /><br />13) Django supposedly wants to rescue his slave wife, yet he waits months and months, through an entire winter, before he goes and tries to rescue her?  Yeah, I think I'll wait 3 or 4 months before I go rescue my poor slave wife who's probably getting raped, whipped and beaten; who may even get pregnant from some random guy; but I'll just wait months before I go try to help her.  Totally illogical.<br /><br />14) King Shultz also has NO motivation to help Django go rescue his wife.  Maybe if the lazy writer had written a scene were Django SAVED King's life I might have bought into King risking his life's savings and his own neck to go help Django.  But, no, the movie writer just has King going off and doing all that with no compelling reason.  You don't even get the sense King likes or bonds with Django that much.  So there's really no reason I buy that King would help Django.<br /><br />15) Toward the end, when King shoots Candie, he has a 2-shot derringer and could easily spin around and try to shoot Candie's henchman with the shotgun, yet DOESN'T.  And King's supposed to be this expert bounty hunter/killer, yet doesn't even try to shoot the goon with the shotgun who has orders to kill Hildy???  It's totally illogical.  Again, lazy writing.<br /><br />16) What's also illogical is that King (and Django by extention) are bounty hunters (officers of the court), yet they are also cold-blooded killers who kill a slaver-trader and Big Daddy in cold blood.  Wouldn't King and Django become wanted fugitives themselves hunted by other bounty hunters for killing these men???  Especially Big Daddy who's an important plantation owner?  It makes no sense.  AND, then to top it all off, King kills Candie at the end with no legal justification.  King's always spouting off about how he's an office of the court, then he just murders people because he doesn't agree with them or like them??? It's like there's NO logic at all in this movie.<br /><br />17) There's no real emotion of any kind.  It could have been a great \\"buddy movie,\\" with King and Django bonding and becoming like \\"brothers\\" or \\"father and son,\\" yet there's no great bonding moments between them.  Likewise, we're just told Django and Hildy have this great love for each other, yet we're never shown a reason why they love each other so much.  There's no romance, no great love story of any kind.  There's no soul or heart to this movie at all.<br /><br />18) The most important aspect of a story is that the hero defeats the villain.  Yet in this movie, screwed up as it is, the supporting character, King, kills the main villain, Candie.  NOT Django.  So the main villain dies (the movie should be over), but no, due to the crappy writing, there's like 20 minutes left in the movie where the hero, Django, just goes around killing the 3rd-string villains--actors and characters we don't even know or really care about!  It's just bad writing!<br /><br />19) Another instance of bad writing is the fact that Django, a black man and former slave, is THE REASON that super powerful plantation owner villain Candie gets killed.  The plantation caretakers and Candie's Sister want revenge in the worst way and they have captured Django.  They can slowly torture him to death, do the worst things imaginable, yet for NO logical reason AT ALL they decide to just give him to a mining company so he can break rocks.  They want revenge in the worst way, are about to cut off his balls, yet, ahhhh, no, we won't cut off his balls, instead, we'll just give him away to a mining company.  WHAT????  Retarded! What's worse, getting your balls CUT OFF or having to break rocks all day?  Plus, they, the Candieland people, don't get to see Django suffer.  Again, it's just really bad writing.  Lazy.  Illogical.<br /><br />20) And number 20, at the end, Django, slaughters a white woman, Candie's Sister, who doesn't do anything evil or bad the entire movie.  Her only sin, I guess, is being white and living in the Antebellum South.  And for that, Django slaughters her?  LAZY WRITING.  All the writer had to do was make her an evil bitch.  Yet he wasn't a good enough writer to make her worthy of Django's vengeance.  So again, Django's not an angel of vengeance, but rather just a murderer who murders a poor white woman for no good reason.  And he's suppose to be the hero?  The writer of this movie must have been on some serious drugs when he wrote it.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE IS BAD, BADLY WRITTEN AND BADLY DIRECTED.

When I tried to install them, the apps requested way too many permissions, including &#34;Total Access to Protected Storage&#34;.  I have not seen an app requesting it, not even Gmail!!!  It was such a big red flag that I didn't allow it to install, and will delete it from my app list.

B002T9H2LA|1.0|It seems the writer of this movie has almost no understanding of what constitutes good story-telling, and more importantly, good story structure.  This movie is literally all over the place.  It can't decide whether it wants to be about a Jewish girl or a squad of American commandos (and later a British commando).  And that's the problem, it's really two or three different movies all squashed together and the end result is a jumbled mess, so much so, that the film comes off almost schizophrenic.  There's no real narrative to the movie.  Or maybe too many narratives which makes it feel like there's no narrative.  Maybe if the story had stuck to just the Jewish girl's story (and somehow had her story/effort/plan actually tie into the German actress double-agent and commandos) it might have worked better.  But even at the end, the Jewish girl and commandos don't even know each other exist.  So we don't even care if the commandos succeed or fail in their mission because we know the Jewish girl is going to kill all the Nazis anyways.  The story is just really badly done.<br /><br />Too much of the movie is illogical as well.  In the opening scene, Landa already knows the Jews are hiding under the floorboards, so what's the point of him going through the long conversation with the Farmer?  He learns nothing new, gets nothing out of it.  It makes no sense.  Plus the Germans are there to kill all the Jews, yet they let the Jewish girl just run away?  None of the German soldiers chase after her?  None of them try to shoot her?  Again, makes no sense.  And the British commando meeting the German actress double-agent in a basement bar full of German soldiers?  I mean, really?  Would commandos and spies really be that stupid?  And at the end Hitler is in the movie theater and there's no German guards in the lobby???  No Germans are guarding the theater that Hilter is in???  It's so implausible that it's insulting to the viewer.  I mean the writer of this movie should have at least attempted to make it a little bit plausible.<br /><br />Also of particularly unfortunate note is Brad Pitt's performance as the commando team leader.  Pitt is usually a stellar actor, but in this movie he comes off like a hammy, over-the-top, cartoonish joke.  I mean his performance (and his character) are jaw-droppingly bad.  It has to be the worst performance of Pitt's career.<br /><br />Overall, a huge disappointment.  I was shocked at what a huge mess this movie was.  See \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" for a truly great WWII commando movie.ast attempted to make it a little bit plausible.<br /><br />Also of particularly unfortunate note is Brad Pitt's performance as the commando team leader.

We must stop the practice of throwing children away because they are difficult or disruptive.<br /><br />Paul documents that these are issues of Character and Educators can change what happens to and with these challenging youngsters. This book finalizes my 50 plus years in alternative education working with the most difficult and this book has given me the outline and language of why what we did in my schools was more important than academics. We were helping to change youngster's CHARACTER so they could apply whatever skills they had.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i just seen the dispicable me 2 premere!<br />minions are so cool! this game would definitely be recommended by me!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Fresh, unpredictable, and addictive; only a few words to describe the latest effort of \\"The Queens of the Stone Age\\". Their precise, polished craftsmanship is only out-shined by thought provoking lyrics and Josh Hommes' odd, but indefinitely interesting voice. I have not been this addicted to an album in a long time and can not say enough good things about it. They may be artists, but their sheer professionalism and grace in their musicianship create an eerie, atmospheric, and haunting album that is one hell of a listen(s).
B0095MVOMC|1.0|This game is so easy that it is boring. The one major problem with this on kindle fire is that some of the numbers are right under the icon you tap to get to the menu, so that every time you try to tap the number the menu screen pops up. A waste of time! Glad this was free, because I would have been angry if I had paid for it!
067942850X|5.0|Jon Krakauer went in depth about Chris McCandless and his life as well as his travels. Some may say Chris is an inspiration, while others may think of him as an idiot, however truth to be told, Chris did what he loved. Unfortunately it didn't end well, and if it had ended differently, there probably would not be a book about him unless Chris would have wrote an Autobiography.<br />Over-all the book is a must read and definitely enjoyable.

B00B7Y0206|2.0|When I first loaded up this app it ran really well. Now it doesn't run as well as it could. Sometimes it has a real hard time loading anything I click on when I get to the You Tube page. Loading is very unreliable and inconsistent. A lot of times it will load something and start to play it and then stop right in the middle to take a very long time to load up the rest. Voyage Apps has done a poor job at designing the technology that is required to access the You Tube website.

0385535147|5.0|John Grisham has a reputation for legal thrillers with compelling plot twists that make each one a literary gem! This novels concerns an unjustly imprisoned African American lawyer who uses his contacts as a jail house attorney to, not only free himself from an unjust imprisonment, but, also to enrich himself beyond most people dreams, while at the same time, giving government prosecutors the identity of the true culprit to secure an ironclad conviction. The legal process, small town values, and career challenges, are all brought up here, as is the moral and legal ambiguities surrounding the national drug trade. the political machinations of the FBI, and US Attorney office, as well as the prison system, are also explored, and there are some travel commentarys on some of the more affluent areas of the US, and some Carribean Islands. All in all, this is one of the best Grisham novels I have ever read !

B004XWLN20|5.0|Love this show... Got my wife to join me in watching it starting from season 1.<br />As far as packaging, I get to some degree how people my be frustrated as you don't have of the DVD exposed to pull it out of the booklet sleeve.  However, take your time and everything is fine.  I hate when people complain about packaging and how it scratches the discs... The same complaints were made with the MacGyver box set but I have no complaints, problems, or even scratches either with that.  I was fortunate to purchase the Smallville box set on sale as it was the deal of the day; glad I purchased it with no regrets.

B002PQ1PDS|5.0|I buy vinyl for the listening experience and expect the vinyl to present something unique over digital versions.  This album does not disappoint!  Like a live concert this master is generous with the drums, has bass line character that you can feel, and adds just the right amount of audience to place you there.  The vocals seem almost a bit distant at times, but still a great recording of a live performance.

Ok maybe it doesn't have the BEST acting.... but the plot and mystery and suspense make it SO worth it.<br /><br />Cute girls, hot guys, murder, mystery, drama, suspense. PLL has it all. I would recommend for ANYONE (over age of 10 or so).
B000VJAICK|5.0|This is a classic, all good fun!  The combination of Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are great.  I loved Reba and Michael Gross too!

B00AJLHTT0|4.0|There are plenty of reviews on opinions of the songs.  This is solely about the sound and presentation.  I listened to the digital version of this plenty of times and had a very solid basis for comparison.  First off, the vinyl is not as flat as others I own, but you can't hear it.  Not the quietest either, I'd rate it still at a 4.  The vinyl itself fits way too tight into the paper sleeve and leaves a solid imprint in the cover.  I almost avoid listening to it as the act of removing and replacing the vinyl is so tedious.  Overall, the pressing is great - good sound.  Now if it was only not a magical act to get it in and out!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I choose this book by reading the series in sequence.  I thought this was one of the better Reacher novels in character development and tying his past to his present life.  I would recommend this book to those looking to read an entire series and getting to know the character and his way of life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can read it over and over again!!! It's also the best book my husband never really!!! I can't wait for the movie
B00BP0MJ08|1.0|While the author does write strongly about the marvels of the universe, he often sets aside his<br />cautious eloquence to take on the unrestrained coarseness of bar-stool gossip. Here, he mocks<br />the traditional Judeo/Christian views of creation. He uses, for example, a centuries old myth that<br />very few people on this planet will have even heard of. ( The infant Jesus in the womb commanding<br />a branch to bend down towards Mary that she may have one of the fruit ) Then, he places the New<br />Testament miracles in the same category, claiming that they too were unlikely events.<br />And the author's research seems hasty and incomplete. For example, in the segment on DNA, much is<br />said about the men who marched onto the stage to snatch the Nobel Prize. But nothing is mentioned<br />about Rosalind Franklin who made all the key discoveries.<br />For those readers who are familiar with the lonely discomforts which come from the actions of school-<br />yard bullies, the author's voice will sound familiar.<br />There is a useful phrase available to today's consumers. \\"Buyer Beware\\"<br />How well it applies to this book!
B0027Z5DM6|1.0|Very disappointed! We expected a fun family movie based on the previews only to find out we couldn't even watch this movie. It was full of curse words. I expected more...

0307943232|5.0|John Grisham's work is always interesting, cleanly written and he doesn't subject you to filth, explosions, sexual<br />descriptions and flesh, flesh, flesh and soft porn.  He is very, very well-written (reads like the newspaper and give<br />you the facts and what you need to imagine the story.  He is a gentleman writer.  I have read all his books and wish<br />we had 10,000 more writers like him - maybe it's because he's from the South and many good (and great ) storytellers<br />are also from the South.  I'm always anxious to read his next book and wish he had one out each and every month.<br />He seems also be a good human being and active in his community - also he writes about what he knows!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I'm a big Kanye fan, so big in fact that I am going to overlook this album he calls \\"music\\" until the next project comes out. I mean even the album case and disc is lacking quality.

B00005K3NY|1.0|I'd rank this with the worst movies I've ever seen.  I found it boring, muddled, badly acted, and not even particularly horrific.  About halfway through, the budget for exploding heads seems to have run out, and the movie takes a nosedive to even lower depths of awfulness.  At about that same point, I and my family members began making wisecracks and not really caring what happened any more.  It's that kind of movie.<br /><br />Scanners 2 is a better movie and kept me modestly amused.  Not this one.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The story line is creepy ( which I LIKE) THE graphics are great and it only froze once. had to uninstall then reinstall because nothing else worked to fix it.  I even shut my kindle down and did a reboot to no avail. It worked the second time around though. The glitches is the only reason it didn't earn 5 stars

B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|While the antagonist is constantly transported between the world of his college life and this wondrous world called Everville, as a young adult reader I found it hard to fully divulge myself in this book.  I tried continuously to picture the characters and their surroundings but the author chose to be vague with his words, commonly referring to the items scattered across a desk or distinguishing two worlds apart as &#34;stuff&#34;.<br /><br />Please Mr. Huff, I wanted very much not just to read your story, but to feel as if I were living it too.  Take the time to paint your readers a picture.  I understand that I as a reader fill much of it in with my own imagination, but I need a little more description to build the frame work before filling it in.  I want very much to see these worlds as you have envisioned in your mind.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|A mixture of modern London life with the era of Jane Austen 200 years ago using a magic portal.  I particularly liked the portrayals of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, Jane, Elizabeth, D'Arcy and his sister, reveled in the twists of character and plot that were contrived but consistent with the facts presented in the book.  This is the best Lady Catherine of the four movie versions of this story that I've seen, with an intensity that shines from the screen.  A very fine addition to the venerable works of Jane Austen that should be enjoyable for a wide audience.  The main character Amanda Price grates on you at first, but warms up if you watch the movie more than once.  One of the few that I've watched five times in relatively quick succession and enjoyed the last time more than the first.

B00008BLB8|5.0|I still have my LP from 1975 even though I've lost/loaned/given away many of them.  The only thing I can add to previous reviews is that almost EVERY song is better here than on the studio versions.  No live album in history opens with more energy than this one, with a version of \\"Footstompin' Music\\" that blows away the (excellent, yes) studio version.  And \\"Rock and Roll Soul\\" is much better, more funky, than before.  This version of \\"Inside Looking Out\\" tops all others, and parts of it are constantly in my head.  What more can anyone ask for?  This is what live music is all about!!
B00DPUB56U|4.0|Being a fan of \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" the main selling point of \\"Byzantium\\" was director Neil Jordan's return to the world of vampires. Vampires have transformed drastically since the likes of \\"Nosferatu\\" and \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" and their origins are altered with every cinematic adaptation these days. \\"Byzantium\\" portrays vampires that can walk around in daylight and feed by shoving a retractable thumbnail into a victim's throat. To be clear, \\"Byzantium\\" is in no way connected to \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" but it's certainly just as compelling.<br /><br />It's a little awkward seeing Gemma Arterton portray a lady of the night while also trying to be a vampire hiding from the spotlight and a mother just trying to take care of her child. Something has got to give and attempting to be sexy must have been the straw that broke the camel's back. It's difficult not to look at her and think of the painful performances she put into \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and \\"Prince of Persia.\\" She's got that artificial facial expression glued to her face that seems to hint that she accidentally sat on a bicycle seat upside down and you can't tell if she liked it or not; that expression that's permanently devoid of emotion that's become the norm for actresses like Kate Beckinsale, Nicole Kidman, and Megan Fox. It's probably just the result of too much Botox, but in the meantime you have to play a game of charades if she's trying to portray emotion without words. With that said, \\"Byzantium\\" may be one of Arterton's best performances as her undying devotion for her daughter is noticeably there from start to finish. Arterton is undeniably heartbreaking at times.<br /><br />The film begins with a foot chase through a grocery store that culminates in a bouncy house. How often do you see vampires partake in such behavior? There's an extremely gruesome beheading early on that is fantastic. It's interesting seeing how often Eleanor and Clara are shown waiting to be invited into someone's house or how Clara will feast on anything she can get her hands on while Eleanor only dines on the elderly and those who are ready to die. Saoirse Ronan is making quite a name for herself. Her performance in \\"Byzantium\\" is exceptional and absorbing. Ronan is constantly portraying characters that are wholesome, innocent, or conflicted and that is trapped in a tainted world. She's always choosing fascinating characters with evolutionary arcs that are riveting to witness play out on screen.<br /><br />Caleb Landry Jones makes his presence known with his brief amount of screen time. His chemistry with Saoirse Ronan is powerful. There's a lot of weirdness in \\"Byzantium\\" that includes Eleanor constantly seeing herself everywhere she goes, Eleanor sucking on a bloody handkerchief, and random shots of kinky sex, but there actually seems to be somewhat of a meaning behind it that makes it all worthwhile. Eleanor's story is an exceptional one and the origin of how humans are changed into vampires is fairly unique. Seeing the authorities trailing Clara and Eleanor the entire film, Clara's demanding sense of protection for Eleanor, and Eleanor's need to come clean to anybody makes the film constantly engaging.<br /><br />With a magnetic performance from Saoirse Ronan, a surprisingly excellent performance from Gemma Arterton, and a deliciously peculiar spin on familiar lore, \\"Byzantium\\" is a refreshing take on vampires and the most stimulating film on the subject since Park Chan-wook's \\"Thirst\\" and Tomas Alfredson's \\"Let the Right One In.\\"s house or how Clara will feast on anything she can get her hands on while Eleanor only dines on the elderly and those who are ready to die.

B007KAJG3K|5.0|Hollywood continues its trend of rehashing previous released material trying to redefine famous characters in a new light.  Sometimes they succeed, and it's getting a lot harder to see Nigel Rathbone in the role of Sherlock Holmes anymore.  This is 1800's England portrayed by the people who gave you Iron Man 2, featuring our standard hero actor making another role his own.<br />Definitely belongs in any action movie collection, and a great candidate for movie watching parties.

B00CWIMY3O|5.0|This show is a refreshing treat for the mind amongst the trivial buffet of tv shows airing.<br /><br />Brilliant acting, writing, directing, filmography, set & costume design. My only hope is that it gets the recognition that it deserves from the masses and doesn't get overlooked in favor of the next reality show.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|It has been five long years since we last saw Guillermo del Toro in the director's chair. The man has become a visionary and an endless source of much needed unique and creative ideas in the film industry. \\"Pacific Rim\\" has been highly anticipated ever since del Toro announced he'd be creating a film involving giant robots fighting giant monsters. \\"Pacific Rim\\" evolved into one of the most anticipated films of 2013. Speaking as someone with enormously high expectations, \\"Pacific Rim\\" doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The comparisons to \\"Transformers\\" and \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\\" aren't justified, but \\"Pacific Rim\\" has more in common with \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\" The neural handshake alone feels like direct homage to \\"Evangelion.\\" There is surprisingly quite a bit of story in \\"Pacific Rim.\\" Charlie Hunnam stars as Raleigh Becket. Raleigh and his brother pilot the Jaeger Gipsy Danger and are heroes because of it, but all of that changes when Raleigh's brother is ripped from the Jaeger mid-battle. Raleigh does the unthinkable and pilots Gipsy alone long enough to get to safety. Five years later Raleigh is pulled back in by Major Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) where he must choose a new candidate to help him pilot the now out-of-date Gipsy Danger.<br /><br />One of the biggest aspects to take note of is the film's use of 3D. \\"Pacific Rim\\" was not filmed in 3D. It's a post-conversion. Guillermo del Toro put eight months into converting the film to 3D and warmed up to the effect because of it. For a post-conversion, \\"Pacific Rim\\" utilizes the effect extremely well. The Kaiju are absolute behemoths while the Jaegers are undeniably massive. When they come together, the result is awe-inspiring. These beatdowns will bring out the kid in you. It's that much fun and that entertaining.<br /><br />Besides the impressively destructive battles, the constant bickering between doctors Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Hermann Gotllieb (Burn Gorman) provide the majority of the film's humor. The Kaiju drift Newt is responsible has more of an overall impact on the story though. Mako's (Rinko Kikuchi) memory with the crab Kaiju bleeds the present into the past extremely well while the \\"Empty the clip!\\" and \\"no pulse\\" sequence is perhaps the film's shining achievement.<br /><br />The one downfall \\"Pacific Rim\\" has that it does in fact share with \\"Transformers\\" is that some of the action is difficult to process during the more involved action sequences. It doesn't really take away from the film in the long run, but at times you can't really tell what you're looking at like what body part was just ripped from a Kaiju or which robotic limb was just destroyed off of a Jaeger. It becomes an issue when more than one Kaiju are in a single action sequence.<br /><br />\\"Pacific Rim\\" will tickle every \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" loving fiber in your body. The kaiju are massive, the jaegers are creative, and their battles are absolutely breathtaking. The wait for Gareth Edwards \\"Godzilla\\" just became a little easier to swallow. Guillermo del Toro has created a giant monster infested ecstasy that will send chills up your spine.ority of the film's humor.

B000FZETIO|4.0|I'm a sci-fi action fantasy kind of movie watcher who recently discovered he liked certain examples of the romantic field, like Jane Austen stories.  Lots of famous actors showing their younger selves talent.  Lots of insights into human emotions and why some of us do the things we do.  It feels like the director succeeded in getting his vision on the screen.  Very entertaining and worth watching again.

B00DGNO3WE|3.0|We were disappointed in the movie. We had expected more humor. Unfortunately, the previews seemed to show this movie to be more lighthearted, when in fact we felt it was a tad boring.  The actors were not disappointing and each played their role well.  We had expected a movie similar to \\"The Last Marigold Hotel\\".
B009KKLQKO|5.0|This is a fine concert film, the Boys are in fine voice, Brian surprisingly so, as he delivers his vocals in a matter of fact, understated manner, he sounds much better and in control vocally than one could have ever expected.  Discerning listeners can also distinctly hear the other voices of the Boys in the overall vocal blend and Mike and Al are in fine form with their leads and Bruce sings some fine falsettos.  Most of the griping is just from spoiled brats who wanted fifty songs instead of the twenty or so we received, but it is all cream, so catch a wave and ignore the negative goofballs.  This is a keeper you will watch many times over and enjoy, enjoy.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I have two movie versions of the Jane Austen story &#34;Northanger Abbey&#34;, and finally bought the book to read.  Not one of my favorite Austen stories, exploring darker Gothic themes with a non-heroic heroine.  The Masterpiece edition came closer to fulfllling the vision of the book and was a lot easier to follow.  I liked the casting better, and the closing was more satisfying.
B009LDD5HW|2.0|This is the season that officially ruined the already backsliding Glee. I have never seen so many episodes in a row of overblown after school special emmy bait, all of which fell completely flat in execution. The new kids, with the exception of Kitty, have all the personality of dead grass. And as much as I (used to) like Blaine, this season had too much of him. I enjoyed his sudden bromance with Sam, but unfortunately we saw very little of that. Instead, we had the hideous love affair between Sam and Brittany... and I have never been so happy to see any character leave a show. Brittany used to be my favorite character.<br /><br />I'm just angry. The writers show us repeatedly what they think of their audience. They jerk us around and throw crap in our faces and expect us to dance along as if we're still in season 1. Not gonna happen. Even Lea Michele and Chris Colfer's amazing chemistry couldn't save this schlock. Save your money.
B005OK721G|2.0|Starts off great showing a 5 year old girl that can jump high fences then later she becomes a woman who can nearly beat a man in a fight. Lots of shooting and thats it. Little story, totally predictable and little excitement. I fell asleep near the end. Makes Cat woman Tomb Raider Azumi look like 20 star movies by comparison.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is great  the reason I gave this book 5 stars is because it's funny all I have to do is read book 7, which is the third wheel, which I'm expecting is good, I've heard that book is good, when we go to our uncle's this week, I'm gonna read the third wheel on the road. But I think this book is funny. Actually it's so good I wanna read it again. ;)

B009DT424Y|1.0|I purchased this mic to work remotely in recording videos to my laptop with my web cam. The web cam's mic does no noise cancellation so the sound quality is bad, and at the distance from my laptop that I needed to be for the recording, all the web cam's mic picked up was ambient noise, not my own voice. I have tried everything I can think of to get this to work with my laptop, both with and without the webcam connected, to be sure there was no conflict. I paid enough for this product that it should be complete. If special drivers are required, there is no documentation to indicate either the fact, or any way to acquire them. If additional hardware is required, that fact should be clearly stated in both the sales copy on Amazon, and in the documentation. However, the documentation is scarce and sadly lacking any helpful information. If someone can help me make this work on my laptop, without an additional expense on my part, I will gladly re-consider this rating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to make you think! Hard enough to make you work at it but not so hard that it takes the fun out of playing.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|While not written about our world or time it couldn't be made any more real in a book. The complexity of the story, mainly due the very large number of main characters, reflects real life. This is borne out by how closely the TV series follows the books which is very unusual as most movies made from  books use significant poetic licence, but not so with this one.<br />If you are a fantasy fan this series is definitely for you.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|All of the live performances they've released in this 25th Anniversary collection have been really great, but the band really is in top form throughout this recording.  And getting to hear early live versions of &#34;Belong&#34; and &#34;Low&#34; is also nice.  This was the first R.E.M. album I ever owned (unless you count the cassettes of Pageant and Document I...let's say &#34;borrowed&#34;...from my older sister) so there was the nostalgic aspect of picking this one up in physical form rather than just an .mp3 format...opening up the box and pulling out the liner notes and reading through them...unfolding the poster...popping the discs into the stereo for a listen.  I remember listening to &#34;You Are The Everything&#34; while riding down the wooded and tree canopied Main Rd. from West Ashley to Kiawah (on the other edge of the continent) on summer afternoons.  Well, that and lemons, limes, and tangerines.<br /><br />All of that said, if you're not a big fan of a band or of a particular album, then the Deluxe Edition of that album probably isn't for you.  It's a remastered album and some bonus material; in this case a recording of the Greensboro, NC (fitting) show from the Green tour.

030746363X|1.0|I did the 4-Hour Body (4HB) for several months and lost a decent amount of weight, but ultimately found it wasn't worth it.<br /><br />Lately I have been feeling sick, and there is nothing to blame but the diet. I think that weeks of reducing my meals to eggs, stir fry, taco salad, and chicken thighs have ultimately been unhealthy for me. I started taking a women's dietary supplement a month in to address some of these problems, but it's not the same as getting the nutrients non-synthetically.<br /><br />Furthermore, my rate of weight-loss has slowly been decreasing. I believe that the shock of going onto a low carb diet is wearing off. If you look at Tim's study in the back of the book, his main study only lasted a month. From there, he only lists extreme cases of people doing well on the diet-like his father. It makes me wonder if in the long term, this diet is only meant for certain metabolisms. Furthermore, I wonder why he didn't list any long-term women... and studied women far less than he studied men. From what I've seen in active 4HB communities, women do far poorer on the 4-Hour Body diet than men. I doubt that this is a coincidence. Thus, I believe that 4HB is great for shocking the system into losing weight quickly for about 4 weeks, but nothing longer than that.

1451629192|3.0|Where there is a part in that describes(with much terrible detail) some of the things this monster did to Jaycee, the book is a mostly flat.  It reads a bit like a young girl wrote it and there is a lot of redundant information.  What she went through is beyond horrible and I am glad she was able to get her life together and thrive.
B0039208CG|3.0|While \\"Batman Forever\\" is enjoyable to watch, Joel Schumacher's direction starts to drift away from the darker story of the two films preceding it and tends to lean a bit toward the cartoonish tone of the TV series. Jim Carrey's Riddler just seems to be Jim Carrey in green leotards, nothing original. As for Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face, I had difficulty understanding half the things he was saying, talking way too fast and mumbling a lot of his dialogue. Also the loud soundtrack has a tendency to drown out some of the spoken word. (Thank goodness for closed captioning.) Val Kilmer gave an excellent performance as Bruce Wayne, as did Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson. The Blu-ray disc is done well, and the extras are fun to watch, like the character studies of the heroes and villains by the actors. It's cool when the main stars of a film add their comments and insight about a film that they made some years earlier. (Although my guess is they do because they get a cut of the dvd/Blu-ray sales). Too sum up, high praise for the Blu-ray disc, mediocre kudos for the movie itself.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Just watched a PBS documentary on Hampton Court - Henry's favorite palace.  And found so many facts of his reign, life, etc from the documentary portrayed so accurately in the Tudor series.  Henry playing tennis indoors - true!  Henry having a concussion - and personality, demeanor & actions changed from that point forward - true!  The relationship with Woolsey portrayed very realistically and so many other historically accurate issues.  That said, I do & you should also realize this is an entertainment video & not a documentary so also theatrical license used by the actors & director very liberally. The scenes are breathtaking & the interludes quite racy - but all in all a great series.

B0039208JE|4.0|Prior to Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\", we were saddled with the over-the-top TV show as our source for live action imagery of the Caped Crusader, and not to be taken very seriously. This \\"Batman\\" isn't done for laughs. It takes its anti-hero and its villain very seriously. Jack Nicholson takes his roll as The Joker and runs with it, makes it his own. Michael Keaton also plays his Bruce Wayne/Batman with class and respect. My one problem with the film is that it tends to be TOO dark at times. Tim Burton's image of Gotham City is not that of a \\"fun\\" town, very depressing. Why would anyone want to live there? If I lived there I'd move out as soon as I could, even without the menacing Joker causing havoc. As for the Blu-ray disc, it's all that you should expect. Visually and audibly stunning. The extra are fun too, including commentaries from Burton, Nicholson, Keaton, and others.

0307730700|4.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm is the story of a Navy SEAL who would rather die than let down his fellow teammates. This story explores the physical, mental and spiritual capacities of these incredible citizens of the USA.<br /><br />In spite of severe injuries, SEAL Adam Brown was able to put others first, whether those be his fellow SEALs, the Afghan children around the military base or some other total stranger. The multiple accounts of his bravery and courage are sure to inspire anyone who faces any sort of a trial or tribulation.<br /><br />Although Adam Brown died fighting for his beliefs, his spirit and essence live on through his legacy of courage and generosity.

B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|This is not a shortcoming of the Movie.  This is a rating of Amazon's ability to deliver the product.  I am very disappointed in the delivery of this product and hope to get my money back.  I rented this to watch with guests but Amazon's server issues scrapped that plan (and wasted 45+ minutes of 3 people's time).  My guests left 20-minutes into the movie as it took 45 minutes and 15-25 interruptions to get that far.  Amazon's error messages sited a slow network but this was not the cause, as I ran several speed tests and found my network speeds to be 25Mbps+ (yet the movie only download from Amazon's servers at an average of about 1.1 Mbps).  Amazon, I hope you fix your server issues.  UPDATE:  I got through to a tech support rep from Amazon who confirmed my suspicions and refunded my money.  He was very understanding and professional.

1781162646|2.0|Joyland is a victim of high expectations: I was expecting something that would knock me down like The Shawshank Redemption or Charles Frazier's Nightwoods; I thought this would be a coming-of-age story with poignant life lessons and got a murder mystery with a bad made-for-the-movies ending. It was okay. The characters were fun, the setting in an old independent amusement park was interesting, and the writing was good. I read most of it in the plane on the way to and from a vacation. But on that trip, the book didn't take me the places I thought it would. Mr. King is a great writer but this is just an okay book.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was yet again another Preston & Child collaboration that I could not put down.  As always I'll be counting the days until the next novel that keeps me up all night.  I'm a true addict when it comes to reading about this particular series.  Please keep the Pendergast stories coming!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very challenging. and a very good way to pass the time on a rainy day. gets harder as you go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003Y5H574|5.0|As a huge Steve Carrell fan, I like to see as many movies with him in it.  Steve brings another dimension to movies and I love that about him.  his ability to make any situation comedic is wonderful.<br /><br />On top of this, you have great cast that includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, and Kevin Bacon!<br /><br />I would recommend this as a great date movie since it is not over the top on the sappiness and leaves behind much of what makes the typical chick flick.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game.  It is super fun.  I love to play it with my mom.  We are addicted to it.
0385738781|3.0|Wasn't expecting it to be a happy ending, but was wanting at least not to be confused. Poignant message on human greed and survival.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful read, incredible insight into events and people that shaped the 20th century.  Can hardly wait for volume three to see how these families lives and fortunes continue through rest of the century.  Explaining history through fictional characters who are centrally involved, is a wonderful way to learn. I would recommend this trilogy to any student as way to make history come alive.  I certainly learned so much about the origins and inevitability of both world wars, and how our present is a product of our past.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If you are looking for a good read, then I seriously recommend this book. It's worth it I promise you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun app. My eight year old son begged me to get this app and he loves it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie trilogy is my favorite of all superhero movies.  While I like The Dark Knight a bit better, The Dark Knight Rises is my second favorite, followed by Batman Begins.<br /><br />This DVD also comes with a digital copy.  In order to obtain this you must download a program and have an internet connection whenever you want to watch the movie.  Also, if you are thinking that this will be a shareable copy, think again.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This is my man. I'm Superman. I've watch all the adventures of smallville. Watching Clark kent get all his powers and use them daily. S on my chest. Up, Up and away.
B000FC12Z0|4.0|This is a grand story!  One must understand Agatha Christie's writing style to appreciate this book.  This is not a work of Action/Advinture.  Rather, it is a detailed Mystery.  The story moves slowly in order the include the many elliments.  If one is looking for an exciting fast moving book, one should pass up reading Agatha Christie's work.  However, if one is prepared for a cozy evening with a cup of tea and a good book, I would recommend this story.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I really like the game! It's super fun and addicting but I wish you had more levels and they were more diverse each time. My brother downloaded the app a year ago and I played it a couple times then and it seems pretty much the same
B000002NBY|5.0|I saw the Graceland special on PBS and knew I had to buy this album.  Paul's talent to put words to the music is unmatched.<br />Every time I listen, I hear something new.  Highly recommend this album to anyone who doesn't have it already.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I have been wanting to watch this and also read the books. I enjoyed it and will wait to see if they make more.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Without a doubt, this is a great show!  I would recommend this show very highly to anyone of the appropriate age.<br /><br />BUT before you buy this, remember that you can watch many shows online now with Netflix (this is on Netflix up to the 4th season).
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've watched this show from the beginning. I follow the brothers lives faithfully. Ill enjoy every minute of it. The winchesters.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|congratulation, you took something that worked and ruined it. crashes continuously, hard to use if it works anyways. someone should be embarrassed to say they know a guy who knows the cousin of the guy that did this. that is all.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the BEST version of this movie out of all of them. Much truer to the book with more \\"real\\" people. You have to just love Lizzy and swoon over Mr. Darcy. Something the Keira Knightly version lacked for me. This is as close to the book as it gets. If you are looking for another good version, the older Greer Garson one is enjoyable. Highly recommend. Although its definitely an all day thing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've watched Downton Abbey since the very first and find myself counting the months until the next season.  The acting is superb, the screenplay is excellent, and the attention to details like clothes, manners, customs of the time, etc. are the best I've seen in a television drama.  I've bought all of the seasons so I would be able to view the episodes anytime I want.
B000P0J09C|5.0|It worked perfectly and I am glad to have this classic! Excellent movie! I would but it again if I had the chance too. Movie was like NEW condition....Perfect!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|The chemistry between Justin and Mila is strong.  They play off of each other very well and make this movie so much more than it ever could have been with a different cast.  I would recommend seeing this movie just because of how well these 2 actors work with one another.<br /><br />Better than &#34;No Strings Attached&#34;<br /><br />Worth the buy
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Reminds me of the movies. Wonder though do they escape haven't gotten that far yet...thAt would be interesting...otherwise I can't go a minute without checking it
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Perfect stand and protects my Kindle. The price was right and the quality is good. Would recommend this product. Lots of colors to choose from.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I have enjoyed the FF series since the first Nintendo. This version works flawlessly on the Kindle HD Fire. I hope to see more releases available in the near future!
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Great new music from one of my favorite artists.  I loved so many of the songs, but the divorce song was really sad and upsetting.  I suppose it could have appeal to people in this situation, but it brought down an otherwise great collection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game around except that it is a little slow about updating new rooms on the Kindle Fire. It usually takes them about a week to update the Kindle after they have started a new bingo room or slots room. Other than that this is the best free bingo game out there!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|A gem of a season, this kicks-off the series with great episodes that introduce us to all of the wonderful characters that make this series so entertaining.  These early episodes perfectly balance the humor, drama and just-plain-fun of everything Castle!  And Kate Becket still has short hair in this premier season of the series!
0143036424|4.0|Good start of a series, strong characters, nice twist at the end. Hard not to compare to TV series, but it's best not too..treat as two separate stories.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Awesome app, very easy to install and use! I had no idea I could even print off of my kindle fire until I Googled it. Love it!!
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|I have been a fan and collector since 1977 when I saw them blow Queen away in New Orleans.<br />I have ever album single bootleg demos books,dvds of every show filmed. I could not accept<br />the Sykes Lineup as Thin Lizzy nor the most recent one either even with Downey/Wharton. I<br />love the Chinatown/Renegade albums and lineup. Snowy White didn't get the respect he Deserved.<br /> Too bad he's not the other guitarist on this album!<br />Thunder & Lighting was good but too metal for Lizzy. Actually this album is more<br />Lizzy than that! The sound playing songwriting guitar work are damn good. The vocals well<br />nobody will be Phil Lynott. Ricky Warwick goes a good job keeping the vocals as close to<br />Lynott as possible. Jimmy DeGrasso from Y&T on drums was a perfect choice. The album is<br />closer to Black Rose and Chinatown than Jailbreak. Gorham did the right thing changing<br />the name and recording this album. It ROCKS! Best album of the year! I hope this turns<br />some old fans and new fans to give the a listen! This kind of rock is what the music<br />scene needs right now. The song Kingdom of the Lost is an epic irish rock song like<br />Black Rose. I really like Before the War and bonus track Right to be Wrong but all the<br />songs are great not a filler on this album. BUY THIS NOW!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is the kind of book it is hard to put down.<br /><br />Told from the unique perspective of a dog, you are sure to fall in love. Snap takes you on his life journey which revolves around his owner Denny a race car driver fighting for what he loves.<br /><br />You won't be able to get through this book without shedding a few tears.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The writing was pure and believable.  The way Collins broke down the characters and where they came from was down right reality at it best. I want people to read this book they will get a ride of a life story. I gave this book six star .
0345522303|4.0|I only discovered this series about 6 months ago.  I have fallen in love with it.  I really appreciate the cover of this one, because I would love to create a Seregil costume for a convention.  It would be wonderful if this author came to DragonCon.
B003PAXOPU|5.0|Tremendous movie that can not fail to have in your collection. Comes in a very good book kind of really
B004ISVH6G|5.0|John Waite one of the greatest singers in rock history!<br />After leaving the Babys he made some great records but<br />only No Brakes was a bit hit. Too bad cause he's never<br />made a bad record. This one is one of his best! It's got<br />some rocking songs as well as the pop and slower songs<br />but there isn't a bad song on this record. I hope he gets<br />the attention he deserves and continues to record and perform!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't have this app but I was thinking of downloading it. I was reading reviews, and y'all are harsh. I personally don't mind if they need all those permissions. but, once toy create a note, can you convert it into a regular document and email it to the average computer/laptop? Because that's what I need.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I LOVE this game but I wish it would not cost slot to unlock a level or to unlock a car.
B0000046WL|5.0|this is very well done! Christian McBride has an all star cast with him, including Joshua Redman, Steve Turre and Roy Haynes as the horn section. The playing is on point! For his first album, very well done!!!!
B000Q67876|5.0|Tremendous movie that can not fail to have in your collection. Comes in a very good book kind of really
B001MTENOC|4.0|I think this book is good for everyone. It really defines are lives as spirts living in physical bodies. I can't wait to read more from Dr. Newton
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is quite entertaining, with the challenges and all sort of characters to buy with coins. Over all, this game is pretty good.
0757302661|5.0|but this book is very helpful in putting the pain of birthing into a context that allows you to embrace it, rather than fear it.  The first chapter of this book in transformative in the way it exposes the learning process in relationship to the pain of childbirth.  It really provided a foundation for me that I could work within to prepare for my labor and manage my delivery with only a shot of nubain during transitional labor.  The visualizations in the book were helpful.  Though rather than visualizing my cervix opening like a flower, I just visualized my cervix opening.  The end result was the same - it put my mind in sync with what my body was trying to naturally do.  I do feel that is half the battle.  Caveat:  I have only had one child, had a very easy pregnancy and a delivery that lasted only 7 hours from the first contraction to arrival; no braxton hicks, worked right up until the day before.  SO I am fortunate.  However, I do credit the techniques in this book with helping me to provide the best possible environment for this to occur.  We cannot control nature but we can control our response to it.  Even if something unplanned occurs in your birth like the need for a c-section, I think the medication, visualization and grounding skills explained in this book are transferable and would better equip an individual to manage those situations.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I've got a smaller Fiio that can run on the USB charger and i wish this one would too, for those long days at the desk. But this one is better, and the battery life is pretty good, I can go a couple with my typical 3-4 hours of listening time. I love the high gain setting. and the EQ settings are a plus.<br /><br />Also the battery is removable so if you need to you could get a second one and a charger and cycle them.
B007L24T52|4.0|As usual, Baldacci races along with twists and turns that hold you spell-bound! Looking forward to the next exciting publication.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE IT! thx so much whoever made this game and thx for making the game free cause lots of cool and fun games r not free and that sucks
1250012570|5.0|There are books that I absolutely fall in love with and it hurts when it finished. That is how I felt about this book, I wanted more.<br />I loved Eleanor. She is funny, intelligent, and down to earth. I also liked how Rowell didn't make it super pretty or thing. Instead, she has \\"flaws\\" and that is one of the reason that Park likes her. Park was amazing too. He was sweet, thoughtful, and just amazing. Rowell reminded me of how it felt to be a teen and in love. I enjoyed the development of the relationship and that it was slowly built as time passed. I liked the other characters in this book and just wanted more.  I found the plot to be very cute and fun, but at the same time, it dealt with serious issues in a matter that I liked. I found the book intense due to this.  I also loved the setting of the 1980's and how they talked about bands and comic books. I found this to be a very original book and I hope to find one like this in the future. It made me feel so many emotions and I couldn't help liking it. Rowell's writing is amazing and clever. I can't wait to read more from her in the future. It was raw and the story stayed with me after it was over. I need more.  Like seriously, you need to read this book as soon as possible if you like contemporary romance. I recommend this book to fans of John Green,  Jennifer E. Smith,  Stephanie Perkins, and Courtney Summers.
0316152196|5.0|Great Michael Connelley novel, particularly for those who are in any way familiar with Los Angeles. I am currently hooked on the Harry Bosch character and his intensity as he tackles case after case of surprising complexities. Harry is a very human character that will draw you into every novel. Similar to Coben, Baldacci, and Rosenfelt in plot lines and vivid characters. Intense and rivoting until the very end.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|A memoir and reflection on hardcore parenting. Eventually I  came to not take her extreme parenting so seriously and took her writing as ironic, embellished, and at times sarcastic. I can see why it created such a media hoopla but what you get out of it depends on your own perspective and experiences with parenting, and how much you decide to invest yourself in the story.
0345528581|5.0|This book is awesome. Provides easy to advanced exercises. The photos along with written instructions makes this easy to understand. Would recommend to anyone of all physical conditions
0684135051|3.0|I'm not real fond of Elizabeth Zimmermans books and would not buy another one.  There are better ones out there, although there are a few hints in this one that are helpful.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|better than bejeweled; hours of fun. Each level just a little harder than the last; and I haven't. even tried all the different. modes. yet. FREE too :)
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It's a fine little story and spookier than I would have thought. But it's not Gaiman's best work. I may have missed the significance of it all but in the end I couldn't understand *why* this book needed to be written. There wasn't much there there.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Well written, moved along well, an overall interesting story. I would have liked the conclusion to be a little more detailed and filled in. There could have been a little more to the epilogue or maybe the author is planning a sequel. The characters were well drawn and I would like to see more of them.
0062255657|5.0|No one should be calling \\"the Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" anything more than just that--a damn good read.  It's not a tour de force, it's not an all encompassing treatise on human dignity, but it is one of the best stories I've ever read.  And to be honest, it filled a hole in my heart.  A hole I didn't even know was there.  A sliver of darkness that I thought was gone forever, way back in the depths of childhood, has been completed and warmed by Gaiman's gift of storytelling.  You'll wonder how you ever thought this story didn't exist.  It's simple and compact and wonderful.  It aches to be read.  Read it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I like this book but it does start out slow. I would recommend it for anyone who is 10 and up
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have no idea why some people think this game is bad. Those people are nuts! This game is totally worth downloading. It has great graphics, it's extremely addicting, and it's for all ages. If you loved the movie, you'll definetly love the game. Get the game NOW! Your gonna thank me later when you play it.<br /><br />FIVE STAR GAME!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun, makes you think. Ideal for all in family, lots of discussion between my children and myself.I would recommend this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Found it entertaining and sometimes very challenging. Had to get some helps  few times. Overall I enjoyed playing , great for when you have time on your hands.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, good game to play when you have nothing else to do. When you are bored, this is the game to play
1439190275|4.0|Received it quickly and although it seems to be bent open it is still in great shape and easy to read. I am enjoying it a lot.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Really cool app with a good idea and many functions but it won't save images locally so it's rather pointless. Would be nice to have an option to email images too.<br />Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus
B0088X7YMS|5.0|I liked the movie, it's all CGI and has about 90 or more minutes of bonus vignettes on the making of it.  It stays within the ST Universe (Paul Verhoven's) and is a nice addition. I'd also say there was decent character development for the new characters.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Forever Girl. It is a really well written book that combines Dark Fantasy and Romance. Sophia and Charles are bright, memorable characters who are easy to relate to. The evil characters are well done as well.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton has a gift bringing her characters to life and giving a 3-D picture of what is going on with and around her characters. I can't help mentioning that I was thrilled by the visions Sophia had throughout the book. They carried a strong Horror element that was masterfully done.<br /><br />I was left wanting for more after reading the last page. The ending is great, even though a bit sorrowful. No doubt I look forward to reading the next book in the series.<br /><br />***Many thanks to the author for providing me with an e-copy of the book!***
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Started as easy, but by the time I got to the 9x9 grids I actually felt proud that I solved them.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Gave this set as a gift, and it was well received.  What do you say about a set of movies?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I hope they add new levels soon, I've enjoyed these much more than I expected.  The puzzles became progressively challenging with nearly each level.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is a very inspiring book, that I had a difficult time putting down.  The story is for ages 5th grade and up, and would appeal to someone who likes realistic fiction stories.  August, the main charactor, is a very brave and inspiring 5th grade boy, who finds his inner self.  Severel of the characters were supportive of August throughought the book, and some were mean in the beginning, but the better they got to know August, the better friends they became.<br /><br />Wonder draws you in and makes you want to keep reading like no other book I have read.  I enjoyed this book because it made me really feel for August.  This book is very relatable for people with insecurities, and that are nervous about starting a new school without knowing anyone.  Wonder gave me emotions I have never felt while reading a book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a book about grace, forgiveness and repentance that will grasp your heart. God's love and kindness lived out can change others life, just like the short encounter of Jean Valjean and the Bishop. Great book!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. I have only played for a few minutes but decided it is already worth five stars.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I was astonished that they could sing through the entire movie and the story come across so clearly.  This movie is wonderful!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love this game. Other than the really small blurry picture its super fun and challenging. I really like the flow of the game. would be cool if I could zoom.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What more can be said about a franchise that I felt from day one was exemplary? Having attended the very first preview of &#34;Stars Wars&#34; back in early May in Santa Barbara, seeing it opening day at Grauman's and now owning it on Blu-ray, I've come to admire George and the empire he hath built. It wasn't easy, considering his start with Zoetrope. All Kudos and bows to you, illustrious one. May the force be with you forever.
0425263924|5.0|I didn't want it to end!!! It was a fun easy read, I am enjoying the series. Can't wait for the next book.
B00D6BQG1W|1.0|If you are over the age of 14 skip this one. I found it almost painful to sit through the entire thing
B000JML90Y|3.0|quit telling people it is required to write a review. thats wrong and people should be allowed to jotfdown whatever they want.
0761171703|5.0|Lovely, often startling photos you can look at again and again.  Would be a wonderful gift for a dancer.  Inspired me to take more photos of my daughter dancing, to get that perfect action shot.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|The book was so good in so many ways that I thought it was basically impossible to film. Considering what it takes to condense a book into a film, the Wachowski &#34;brothers&#34; have done an excellent job giving us a thrill ride with an excellent cast of actors who manage to fool nearly every critic when they appear throughout the film in a variety of roles (although even with makeup, it's nearly impossible to hide those boyish good looks of Tom Hanks). This film was completely ignored by the voting Academy (who chose Ben Affleck instead????). This is a great film that will stand the test of time. I look forward to &#34;Jupiter Ascending.&#34;
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I would put this in the category of a great epic.  Compare it to Dr. Zavago, Lawrence of Arabia, Gone With the Wind.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it's way more fun than temple run. It is great time passer!I'm going to Europe soon for 7 hour I think will help me pass the time!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|i'm always at work when is on so i'm glad to have bought the season. i can't get enough of it
B00009YXHN|5.0|the movie was good like it. I was able to finish my collection of the franchise. the plot was good.
0670022950|5.0|Stephen Pinker's latest book is his most polished work yet. After reading The Blank Slate and How the Mind Works, I found The Better Angels of Our Nature to stand out among the rest. This controversial book is surely to put you at odds with all who think that violence is on the rise. A lengthy read surely to expand your mind.
B00005N6RU|1.0|A one star rating because 0 is not an option. Amazon sent me a DVD that was a knock off from the United Kingdom which is not compatible with the Sony DVD player I have. First time that has happened. Since it couldn't be viewed and returning a 10 dollar movie with shipping and handling wasn't worth the hassle I simply threw it away.
B004VFK5LO|3.0|I used to work at a Second-Run movie theater. This was one of the first films I saw there with my ticket privileges. Seemed like a pretty standard/generic thriller, although Holly Hunter was quite good.
B009GED3HS|5.0|i absolutely love this show so anything they do is flawless. i can't believe it's going to end soon :(
B000SW4DXK|4.0|Watch all times of year. Family fun and enjoyable. Better ten most of the new movies availiabe, also loved old version
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very good escape game. If you are used to escape games, this one wont take you long to complete; however it was challenging. The graphics are great too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. It has lots of characters and outfits you can buy. You will durely love it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Husband it addicted to this...... Don't hear from him for hours.I like It also,but its his favorite! Fun,fun,fun,fun, luv it
0061906220|5.0|She asks me to read this book to her most every day and its helping her to learn her colors!!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I was somewhat disappointed with my vita purchase, as I didn't have many games that really captivated me. That changed when I got persona 4 golden, which is easily one of the best games of this generation. I've never played a JRPG before and this game is a good introduction to the genre.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I knew they were going to make it free app of day :)  thanks allot Amazon I'm very thankful you guys are cheaper than .. nothing upper echelon you need MORE games if you want MORE money
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a cool game and has a lot of things from the movie, I beat the game<br />in one day
B0020BUWX2|1.0|Boring.to many flashbacks of the past. Not enough emotional scenes and the deaths and such were put to lighly. Nothing happened. You could probably get the same amount of details in a more interesting way in a kids book. It wouldve been better as a short storie.
B005USZYDU|3.0|I thought Pete Duffy would get arrested, instead the book leaves me hanging.so I give this book a 3/5 :)
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|I remember this movie scaring the heck out of me as a little kid. (The children of the 1980's had some twisted movies growing up; you gotta wonder what effects they had.)<br /><br />This is a dark movie that is quite depressing and replaces the dreamlike quality of the first original film for a nightmare scenario. While it introduces elements from other Baum Oz books, it creates a different story that tries to make the characters look like the drawings from the books instead of the first movie.<br /><br />As an adult, I was really excited to see it again but was kind of disappointed at how the movie seemed to drag a little and obviously was not nearly as scary as I remembered. Despite that, it did bring me back and was enjoyable to see again.
081297381X|1.0|There were several logical fallacies within the first several pages of this book, and the word/information ratio was way too high for non-fiction. In the end I was reading the first sentence of each paragraph hoping to find some nuggets of truth, but after 15 minutes I decided my time was better spent elsewhere.<br /><br />The author describes black swan events as outlier data points that cannot be predicted, but then he goes on to list many, many examples of black swans, and eventually suggests that every significant event in the reader's life has been a black swan event.  This is an example of the imprecision I came to expect after just a few pages of reading.<br /><br />I was recommended this book because I read The Drunkards Walk, which I did think was a pretty fun read, but perhaps I should have read more of the reviews of \\"The Black Swan,\\" before checking it out from the library.
B008L5G4I8|4.0|This was Agatha Christie's first mystery and it's the classic case of suspicion falling on all members of a household. Hercule Poirot happens to be in the vicinity and he assists the household in finding the criminal.<br /><br />Christie is skilled at drawing suspicion to and from various members, but she did a double twist in this one. Clever. Very clever. I won't give it away except to say that you should not eliminate anyone, not even the suspects that have been eliminated before.<br /><br />I do feel she wrote herself into a hole at some point and had to think up an extremely convoluted sequence of events to get herself out. Therefore the mystery was not entirely fair because it relied on knowledge about a medical potion that the ordinary reader would not possess. Maybe it's common knowledge for a chemist, but at the end, while I appreciated the skill it took for her to unravel the mystery, it was not satisfying because no one would have known about that particular chemical reaction.<br /><br />There were other places where you had to believe that the perps were so unable to communicate with each other that they'd let evidence sit around, and in fact, there was no reason at all for that key piece of evidence to exist! I mean, bah, a written letter? That is like leaving a smoking gun on the mantel.<br /><br />However it was enjoyable, maybe slow by today's standards and lacking in suspense, because no one was in danger of a secondary murder. Later Christie mysteries will add in the secondary murder to speed the pace up and put more pressure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought this game would become stale but they always have an update that refreshes one's interest.  I think past boards and characters from countries should be available to purchase still.
B00263HWM8|1.0|Don't waste your time. M.I.3 is so much better. This is why people are weary of sequels. It begs you to shut off all common sense. Your brain just can't help but say..\\"Wow, this is stupid\\"
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|,<br /><br />great more than I expected worth the $7.51 dollars best first person shooter just like black opps 2<br />best game I played
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Every chapter leaves you anxious for the next page. Martin's words paint a vast and detailed picture of the Seven Kingdoms and the world beyond the wall.
B000OPP8KI|5.0|its sad that the reason for the price tag of this particular version is due to its non '2.0' status.  the original movie was brilliant- a must have for all anime junkies (sequals and espescially comics included.  it was made at the dawn of film digitisation and had that perfect ballance- cells were traditional painted ones, scannned in with all other art and put tegether in software and mixed with effects.  what was an effect never looked like an effect.  satnav, ghost diving, vehicals always looked part of the same presented world- this was the magic of ghost in the shell (original).<br /><br />sadly marmoru oshi decided to go all george lucas and rework it.  he had pefectly well done sequences replaced with 3d ones that just broke up visual continuity and had the entire film tinted orange to force it to look like the sequal: innocence.  whats even sadder is that this '2.0' version now outpopulates the original in dvd versions and prevented the original from ever even making an appearance on uk shores in blu-ray format and because the original is superior to the messed up 2.0 version it seems you will struggle to find it without a high price tag.
1878424319|5.0|Excellent book! I immediately began to apply its philosophy to my life and felt the benefits right away. I liked this book so much I purchased copies for my 3 daughters and my sister. A worthwhile read.
B00BF11STU|2.0|This movie disappointed me.  It was not the action packed thriller that you would expect from the story of Seal Team 6 infiltrating Pakistani airspace to assassinate Osama Bin Laden.  Instead, this movie focuses on a female member of the CIA that spends the better part of a decade obsessing over Bin Laden's whereabouts while most of her colleagues have given up hope.  While it was entertaining enough to keep me watching, I probably wouldn't recommend it.  The actual raid on Bin Laden's compound is only about 5 minutes of the whole movie.  This movie is mostly a drama about a female CIA agent who has to come to grips with the water boarding methods of interrogation used by the US to obtain information that she needs to accomplish her mission.  Maybe a rental, definitely not a movie to purchase.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This is a terrific movie.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is a wonderful actor.  I love the small town and there are a few very funny parts in this movie.  I have watched it over again - it's really great!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|After reading Ender's Game I have to admit that I expected a different type of sequel. Still focused on military aspects for instance. Yet I have to say I liked the theological, or rather the philosophical route the second book took, adding a different complex element to a great saga. I can highly recommend it and will soon continue with the third book.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I was hoping for more acoustics like their MTV unplugged album but I like a couple of songs (Stone and Voices).
0307593525|5.0|The best part about these cook books is that Julia took time to why a certain technique is necessary. Why using a curtain pot will make or break a dish. I know more about food after reading just the forward than I've learned in the first 27 years of my life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app help a lot I used to hate math but this app made it so easy I rate 5 stars
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is pretty cool but the stuff in the game should be a little cheaper. U have to spend real money to get some stuff.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works fine for me, does what it says on the tin and allows me to know how much power I have left in my Kindle Fire HD 7\\". I've not experienced any of the power drain issues some have reported. It works for me, gives me what I needed it for and best of all, it was free! Nice!
B0082SU98U|5.0|The book was slightly different from the movie we all know and love.  I enjoyed the differences especially it was more detailed about her accident and more details about some of the characters as well. I can't believe I didn't know there was a book. Would recommend this to others to read.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo blitz is a lot of fun to play.  Unfortunately,  it freezes up once in awhile causing you to lose Bingo credits.  You cant get a refund unless you provide a receipt that you paid for those credits instead of earned them through the game.  Also, when you log a complaint you get an automated response but nothing gets done about the problem.  Generally, a great game.  You use to be able to buy power ups, 9 of them for 1000$ now its 4 for 1000.  If I could change one thing,  it would be that you could buy Bingo credits with the coins you earn.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|Avast mobile virus scanner found malware, so uninstalled right away. Don't remember what the name was as I hit Clean quickly.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun game to play and pass some time the only issue is I can't seem to get it to connect to Facebook no matter how many times I try! Please fix this glitch.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I enjoyed this book on so many levels. But don't expect this book to be an easy read/listen. The book is thought provoking and the themes will keep you thinking for many weeks and months. I have gone back to listen to various parts of the book many times and always seem to learn new ideas afterwards. If you are a curious person and enjoy learning about why you think the way that you do then you will enjoy this book. Cheers!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really recommend this app for any temple run lovers.  You'll love this app!! The background music is great, and the minions s are really funny.  It's very entertaining and just plain fun to play. I absolutely love it!!  My new favorite app!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a really good book. It was very suspenseful and intriguing. It kept me coming back and wanting to read more.. Hoping that a second book to continue the story is in the works.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is pretty adictive and more fun than Subway Surfer. The graphics are very good - just like you are watching a movie. I appreciate the fact that this game is free. My only issue with the game is that every once in a while the game will freeze for a nano second which, unfortunately, is long enough to hit the next obstacle and die. The other problem with this game is it randomly just stops and kicks you out of the game. Again, it is a free game with good graphics and it is fun, it's just frustrating when it randomly stops working.
B000059GEH|4.0|Marilyn Monroe is cute even in glass! I like her.<br />Died too young! Who killed her? Robert Kennedy? Did he have an affair with her?
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|A tragically, true story, documented very well. Great family movie to watch with older kids. I would highly recommend it!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|With the two sides, carbide and ceramic, it's a jiffy to either put a new edge on a dull blade, to finish off a sharpening job, or to use the folding rod to sharpen a serrated blade.  Pocket carriable, compact, inexpensive.  A winner for sure.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|As a performer - let me qualify that. Like many people, I first ran into this awesome contemporary violinist on You Tube and when her album came out, I didn't hesitate to buy it. Take a listen and see what you think. Her goal is to take the violin places it doesn't normally go, and she is successful in my opinion. Her You Tube videos are definitely worth viewing. They are creative, epic, sometimes funny but always enthralling.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i love this game it shows the arts with u in ur finger the pictures wont be good but u will be able to know what it is.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I love/hate this game!! This game has several levels, some of which are pretty easy, but some I just can't beat.Argh!!
B000VDDWDS|1.0|Upon placing this DVD in my PC. A Notification that  &#34;This DVD is not of a format your device can play&#34;. Another Icon pops up and claims If I select MY Region, it will play. Upon clicking North America, my computer was attacked and infected with a connection indicated originating in Amsterdam. I had to delete all my Java Applications. I am running a Custom Scan with my Security Software to Erase the Infected Files....<br /><br />NOT Happy<br /><br />Captain Lance.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|This is one of the games I'll pick over most like it, because of the single board graphics on the  KINDLE FIRE is very easy to see and play the game without missing a thing. I really like this game this is one of my faves!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Another great album by Queens of the Stone Age.  Like clockwork contains their signature introspective riffs that range from dark to jubilant.  Songs like &#34;If I Had a Tail,&#34; add a theatrical element to the album, which shows that QOTSA continues to evolve as artists....
0062238868|5.0|The journey of an American hero in his own words.  Not just about combat but the hardships of having a family and the internal struggles of the warrior's heart.
B002YO7A5I|5.0|Really a fantastic pair of headphones for the price.  Disregarding that, I'd even say they're better than a lot of the more expensive ones.  They've got a generous, crisp-sounding bass without going overboard (Beatz.....), and they're incredibly comfortable.  Easy to adjust, lightweight, very durable, great.<br /><br />The only downside I can see is that they don't have a 90 degree plug, thus there might be a chance of the plug getting messed up over time, and cutting out audio to one ear.  But most headphones I've bought have had this same problem unfortunately...<br /><br />Yeah... get them 'n stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it!!!!! I cant stop playing it! I had this game for 10 days and I have been playing it and doing nothing else cud it is amazing!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|LOVEd it! Very, very good television. Makes me want to have good manners and dress well for dinner! Cannot wait for Season 4.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small enough to carry in your pocket for those quick touch ups your blade needs occasionally.  Quality in a small package.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I've only listened to it a couple of times so far, so perhaps it just has not had the chance to grow on me yet, but I am not hearing the old Sabbath sound that some reviewers claimed was present.  This sounds very much to me like Dio-era Sabbath musicianship without the awesome presence of Dio's vocals.  Don't get me wrong, Ozzy actually doesn't sound too bad on this one, but the heavy riffs with thundering bass/drum beneath seems more fit for Dio's singing style.  Too bad he's gone, he really was damn good...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed playing Can You Escape. Challenging but not nerve wracking. No dead bodies or sexual innuendo - no objectionable ads, which is important when small children are playing. Kid friendly. Good pass the time game. Looking forward to more games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app! I love to play it when In the car or at any time... i love minecraft for the PC!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I thought I could use this so I downloaded it, no problem.  But when it went to install, it wanted to do so many other things that I did not want nor understand and maybe even put some extra things on my kindle that I did not want/understand.  Not wanting the aggravation of sorting thru all of that stuff, I uninstalled it and deleted it.  The aggravation far outweighed the usefulness for me.  If someone makes this SIMPLER, without all the EXTRA stuff, I will reconsider it.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking.  I love the story.  The ending was beautiful.  I put this on to watch while my roommates were busy and suddenly they were joining me for an impromptu movie night.  We all loved it.  Now I want to go see the Vegas shows.  Very well done.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thought that this would be a strange and another creepy fantasy books like all of the ones my brother reads. It really surprised me. I enjoyed reading it and cannot wait for Hollow City to come out. I read this on a long car ride and could not put it down even after we got home. I recommend this book and hope people will give it a chance even though it has a...different cover. Remember; don't judge a book by its cover.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I like the actor Tom Hanks and Ms. Berry, I was curious about the concept. After reading a few reviews I knew I had to see this movie, it was very involved in following how the human spirit can always prevail.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|All three Downton Abby shows are insightful and great entertainment.  Masterpiece Theater has done themselves proud.<br />I hope the view more series like this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of this type of shows or movies, but they have got it right. Thrilling, smart, romantic, great actors, amazing photographs and props. You're in for a treat!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Fun, Entertaining & Educational all in one!  Great for the whole family.  I would recommend this movie to my friends.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it!!!!!<br />Can't wait for Season 4!!!!<br />I think I may have to watch it over and over again and again!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A rich storyline layered with intrigue, personal restraint, honor, and the enduring need for a deeper connection than social morays might dictate as acceptable. You must see this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|These little creatures are so cute that when I saw they had a game, I just had to see what it was about.  It is similar to Subway Surfer and Temple Run; however, the graphics are so much better, the challenges are higher and the speed and \\"sideways\\" running is fun and challenging at the same time.  This is truly one game I cannot put down.  Highly recommended.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of the Austen novel, and Elizabeth Garvie is exceptional.  Although I prefer the A & E version overall, your time will be well-spent with this earlier version.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|When you get to an advanced level the app shuts down and will not load at all on our kindle HD. Now I have a crying child who lost his reef.  Don't bother getting your child excited about something only to have the rug pulled out from under him.  Thanks Disney for nothing! Walt would be proud!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started out with the smaller version and found that I was putting everything in it, from vacations to projects at work.  I add pictures of the family with vacations and weekend trips.  It's nice to add what we did during this time as I am getting older will be nice to pass down to the grandsons so they can remember where we went.<br /><br />This is an easy program to use and since upgrading I have added this from my phone to my computer to my Kindle fire.  the program syncs so all information is available on all devices.<br /><br />I recommend this to all even to students as they can keep stories and school projects on with continued updates.<br /><br />Thanks again Evernote.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used many different keyboards on many different phones. But SwiftKey is by far superior toall the others. Customizable, excellent word prediction and correction, the number pad, and arrow keys make for the most user friendly keyboard ever!
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is a wonderful example of Stephen King's skills as a writer.  He puts so much into his characters and scene development - I know way more now about what it would be like to work at an amusement park or carnival than I did before reading this.  In my opinion King is at the top of his game here - Joyland isn't too weird (like some of his older stuff), it's very emotionally moving, it's not too long, and it has a great ending.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />P.S. I actually had a few tears in my eyes at the end of the book. Just to forewarn any future readers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow that is lots more fun than temple run and subway surfer and it also has a lot more items that gives you a advantage in the game. I think u should get the app and funny animation a must do
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it's a great puzzle game that keeps you coming back for more. Very challenging and fun to play. Really makes you think.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|The unique packagaing, and rarity B-sides make this so much better than the old one I played over and over and over, without tiring of their breakthrough sounds.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This app is very boring. Don't waste your time! I am going to delete it very soon. Don't bother with it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun. I love how each level is harder than the one before. I would recommend it for anyone that likes a challenge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm not very good at it but I love this game. SO MUCH FUN  It' not just for kids.  It takes talent
B0091REZMW|1.0|This app like shorts out my kindle I don't know what the problem is. I did like the game play. But I'm deleting for my device's safety. I would appreciate my money back or an email letting me know you fixed the problem I may reinstall.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I downloaded this to check ebay while on my Kindle Fire HD.  Good app.  Simple to use and saves time by not having to go to ebay through the web browser.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Looks very much like the Windows 8 app, which is a good thing. All in all, this is a very good weather app. Would like to see a future map view like on the web site. Would also like to see the Windows Phone 8 app upgraded to this version.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Interested to see if they make significant changes to the third movie installment. Hated the ending unfortunately but still fun.
B00005Y228|5.0|Containing the smash hit &#34;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&#34;, this version of the albums features an alternative cover, far better than the standard one. Amazing songs that turn your living room into a dance club *o*
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging and fun. Requires memory, problem solving, and patience. It would be nice if the hints were more direct. Love how items only work once they have been manipulated.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|I need to know how to get a refund for this film. It came with a long SCratch/crack and was unplayable.  It's one of my all time favorite films and I like to keep a copy.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I'm sure I will love it. Haven't got my blue ray working yet. When it's up & working, &#34;Sof M&#34; will be my 1st play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can you escape is one of the best games ever. This game is really good to workout your brain and strategies.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|had never read anything by nesbo so tried and enjoyed it.  a bit far fetched but that made it enjoyable
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love angry birds so I am glad that the star wars one is free now!  I  downloading it now! It better be good! :-)
B009UKUGXC|5.0|I read Simon Singh's Fermat's Last Theorem in 2007. It was recommended to me by a dear friend as a cure to boredom. I was reluctant about reading it in the beginning as I never had any interest previously in popular science. I nonetheless got it from the library and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down till the time I reached the last page. And when I finished it, I was expecting more. I was sad to see it end.<br /><br />Fermat's Last Theorem is a story about many stories. First and foremost, it is a story about a mathematical problem that ensued from the ancient Pythagorean theorem. Fermat's Last theorem is basically a generalized version of the Pythagoras theorem. It suggests that whole numbered solutions for the higher order Pythagorean equation do not exist. The theorem was proposed by a French mathematician Pierre De Fermat who lived between 1601 and 1665.<br /><br />It has stories about many mathematicians starting from Pythagoras himself and finishing at Andrew Wiles. The latter spent a significant portion of his life is trying to come up with a proof for the enigmatic theorem. He eventually succeeded. The way in which Andrew and a myriad of his predecessors approached to solve the mystery is absolutely epic and is the subject of this book.<br /><br />Stories of many mathematicians are told not only from the point of view of their works' relevance to the Fermat's theorem, but also about their personal lives. It is very interesting and motivating to read the stories of some of the mathematicians who grew out of humble circumstances and became some of the most renowned people of all times. Some of the notable people among these are Laplace, Fourier, Galois, Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimua, to name but a few.<br /><br />The book also has lucid and eloquent explanation of various mathematical concepts and how they evolved over time. For instance, the book explains the generalization ability and importance of a mathematical theorem and its proof. Other topics such as group theory and elliptic curves are also introduced in a layperson friendly way.<br /><br />Reading this book was one of the best experiences of my life. It kindled an interest about reading and knowing more about various disciplines of science and mathematics. After reading this I went on to read other works of Simon Singh, whose thrilling storytelling style vitalizes any narrative he wishes to tell. Any person who would read Fermat's Last Theorem would fall in love with number theory, at least for a while.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love his story telling and his writing. I found the book once again involving me in actual lives in Afghanastan. Whether they were real or not it made me feel alot of differences between our lives
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I liked the characters they make one see the similarities in ones friends and family ..bringing life to the written word is gift that only a few writers posses and Markus in my opinion is one of them !
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this ap used to be great until a few days ago when the new design came out. now it's covered in advertisements and I can never find the right forecast. why did they ruin it???!!
B0095MVOMC|1.0|Avast identified this app as SMSreg infection. Please fix the permissions so avast wont through a fit so I can play it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best games right now and my kids love playing it! Definately keeping this one and recommend it!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Great game, I will be playing for a long while.  It would be an even better game if the dragons didn't cycle out so fast and if we were all playing the same game.
0425267695|5.0|Honestly last weekend I purchased about eight books written by authors unknown to me.  This book was one of them.  Love it!!!  I've read many great fantasy books; Black Jewel trilogy, Fire and Ice trilogy, Farseer trilogy, Chronicles of Elantra series, Black Magician trilogy/Trader Spy trilogy, Deed of Paksenarrion series, Dark Tower Series, Mistborn, Wheels of time,and so many more. I'm all over the map so to speak on what type of fantasy books I enjoy.<br /><br />This particular book is very unique.  It is like Enders Game in that the boys are given up at an early age and must find a bond with the other children in the same situation.  It is like the Rangers Apprentice series in that there are really strong characters within it and many adventures through the story where the main characters use standard weapons; knife, sword, arrows, and fists.  I've only gotten to page 238 so far and it has some hints of darker fantasy.  It will probably turn out to be an epic military type fantasy but at this time could be any type of fantasy book out there as the story continues to grow.<br /><br />It is very well written. The characters are very strong and not just the main characters either.  The story line is interesting and unusual.  Truly awesome book that I can't seem to put down.  Hope others will purchase it for that lazy summer day where they plan for an all day read.  Great choice!!!!
B002HXR542|5.0|This is a MUST watch!!! I have been looking for a long time for a true scary movie that makes you even scared after the movie and this is it!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|As a former A Capella group member, this movie brought back a ton of memories.  Though not original in the sense of the teen romance, its focus on a group of women is refreshing when compared to teen flicks like the American Pie series.  The film includes brilliant singing (all completed by the cast of actors who were not professional singers), entertaining comedy, and a gross-out moment for two. In short, it's light-hearted fun and great for anyone who wants to relive the musical experience that high school and college can be about. Can't wait for the sequel!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I did not realize when I purchased this that the entire movie was a musical.  I have to admit that as the movie started and I realized that the entire movie dialog would be sung, I was very leery.  I have to say that after only a few minutes I didn't even realize that was the case.  What a wonderful movie.  I look forward to seeing this again and again.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I researched so many titles looking for my next book to read that after I began this one I realized I ordered a Young Adult book. This book reminded me of the Twilight series. I enjoyed it. It is well written but I wasn't wanting to read a book about high schoolers.  I thought I would give it to my daughter to read after me but then I came to the part where they have sex in the hotel. The author does a good job making you feel the emotions of the characters.  But the intense emotions and desperation during the sex scene in the hotel would be something I can see adults go through not teenagers. That part was a little much for me but I did give it 4 stars because I thought her descriptive writing was very good.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really, really enjoyed this game. The mood of the game is very similar to Myst: mysterious and vaguely sinister. Here's my breakdown:<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />- The puzzles are innovative and challenging, yet completely able to be solved with minimum (if any) help from the hint system.<br />- The hint system is progressive, meaning each puzzle has a series of three or four hints to help you. The first hint is vague and gives you a general idea of what to do next, and each successive hint gives you more information about the task at hand. This is fantastic, as all you may need to solve a puzzle is a gentle push in the right direction; you're able to solve the puzzle and keep your sense of having accomplished something.<br />- Again, the atmosphere of the game is very Myst-like; creepy and shrouded in confusion. It's not overtly scary, just sort of uncomfortable. It invokes a feeling of distrust; what if the person who is directing you to do all this work is lying about its true purpose? It's extremely well done, in that aspect.<br />- Gameplay is very intuitive and interactive, with the player actually having to turn keys, open drawers, and manipulate objects in a variety of ways. This really helps create a sense of immersion during gameplay.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />- The graphics are a bit fuzzy on my Kindle Fire HD. It's not unplayable, but it certainly detracts from the overall gameplay experience.<br />- The way the player navigates the screen and shifts perspective from one puzzle to another can be very temperamental. Manipulating objects in your inventory, which is required for many of the game's puzzles, can be an exercise in futility.<br />- The music and sound effects are forgettable, doing little to add to the game's overall creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />THE UGLY:<br /><br />- Gameplay is SHORT. It took about 2.5 hours to solve everything, which left me feeling a bit miffed. Obviously, your play time will vary, but if you're an experienced puzzle gamer or particularly good at this type of game, don't expect a long gameplay experience. There is little payoff, and virtually nothing is explained about the nature of the element at the center of the story. There is a promise of more games to come, so hopefully answers will be had in these chapters.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this game,with one star subtracted for the short play time. I think the developer would have been better served by developing the second part of the story and releasing them as one game. The end comes abruptly, which somewhat cheapens what should be an excellent, innovative puzzle game experience.
0060853980|5.0|I bought this book for light reading while on vacation.  Planned on reading only during the painfully long bus rides, plane rides, airport layovers... You get the idea.<br /><br />Problem is, I had a REALLY hard time putting this book down!  Superbly written, light hearted, funny.... With the added advantage of being centered in England, where I happened to be vacationing.  (I admit looking for Aziraphel's bookstore while staying in Soho.... And I may have walked by it!)<br /><br />Have read both authors and rate this book on par with similar writings for both.<br /><br />Can't say enough about it,... If you love these authors, this book is a must read....<br />Although,... If you plan on reading during your vacation, you'll need at least something else to read as well.... This book doesn't last very long when you can't put it down.  ;)
B001O1O71C|4.0|While this is a difficult subject and much has been written about it.  This was a unique.  Written from a child's perspective.  Very touching.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said.A great work, worthy of reading and rereading.  The story of Ender, a child prodigy, born and trained to lead the human fleet against an unseen enemy.  Its easy to forget that Ender is a child in all this.  He is pushed to his breaking point, and just when he is about to give up, he finds it deep within himself to push through.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|Being a fan for about 10 years I was thinking they were losing their edge when Sounds of the Universe came out. But after getting into this album on my last overseas vacation, I came to realize they had pushed their boundary again. Musically they've moved into some edgier territory, lyrically there's been some improvement but not as much as I would have hoped. The notable blues influence on this production manages to work, but as blues is not my thing the other tracks have more appeal to me. They could have left off \\"Child Inside\\", \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Slow\\" as these seem to cater to the individual members or main stream too much and not show the band's work and direction for what it is.<br />The songs that move me most are \\"Angel\\", \\"Secret To The End\\", \\"Broken\\", \\"Soft Touch/ Raw Nerve\\", \\"Alone\\" and \\"Always\\". Although DM is not a young band anymore, their experience and hard studio work has kept me listening and enjoying their music. Here's to them moving the boundary for many years to come!

B00AEFXKOO|5.0|This movie is a classic, and I was excited to add it to our collection.  The last time I owned it, it was on VHS, so this is a major improvement!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hopefully there are more types of this game created. It really keeps you busy. I love this game. It really makes you think!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love this game. I've played the others and helps with this one. Great graphics and story telling hope they keep coming up with new ones!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challeng<br />this game is challenging and fun to play. to get through the game you need to use the different clues in creative ways. loved this game
B00007FKPY|5.0|I am a newbie to Parsifal and stewed about which to buy.  No regrets!  The performers sound terrific; the recording shows its age somewhat especially with the string sound, but the playing is excellent and the dynamics remarkably good.  Hall sound (ie sense of space) is far better than on many glossier sounding recordings (of other works, that is) and I find that more compelling at giving a sense of occasion.  I think I picked just the right first one, now the problem is which one next.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|The movie lived up to all my expectations of it.  A sweet love story brilliantly told by the author and director.  Would highly recommend same to anyone.  Look forward to watching many more times in the future
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book makes me feel a pang for that which I forgot. Because I do. Forget. This story examines that which we know, and that which we are able to know. I want to know what I forgot....but the author, Gaiman, seems to send a caution about that wish.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|First game I have played where it was actually worth it to upgrade and get more levels. A game that is fun and makes you think. Highly recommend you get this game.
0345537998|5.0|I have the fortune to own the one of the first edition paperback issues of this book (March 1987) and am so glad that I haven't gotten rid of it.  I had a huge library of books but have begun to purge it recently but not this one. It holds a place of honor with other old favorites of the past.  No library worth it's science fiction salt would be without this incredible story.  Tuf is smart, cunning and fat, being a stranger to exercise but surprisingly is a vegetarian.  What makes him unique though is his old fashioned values and manners. Which is a good thing when he comes into possession of an ancient seed ship that could change worlds and corrupt a lesser man.  I especially love his affection for cats as I'm a cat lover myself.  I highly recommend giving this book a read now that it is again available.  You won't regret it.
0449911357|5.0|It reminded me of our own cold winters here in Windsor Canada  directly south of Detroit mkchigan and left me with a self yearning to find such a lovel place to spend my last days with truly lovely and thoughtful people.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its a cute fun game and it keeps me busy lol its not hard to learn and it has the most basic instructions.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|the book was so amazing an ended way to soon. I cant believe I have to wait for the next one to come out.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game so far I've been playing for a couple days now and I very much interested still hopefully every thing will stay the same in the way I mean smooth game play no force close and I play on a kindle fire..
B0060YIBLK|4.0|It is really quite an amazing book with some very good techniques about starting a conversation and how to focus on the other person.  I think people, for the most part, tend to have conversations with others just to get an audience to talk about themselves. This book gives you verified techniques to get others (strangers) to talk about themselves.  Some of the techniques could be used for people you know as well. I found the book very interesting, even with all the psychology I've had, I learned quite a lot, and found that I had actually used some of these techniques previously, without even realizing it.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|While, perhaps derivative of countless other horror films, Sinister possessed enough of its own style and atmosphere to both scare and entertain. The opening scene was awful enough to work its way into your head and set the tone for what proved to be an entertaining blend of creepiness and suspense. The tension built upon itself at a solid pace and worked its way to a pretty fulfilling, if not predictable, finale.
B002ECN4P0|4.0|I chose this rating because I like the Rolling Stones. Ilke all of the songs that are on it. I'd recommend this this product to anyone who likes the rolling stones
B00AREIAI8|3.0|In love this game! It makes me feel like I have my own horse!! :) you complete, car for the horse, feed the horse, and train the horse like it's actually yours!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this app!!!!!!!!!! It brings the world of Jurassic park to life. It's perfect for all ages who love dinosaurs, or don't.
B008JFUQZ2|3.0|Well it's here everyone, my second most anticipated movie of the summer behind the exceptional World War Z. What could possibly be better than a worldwide zombie outbreak starring Brad Pit? How about a summer blockbuster about giant monsters and robots smashing the hell out of each other? It's like someone watched a bunch of anime and decided that, hell yeah, mechs VS monsters is a freaking great idea for a movie and American audiences will eat it up. I mean, how can you screw that up? Monsters, robots, in an anime inspired brawl to the death? Shut up and take my money! But as amazing as that sounds, Pacific Rim, though fun and most certainly enjoyable at times, doesn't quite manage to live up to expectations.<br /><br />In 2012 a riff opened up at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean through which monsters of enormous size called Kuaji entered the earth and wreaked havoc on our major cities. First San Francisco was destroyed. Six months later, Manila. As time went on more and more Kuaji emerge from the riff to wreak havoc on our shores. In response to this threat humanities governments rallied together to create the Juager program (perhaps after taking too many Juager Bombs) and begin construction on a series of giant robots to battle the Kuaji. And for a while it works. More and more monsters come out of the riff with less time between attacks, and every time they are destroyed by the Juagers. But things have changed. The Kuaji are coming more and more frequently, and the Juagers are being overwhelmed. Twelve years after the initial breach humanity has placed all its hope in a gigantic sea wall around all its shores (which is exactly as stupid an idea as it sounds) and given up on the Juagers. With only four Juagers left operational, and extinction knocking on humanities doorstep, a last ditch effort is made to close the breach once and for all and end the Kuaji threat for good.<br /><br />What follows is a disjointed, cheesy, fun as hell mess of a film that at the same time is one of the corniest films of the year and one of the most entertaining. Let me get the negatives out of the way now, and please hold off on the crucifixion if you can. The movie spends way too much time focusing primarily on the characters in the film, which would be great had there not been such terrible character development. Okay, that's a bit harsh. They aren't THAT terrible, but with so much time and effort given to them when we could have been watching a giant monster bash the very least Del Torro could have given us was compelling characters and convincing acting. A character driven story of the world's desperate fight against unstoppable odds is not a bad idea, in fact it was done quite well when it was called Neon Genesis Evangelion (for those of you who don't know, it's an anime mech series that has achieved legendary status), but Pacific Rim doesn't even do a passable job in developing its characters into people we'll care about. We do get a couple of touching moments, esp when it comes to female lead Mako Mori (played by Rinko Kikuchi) but all that is done in flashback and very little is done with her adult self. All the other characters are cheap one dimensional cardboard cutouts with no depth, little personality, and nothing at all compelling about them.<br /><br />\\"But it's a monster VS robot movie!\\" you say. \\"Why would you go see this film if you wanted three dimensional characters?\\" Well, you have a point.  I didn't go to the movie to see a character driven film. And that's the problem. Pacific Rim tries to be more than that and does focus on its characters a lot more than other movies of this type. It TRIES to be more then Star Trek, or Iron Man, or any of the other mindless summer fare we've seen this year. It just fails at it, and fails badly. EVA this is not. The script is full of pointless tension, cheesy one liners, and wasted characters. It really needed to go through another draft or two before they started filming.<br /><br />Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, let's get on to what the film did right. For a film like this they really only had to do one thing right and one thing only, and that's the fights. And yes, I'm glad to announce that what fights they did have were actually quite good. Though I do have quibbles with how the monsters were designed, that was quickly forgotten the first time a Juager punched a Kuaji in the face. Such scenes of epic awesomeness are just too much for the human brain to comprehend. The robots are amazing, reflecting their countries of origin in both design, functionality, and tactics. Whereas the Russian Juager is built like a tank and fights in similar fashion, the Chinese Juager is a lot sleeker and uses its speed and many bladed weapons to their advantage. The tech is also interesting as well as the Juagers require two pilots to operate as it would kill a lone pilot. It may seem like a stretch to give a movie three stars for fight scenes alone, but come on. It's a giant monster movie. THIS is what people are paying for, so this is clearly the most important aspect of the film. And Pacific Rim blows it out of the water. I'll call it right now; Pacific Rim is the best live action American movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. Hands down.<br /><br />So is Pacific Rim worth seeing? If you want to see robots battle monsters in one of the most epic battle royals of the year, then yes. If not, nooooo. It's a fun movie, with a good deal of action to keep people entertained for a long time. Though the silliness, the bad character development, and the cheesy script hold this film back it does the battles right and that's all people really wanted from this film anyway. Is it a masterpiece? No, not even close. Is it a fun romp of a film with fun battles and amazing effects? Hells yeah it is.<br /><br />Replay value, high., now that I've got that out of my system, let's get on to what the film did right.

B000002G8L|5.0|I choose this rating because I love it. I wanted the songs that are on it. I wanted live Eric Clapton on my ipod
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Season.five is the last one. I knew it had to end, the question was when and how, and they did a great job of it. This definitely has a look about that is not American, but that is quite ok. The the camera work, writing and acting is great.  One thing that stands out is the a great deal of the shows are not shot in a studio,  but in castles and in the wild and it shows. Even though it is fantasy fiction, it looks to be shot on a real fitting location, although the primary castle is French.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much if you watched despicable me 1 or 2 you should get this app definitely.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I loved everything about this game!  Beautiful graphics, lovely music soothing game play...Don't know what else to say I would definitely recommend this game if you love match three type game
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Great artist. Good CD. Arrived quickly in great condition. Rod Stewart is ageless. His voice still sounds remarkable even after his health problems. Now he has learned to trust his own writing abilities. Enjoy the lyrics as well as the music.
B00005QB42|5.0|Anything she sings I absolutely love and this is no exception.  What more can I say.  She's beautiful, her voice is beautiful.  Her songs are beautiful!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This product was everything I wanted it to be.  Really good quality, and I would definitely purchase this again !
B0034KZE9U|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE.. I WAS AFRAID THESE WOULDNT FIT BECAUSE I WEAR A SIZE 16/17/XXXXL Shoe in Croc.. I can only wear the beach/cayman clogs... and in normal shoes/sneakers I wear a 16W...<br /><br />I got these because they were a good price, and could always return these if needed..<br /><br />i got them on and they fit perfectly... not so much tight as snug... perfect for me!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This book continues to develop the characters I have come to love in this series, and introduces some new ones as well. While quantum theories are interesting, I will stick with my Lord God's theory. That said, I am in no way offended by this book, rather find It a great r read with lots of excitement, suspense, and action.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use it to compare with AccuWeather to see if they are similar. The closer the match, the more I believe the  forecast.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read, so suspenseful and so mind blowing. Now I want to read the last book, and that's exactly what I'll do!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a very fun and enjoyable game for everybody. I like it because it even kind of teaches you about dinosaurs.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great solitary game, but is plagued with ads.  Good graphics, auto moves, and speedy resets.  Every thing you would want except for the annoying ads that you must deal with before the game can begin.
B001AQO3XS|1.0|I bought this disc and then did not watch it for several months.  When I did the disc was faulty.  The sound did not play and it seemed as if it were flawed.  Of course my mistake was not watching it right away for now I have a flawed disc and cannot return it.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|The DVD's were intact, but the box was a little meh. Great, though! The series is truly amazing to watch!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I don't see why so many people don't like this app, it's so much better than the first one. More blades, and the giant pomegranate at the end to give you bonus points. Also more backgrounds. The only real downside of it is the fact that you need wifi, but its really not that big of a deal people!!!! :P  i love this game!!!
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Fun and entertaining.  Love the science,  I use to watch this show years ago when it first came on.  It was fun to share it with my son.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I can't place blocks and destroy blocks .When I place blocks it goes somewhere else!<br />Waste of money... I wish they would just fix there issues
B007B5EDEG|4.0|Started with book one, put my entire life on hold until I completed book 5. Now I can eat sleep and breathe again. Waiting for books six and seven
0895260131|5.0|This was a great read.  Lots of valuable information.  I bought the book mainly for the info on Islam, to understand Jihad better.  I've really liked other P.I.G. books, so that sold me on it.  This book definitely delivers.  It's pretty simple so the average person can understand it.  It's footnoted - these are facts, no matter what most of the world will try to tell you!  It quotes the Koran - anyone who tells you that Islam is a religion of peace is crazy.<br /><br />This book also talks about the crusades, both the Islamic side and the crusader side.  There were atrocities on both sides, but we only hear about the horrible things that the crusaders did.  This book sets things straight.<br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the crusades, particularly seeing that Jihad is nothing new but is centuries old, this is a great book.  It helped me understand what Jihad is, why Muslims participate in it, that it is a key ingredient of Islam, and how it all works together today.
0345803493|5.0|My mom absolutely loved this book. I'm looking forward to reading it myself. My mom said that 50 shades darker, is better than 50 shades of gray.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's like Temple Run and Subway Surfer, but it is still a lot of fun. It is easy to play, and we like the Vector battles.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent book. My daughter and I enjoyed the movie as well. I look forward to Martel's next book. Highly recommended.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Watched using Benq W7000 amazing 3D razor sharp picture, On a scale of 1 to 10 for picture quality I give it a 10 I have purchased other Blurays that where not worth the extra money I spent for the Bluray disc DVD would have been more than enough (Example Apollo Thirteen)
0307476464|1.0|Hm...perhaps I chose incorrectly for my first book by Haruki Murakami.  I read the description and my interest was piqued.  I waited patiently for the paperback edition and eagerly began to read when it arrived.  Having made it to page 629, I am finding the dialogue between the characters to be tedious and the story far more wordy than necessary.  Also, I read for pleasure and had I known the content included details that I don't find pleasurable to read about, I would not have purchased this book.  The story includes details regarding the cult leader having had intercourse with his daughter and his altered states in which he is unable to move except to ejaculate into 10 year old girls.  Not my kind of a fantasy book...
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|Gmail on my Kindle Fire HD.  Works like on my phone.  I will use it when I am not using my phone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i found this game to be quite fun and addictive. it is also challenging you have to use your brain. i give it five stars.kudos to the graphics and design teams
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game, but it doesnt have half of what the computer version has! I cant play it on MY computer, so I REALLY hope that it updates!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A can't put down Amazing book! Would love to have met Adam and his friends. This book gave me a new respect for the men and women who sacrifice their lives so the rest of us can live in peace.
B00821PCJS|3.0|While this show is in the same vein as many other themes out there it still has some original twist to it if you are in to aliens and sci fi this gives you something to pass the time is it compelling as Game of Thrones no human evil just seems somehow more dangerous than an aliens
0439023491|5.0|Wonderful book. The story is very Interesting it will keep you on your toes.  A great book, I loved reading it. Recomended for young teens and adults.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I absolutely love the edition, I'm a Superman freak and I'm more than pleased with Hans Zimmer's partiture. 'Thet are you going to do when you're not saving the world?' is an absolute masterpiece.
0894803123|5.0|Gave this as a gift to my son along with the Cuisinart ICE-21.  It has already got dribbles on the favorite pages! For calorie watchers, there are recipes for yogurt.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is amazing! I picked the warrior I love slicing my foes down with the ax! Pretty awesome so check it out!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I appreciated this game.  It was fun to play, but i wish it was a little longer for the price.  Different setting - good theme.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|this game is lots of fun. and is challenging. with its unique clues,  it makes you think and observe. I really enjoyed this app. each floor has different cryptic clues that need to be solved before you can take the elevator to the next floor.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun app similar to temple run and subway surfer. It is very fun and challenging and the game moves at a pretty fast pace. So much fun and a great time killer.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|Love it. Not my favorite QOTSA album (Songs for the Deaf & Lullabies to Paralyze are AMAZING) but completely worth the purchase.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|its a fun game. its a little hard to get used to the controls but otherwise its amazing. People should have real fun with this game.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Good for sandy bridge x86in'. Works great. Just enough power. Not crazy expensive. Great starter processor for first time pc builders.
1591845556|3.0|Like many reviewers have noted, the author goes into tremendous detail about what he's studying/learning, as if you're reading his personal journal of his journey thru these tasks.  It can be extremely tedious, and there is no particular point being made; in other words, there is simply no reason for you to be subjected to this level of detail about the particulars of his computer programming, or the game \\"Go\\".<br />If you can be washing the dishes or in some other way using your time, you might not feel like its being wasted as much; therefore, get it on audio.<br />Only the first very small portion of the book is relevant.  Don't get me wrong, I like the author and his book and appreciate his sharing his personal journey with us.  However, a great majority of it was simply wasted time listening to someone else's story.  It will probably hold little application for you, the reader.  Be a \\"listener\\" instead, if you can.<br />I have found a different way to accomplish goals and/or learn skills and subjects.  Its all free, and you can learn the method by searching for \\"15 minute goals\\".  But this author's method is probably a little bit better at getting concrete results, its just much more difficult to implement.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|Characters were what made this film go the little girl and the minions worked perfectly with the Carell character parts were laugh out loud funny
159463176X|3.0|This was just OK, as the three stars indicate. I LOVE Hosseini's previous books, so I was beyond excited to read his newest release. I was sad to find that the story itself just didn't grab me. I definitely found the beginning to be much better than the last half of the book, where I basically lost interest in the story. I'd give it a try if you like the author, but I don't this this novel compares at all to his previous works.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Sometimes I feel like movie critic reviews need to treat each movie differently based upon what it is trying to do.  If you treat every movie like it's out to win the Oscar for Best Picture, you're going to find a lot of \\"terrible\\" movies.  This is one of them.  It is not in contention for an Oscar.  It's there for entertainment purposes, and entertain it does.  Most people skip movies like this in theatres because we don't care to pay $20 for a one-time viewing.  We wait, and buy it on Bluray for the same price and can then watch it repeatedly and enjoy it every time.  How many times can you watch an Oscar-winning movie before the \\"art\\" and \\"charm\\" start to wear you down?  This movie claims no art and charm and instead provides just shy of two hours filled with enjoyable action scenes.  Yes, it's preposterous but they put their money and effort into making cool fight scenes that make you feel happy and forget about life for a bit.  Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a fun escape from reality that will be plucked repeatedly from your shelf for repeated watching while the Oscar winners gather dust.  Keep your mind open and don't judge this movie based upon what it's not trying to be.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Seth Rogen, and I really enjoyed this film.  He was a little more serious in this film. It was a cute movie and Barbra Streisand was cute.  They make a great comedic duo, it also seemed more serious for most Seth Rogen movies.  He tends to play in a lot of slap stick humor type of movies, this one was one of those films that portrayed a better more serious Seth Rogen.... I like
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My Grandchildren loved it! If they liked it I like it, beside it was just funny, liked the character and the story
0743454537|5.0|This book was great.  My son needed it for his English Honors summer reading and I really got into the book with him.  Awesome and powerful read.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|We have been playing this this game for almost a year on Kindle and IPhone.  \\"FRIENDS\\" have been  disaster most of the time, log in has not worked a good portion of the time.  I have not been able to log in to GL Live for two weeks on my Kindle and one week on my IPhone.  I have missed out on collecting from friends and purchasing promotional items.  I have been emailing Gameloft for over a week and all I get is \\"Someone is looking into this issue.\\"  If 36,000,000 people are actually playing this game, as Gameloft claims, then they should be working the issues and not giving everyone the runaround!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! and the minions really look like it in the movie! and they are as funny as in the movie!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Good movie if you're into the mafia gangland type movies, lots of mafia type executions. I really enjoyed the movie.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next installment.  This is by far one of Jeffry Archer's best storylines.  Too bad it wasn't written into one all-encompassing volume.  But then, I'd have breezed through it by now and not had something to look forward to!
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums from my favorite band in the whole world. Twenty one pilots are amazing and I have the biggest crush on Tyler.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Enjoyed the characters and story. Parts were too wordy. I'm not sure that I will read the rest in this series.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This is no mere book. A philosophical, tragic, theological and masterful adventure filled with unforgettable moments of awe.<br />After countless reviews, this book ends with controversy, leaving you to decide it's truth, much like with religion, but the answer, will never be known. Call me a spoiler, but it's the books, not the movie everyone has seen s send that makes the difference in choice
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was a good start; it just didn't fully develop. With this storyline, it would have really exploded on screen, but the characters were t quite real enough--lacked depth in developing what might have become a powerful movie. But didn't feel enough authentic view of who they were and why and how.<br />Having said that, the scenes--many of them way cool--maybe should have been a mini-series!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great way to get ideas!!!!!<br />The way I can I can make board's!<br />This is recommended to me even if I have it!!!
0715338153|5.0|This is a charming collection of characters to sew.  I look forward to buying some fabric today for a bunny project.  All patterns appear to be well delinieated as to procedure.  Buying the collection made great sense, and I was not disappointed.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I enjoy the music of Ms Boyle. I liked the songs on this particular cd because I knew most of them.<br />If you like easy listening with an excellent voice accompaniment you will enjoy this one.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I always liked playing games like galaga and invaders. When I saw this game , I knew I would like it. Thanks! It's great playing it again!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|LThis game is a great game to work your mind.when you feel like there is nothing to do playing escape the floors will really help.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for everyone to play and challenging so much fun. I hope everyone can get this game.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|I just tried to download this app and my security found a malware virus. Install with extreme caution or not at all. I didn't
B002OMZTSK|1.0|The plot was the predictable high school romance novel, but instead of boy-meets-girls, it was boy-meets-boy. Russel Middlebrook was not a very bright character, nor were most of the other characters. The plot was boring, predictable to the point where I could say what would happen before it did. This may be a book other people would love, but in my opinion it sucked; 0/10 would not ever recommend... ever.
B009SH5JS4|4.0|My wife has been waiting some time  for this movie to release on blu-ray and here it is. Movie looks great.
0345529057|5.0|Of course I watch the series on HBO but also wanted this for my library collection. Thanks Amazon for providing this for a lot cheaper than the stores.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It was a fantastic book. Love every thing about it! I would recommend this book to my friends and family
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had lots of fun with it. Raced my husband on several levels to see who could escape faster. Fun game.
1572816295|5.0|This deck is beautiful, I love the art that Paulina Cassidy creates... it is very fairy-tale infused and dreamy, vintage as well.  Not all of the cards have the traditional ryder waite symbolism, but I was able to do an accurate first reading with them today, after they arrived.  The cards are very &#34;busy&#34; so if you spend a lot of time searching for symbols, you are going to be spending a lot of time analyzing these cards (I still need to give each card a really deep look!!!  But will do so later).  I love the cards and I highly recommend!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty enjoyable, some of the puzzles are linear and would be nice if they allowed you to see where your mistake would be instead of not allowing you to perform an action (thinking of level 10). Considering the puzzle will reset if you leave the app anyways so you can reset it after seeing your mistake.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The story of Kvothe continued! Great mix of fantasy, adventure, and love. Now the long wait for the third book.
B003Y5H5FQ|2.0|This 3d has so many problems...ghosting, poor quality blacks. The audio is great and some of the shots  are great.  Give it a 60% rating.
B008MM9630|5.0|Gme is ok.it is fun and help me relax<br />The. Characteristic is nice and funny.i use this game to kill the time
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|This game was a lot of fun until you get to level 3.7. When you get to that level you can't move on because your ship crashes into the fan and there's nothing you can do about it. When the developer fixes that glitch I will change my rating!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a really great game this is awesome u could do a lot of cool things with this game
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Dont get me wrong the movie was very good. But i was looking like it might be more action like and less \\"Twilight\\" like. But good premiss and well done.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was skeptical at first...but wanted more when finished. Just try it..it's free. Definitely getting more levels when they come out.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Terrible Movie.  The writing was very poor, the action wasn't anything special, and the characters are not likable. Very poor movie.
0307950689|4.0|Full of interesting and eye opening facts that are neatly woven into a great story. A refreshing read as like many of his other works.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|With most free games you get some adds. This one shows you an add after ever game, but it really isn't that big a deal to me. Runs great on my kindle fire HD. I love the game, so maybe that helps. I am happy to give them a 5 star rating. It isn't like I've ever made a game though, so I Have no idea why my rating should make a difference. :) I am just a woman who enjoys the mahjong.<br /><br />You might enjoy it too...give it a try.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I would love this game, except for a couple of things. The biggest issue is that it often doesn't give credit for things you have done to earn rewards, so you have to do twice as much as you should . The second problem I've had is that it pushes actions that cost cash to complete. I originally rated this game higher, but twice now it has \\"rebooted\\" or something, and started the whole game over, when I was in higher levels (above 25) for no reason. I lost my whole reef - again, and I had spent real money on in-app purchasing, which is now basically gone & wasted. I will never play again.
B005HWUBZ0|4.0|The songs on this album remind me of late '60's Motown style. Great vocals, not too heavy production and a lot of catchy songs.<br /><br />Best cuts are &#34;A Long Time&#34;, &#34;The Walk&#34;, &#34;The News&#34;, &#34;You Called Me&#34; and &#34;No Strings&#34;.<br /><br />I first heard him when he appeared on &#34;Live From Daryl's House&#34;. I'm not easy to impress, so when I say Mayer Hawthorne can sing, you can take it to the bank.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|If you are a fan you will be pleased.  Has instrumentals imbedded in different tracks and shows the bands progression.
B003B96AOW|2.0|To me the best part of this figure is the base he comes with. Its very well detailed and large. He also comes with some nice weapons though the Sai and the Katanas feel very brittle. The 3 guns he comes with two hand guns and a machine gun seem to be out of scale with the figure as he's a tad bit bigger then your average Marvel Select figure. The scale is also one of my more biggest dislikes. This Deadpool is to large for the character hes a good head taller then the other average size MS figures i have. The joints on mine are also a bit loos in the legs so its hard to stand. The Detail is very nicely done on the over all sculpt of the figure with some nice shading tossed in to help it pop. There are a few small paint issues here and there but thats to be expected with most figures.
0679809015|5.0|The twins, my niece and nephew who just turned three loved this book according to Mom. In fact I sent 3 books total and this is the one they both want. I may have to send one more copy.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I found this world builder game and am learning the ropes.  It has lots of help with pop up comments and a help section in the app options.  I introduced my grandson to the app and he took off like a rocket with it.  I think we have found another game experience we can enjoy together.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is quite addictive, i can't stop playing it since i downloaded it this afternoon. Keep up the good work.
6305313687|4.0|Really shows the bad side og gang voilence even when you try to turn your life around. A good movie to watch
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Seems like it could be a great app.....but, have yet to find where it saves pictures.  Uninstalled, then re-installed.  Contacted the developer twice, and haven't heard back or even an aknowledgement of receiving my email.  Have it on Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and Galaxy S3.  Doesn't work on either.
160459201X|4.0|Over many years, I have collected Dr. Murphy's books.  This is perhaps his best and I am grateful to have it!  After MANY years, a quote or reference made by him, will pop into my mind,  fresh as the day I first read it.  I value this book!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Wow the best movie i have seen in a long long time.....  wonderfully made and monsters to watch galore!  I thought it was fantastic!
B0000DK4PO|5.0|I have loved this since I first saw it. I had to buy again bc my first copy stopped working. Baz Luhrman is crazy! It's flashy, I love all the music. Ewan McGregor sings so well. I will always keep this in my collection.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Someone told me this movie was similar to Narnia or to Avatar. That is not true at all!BTW, I never talked to this person again after this comment!. It's a movie full of Hindu symbolism about animals and if you are not familiarized, it would make you watch it many times until you get it.<br />Love it, from beginning to end, totally engaging.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|previous version had easy-to-navigate maps and info. noticed a major change when wife got a new tablet and d-loaded this. decided to not allow an update on my kindle but today it updated automatically w/o my permission :(  would have deleted anyway adding insult to injury it crashed my kindle. less qualities. non-intuitive navigation. fewer map layers. bummer.
B00CFA227C|5.0|i liked everything.....  so much action and strange giants who lived above the earth on a small piece of land it looked like with running water falls...  lots of rocks..  wow it was the cartoon made into human form like the flintstones with humans and it was really exciting at everyturn....  do not miss it please....  it is worth it big time....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I couldn't quit, well thought out. Some rooms were more challenging, but not too hard. Can't wait for new rooms!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Fresh out of the theater, here is what I think about the film itself:<br /><br />The spectacle of this film is unrivaled. The CGI budget for Pacific Rim must have been enormous, because you see an insane amount of money all over the screen. Everything moves in a way that looks natural, and on a grand scale that your brain sees and understands. The sound design is also first-rate and helps you feel like you're there. The plot is simplistic and standard, but that's a good thing, since it gets out of the way and lets you experience the main attraction of seeing the massive monsters throw down. And thankfully, the action is framed and edited in such a way that you can see and always understand what is happening and who is where. The characters and drama are serviceable for the most part, and don't really drag the film down, but they don't pull at your heartstrings much either. There is a really over-the-top nerd stereotype applied to two characters in a subplot that I didn't really care for, but even they moved the plot forward with vital information about the final mission. I had a big grin on my face for the entire movie, and a lot of people around me were cheering out loud at the great action. If you don't have fun watching this movie, maybe movies aren't for you.<br /><br />About the blu-ray:<br /><br />It is not released yet as of 7/12/13, the opening day of the film. However, these days every new movie looks and sounds great on blu-ray. This is not 2006 when people were still figuring out how to use the format and certain transfers were awful. That is really only the case with some older catalog titles at this point. Unless it is botched (very unlikely) this will almost certainly be a fantastic demo disc to show off your audio/video setup. I also hope there is an extended edition blu-ray of this with a little more fleshing out of the main characters (I think 10-15 extra minutes would be fine without dragging things down.) I will update this part of the review whenI get the blu-ray.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Once again Sylvia Day does what she does best. Write about Eva and Gideon! Get completely lost in them every time!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Now first i must tell you no one seems to be what they say at everyturn....  if they say they are the good guys do not believe until you continue watching at everyturn....  you'll see a big difference and it will amaze you what trickery develops....  and all the characters are so special to me and dear to my heart...  just watch and see you will not be dissappointed....
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have grown up with the WOT characters, and as such had awaited the arrival of this last novel in the series for a very long time. What a joyous and yet bittersweet experience it was to read the culmination of the series, with a story that you simply CAN'T PUT DOWN until the very last page. What a thrill to see so many characters finally achieve victories or epic moments prophesied throughout the series, and yet it is with sadness that you say goodbye to some beloved characters who honorably give their lives as a sacrifice for all that is good. So many characters from this series have left an imprint on me and will always shape who I am. Great kudos to Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for an epic, wild, satisfying adventure! May the Dragon ride again on the Wheel of Time!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|First, let me place a little background. I don't read. I don't care about the adaptation of the book. My wife wanted to watch this movie and I conceded simply because she bought me some pizza.<br /><br />The movie itself is good enough to watch, but I am not exactly raving about it right now.<br /><br />The character development in this movie is atrocious. I started off hating about 4 characters in the very beginning simply because their acting was terrible. I am not sure if it was the acting so much as the director's interpretation of Southern behavior, dialect and the stereotypical \\"church people.\\" That is really what I took from some of these characters. Really heavy-handed stereotyping of Southern culture and it was a hard pill for me to swallow. I mean really, really hard to swallow.<br /><br />The main character also had a penchant for constantly mentioning books and trying to apply them to life. He did it way too often. I understand that someone who had something to do with this movie really had an extensive high school reading list. It was very unnecessary.<br /><br />Finally, one of the silliest moments to me, was a scene where the main character and the \\"caster\\" are out in the rain and he starts citing the movie Titanic. The main character is supposedly some \\"jock\\" according to the caster female protagonist and she seems to think he is a jock after quoting the Titanic. She also seems to think he is a cool kid in school. It just all seems a bit overdone and unbelievable.<br /><br />Anyway, if you get past the fact that this movie is way too exaggerated in too many ways, then this will be a decent experience for you with a supernatural background.
B0058GYP5W|4.0|I have never listened to the Chemical Brothers before this. I'm not a musical snob, but I just don't listen to techno much. That being said, I think about half of the soundtrack is absolutely exceptional and the other half is filler and really doesn't go anywhere. The best tracks are those with dynamics, like \\"Escape 700\\" and the two versions of \\"Hanna's Song\\" and some others. The rest is ambient sound, which I have no problem with except that it should compliment the film, which I feel it doesn't. A couple of pieces made me think of Brian Eno's \\"Baby's on Fire.\\" Anyway, I like the cd. I find that I like about 1/2 to 2/3 of the tracks on any cd anyway. I say buy it, if foe \\"Escape 700\\" for anything.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I did enjoy some parts and found parts exciting.  However, much of it was horrible, hideous and extremely violent.  I would never take a child to see it.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is almost indistructable...I'm pretty sure my great great grand kids will still be passing this knife down long after I'm gone. The knife is simply built like a tank and weights about as much. The weight and bulk of the 1/4 inch blade is something you quickly get used too. It does a lot better at fine motor projects than some people give it credit for. I enjoy the heft of the knife, which after you get accustomed to it, makes anything lighter feel cheap and flimsy.<br /><br />I bought the BK-2 to replace my old Buck 119 that I have carried for over 10 years now. I use the BK2 for everything, camp cooking, splitting firewood into kindling, hammer, small prybar, chisel, minor brushwork, etc and I throw it.<br /><br />The only two occasions I leave it at home in favor of another fixed blade (I always carry 2 of various sizes...curtesy of working overnights in emergency services) is when boating or concealment is required. Although the high carbon blade can rust easily, my real reason for not carrying it while boating is I'm afraid of accidently dropping it overboard. Concealment is not really an option...the knife is simply too large and bulky.<br /><br />The sheath is decent, I highly recomend you get the accessory pouch made for the ESEE 5/6 (which bolts right on to the sheath with no mods needed) and paracord for a leg strap. People who have purchased earlier models have complained about the sheath dulling the blade, but I have not had this issue. The oversized belt loop is real pain, but the leg strap helps keep it upright when the top strap isn't buckled. Most people have bought a leather belt loop replacement which is often referred to as \\"the fix\\" or a custom sheath. I finally broke down and did the latter. The nice thing about the original sheath though, is how firmly it snaps onto the knife. This is great for those who ride motorcycles, ATVs etc...<br /><br />With any real use the black coating wears off in high rub areas...just wipe on some mineraloil or baby oil (which is just scented mineral oil) from time to time prevent rust and you'll be fine. I don't recommend stripping off the coating completely.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the scales (grips) getting slippery when wet...It has never been an issue for me despite my original thoughts.<br /><br />In summary, this is a solid dependable knife that will serve you and your kids for years to come. Get it now while it is still under $100.00
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|its a free for all it is so awesome. you can do eneything. you whant. gameloft is so awesome. it is my favroit game
B005CMSDLE|4.0|First, let me say that I did enjoy this movie. The acting was excellent and the soundtrack is wonderful. My problems were that the \\"flow\\" of the film was somewhat choppy and some of the characters needed to be fleshed out. The film gives very little background on Hanna's \\"father\\" and Marrissa. The same for the Grimm character. The British hippie family were done well, with an exceptionally good acting job by the young lady playing the daughter. I cannot say enough about the Chemical Brothers' soundtrack though. It is one of the things which makes the film work. The young actress playing Hanna was quite good too. All in all it is a worthy effort and I recommend it to fans of espionage films.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I knew I would love the cd, because I'm a great JT fan. This review is for the seller. I am very pleased because the cd arrived very promptly and in new condition, as promised. I will definitely look for items by this seller in the future with no hesitation! Merry Christmas to all and to all a goodnight!
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|This book is like an old friend.  I have a paper copy and I've purchased it for each electronic reader that I have had.  Every time you read it you find something new.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|awesome movie. I wish hollwood would still dream this way. Todays movies are full of C.G.I. which i would use lite to none. So i like this idea in the movie where everything is there.
020530902X|5.0|This is a great basic writing resource for students young and old.  I had a copy when I first went to college and am glad to have it again as I work on my third doctoral degree!
193700788X|2.0|My friend and I have been fans of the series since the first book. We have had so much fun over the years discussing the characters, anticipating what would happen in the next book, plotting out how we would like events to unfold (I have always been a fan of Sookie and Bill getting back together; my friend likes Eric instead). This last book was a real failure on the author's part to conclude the series in a way that honors both the fans and the work itself. My friend and I are very disappointed. To me, the book reads more like a first draft than a final one. I was so shocked, in fact, I wondered if Charlaine Harris might be ill (I hope not!) I do, however, like the fact that, in the end, Sookie remains true to her rural, working-class values. Maybe the author will relent and write just one more installment that does a better job concluding this enjoyable series.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Kickazz!!! Why sift through crap to find a gem? Cheap and fun, well worth the small cost. Buy the game...
B000002JNJ|5.0|This should be required listening for any metalhead.  Don't buy a song or two get the whole album, the work is solid all the way through.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but what I hate about it is the update .I have been waiting for the update for to long. I wish I get the update for minecraft now.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|Love using kindle on my Samsung android tablet. Ordering online books is easy and inexpensive. I no longer have to wait until I can get to the book store to buy a hard copy book that will collect dust when I am done reading it. Having ebooks on my kindle app is so handy. It is like carrying around over 100 books with me whereever I go. The main improvement that would help is if the app allowed users to create &#34;folders&#34; to organize books by subject, author, or read/unread for example.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was free and looked fun so I tried it. I had a lot of fun with it! I found it challenging at times yet not to hard that so I didn't become frustrated. Addictive and good fun :)
B000YMM3CC|1.0|I don't know why anyone likes this movie. I was in the mood for a cheesy romance movie, but this didn't even meet my low expectations.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I saw this at the theater. Sure it may not have the same humor as the first Die Hard movie. But it is a Bruce Willis movie and I thought it was very good. Like I said not as good as the first one. But I liked it enough to buy the BluRay. If it was so bad, I wouldn't have done that. Action movies are about the action, not the story. If you want a real good story, go see a drama or murder mystery, or one of those movies that the critics all love, but everyone else thinks is boring. I bought the BluRay at a store in my town, should have ordered it from Amazon, could have saved $4. Oh well. That's OK.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Takes me back to the 80's when I played my Atari games like asteroids, space invaders, galaga, and centipede. Plasma sky has all these games rolled into one! Easy to play on tablet and phone with only one finger. No special manuevering or two handed shooting needed.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon Cross ans Eva are truly unique!  Love the storyline and can't wait for the next book!  I'm dying to continue this ride sigh them.
B008K9SG9K|1.0|I love the band and the songs, but this album represents the absolute pinnacle of decrepit audio engineering. Perhaps someone accidentally left all the compression knobs cranked fully clockwise on the mixer, because that's exactly what it sounds like. I suppose it could have been mixed and produced to sound like a 0.5kbps mp3 compression on purpose, but WHY ON EARTH??? I have no idea whether the sound is the band's idea or the producer's, but as much as I like the actual music behind the distortion, I can't listen to the CD anymore since every note makes me cringe and feel like I'm destroying my amp and speakers even at a low volume. If you even remotely consider yourself an audiophile, avoid this album at all cost!<br /><br />UPDATE:  After a bit of research I discovered that all the added distortion/compression and totally overdriven sound is the brainchild of asinine producer Alex Da Kid. How unfortunate that someone in the music industry felt they had to actually ruin the sound of a good band in order to make them popular. I can only hope that this album is someday re-released without distortion at the proper recording level.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can you escape is an unlikely fun thinking game. It took some time but I got through the levels. Need more levels asap!! Highly anticipating the update.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|A little repetitive but fun. Wish there was more control over the jumping than just tapping a button but overall, not a bad app.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  The plot was good and the characters interesting.  I would have liked the new relationships had been developed a little more.
B001NHNG64|3.0|A few errors that drove me nuts. I would get into it more but don't want give to many details about the book away. It has to do with the .38, I've never seen a .38 hold 6 rounds, and the stinger transfer. And there's more but can't remember all the stuff from earlier that I read.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Best show on tv. Now I can watch it over and over and over. Never gets old or disappoints me.
B000P0J09W|4.0|a ride for the imagination, truly a what if type movie. To see the movie, then the special behind the scenes with stars years later is like the Goonies then and now. Only to realize that the NOW is still 10 years before the present. The movie itself is the junior version of Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. Popcorn and Milkduds are not included but are recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even though it was sad it the end. It still leaves you wanting more. I can't wait for season 4
B004Y042N8|3.0|And if you know how to manually locate and edit the config file (to get access to other levels) you probably either already know or can easily figure out the one single logic that solves all 380 levels. The memory mode is a different game that doesn't really need this logic but tests your ability to remember the moves it shows you.<br />The app icon is deceiving as no level has more than one color or an artistic shape remotely looking like it.<br /><br />Edit: This version (1.9.5) actually has more than 380 levels, but the other levels can only be accessed if you click the right arrow while in level 380. The same app on Google Play is a much more recent version (3.0.x) that has thousands of levels and online multi-player mode but without the memory or challenge modes.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked the intensity of this book. The story line was perfect. It made me want more and more. I could not stop reading.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|My first review was  3 stars. I had to watch it again to  realize it was a much tighter script than I first discerned. It's very detailed so every scene is critical to understanding the events leading up to climax. I would have given it 5 starts had I been smarter to discern its fine tight script on my first viewing. I settled on 4 stars to save face. Tight script, great acting, directing, and passes the suspend disbelief test. I'm actually very embarrassed that I didn't GET IT the first viewing. Oh well, getting senile.

B00C81LYH2|3.0|As a longtime Barbie collector (I started collecting in the 70s) and Barbie gift giver (to my nieces), I confess I have mixed feelings about this doll. The fact that it is marked \\"25th Anniversary\\" led me to expect something show-stopping, luxurious and flowing with satin and shiny fabrics in the old-fashioned, glamorous Barbie style.<br /><br />Sadly, I was disappointed. Instead, I received a plain red box with a surprisingly minimialist background (red with white snowflakes and a raindeer). The doll itself is pretty (glistening silver with some tulle at the waist and a lace overlay) but the more I look at it, the more I notice the cheap simplicity of the design (it's as if someone just took a doily and sewed it, asymmetrically, on her bodice to create the illusion of couture). Another thing that's missing is JEWELRY. The doll has earrings, but NO necklace, NO sparkly bracelets, NO rings, NO tiara. She poses with bare arms, which makes me wonder what ever happened to the faux fur boas and throws that the older Barbies came with. This is 25th Anniversary?!<br /><br />C'mon Mattel, Barbie lovers deserve better than this! Is this \\"Holiday Recession Barbie\\"? It would seem so. I've read that Mattel's sales of Barbie have been on a decline - well, cutting corners and raising the price for what used to be a great holiday line isn't the way to raise sales.<br /><br />Now if this was a standard, non-special edition Barbie, I would say it's OK. The three stars is for the fact that I know my nieces are too young to be as discerning as a seasoned Barbie doll collector, and that they will enjoy it. Another silver lining is that, because the doll isn't as nice as previous Holiday Barbies, more collectors may be tempted to open the box and display the doll rather than it keep unopened.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|An amazing game! It is fun to play and is a better version of temple run and subway surfer awesome
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|reminds me of a lot of  the old arcade games back in the 90's  Lot of fun put into that game, good graphic's too! Will update this<br />product later, but so far it's been great!
0399255370|5.0|I wanted this book as soon as I saw it and read about the content; what a great idea! Complaining crayons! We go through all the colors in the box and share their unhappiness when they send a batch of letters to their owner Duncan. He reads all of them and comes up with a magical solution which is shown toward the end. Along the way we meet various crayons and read about their individual complaints and though I found all of them to be funny and witty, my favorite was poor Peach who was afraid (and embarrassed!)to come out of the box since Duncan removed her wrapper! This book is simply brilliant and the illustrations are fantastic! This book can (and should) be given to kids everywhere for birthdays, holidays or just because, it is that special. No child should without one!
B0093X805W|5.0|Very well written it will truly be a child's favorite. Exciting, thrilling, one of the best books written.couldn't stop reading. Love it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The best game ever I couldn't put it down. My son is next in line to play and I can't wait for the next one.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I love this movie in regular Blu-ray /DVD so when we bought a 3D TV I just had to have it in 3D. It is wonderful!!. I LOVE watching it over and over!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The story centers around a formerly active man now wheelchair bound and his caregiver. While there is less detail than I may have liked, I appreciated the author addressing the real feelings and difficulties experienced by those who are physically fragile- especially for someone formerly active. From daily activities to larger situations to family dynamics, life changes drastically in such situations. The right-to-die subject was handled with grace and was presented from several points of view.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Very enchanting and completely different tale from any other I have read. Would recommend to anyone. I would definitely read it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is easy to learn and fun to play, especially if you like the minions!!!!!! I love this app a lot!!!!!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Do enjoy playing this game, you really need to be quick, time limited. It keeps the mind alert! & I would recommend it to a friend.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Fantastic movie, great shape, no skips or lags. I had seen this a long time ago and wanted to see it again, couldn't find it at any of our libraries, was delighted to see if for sale on here.  Delivery time was great also.
1579128955|5.0|This is a very amazing Book, I have purchased a few copies as gifts and everyone has loved them as much as we do!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and silly i love playing it i just got it and i cant stop playing its really fun
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've long enjoyed QOTSA.  Each album has a uniquely, slightly different sound to it.  Yet, maintain themselves in all of their songs.  I highly recommend any of their albums.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Any woman in the workforce for a number of years should read this.  There are so many moments where my feelings and thoughts are validated, and then given another way to approach the challenge.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this, Sheryl.
1577311523|4.0|Slow down your reading and soak it in.  A lot of food for thought. It's part of my  personal library now.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|I was a big fan of their last album &#34;One&#34;.  With that; I decided to give this one a try.  Though the singer has changed, I would say the newbie has given them a beautiful new sound. Love this CD!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a game that keeps you thinking. I like that it's challenging and can keep your interest. It's worth downloading.
B008X8RSTM|4.0|This app is helpful but does load slowly. I still prefer it over Google Maps however. It is very useful for finding detours.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|honestly just loved everything about the book, and loved everything about the way it was written.  Although far fetched, it is completely relatable and it has good underlying morals.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I wonder if there's going to be another. U really need to know how this story will end....Lord  how long do we have to wait for more.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am a 34 year old, dentist and I just want to get cut. I just finished this book, but I bought it as an audiobook. Loved it. I just began following the workout part. There were a few chapters that I've gone back and listened to multiple times. The hardest thing for me has been what and when to eat. I love that I get a great idea of what to eat, and when to eat it. I totally recommend it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This, I say, is a good book. I was surprised when Poseidon joined Percy's birthday party. I really liked it. I really did.<br /><br />Reviewed by 8-year-old son, Ethan
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|I downloaded it to my device and then went to play the game and all I hear was background noise but the screen was blank!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A great escape read that genuinely made me think about my place in the world. (I know that sounds corny). A children's fantasy story masked in adult themes, or vice versa. A fast-paced read that ended much too quickly!
B00C8RFRNI|5.0|I rented this movie from Block Buster and found this to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. No wonder so many Academy Award nominations. Riveting, Thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not to mention it's a true story. We have brave men and WOMEN who work to protect out country. What a great way to honor them.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|The game is super fun. For some reason though, it won't give you coins for winning. Thus, you can't buy more colors or bombs. I hope this problem gets fixed soon.
B000002JSN|5.0|This brings me back to the days when I lived in the basement of my father's house.  My older brothers would listen to Led Zeppelin loud as you know what and the air was filled with the acrid smell of weed.  I didn't love Led Zeppelin at the time but now I realize they are at the pinnacle of the rock and roll gods with Pink Floyd, the Stones and The Beatles. You won't be dissappointed!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've read all of James Altucher's blog posts and previous books, and this is the best one yet. Previous books were a little more disjointed, in terms of sometimes leaning too heavily on prior blog posts, but Choose Yourself! is a clear and self-contained guide to picking yourself up from the floor during tough times. Altucher uses his own successes and failures (both business and personal) to show you how you can come back from total disaster. His framework for doing so is his \\"Daily Practice,\\" which has worked well for me. And the book provides good additional value over Altucher's blog. Highly recommended.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Its amovie I enjoyed. It also played good in the machine.  REQUIRING MORE WORDS IS JUST OF TIME WHEN I HAVE SAID WHAT I WANTED
B007RTAR64|5.0|this doll is fabulous for starter doll collectors or a great doll to add to your collection! its a very durable doll that has beautiful detailing,and unlike most dolls this doll actually looks like the character its self than a typical pink and polished barbie doll. it also comes with accessories like a bow and a coupe arrows so you can make her have weapons when shes fighting off the other tributes,also a bag to store her weapons in. she has adjustable legs and arms so you can put her in fighting positions so she can kick someones butt. get the katniss doll for a low price and you wont regret it
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Snarky, violent, hilarious at times and an interesting psuedo-commentary on the darkness of slavery. Tarantino's visions have evolved into rich graphic-novel worlds that you can't stop watching.... its something like Kill Bill set in a western with the amazingly charasmatic Cristoph Waltz and a subtle Jamie Foxx.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Slow  start, good finish!!<br />Grisham has a way of surprising you of the outcome.<br />Amazing what some ingenuity can do.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|absolutely do not like - too frustrating to find simple info that was quickly available with now 'old' version. just deleted app from kindle -
B001AITGWE|3.0|The first half of this film is interesting as we watch Michael Douglas unravel. The parallel with Robert Duvall's character is interesting as one may say he and MD are similar in the sense that they have both fallen; but the richer subtext is in Douglas' vision of a middle class man falling apart in a somewhat dystopic and shallow L.A.. ..Watching this in 2013,  still a decent movie nearly 20 yrs later.
B003XMKMTQ|5.0|Bought this DVD for my husband for Fathers Day. He absolutely loves it. He loves anything with Eric Clapton and Blues. It has such a mixture of music. Anyone who appreciates music and the crossroad festivals will enjoy watching the many different performers. It does have a couple of unheard of musicians at least to us, so even if they're not your thing, the others make up for it.
0425263924|2.0|Enough said...  The End!<br />Wait for book 4 since 3 was such a waste of time... Hopefully that one will take us somewhere!
B004J713JW|5.0|New Yorkers - off with your heads if you don't have this in your library.<br />That said, I married a New Yorker and he wanted this for his birthday.<br />It is amazing.<br />Joel has been through some chizz in his life and I got a secret &#34;yes!!&#34; to see Christie Brinkley reduced to standing on the floor with the regular audience. Because this guy is just a musical genius. The back story is great as it shares about Joel's career, his personal life, and his inspirations over the years in between playing some just great music.<br />A really cool part - he invited some of his friends to share songs with him and the most favorite of this non-native New Yorker was Garth Brooks singing &#34;Shameless.&#34;<br />I haven't been able to get that performance by him and by Billy outta my head since we watched it two days ago. Gives me chills.<br />When I heard that Billy Joel was going to be the last concert - the last anything at Shea I was like, &#34;whaaaaaat? Why?&#34;<br />The goof was on me because I do not believe any other person, artist, genius could have laid Lady Shea to rest the way she deserved than the way Billy Joel did it. He may have even lifted her status up a few notches with his choice of sharing the stage with old and new friends -- shutting down Queens to bullet Sir Paul through NY air space through the airport red tape through traffic to Shea's doorstep was a small feat in and of itself --- to the diverse people he added on stage to pay tribute to NY events, to the choice of musical instruments he invited, to the light engineers he hired (who should get a separate award for the awesome light show and background graphics), to the very personal performance of his band, to the sharing of his heart in this entire performance, to the FOUR encores he did...there are no fitting words that do justice to this entire evening. You have to experience it - and you will experience it, not just watch it.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|An inter-dimensional portal has opened up on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean letting Kaiju (giant monsters) into our world that prove unstoppable by conventional military methods and possessing the sheer power to level cities and destroy millions.  Mankind's only defense is to fight fire with fire by creating colossal mecha-suits (i.e. Jaegers) controlled by uniquely skilled teams of the world's finest combat pilots.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is a film where we are immersed in titanic battles from beginning to end, introduced to unique characters and in discovering their motivations we not only feel for them but find ourselves fiercely devoted to their victory over these terrible invaders.  We become quickly attached to the last remnants of the Jaeger fleet, each with distinct looks and special skills and are allowed to actually take part in the struggle to save humanity; we just want to stand up and cheer when they're victorious but also feel the tragedy of their loss.<br /><br />A fun and riveting action film on a grand scale, visually spectacular but also with a heart.  :o)
B003AVPV1O|5.0|As described. Connects two monitors that i use for my workstation while producing music and working on graphics etc. cheap and to your door
1451695195|5.0|I purchased Proof of Heaven on 7/11/13 and finished early on 7/12/13.  I could not put down the book because I have always been fascinated with true stories of NDE.  I truly loved reading this book.  What did I get out of it?  Confirmation of what I believe \\"we are all connected and united in the love of God\\".  I once saw a documentary on NDE's in the 70's at a theater with my then fiance'.  Since then, I have read a few books about NDE's.  Proof of Heaven is a beautifully written book; I can't praise it enough.[[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]]<br /><br />Estela
B00CWY76CC|4.0|For a free app its fun. Got thru the 10 levels in an hour and that was about long enough. The &quot;harder&quot; levels are not really any different. You just have to find a 6-digit code instead of 4 or need two.codes to unlock something instead of one. The search aspect and item usage is still the same. You have to have discipline not to take notes or just try every item. But you will. Graphics are very pleasing. Fun for a little while but would get old. It could definately be more clever.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game, some levels easier than others but overall a fairly difficult game.  I just wish there were more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun to play. Has funny minions doing crazy things. I like making them jump and slide all over the place.
0061122416|5.0|Truly an amazing book! I found such inspiration reading this book. I love the symbolism and metaphors. If you want to be inspired read this!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging. makes you think. makes you remember what you saw and where. its hard until you figure out what to look for. I spent hours on it the first time. want more.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Poorly written and the author clearly just wants to sell another book. Not likely that I will buy the next one, disappointing plot to say the least.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I thought I was ordering a hardcopy copy of this item - I do not need a digital copy and DO NOT WANT a digital copy.<br />I thought when it came up and had me verify what my ship to address was I was going to get a hardcopy of this item.<br /><br />I have spent the last hour trying to see how to change this - to no avail.<br /><br />If this is not cancelled and changed to what I really want then I will NEVER buy anything else on amazon.com.<br /><br />Customer Service just responded,<br /><br />Walter is happy now.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read all 3 books when I &#34;didn't have time to read&#34; so that says something about SL's ability to tell great stories
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book depicts a mothers unconditional love for her son, who later grows up and begins the cycle of loving his own child.  My four year old grandson loved it, especially because of the sweet song.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Don't bother downloading. They took a great and very useable app and ruined it . I uninstalled it. I'm so disappointed I would give it a minus zero if I could. I'm currently shopping for a new weather app. No one is going to see your stupid billboard size ads or cash in the hokey points if we are all deleting your sucky app.
B00BC5FN2C|4.0|I bought this series as a recommendation from a friend. It started slow but quickly showed itself to be an excellent political thriller, complete with unusual storylines and of course, Kevin Spacey, always excellent in whatever he does.<br /><br />What really intrigued me, however, was the series finale. Unlike most series finales, either predictable or tied up in a neat little bow, this series finale was not only a surprise but also left me hungry for more.<br /><br />Can't wait for next season!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be an app I used daily. The newest version is confusing and overrun with distracting, useless ads. I'm on the lookout for a new weather app. Shame on you Weather Channel.
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|Heard their 1st single while on vacation on Los Angeles.  Bought the CD and it is wonderful.  Buy It now
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|Thanks! It's cool! Quality! Price! Everything is ideal! The goods correspond to the description! It is very happy! Further cooperation of 100%!
3836531038|4.0|the quality of photos is amazing, a very unique book of nude women, i  would recommend this book to all lovers of women in the nude..............
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Love that while Wimbledon was going on, you played this game and it was the match from the day before.  LOVE IT
B008B68IV8|5.0|Thanks! It's cool! Quality! Price! Everything is ideal! The goods correspond to the description! It is very happy! Further cooperation of 100%!
B003BD236C|5.0|I was glad to see this movie was available on Amazon Instant Video. It was very well done and is still timely.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is amazing ,I love it so much , you go through about 50 levels and and it gets harder and harder<br />So you should get this game it's the best!
B00C4Y4434|5.0|Thanks! It's cool! Quality! Price! Everything is ideal! The goods correspond to the description! It is very happy! Further cooperation of 100%!
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Thank goodness, a rough and tumble Robin Hood.  I mean, Kevin Costner?  Russell Crowe has the machismo to bring the legendary character to life.  The story can be, at times a bit obtuse, but it all comes together in the end.  Crowe had attitude and Robin Hood needs some attitude.  Buy the disc and enjoy a believable portrayal of Robin Hood!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Actually found a movie that deserved my time it took to watch it!  I felt emotionally attached to the characters!
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|Thanks! It's cool! Quality! Price! Everything is ideal! The goods correspond to the description! It is very happy! Further cooperation of 100%!
B00006EXDM|5.0|This is down and dirty Rock and Roll that defines the genre.  The songs, as well as the band, are iconic.  I can't imagine a better compilation of their best songs.  The sound quality is sound, and every song transports you to another place when you first heard a particular song.  This is a must have for its quality and consistency of rock's iconic group.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it I love the way the makers made it possible to  have a creative mode I just love it so much I play twenty four seven
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Thanks! It's cool! Quality! Price! Everything is ideal! The goods correspond to the description! It is very happy! Further cooperation of 100%!
B007L96VCY|5.0|This album is about Paul and Linda in love.  He is so free to express himself and his love for Linda.  He takes creative, confident that all will &#34;work&#34;, and it does!!  This is Paul letting it all hang out with no person or professional inhibitions.  He's just having fun and so will you.<br /><br />Audiophiles - Great sound quality.  Clear sound is icing on the cake!
B0091V6TF4|4.0|Music evokes memories of the movies, but not every theme or song is worth remembering. Better to purchase individual songs than to own the CD.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|If You love car races, things blowing up and car crashes than this is the<br />Movie for you it is filled with it and more it will keep you interested for sure and in your seat<br />where you should be from the start ,  Really it is a good movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The movie despicable me was great but the minion rush is off the hook and to know there's a new movie can't wait to see it hoping for a third.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Clever and witty, I enjoyed this book from cover to cover. I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I only got the sample &quot;free&quot; version so far, but it was great! I will be buying the full version.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Sickest slender game ever and one time i was playing it was night with fog on expert i had 1/8 pages slender went right in front of me and i screamed like a girl. Point is its a scary and fun game
B005GG0MIS|5.0|One of the best books on Presidents, the pressures they face and a behind-the-scenes view of their relationships with one another.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|In my opinion this Howleen is the sweetest of all Howleen dolls.<br />At least my daughter did not want to have any of previous editions Howleens until she saw this one.<br />Her straight long hair, baby face, one ear up with a neat earring, little claws at her gestural hands and modern outfit - everything about this doll is loved by my daughter.<br />My daughter is 11 years old, Howleen looks like she were the same age, so it's another reason why my daughter really likes this doll.<br />I don't like only wide slits on the back of her boots, but it could be only our doll's problem.
B00A27X972|5.0|I had to push myself to read on after the first two chapters. I didn't like the direction it seemed to be going. BUT I did read on. It took me 3 days to finish it. I loved this book. I recommend it to everyone. This book shed light on the unspoken issue of being human. Read on folks. Read on.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Im addicted. And I am not a real sci fi fan. I will eventually get every season!  I watched the second season in one weekend.
B0001I562I|5.0|Please correct your credit listing as James Glennon was the Director of Photography and Randal Kleiser is the Director of the film I was the Production Designer and Second Unit Dir.......................WJC.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I used to think minecraft was dumb but now that I played it I think it's the best game in the world I think you should get it there are tons of reasons to get it
B0000WN0ZK|2.0|the audio portion of the dvd was very poor.  having seen this movie many times before in theatres long ago, i know that the audio was faulty.  that ruined the viewing experience.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I really liked the first book in this new series.  Although a little bit predictable near the end, I look forward to reading the second book.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|I love flying games in general and this one is no exception. Not much you can do for free but additional episodes aren't expensive&hellip; and I don't usually like paying for things.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Bought this as carry all while international travelling for 10 weeks.  Used as day bag for laptop, iPad, camera passport documents, coat scarf gloves etc..  Very functional and also comfortable.  Now use it as a day bag for my frequent ski trips. Easily totes all my gear. Highly recommended.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|There was times when I was reading this book that I had to remind myself it was fiction and not a real story.  Christoph really knows how to tell a story.  And oh boy what a story.  Love, action, humor, and heck you name it is in this book.  Now I have to read the rest of the trilogy.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B005DESVPO|4.0|I grew up with Hip Hop.  Now, I am uninspired with the rappers and the popular music currently available.  Then I heard the buzz about Gary Clark Jr.  This guy is exceptionally different....a real musician.  I like the blues inspired riffs and the distinct sounds he provides on the guitar.  This guy is the real deal and I will label him eclectic.  I like 3 of the 4 tracks on the EP and I recommend.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Simply beautiful! A book that when I see someone starting it, I experience a sense of jealously knowing of their journey ahead.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a book chosen for a book club. It isn't something I would normally read but I found it to be a pretty good captivating story. I felt sorry for Ender in so many ways, manipulated by the adults in his life. The ending is a surprise.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Chapter by chapter the story develops and engages you. In many twists and turns it links the multiple tales. I like the way the characters are developed so clearly
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is cool great graphics and stuff and fun but i couldnt get one page i quit of scaredness &larr; not a real word) but its still good im in to the slender stuff like pranks and lets plays this game is soo great im gonna make a letsplay of this on youtube if u wanna watch like u wanna know what the game is like then check out my youtube Poie Apeza so beware i might scream in the videos of course i dont hav the video yet but soon it seems scary cause well.... it is :3
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game u can push minions and every thing it is awesome u should buy this awesome game
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The packaging was intact-- this was a gift which he wanted ad that we have seen all the movies already but Blue Ray is just like at the movies on big screen TV.
B00B769XB8|5.0|This was definitely a movie to get in 3D if you have a 3DTV.  While some of the Dialog was lame the overall movie was great and full of action.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I read this to my private student this past school year, and am happy to say that I have another one hooked on that book, and on Louisa May Alcott! :-)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman is the master of fantasy. Not the kind of Tolkeinesque fantasy, not high fantasy, but the homey kind that is somehow more real, more beautiful, and more frightening than any other.
B009EANE3M|2.0|Loved their first two albums, this one, not so much. Too much rapping for my taste. Seeing them in a couple of weeks, and hoping it is not all rap.
